 forum pompeians first rude
machinery by which new era world
was wrought
it was early noon and form was crowded
alike with busy and idle as at paris at
this day so at that time in cities italy men
lived almost wholly out doors public buildings
 forum porticos baths 
temples themselves might be considered their real
homes it was no wonder that they decorated so
gorgeously these favourite places resort they
felt for them a sort domestic affection as well asa
public pride and animated was indeed aspect
 forum pompeii at that time along

its broad pavement composed large flags marble
sere assembled various groups conversing in
that energetic fashion which appropriates a gesture
to every word and which is still characteristic
 people south here in seven stalls
on one side colonnade sate moneychangers
with their glittering heaps before them and merchants
and seamen in various costumes crowding
round their stalls on one side several men in long
togas avere seen bustling rapidly up to a stately
edifice where magistrates administered justice 
these were lawyers active chattering joking
and punning as you may find them at this day
in westminster in centre space pedestals
supported various statues which most
remarkable was stately form cicero around
 court ran a regular and symmetrical colonnade
 doric architecture and there several whose
business drew them early to place were taking
 slight morning repast which made an italian
breakfast talking vehemently on earthquake
 for lawyers and clients when attending on their
patrons retained toga after it had fallen into disuse among
 rest citizens
 preceding night as they clipped pieces 
bread in their cups dilated wine in open
space too you might perceive various petty traders
exercising arts their calling here one man
was holding out ribands to a fair dame from 
country another man was vaunting to a stout farmer
 excellence his shoes a third a kind 
stallrestaurateur still so common in italian
cities was supplying many a hungry mouth with hot
messes from his small and itinerant stove while 
contrast strongly typical mingled hustle and
intellect time close by a schoolmaster
was expounding to his puzzled pupils elements
 latin grammar a gallery above portico
which was ascended by small wooden staircases
had also its throng though as here immediate
business place was mainly carried on
its groups wore a more quiet and serious air
in museum at naples is a picture little known but representing
one side forum at pompeii as then existing
to which i am much indebted in present description
it may afford a learned consolation to my younger readers to
know that ceremony hoisting moie honoured in 
breach than observance is high antiquity and seems to
have been performed with all legitimate and public vigour in
 forum pompeii
 
every now and then crowd below respectfully
gave way as some senator swept along to 
temple jupiter which filled up one side 
forum and was senators hall meeting nodding
with ostentatious condescension to such his
friends or clients as he distinguished amongst 
throng mingling amidst gay dresses 
better orders you saw hardy forms 
neighbouring farmers as they made their way to
 public granaries hard by temple you
caught a view triumphal arch and longstreet
beyond swarming with inhabitants in one
 niches arch a fountain played cheerily
sparkling in sunbeams and above its cornice
strongly contrasting gay summer skies gloomed
 bronzed and equestrian statue caligula
behind stalls moneychangers alas that
building now called pantheon and a crowd 
 poorer pompeians passed through small
vestibule which admitted to interior with panniers
under their arms pressing on towards a
platform placed between two columns where such
provisions as priests had rescued from sacrifice
were exposed for sale
pompeii
at one public edifices appropriated to 
business city workmen were employed upon
 columns and you heard noise their labor
every now and then rising above hin
 multitude columns are unfinished to
this day 
all then united nothing could exceed in variety
 costumes ranks manners occupations
 crowd nothing could exceed bustle
 gaiety animation flow and flush life
all around you saw there all myriad signs 
a heated and feverish civilization where pleasure
and commerce idleness and labour avarice and
ambition mingled in one gulf their motley rushing
yet harmonious streams
facing steps temple jupiter with
folded arms and a knit and contemptuous brow
stood a man about fifty years age his dress
was remarkably plain not so much from its material
as from absence all those ornaments
which were worn by pompeians every rank
partly from love show partly also because
they were chiefly wrought into those shapes deemed
most efficacious in resisting assaults maoic
 
and influence evil eye a his forehead
was high and bald few locks that remained at
 back head were concealed by a sort 
cowl which made a part his cloak to be raised or
lowered at pleasure and was now drawn halfway
over head as a protection from rays 
sun colour his garments was brown no
popular hue with pompeians all usual
admixtures scarlet or purple seemed carefully
excluded his belt or girdle contained a small
receptacle for ink which hooked on to girdle
a stylus or implement writing and tablets 
no ordinary size what was rather remarkable
 cincture held no purse which was almost
indispensable appurtenances girdle even
when that purse had misfortune to be empty
it was not often that gay and egotistical
pompeians busied themselves with observing 
countenances and actions their neighbours but
there was that in lip and eye this bystander
so remarkably bitter and disdainful as he surveyed
 religious procession sweeping up stairs 
 temple that it could not fail to arrest 
notice many
pompeii 
who is yon cynic asked a merchant his
companion a jeweller
it is olinthus replied jeweller a reputed
nazarene
 merchant shuddered a dread sect said
he in a whispered and fearful voice it is said
that when they meet at nights they always commence
their ceremonies by murder a newborn
babe they profess a community goods
too wretches a community goods what
would become merchants or jewellers either if
such notions were in fashion 
that is very true said jeweller besides
they wear no jewels they mutter imprecations
when they see a serpent and at pompeii all our
ornaments are serpentine
do but observe said a third who was a
fabricate bronze how yon nazarene scowls
at piety sacrificial procession he is
murmuring curses on temple be sure do you
know celsus that this fellow passing by my shop
 other day and seeing me employed on a statue
 minerva told me with a frown that had
it been marble he would have broken it but 

bronze was too strong for him break a goddess
said i a goddess answered atheist it is a
demon an evil spirit then he passed on his
way cursing are such things to be borne t
what marvel that earth heaved so fearfully
 night anxious to reject atheist from her
bosom an atheist do i say worse still a
scorner fine arts woe to us fabricate 
bronze if such fellows as this give law to
society 
these are incendiaries that burnt rome
under nero groaned jeweller
while such were friendly remarks provoked
by air and faith nazarene olinthus himself
became sensible effect he was producing 
he turned his eyes round and observed intent
faces accumulating throng whispering
as they gazed and surveying them for a moment
with an expression first defiance and afterwards
 compassion he gathered his cloak round him
and passed on muttering audibly deluded idolaters
 did not night's convulsion warn yc 
alas i how will ye meet day 
 crowd that heard these boding words gave
pompeii 
them diifereiit interpretations according to their different
shades ignorance and fear all however
concurred in imagining them to convey some awful
imprecation they regarded christian as 
enemy mankind epithets they lavished
upon him which atheist was most favoured
and frequent may serve perhaps to warn us believers
 that same creed now triumphant how
we indulge persecution opinion olinthus
then underwent and how we apply to those whose
notions differ from our own terms at that
day prodigality on fathers our faith
as olinthus stalked through crowd and
gained one more private places egress
from forum he perceived gazing upon him a
pale and earnest countenance which he was not
slow to recognize
wrapped in a pallium that partially concealed his
sacred robes yoimg apsecides surveyed 
disciple that new and mysterious creed to which
at one time he had been half a convert
is he too an impostor does this man so
plain and simple in life in garb in mien does he
too like arbaces make austerity robe 
 
sensualist does veil vesta hide vices
 prostitute 
olinthus accustomed to men all classes and
combining with enthusiasm his faith a
profound experience his kind guessed perhaps
by index countenance something 
what passed within breast priest he
met survey appetites with a steady eye
and a brow serene and open candour
peace be with thee l said he saluting ascites

peace echoed priest in so hollow a
tone that it went at once to heart 
nazarene
in that wish continued olinthus all good
things are combined without virtue thou canst
not have peace like rainbow peace rests
upon earth but its arch is lost in heaven 
heaven bathes it in hues light it springs up
amidst tears and clouds it is a reflection 
eternal sun it is an assurance calm it is 
sign a great covenant between man and god
such peace o young man is smile 
pompeii 
soul it is an emanation from distant orb 
immortal light peace be with you v
alas began appetites when he caught 
gaze curious loiterers inquisitive to know
what could possibly be theme conversation
between a reputed nazarene and a priest 
isis he stopped short and then added in a low
tone we cannot converse here i will follow thee
to banks river there is a walk which
at this time is usually deserted and solitary
olinthus bowed assent he passed through 
streets with a hasty step but a quick and observant
eye every now and then he exchanged a significant
glance a slight sign with some passenger
whose garb usually betokened wearer to belong
to humbler classes for christianity was in this
 type all other and less mighty revolutions 
 grain mustardseed was in hearts 
lowly amidst huts poverty and labour
 vast stream which afterwards poured its broad
waters beside cities and palaces earth took
its neglected source
 
chapter 
 noonday excursion on cabipaxian seas
but tell me glaucus said lone as they
glided down rippling sarnus in their boat 
pleasure how earnest thou with appetites to
ray rescue from that bad man 
ask nydia yonder answered athenian
pointing to blind girl who sate at a little
distance from them leaning pensively over her lyre
 she must have thy thanks not we it seems
that she came to my house and finding me from
home sought thy brother in his temple he accompanied
her to arbaces on their way they encountered
me with a company friends whom thy kind
letter gave me a spirit cheerful enough to join her
quick ear detected my voice a few words sufficed
to make me companion appetites i told not
pompeii 
my associates why i left them could i trust thy
name to their light tongues and gossiping opinion 
nydia led us to garden gate by which we
afterwards bore thee we entered and were about
to plunge into mysteries that evil house when
we heard thy cry in another direction thou
knowest rest 
lone blushed deeply she then raised her eyes
to those glaucus and he felt all thanks
she could not utter come hither my nydia
said she tenderly to thessalian did i not
tell thee thou shouldst be my sister and friend 
hast thou not already been more my guardian
my preserver 
it is nothing answered nydia coldly and
without stirring
ah i forgot continued lone i should
come to thee and she moved alone benches
till she reached place where nydia sate and
flinging her arms caressingly round her covered her
cheeks with idsses
nydia was that morning paler than her wont and
her countenance grew even more wan and colourless
as she submitted to embrace beautiful
 
neapolitan but how comest thou nydia whispered
lone to surmise so faithfully danger i
was exposed to didst thou know aught 
egyptian 
yes i knew his vices
and how 
noble lone i have been a slave to vicious
 those whom i served were his minions
and thou hast entered his house since thou
knowest so well that private entrance 
i have played on my lyre to arbaces answered
 thessalian with embarrassment
and thou hast escaped contagion from
which thou hast saved lone returned neapolitan
in a voice too low for ear glaucus
noble lone i have neither beauty nor station
 i am a child and a slave and blind 
despicable are ever safe
it was with a pained and proud and indignant
tone that nydia made this humble reply and lone
felt that she only wounded nydia by pursuing 
subject she remained silent and bark now
floated into sea
confess that i was right lone said glaucus
pompeii 
in prevailing on thee not to waste this beautiful
noon in thy chamber confess that i was right
thou wert right glaucus saidnydia abruptly
 dear child speaks for thee returned 
athenian but permit me to move opposite to
thee or our light boat will be overbalanced
so saying he took his seat exactly opposite to
lone and leaning forward he fancied that it washer
breath and not winds summer that flung
fragrance over sea
thou wert to tell me said glaucus why
for so many thy door was closed to me 
oh think it no more answered lone
quickly i gave my ear to what i now know was
 malice slander
and my slanderer was egyptian 
tone's silence assented to question
his motives are sufficiently obvious
talk not him said lone covering her face
with her hands as if to shut out his very thought
perhaps he may be already by banks 
 slow styx resumed glaucus yet in that
case we should probably have heard his death
thy brother methinks hath felt dark in
 
fluence his gloomy soul alien we arrived 
night at thy house he left me abruptly will he
ever vouchsafe to be my friend 
he is consumed with some secret care answered
lone tearfully would that we could lure
him from himself let us join in that tender
office
 he shall be my brother returned greek
how calmly said lone rousing herself from
 gloom into which her thoughts appetites had
plunged her how calmly clouds seem to repose
in heaven and yet you tell me for i knew
it not myself that earth shook beneath us 
night
it did and more violently they say than
it has done since great convulsion sixteen
years ago land we live in yet nurses mysterious
terror and reign pluto which spreads
beneath our burning fields seems rent with unseen
commotion didst thou not feel earth quake
nydia where thou wert seated night and was
it not fear it occasioned thee that made thee
weep 
i felt soil creep and heave beneath me
pompeii 
like some monstrous serpent answered nydia
but as i saw nothing i did not fear i imagined
 convulsion to be a spell egyptian's
they say he has power over elements
thou art a thessalian my nydia replied glaucus
 and hast a national right to believe in magical
magic who doubts it answered nydia
simply dost thou
until night when a necromantic prodigy
did indeed appal me methinks i was not credulous
in any other magic save that love said
glaucus in a tremulous voice and fixing his eyes
on lone
ah said nydia with a sort shiver and
she woke mechanically a few pleasing notes from
her lyre sound suited well tranquillity 
 waters and sunny stillness noon
play to us dear nydia said glaucus play
and give us one thine old thessalian songs 
whether it be magic or not as thou wilt let it
at least be love
 love repeated nydia raising her large
wandering eyes that ever thrilled those who saw
them viih a mingled fear and pity you could

never familiarize yourself to their aspect so
strange did it seem that those dark wild orbs
were ignorant day and either so fixed was
their deep mysterious gaze or so restless and perturbed
their glance that you felt when you encountered
them that same vague and chilling and
halfpreternatural impression which comes over
you in presence insane those who
having a life outwardly like your own have a life
within life dissimilar unsearchable unguessed 
will you that i should sing love t said
she fixing those eyes upon glaucus
yes replied he looking down
she moved a little way from arm lone
still cast round her as if that soft embrace embarrassed
 and placing her light and graceful instrument
on her knee after a short prelude she sang
 following strain 

 wind and beam loved rose
and rose loved one
for who rocks wind where it blows
or loves not sun 
pompeii 
none knew whence humble wind stole
poor sport skies 
none dreamt that wind had a soul
in its mournful sighs 

oh i happy beam how canst thou prove 
that blight love thine
in thy light is proof thy love
thou hast but to shine 

how its love can wind reveal 
unwelcome its sigh 
mute mute to its rose let it steal 
its proof is to die 
thou finest but sadly sweet girl said
glaucus thy youth only feels as yet dark
shadow love far other inspiration doth he
wake when he himself bursts and brightens
upon us
i sing as i was taught replied nydia sighing
 thy master was lovecrossed then try thy
 
hand at a gayer air nay girl give instrument
to me as nydia obeyed her hand touched
his and with that slight touch her breast heaved 
her cheek flushed lone and glaucus occupied
with each other perceived not those signs 
strange and premature emotions which preyed
upon a heart that nourished by imagination dispensed
with hope
and now broad hie bright before them
spread that halcyon sea fair as at this moment
seventeen centuries from that date i behold it
rippling on same divinest shores clime that
yet enervates with a soft and circe spell 
that moulds us insensibly mysteriously into harmony
with thyself banishing thought austere
labour voices wild ambition contests
and roar life filling us with gentle and
subduing dreams making necessary to our nature
that which is its least earthly portion so that 
very air inspires us with yearning and thirst
 love whoever visits thee seems to leave
earth and its harsh cares behind to enter by 
ivory gate into land dreams young
and laughing hours present hours
rompeii
those children saturn which he hungers ever
to devour seem snatched from his grasp 
past future are forgotten we enjoy but

benign campania vain were indeed titans
if on this spot they yet struggled for another
heaven here if god meant this workingday life
for a perpetual holyday who would not sigh to
dwell for ever asking nothing hoping nothing
fearing nothing while thy skies shone over him 
while thy seas sparkled at his feet while thine air
brought him sweet messages from violet and
 orange and while heart resigned to beating
with but one emotion could find lips and
 eyes that flatter it vanity vanities that
love can defy custom and be eternal 
it was then in this clime on those seas that
 athenian gazed upon a face that might have
suited njonph spirit place feeding
his eyes on changeful roses that softest
cheek happy beyond happiness common
life loving and knowing himself beloved
in tale human passion in past ages there
 
is something interest even in remoteness

they are sympathies which unite ceaseless
generations past lives again when we
look upon its emotions it lives in our own i that
which was ever is magician's gift that
revives dead that animates dust forgotten
graves is not in author's skill it is in
 heart reader 
still vainly seeking eyes lone as half
downcast half averted they shunned his own
 athenian in a low and soft voice thus expressed
 feelings inspired by happier thoughts
than those which had coloured song nydia
instil oss if iliwws

as bark floated on o'er summerlit sea
floats my heart o'er deeps its passion for thee 
all lost in space without terror it glides
for bright with thy soul is face tides
pompeii 
now heaving now hush'd is that passionate ocean
as it catches thy smile or thy sighs 
and twinstars that shine on wanderer's
devotion
its guide and its god are thine eyes 

 bark may go down should cloud sweep
above
for its being is bound to light thy love
as thy faith and thy smile are its life and its joy
so thy frown or thy change are storms that
destroy
ah sweeter to sink while sky is serene
if time hath a change for thy heart i
if to live be to weep over what thou hast been
let me die while i know what thou art 
as words song trembled over 
sea lone raised her looks they met those her
lover happy nydia happy in thy affliction
in allusion to dioscuri or twinstars guardian deity
 seaman
 
that thou couldst not see that fascinated and
charmed gaze that said so much that made 
eye voice soul that promised impossibility
 change 
but though thessahan coukl not detect that
gaze she divined its meaning by their silence by
their sighs she pressed her hands tightly across
her breast as if to keep down its bitter and jealous
thoughts and then she hastened to speak for that
silence was intolerable to her
after all o glaucus said she there is
nothing very mirthful in your strain 
yet i meant it to be so when i took up thy
lyre pretty one perhaps happiness will not permit
us to be mirthful
how strange is it said lone changing a
conversation that oppressed her while it charmed 
that for several yonder cloud has
hung motionless over vesuvius yet not indeed
motionless for sometimes it changes its form and
how methinks it looks like some vast giant with
an arm outstretched over city dost thou seethe
likeness or is it only to my fancy 
pompeii 
fair lone i see it also it is astonishing j
distinct giant seems seated on brow oi
 mountain different shades cicada
body forth a white and sweeping robe over its vast
breast and limbs it seems to gaze with a steady
face upon city below to point with one hand
as thou sayest over its glittering streets and to
raise other dost thou note it towards 
higher heaven it is like ghost some hute
titan brooding over beautiful world he lost 
sorrowful for past yet with something 
menace for future
could that mountain have any connection vvitii
 night's earthquake they say that ages
ago almost in earliest era tradition it gave
forth fires as etna still perhaps flames yet
lurk and dart beneath
it is possible said glaucus musingly
thou sayest thou art slow to believe in magic
 said nydia suddenly i have heard that a
potent witch dwells amongst scorched caverns
 mountain and yon cloud may be dim
shadow demon she confers with
c 
 
thou art full romance thy native
thessaly said glaucus and a strange mixture
 sense and all conflicting superstitions
we are ever superstitious in dark replied
nydia tell me she added after a slight
pause tell me o glaucus do all that are
beautiful resemble each other they say you are
beautiful and lone also are your faces then 
same i fancy not yet it ought to be so 
fancy no such grievous m'rong to lone
answered glaucus laughing but we do not
alas resemble each other as homely and 
beautiful sometimes do lovers hair is dark mine
light lone's eyes are what colour lone i cannot
see turn them to me oh are they black no
they are too soft are they blue no they are
to dec they change with every ray 
sun know not their colour but mine sweet
nydia are grey and bright only when lone shines
oil them ione's cheek is 
i do not understand one word thy description
interrupted nydia peevishly i compress
oily that you do not resemble each other
and i am glad it
rompeji 
why nydia said lone
nydia coloured slightly because she re
plied coolly i have always imagined you under
different forms and one likes to know one is
right
and what hast thou imagined glaucus to resemble
 asked lone softly
music replied nydia looking down
thou art right thought lone
and what likeness hast thou ascribed to
lone 
i cannot tell yet answered blind girl 
i have not yet known her long enough to find a
shape and sign for my guesses
i will tell thee then said glaucus passionately
 she is like sun that warms like 
avave that refreshes
 sun sometimes scorches and wave
sometimes drowns answered nydia
take then these roses said glaucus let
their fragrance suggest to thee lone
alas roses will fade said neapolitan
archly
thus conversing they wore away hours
 
 lovers conscious only brightness and
smiles love blind girl feeding only its darkness
 its tortures fierceness jealousy and
its woe 
and now as they drifted on glaucus once more
resumed lyre and woke its strings with a
careless hand to a strain so wildly and gladly
beautiful that even nydia was aroused from her
reverie and uttered a cry admiration
thou seest my child's cried glaucus that
t can yet redeem character love's music
and that i was wrong in saying happiness could
not be gay listen nydia listen dear lone 
and hear

like a star in seas above
like a dream to waves sleep 
up up incarnate love
she rose from charmed deep 
and over cyprian isle
 skies shed their silent smile 
 suggested by a picture aeniis rising from sea taken
from pompeii and now in museum at naples
pompeii upland
 forest's green heart was rife
with stir gushing hfe 
 hfe that had leapt to birth
in veins happy earth 
hail oh hail 
 dimmest seacave below thee

hurrah for birth love

thou com'st on thy silver ringlets
from thy home in tender west 
now fanning her golden ringlets
now hushed on her heaving breast
and afar on murmuring sand
 seasons wait hand in hand
to welcome thee birth divine
to earth which is henceforth thine

bright pearl in its floating cell 
 according to ancient mythologists venus rose from

like a blush with a bashful glow
sailing on slowly sailing
o'er wild water 
all hail as fond light is hailing
her daughter
all hail 
we are thine all thine evermore
not a leaf on laughing shore
not a wave on heaving sea
nor a single sigh
in boundless sky
but is vowed evermore to thee i
vnd thou my beloved one thou
as i gaze on thy soft eyes now
methinks from their depths i view
 holy birth born anew 
pompeii s
thy lids are gentle cell
where young love blushing lies

she comes from thy tender eyes

into sea covered with countless vessels and

more noisy and frequented hanks olinthus directed
his steps to a path which ran amidst a shady vista
 trees at distance a few paces from 
river this walk was in evening a favourite

business day was seldom visited save hy

a century ago were little aware perhaps that
in their tortured yews and sculptured box they
found their models in most polished period

 villas fastidious pliny
this walk now as noonday sun shone
perpendicularly through chequered leaves
was entirely deserted at least no other forms
than those olinthus and priest infringed
upon solitude they sate themselves on one
 benches placed at intervals between 
trees and facing faint breeze that came languidly
from river whose waves danced and

seest before thee a wretched and distracted man 
from my childhood upward i have idolized

admitted to companionship beings above

feverish and vague desires my nights with mocking
but solemn visions seduced by mystic
prophecies an impostor i have indued these

my nature has revolted at what i have seen and
been doomed to share in searching after truth

i know not if there be gods above if we are 
things chance if beyond bounded and melancholy
present there is annihilation or an hereafter
 tell me then thy faith solve me these
doubts if thou hast indeed power 
i do not marvel answered nazarene that
thou hast thus erred or that thou art thus sceptic
eighty years ago there was no assurance toman
 god or a certain and definite future
beyond grave new laws are declared to
him who has ears a heaven a true olympus is
revealed to him who has eyes heed then and
listen
and with all earnestness a man believing
ardently himself and zealous to convert nazarene
poured forth to appetites assurances 
scriptural promise he spoke first sufferings
and miracles christ he wept as he spoke
he turned next to glories saviour's ascension
 to clear predictions revelation he
 
described that pure and sensual heaven destined
to virtuous those fires and torments that were
 doom guilt
 doubts avliicli spring up to mind 
later reasoners in immensity sacrifice
 god to man were not such as avould occur to
an early heathen he had been accustomed to
believe that gods had lived upon earth and
taken upon themselves forms men had
shared in human passions in human labours and
in human misfortunes what was travail 
his own alcmfbua's son whose altars now smoked
with incense countless cities but a toil for
 human race had not great dorian
apollo expiated a mystic sin by descending to
 gave those who were deities heaven
had been lawgivers or benefactors on
earth and gratitude had led to worship it seemed
therefore to heathen a doctrine neither new
nor strange that christ had been sent from heaven
that an innnortal had indued mortality and tasted
 bitterness death and for which he
thus toiled and thus suffered how far more
glorious did it seem to apa'cides than that for
pompeii 
which deities old had visited nether
work and passed through gates death 
was it not worthy a god to descend to these
dim valleys in order to clear np clouds gathered
over dark mount beyond to satisfy doubts
 sages to convert speculation into certainty 
by example to point out rules life by revelation
to solve enigma grave and to
prove that soul did not yearn in vain when it
dreamed an immortality in this was 
great argument those lowly men destined to
convert earth as nothing is more flattering
to pride and hopes man than belief
in a future state so nothing could be more vague
and confused than notions heathen
sages upon that mystic subject
appetites had already learned that faith 
 philosophers was not that herd that
if they secretly professed a creed in some diviner
power it was not creed which they thought
it wise to impart to community he had already
learned that even priest ridiculed what
he preached to people that notions 
fev and many were never united but in
 
this new faith it seemed to him that philosopher
priest and people expounders religion
and its followers were alike accordant they did
not speculate and debate upon immortality they
spake it as a thing certain and assured 
magnificence promise dazzled him its consolations
soothed for christian faith made its
early converts among sinners many its fathers
and its martyrs were those who had felt 
bitterness vice and who were therefore no
longer tempted by its false aspect from paths
 an austere and uncompromising virtue all 
assurances this healing faith invited to repentance
 they were peculiarly adapted to bruised
and sore spirit very remorse which ascites
felt for his late excesses made him incline
to one who found holiness in that remorse and
who whispered joy in heaven over one
sinner that repented
come said nazarene as he perceived
 effect he had produced come to humble
hall in which we meet a select and a chosen few
listen there to our prayers note sincerity 
our repentant tears mingle in our simple sacrifice
pompeii 
not victims nor garlands but offered by
whiterobed thoughts upon altar heart 
 flowers that we lay there are imperishable 
they bloom over us when we are no more nay
they accompany us beyond grave they spring
lip beneath our feet in heaven they delight us
with an eternal odour for they are soul they
partake its nature these offerings are temptations
overcome and sins repented come oh come lose
not another moment prepare already for great
 awful journey from darkness to light from
sorrow to bliss from corruption to immortality
this is day lord sun a day that we
have set apart for our devotions though we
meet usually at night yet some amongst us are
gathered together even now what joy what triumph
will be with us all if ave can bring one
stray lamb into sacred fold 
there seemed to apsecides so naturally pure 
heart something ineffably generous and benign in
that spirit conversion which animated olinthus 
a spirit that found its own bliss in happiness 
others that sought in its wide sociality to make
companions for eternity he was touched softthe
 
ened and subdued hewas not in that mood
which can bear to be left alone curiosity too
mingled with his purer stimulants he was anxious
to see those rites which so many dark and contradictory
rumours were afloat he paused a moment
looked over his garb thought arbaces
shuddered with horror lifted his eyes to broad
brow nazarene intent anxious watchful
but for in's benefit for his salvation he drew
his cloak round him so as wholly to conceal his
robes and said lead on i follow thee
olinthus pressed his hand joyfully and then
descending to riverside hailed one 
boats that plyed there constantly they entered it
an awning overhead hile it sheltered them from
 sun screened also their persons from observation
 they rapidly skimmed wave from one
 boats that passed them floated a soft music
and its prow was decorated with flowers it was
gliding towards sea
so said olinthus sadly unconscious and
mirthful in their delusions sail votaries luxury
into gieat ocean storm and shipwreck 
rompeii 
we pass them silent and unnoticed to gain 
land
appetites lifting his eyes caught through 
aperture in awning a glimpse face 
one inmates that gay bark it was 
face lone lovers were embarked on 
excursion to which we have been made present
 priest sighed and once more sunk back upon
his seat they reached shore where in 
suburbs an alley small and mean houses stretched
towards bank they dismissed boat
landed and olinthus preceding priest threaded
 labyrinth lanes and arrived at at 
closed door a habitation somewhat larger than
its neighbours he knocked thrice door
was opened and closed again as appetites followed
his guide across threshold
they passed a deserted atrium and gained an
inner chamber moderate size which when 
door was closed received its only light from a
small window cut over door itself but halting
at threshold this chamber and knocking
at door olinthus said peace be with you 
 op
a voice from within returned peace with whom
 faithful answered olynthus and door
opened twelve or fourteen persons were sitting ina
semicircle silent and seemingly absorbed in
thought and opposite to a crucifix rudely carved in
wood
they lifted up their eyes when olinthus entered
without speaking nazarene himself before he
accosted them knelt suddenly down and by his
moving lips and his eyes fixed steadfastly on 
crucifix appetites saw that he prayed inly this
rite performed olinthus turned to congregation
 men and brethren said he start not to
behold amongst you a priest isis he hath sojourned
with wind but spirit hath fallen
on him he desires to see to hear and to understands

let him said one assembly and apa
cites beheld in speaker a man still younger
than himself a countenance equally worn and
pallid an eye which equally spoke restless
and fiery operations a working mind
let him repeated a second voice and he who
thus spoke was in prime manhood his
pomi'eir 
bronzed skin and asiatic features bespoke bini a
son syria he had been a robber in his youth
let him said a third voice and priest
again turning to regard speaker saw an othman
with a long grey beard whom he recognized
as a slave to wealthy doomed
let him repeated simultaneously rest 
men who with two exceptions were evidently 
 inferior rank li these exceptions appetites
noted an officer guard and an alexandrian
merchant
we do not recommenced olintlms we do
not bind you to secrecy we impose on you no
oaths as some our weaker brethren would do
not to betray us it is true indeed that there is
no absolute law against us but multitude more
savage than their rulers thirst for our lives so my
friends when pilate would have hesitated it was
 people who shouted christ to cross i but
we bind you not to our safety no betray us to
 crowd impeach calumniate malign us if you
will we are above death we should walk cheerfully
to den lion or rack torturer
 we can trample down darkness 
 
grave and llat is death to a criminal is eternity
to christian
a low and applauding murmur ran through 
assembly
 thou comest amongst us an examiner mayest
thou remain a convert our religion you behold
it yon cross our sole image yon scroll 
mysteries our care and eleusis our morality 
it is in our lives sinners we all have been who
now can accuse us a crime we have baptized ourselves
from past think not that this is us
it is god approach melons beckoning to 
old slave who had spoken third for admission
 appetites thou art sole man amongst us
ho is not free but in heaven shall be
first so with us unfold your scroll read and
explain
useless avould it be for us to accompany lecture
 medon or comments congregation
familiar now are those doctrines then
strange and new eighteen centuries have left us
little to expound upon lore scripture ur 
life christ to us too there would seem
little congenial in doubts that occurred to a
pompeii 
heathen priest and httlc k'arneil in answered
they received from men uneducated rude and
simple possessing only knowledge that they
were greater than they seemed
there was one thing that greatly touched 
neapolitan when lecture was concluded they
heard a very gentle knock at door password
was given and replied to door opened
and two young children eldest whom might
have told its seventh year entered timidly they
were children master house that
dark and hardy syrian whose youth had been
spent in pillage and bloodshed eldest 
congregation it alas that old slave opened to
them his arms they fled to shelter they
crept to his breast and his hard features smiled
as he caressed them and then these bold and fervent
men nursed in vicissitude beaten by 
rough winds life men mailed and impervious
fortitude ready to affront a world prepared for
torment and armed for death men who presented
all imaginable contrast to weak nerves 
light hearts tender fragility childhood 
crowded round infants smoothing their rugs
 
get brows and composing their bearded lips to
kindly and fostering smiles and then old
man opened scroll and he taught infants
to repeat after him that beautiful prayer which we
still dedicate to lord and still teach to our
children and then he told them in simple phrase
 god's love to young and how not a sparrow
falls but his eye sees it this lovely custom 
infant initiation was long cherished by early
church in memory words which said
suffer little children to come unto me and
forbid them not and was perhaps origin 
 superstitious calumny which ascribed to 
nazarenes crime which nazarene when victorious
attributed to jew viz decoying
children to hideous rites at which they were secretly
immolated
and stern paternal penitent seemed to feel
in innocence his children a return into early
life life ere yet it sinned he followed motion
 their young lips with an earnest gaze he smiled
as they repeated with hushed and reverent looks
 holy words and when lesson was done
and they ran released and gladly to his knee he
rompeii 
clasped them to his breast kissed them again and
again and tears flowed fast down his cheek tears
 which it woukl have been impossible to trace
 som'ce so mingled they were with joy and
sorrow penitence and hope remorse for himself
and love for them 
something i say there was in this scene which
peculiarly affected appetites and in truth it is
difficult to conceive a ceremony more appropriate
to religion benevolence more appealing to
 household and everyday affections striking a
more sensitive chord in human breast
it was at this time that an inner door opened
gently and a very old man entered chamber
leaning on a staff at his presence whole
congregation rose there was an expression 
deep affectionate respect upon every countenance
and appetites gazing on his countenance felt
attracted towards him by an irresistible sympathy
no man ever looked upon that face without love 
for there had dwelt smile deity 
incarnation divinest love and glory 
smile had never past away 
my children god be with you said old
vol ii d
 
man stretching bis arms aud as he spoke 
infants ran to his knee he sate down and they
nestled fondling to his bosom it was beautiful
to see that mingling extremes life 
rivers gushing from their early source majestic
stream gliding to ocean eternity as 
light declining day seems to mingle earth and
heaven making outline each scarce visible
and blending harsh mountaintops with 
sky even so did smile that benign old age
appear to hallow aspect those around to blend
together strong distinctions varying years
and to diffuse over infancy and manhood light
 that heaven into which it must so soon vanish
and be lost
father said olinthus thou on whose form
 miracle redeemer worked thou who
wert snatched from grave to become 
living witness his mercy and his power 
behold a stranger in our meeting a new lamb
gathered to fold 
let me bless him said old man 
throng gave way apacides approached him as
bv an instinct he fell on his knees before him 
pompeii 
 old man laid his hand on priest's head and
blessed him but not aloud as his lips moved
his eyes were upturned and tears those tears that
good men only shed in hope happiness to
another flowed fast down his cheeks
 children were on either side convert 
his heart was as theirs he had become as one 
them to enter into kingdom heaven i

chapter iv
 stream love runs on whither
 are like years in love young
when no bar no obstacle is between their hearts
when sun shines and course runs smooth
hen their love is prosperous and confest
tone no longer concealed from glaucus attachment
she felt for him and their talk now was only
 their love over rapture present
 hopes future glowed like heaven
above gardens spring they went in their
trustful thoughts far down stream time 
they laid out chart their destiny to come 
they suffered light today to suffuse 
morrow in youth their hearts it seemed
as if care and cluuig and death were as things
unknown perhaps they loved each other 
more because condition work left to
glaucus no aim and no wish but love because
 distractions common in free states to menes
affection existed not for athenian because
his country wooed him not to bustle civil
life because ambition furnished no counterpoise
to love and therefore over their schemes and
their projects love only reigned in iron age
they imagined themselves golden doomed
only to live and to love
to superficial observer who interests himself
only in characters strongly marked and broadly
coloured both lovers may seem too slight
and commonplace a mould in delineation 
characters purposely subdued reader sometimes
imagines that there is a want character 
perhaps indeed i wrong real nature these
two lovers by not painting more impressively their
stronger individuality but in dwelling so much
on their bright and birdlike existence i am influenced
almost insensibly by forethought 
 changes that await them and for which they
were so ill prepared it was this very softness
and gaiety life that contrasted most strongly
 
 vicissitudes their coming fate for oak
without fruit or blossom whose hard and rugged
heart is fitted for storm there is less fear than
for delicate branches myrtle and 
laughing clusters vine
they had now entered far upon august 
next month their marriage was fixed and 
threshold glaucus was already wreathed with
garlands and nightly by door lone he
poured forth rich libations he existed no
longer for his gay companions he was ever with
lone in mornings they beguiled sun
with music in evenings they forsook 
crowded haunts gay for excursions on
 water or along fertile and vineclad plains
that lay beneath fatal mount vesuvius
 earth shook no more lively pompeians
forgot even that there had gone forth so terrible a
warning their approaching doom glaucus imagined
that convulsion in vanity his heathen
religion an especial interposition gods
less in behalf his own safety than that lone he
offered up sacrifices gratitude at temples
 his faith and even altar isis was covered
pompeii 
with his votive garlands as to prodigy 
animated marble he blushed at effect it had
produced on him he believed it indeed to have
been wrought by magic man but result
convinced him that it betokened not anger
 a goddess
 arbaces they heard only that he still lived 
stretched on bed suffering he recovered
slowly from effect shock he had sustained
 he left lovers unmolested but it was only
to brood over hour and method revenge
alike in their mornings at house lone
and in their evening excursions nydia was usually
their constant and often their sole companion
they did not guess secret fires which consumed
her abrupt freedom with which she
mingled in their conversation her capricious
and often her peevish moods found ready indulgence
in recollection service they owed
her and their compassion for her affliction they
felt perhaps greater and more affectionate
interest for her from very strangeness and
waywardness her nature her singular alternations
 passion and softness mixture ignorance
 
and genius delicacy and rudeness quick
humours child and proud calmness 
 woman although she refused to accept 
freedom she was constantly suffered to be free 
she went where she listed no curb was put
either on her words or actions they felt for one
so darkly fated and so susceptible every
wound same pitying and compliant indulgence
 mother feels for a spoiled and sickly
child dreading to impose authority even where
they imagined it for her benefit she availed
herself this licence by refusing companionship
 slave whom they wished to attend
her with slender staff by which she guided
her steps she went now as in her former unprotected
state along populous streets it was
almost miraculous to perceive how quickly and
how dexterously she threaded every crowd avoided
every danger and could find her benighted
way through most intricate windings 
city but her chief delight was still in visiting
 few feet ground which made garden 
glaucus in tending flowers that at least repayed
her love sometimes she entered chnm
pompeii 
ber where he sat and sought a conversation
which she nearly always broke off abruptly for
conversation with glaucus only tended to one
subject lone and that name from his lips inflicted
agony upon her often she bitterly repented
 service she had rendered to lone often
she said inly if she had fallen glaucus could
have loved her no longer and then dark and
fearful thoughts crept into her breast
she had not experienced fully trials that
were in store for her when she had been thus
generous she had never been present when glaucus
and lone were together she had never heard that
voice so kind to her so much softer to another
 shock that crushed her heart wtli tidings
that glaucus loved had at first only saddened and
benumbed by degrees jealousy took a wilder
and fiercer shape it partook hatred it whispered
revenge as you see wind only agitate
 green leaf upon bough awhile 
leaf which has lain withered and seared on 
ground bruised and trampled upon till sap
and life are gone is suddenly whirled aloft nowhere
 now there without stay and without rest
d 
 
so love which visits happy and 
hopeful hath hut freshness on its wings its violence
is but sportive but heart that hath
fallen from green things life that is without
hope that hath no summer in its fibres is torn
and whirled by same wind that but caresses
its brethren it hath no bough to cling to it is
dashed from path to path till winds fall and
it is crushed into mire for ever
 friendless childhood nydia had hardened
prematurely her character perhaps heated
scenes profligacy through which she had passed
seemingly unscathed had ripened her passions
though they had not sullied her purity orgies
 turbo might only have disgusted banquets 
 egyptian might only have terrified at moment
 but perhaps those winds pollution left seeds
in breast over which they passed so lightly as
darkness too favours imagination so perhaps
her very blindness contributed to feed aith avild
and delirious visions love unfortunate
girl voice glaucus had been fiist that
had sounded musically to her ear his kindness
made a deep impression upon her mind when he
pompeii 
had left pompeii iu former year she had treasured
up in her heart every word he had uttered
and when any one told her that this friend and
patron poor flower girl was most brilliant
and most graceful young revellers
 pompeii she had felt a pleasing pride in nursing
his recollection even task which she
imposed upon herself tending his flowers served
to keep him in her mind she associated him withall
that was most charming to her impressions and
when she had refused to express what image she
fancied lone to resemble it was partly perhaps
that whatever was bright and soft in nature she
had already combined with thought glaucus
if any my readers ever loved at an age which
they would now smile to remember an age in
which fancy forestalled reason let them say
whether that love among all its strange and complicated
delicacies was not above all other and
later passions susceptible jealousy seek
not here cause i know that it is commonly
 fact
when glaucus returned to pompeii nydia
had told another year life that year with its
 
sorrows its loneliness its trials had greatly
developed her mind and heart and when 
athenian drew her unconsciously to his breast
deeming her still in soul as in years a child 
when he kissed her smooth cheek and wound his
arm round her trembling frame nydia felt suddenly
and as by revelation that those feelings
she had long and innocently cherished were 
love doomed to be rescued from tyranny by
glaucus doomed to take shelter under his roof 
doomed to breathe but for so brief a time same
air and doomed in first rush a thousand
happy grateful delicious sentiments an overflowing
heart to hear that he loved another to
be commissioned to that other messenger
 minister to feel all at once that utter nothingness
which she was which she ever must
be but which till then her young mind had not
taught her that utter nothingness to him who
was all to her what wonder that in her wild
and passionate soul all elements jarred discordant
 that if love reigned over whole it
was not love which is born more sacred
pompeii 
and soft emotions sometimes she dreaded only
lest glaucus should discover her secret sometimes
she felt indignant that it was not suspected 
it was a sign contempt could he imagine
that she presumed so far her feelings to lone
ebbed and flowed with every hour now she
loved her because he did now she hated her
for same cause there were moments when
she could have murdered her unconscious mistress
moments when she could have laid down life for
her these fierce and tremulous alternations 
passion were too severe to be borne long her
health gave way though she felt it not her cheek
paled her step grew feebler tears came to her
eyes more often and relieved her less
one morning when she repaired to her usual task
in garden athenian she found glaucus
under columns peristyle with a merchant
 town he was selecting jewels for his destined
bride he had already fitted up her apartment
 jewels he bought that day were placed also
within it they were never fated to grace 
fair form lone they may be seen at this day
 
among disinterred treasures pompeii in 
chambers studio at naples
come hither nydia put down thy vase and
come hither thou must take this chain from me 
stay there i have put it on there services
does it not become her 
wonderfully answered jeweller tor
jewellers were lyellbred and flattering men even
at that day but avhen these earrings glitter
in ears noble lone then by bacchus you
will see whether my art adds anything to beauty
lone repeated nydia who had hitherto
acknowledged by smiles and blushes gift 
glaucus
yes replied athenian carelessly toying
with gems i am choosing a present for lone
but there are none worthy her
he was startled as he spoke by an abrupt gesture
 nydia she tore chain violently from
her neck and dashed it on ground
how is this avhat nydia dost thou not like
 bauble art thou offended 
several bracelets chains and jewels were found in 
house
pompeii 
you treat me ever as a slave and as a child
replied tressilian with a breast heaving with
illsuppressed sobs and she turned hastily away to
 opposite corner garden
glaucus did not attempt to follow or to soothe
he was offended he continued to examine 
jewels and to comment on their fashion to object
to this and to praise that and finally to be talked
by merchant into buying all safest plan
for a lover and one that any one will do right to
adopt provided always that he can obtain an lone 
when he had completed his purchase and dismissed
 jeweller he retired into his chamber
dressed mounted his chariot and went to lone he
thought no more blind girl or her offence
he had forgotten both one and other
he spent forenoon with his beautiful neapolitan
repaired thence to baths supped if as
we have said before we can justly so translate 
threeoclockcejaof romans alone and abroad
i'or pompeii had its restaurateurs and returning
home to change his dress ere he again repaired to 
house lone he passed peristyle but with 
f 
absorbed reverie and absent eyesof a man in love and
did not note form poor blind girl bending
exactly in same place where he had left her
but though lie saw her not her ear recognized at
once sound his step she had been counting
 moments to his return he had scarcely
entered his favourite chamber which opened on 
peristyle and seated himself musingly on his
couch when he felt his robe timorously touched
and turning he beheld nydia kneeling before him
and holding up to him a handful flowers a gentle
and an appropriate peace offering her eyes
darkly upheld to his own streamed with tears
i have offended thee said she sobbing and
for first time i would die rather than cause
thee a moment's pain say that thou wilt forgive
me see i have taken up chain i have put it
on i will never part from it it is thy gift
my dear nydia returned glaucus and raising
her he kissed her forehead think it no
more but why my child wert thou so suddenly
angry i could not divine cause 
do not ask said she colouring violently i
am a thing full faults and humours you know 
pompeii 
am but a child you say so often is it from a
child that you can expect a reason for every
folly 
but prettiest you will soon be a child no
more and if you would have us treat you as a
woman you must learn to govern these singular
impulses and gales passion think not i chide 
no it is for your happiness only i speak
it is true said nydia i must learn to
govern myself i must hide i must suppress my
heart this is a woman's task and duty methinks
her virtue is hypocrisy
selfcontrol is not deceit my nydia returned
 athenian and that is virtue necessary
alike to man and to woman it is true
senatorial toga badge dignity it covers
selfcontrol selfcontrol well well what
you say is right when i listen to you glaucus
my wildest thoughts grow calm and sweet and
a delicious serenity falls over me advise ah guide
me ever my preserver 
thy affectionate heart will be thy best guide
nydia when thou hast learned to regulate its
feelings
g 
all i that will be never sighed nydia wiping
avay her tears
say not so first effort is only difficult one
i have made many first efforts answered
nydia innocently but you my mentor do you
find it so easy to controul yourself can you conceal
 can you even regulate your love for lone
love dear nydia ah that is suite another
matter answered young preceptor
i thought so returned nydia with a melancholy
smile glaucus wilt thou take my poor
flowers do with them as thou wilt thou canst
give them to lone if thou wilt added she with a
little hesitation
nay nydia answered glaucus kindly divining
something jealousy in her language though
he imagined it only jealousy a vain and susceptible
child i will not give thy pretty flowers
to any one sit here and weave them into a garland
 i will wear it this night it is not first
those delicate fingers have woven for me
 poor girl delightedly sat down beside glaucus
she drew from her girdle a ball manycoloured
threads or rather slender ribands used in
pompeii 
 weaving garlands and which for it washer
professional occupation she carried constantly
with her and began quickly and gracefully to
commence her task upon her young cheeks 
tears were already dried a faint but happy smile
played round her lips childlike indeed she was
sensible only joy present hour 
she was reconciled to glaucus he had forgiven
her she was beside him he played caressingly
with her silken hair his breath fanned her cheek
lone cruel lone was not by none other
demanded divided his care yes she was happy
and forgetful it was one few moments in
her brief and troubled life that it was sweet to
treasure to recall as butterfly allured by
 winter sun basks for a little while in sudden
light ere yet wind awakes and frost
comes on which shall blast it before eve she
rested beneath a beam which by contrast with
 wonted skies was not chilling and instinct
which should have warned her its briefness
bade her only gladden in its smile
thou hast beautiful locks said glaucus
they were once i ween well a mother's delight
g 
nydia sighed it would seem that she had not
been born a slave but she ever shunned mention
 her parentage and whether obscure or noble certain
it is that her birth was never known by her
benefactors or by any one in those distant shores
even to child sorrow and mystery
she came and went as some bird that enters
our chamber for a moment we see it flutter while
before us we know not whence it flew or to what
region it escapes
nydia sighed and after a short pause without
answering remark said 
but do i weave too many roses in thy wreath
glaucus they tell me it is thy favourite flower
and ever favoured my nydia be it by those
who have soul poetry it is flower love
 festivals it is also flower we dedicate to
silence and to death it blooms on our brows in
life while life be worth having it is scattered
above our sepulchre when we are no more
ah would said nydia instead this
perishable wreath that i could take thy web from
 hand fates and insert roses there
pretty one thy wish is worthy a voice so
pompeii 
attuned to song it is uttered in spirit sonyand
whatever my doom i thank thee
whatever thy doom is it not already destined
to all things bright and fair my wish was vain
 fates will be as tender to thee as i should
it might not be so nydia were it not for love 
while youth lasts i may forget my country fora
while but what athenian in his graver manhood
can think athens as she was and be contented
that he is happy while she is fallen fallen
and for ever
and why for ever 
as ashes cannot be rekindled as love once
dead never can revive so freedom departed from a
people is never regained but talk we not these
matters unsuited to thee 
to me oh thou arrest i too have my sighs
for greece my cradle was rocked at feet 
olympus gods have left mountain but
their traces may be seen seen in hearts their
worshippers seen in beauty their clime 
they tell me it is beautiful and have felt its airs
to which even these are harsh its smi to which
these skies are chill oh talk to me greece 
poor fool that i am i can comprehend thee and
 
methinks had i yet lingered on those shores had
i been a grecian maid whose happy fate it was
to love and to be loved i myself could have
armed my lover for another marathon a new plataea
yes hand that now weaves roses
should have woven thee olive crown 
if such a day could come said glaucus catching
 enthusiasm blind thessalian and
half rising but no sun has set and 
night only bids us be forgetful and in forgetfulness
be gay weave still roses 
but it was with a melancholy tone forced
gaiety that athenian uttered words and
sinking into a gloomy reverie he was only wakened
from it a few minutes afterwards by voice
 nydia as she sang in a low tone following
words which he had once taught her

who will assume bays
that hero wore
wreaths on tomb 
gone evermore 
pompeii 
who shall disturb brave
or one leaf on their holy grave 
 laurel is vowed to them
leave bay on its sacred stem i
but this rose fading rose
alike for slave and freeman grows i

if memory sits beside dead
with tombs her only treasure 
if hope is lost and freedom fled
 more excuse for pleasure
come weave wreath roses weave
 rose at least is ours 
to feeble hearts our fathers leave
in pitying scorn flowers 

on summit worn and hoary
 phyle's solemn hill
 tramp brave is still 
and still in saddening mart
 pulse that mighty heart
whose very blood was glory i
 
glaucopis forsakes her own
 angry gods forget us
but yet blue streams along
walk feet silver song
and nightbird wakes moon 
and bees in blushing noon
haunt heart old hymettus i
we are fallen but not forlorn
if something is left to cherish 
as love was earliest born
so love is to perish

wreath then roses wreath 
 beautiful still is ours
while stream shall flow and sky shall glow
 beautiful still is ours 
whatever is fair or soft or bright
in lap day or arms night
whispers our soul greece greece
and hushes our care with a voice peace
wreath then roses wreath i
they tell me earlier hours
and i hear heart my country breathe
i'vom lips stranger's flowers

lydia encounters julia interview heathen
sister and converted brother an athenians

what happiness to lone avliat bliss to be
ever by side glaucus to hear his voice 
and she too can see him v
such was soliloquy blind girl as she
walked alone and at twilight to house her
new mistress whither glaucus had already preceded
her suddenly she was interrupted in her
fond thoughts by a female voice 
blind flower girl whither goes thou there is
no panier under thine arm hast thou sold all thy
flowers 
 person thus accosting nydia was a lady 
a handsome but a bold and maiden countenance 
it was julia daughter diomed her veil
was half raised as she spoke she was accompanied
vol ii e
 
by divorced himself and by a slave carrying a
lantern before them merchant and his
daughter avere returning home from a supper atone
 their neighbours
dost thou not remember my voice continued
julia i am daughter diomcd 
wealthy
ah forgive me yes i recall tones

and diomed again impatiently summoned his
daughter she was obliged to proceed with 
main question she had desired to put to nydia
unasked
meanwhile we return to lone interval 
time that had elapsed that day between first
and second visit glaucus had not been too
gaily spent she had received a visit from her
brother since night he had assisted in saving
her from egyptian she had not before seen him
occupied with his own thoughts thoughts so
serious and intense a nature young priest had
thought little his sister in truth men perhaps
 that fervent order mind which is ever
aspiring above earth are but little prone to 
earthlier affections and it had been long since
e 
 
apeccijes had sought those soft and friendly interchanges
 thought those sweet confidences
which in his earlier youth had bound him to
lone and which are so natural to that endearing
connexion which existed between them
lone however had not ceased to regret his
estrangement she attributed it at present to 
engrossing duties his severe fraternity and
often amidst all her bright hopes and her new
attachment to her betrothed often avhen she
thought her brother's brow prematurely furrowed
his unsmiling lip and bended frame she
sighed to think that service gods could
throw so deep a shadow over that earth which 
gods created
but this day when he visited her there was a
strange calmness on his features a more quiet and
selfpossessed expression in his sunken eyes than
she had marked for years this apparent improvement
was but momentary it vas a false
calm which least breeze could ruffle
may gods bless thee my brother said
she embracing him
pompeii 
 gods speak not thus vaguely perchance
there is but ie god 
my brother 
what if sublime faith nazarene be
true what if god be a monarch one indivisible
 alone what if these numerous countless
deities whose altars fill earth be but evil
demons seeking to avean us from true creed 
this may be case lone 
alas can we believe it or if we believed
would it not be a melancholy faith answered
 neapolitan what all this beautiful world
made only human mountain disenchanted 
it oi'ead waters their nymph that beautiful
prodigality faith which makes everything
divine consecrating meanest flowers bearing celestial
whispers in faintest breeze wouldst thou
deny this and make earth mere dust and
clay no apsecides all that is brightest in our
hearts is that very credulity which peoples 
universe with gods
lone answered as a believer in poesy 
old mythology would answer we may judge by
 
that reply how obstinate and hard contest
which christianity had to endure among heathens
 graceful superstition was never silent 
every most household action their lives was
entwined with it it was a portion life itself
as flowers are a part thyrsus at every
incident they recurred to a god every cup wine
was prefaced by a libation very garlands on
their thresholds were dedicated to some divinity
their ancestors themselves made holy presided as
litres over their hearth and hall so abundant was
belief with them that in their own climes at this
hour idolatry has never thoroughly been outrooted
 it changes but its objects worship it
appeals to innumerable saints where once it resorted
to divinities and it pours its crowds in
listening reverence to oracles at shrines 
st aquarius or st dominic instead to those
 isis or apollo
but these superstitions were not to early
christians object contempt so much as 
horror they did not believe with quiet
scepticism heathen philosopher that 
gods were inventions priests nor even ith
pompeii 
 vulgar that according to dim light history
they had been mortals like themselves they
imagined heathen divinities to be evil spirits 
they transplanted to italy and to greece gloomy
demons india and east and in jupiter orin
mars they shuddered at representative 
moloch or satan
appetites had not yet adopted formally 
christian faith but he was already on brink
 it he already participated doctrines 
olynthus he already imagined that lively imaginations
 heathen were suggestions 
 arch enemy mankind innocent and
natural answer lone made him shudder he
hastened to reply vehemently and yet so confusedly
that lone feared for his reason more
than she dreaded his violence
in pompeii a rough sketch pkito delineates that fearful
deity in shape we at present ascribe to devil and
decorates him with paraphernalia horns and a tail butin
all probability it was from mysterious pan haunter
 solitary places inspirer vague and soulshaking terrors
that we took vulgar notion outward likeness 
fiend it corresponds exactly to clovenfooted satan and
in lewd and profligate rites pan christians might well
imagine they traced deceptions devil
 
all my brother said she these hard duties
 thine have shattered thy very sense come tome
appetites my brother my own brother give
me thy hand let me wipe dear from thy brow 
chide me not now i understand thee not think
only that lone could not offend thee
lone said apjccides drawing her towards
him and regarding her tenderly can i thiiji that
this beautiful form this kind heart may be destined
to an eternity torment 
dii melior gods forbid said lone in
 customary form words by which her contemporaries
thought an omen might be averted
 words and still more superstition they
implied wounded car appetites he rose
muttering to himself turned from chamber
then stopping halfway gazed wistfully on lone
and extended his arms 
lone flew to them in joy he idssed her earnestly
and then he said 
farewell my sister when we next meet thou
mayest be to mc as nothing take thou then this
embrace full yet all tender reminiscences 
childhood when faith and hope creeds customs
pompeii 
interests objects wore same to us now 
tie is to be broken 
with these strange words he left house
 great and severest trial primitive
christians was indeed this their conversion separated
them from their dearest bonds they could
not associate with beings whose commonest actions
whose commonest forms speech were impregnated
with idolatry they shuddered at blessing
 love to their ears it was uttered in a demon's
name this their misfortune was their strength
if it divided them from rest world it
was to unite them proportionally to each other
they were men iron who wrought forth 
word god and verily bonds that bound
them were iron also 
glaucus found lone in tears he had already assumed
 sweet privilege to console he drew
from her a recital her iuteiview with her brother
but in her confused account language itself so
confused to one not prepared for it he was equally
at a loss with lone to conceive intentions or
 meaning appetites
hast thou ever heard much asked she 
e 
 
this new sect nazarenes which my brother
spoke
 have often heard enough votaries returned
glaucus but their exact tenets know i
nought save that in their doctrine there seemeth
something preternaturally chilling and morose
they hive apart from their kind they affect to bo
shocked even at our simple uses garlands they
have no sympathies with cheerful amusements 
life they utter awful threats coming destruction
 world they appear in one word to have
brought their unsmiling and gloomy creed out 
 cave trophies yet continued glaucus
after a slight pause they have not wanted men
 great power and genius nor converts even among
 areopagites athens well do i remember
to have heard my father speak one strange guest
at athens many years ago methinks his name
was paul my father was one amongst a mighty
crowd that gathered on one our immemorial
hills to hear this sage east expound 
through wide throng there rang not a single
murmur jest and roar with which our native
orators are received were hushed for him and
pompeii 
when on loftiest summit that hill raised
above breathless crowd below stood this mysterious
visiter his mien and his countenance awed
every heart even before a sound left his lips he
was a man i have heard my father say no tall
stature but noble and impressive mien his robes
were dark and ample declining sun for it was
evening shone aslant upon his form as it rose aloft
motionless and commanding his countenance was
much worn and marked as one aviio had braved
alike misfortune and sternest vicissitude many
climes but his eyes were bright with an almost
unearthly fire and when he raised his arm to
spealv it was with majesty a man into whom
 spirit a god hath rushed 
 men athens v he is reported to have said
i find amongst ye an altar with this inscription 
to unknown god ye worship in ignorance
 same deity i serve to you unknown till now
to you be it now revealed
then declared that solemn man how this great
maker all things who had appointed into man
his several tribes and his various homes 
lord earth and universal heaven dwelt not in
 
teiiiples made with hands that his presence his
spirit was in air we breathed our ife and our
being was with him think you he cried that
 invisible is like your statues gold and marble 
think you that he needed sacrifice from you 
he who made heaven and earth then spake he 
fearful and coming times world
 a second rising dead whereof an assurance
had been given to man in resurrection 
mighty being whose religion he came to preach
when he thus spoke long pent murmur
went forth and philosophers that were mingled
with people muttered their sage contempt 
there might you have seen chilling frown 
 stoic and cynic's sneer andtheepicmvan
who believeth not even in our own elysium muttered
a pleasant jest and swept laughing through
 crowd but deep heart people
was touched and thrilled and they trembled
though they knew not why for verily stranger
had voice and majesty a man to whom 
unknown god had committed preaching 
his faith
lone listened with rapt attention and seri
pompeii 
vous and earnest manner narrator betrayed
 impression that he himself had received from
one who had been amongst audience that on
 hill heathen mars had heard first
tidings word christ

 porter girl and gladiator
 door diomed's house stood open and
medon old slave sat at bottom steps
by which you ascended to mansion that
luxurious mansion rich merchant pompeii
is still to be seen just without gates city
at commencement street tombs it
was a gay neighbourhood despite dead on
 opposite side but at some yards nearer 
gate was a spacious hostelry at which those
brought by business or by pleasure to pompeii
often stopped to refresh themselves in space
before entrance inn now stood waggons
and carts and chariots some just arrived some
just quitting in all bustle an animated and
popular resort public entertainment before 
pompeii 
door some farmers seated on a bench by a small
circular table were talking over their morning cups
on affairs their calling on side 
door itself was painted gaily and freshly eternal
sign chequers by roof inn
istietched a terrace on which some females wives 
 farmers abovementioned were some seated some
leaning over railing and conversing with their
friends below in a deep recess at a little distance
was a covered seat in which some two or three
poorer travellers were resting themselves and shaking
 dust from their garments on other side
stretched a wide space originally burial ground
 a more ancient race than present denizens 
pompeii and now converted into ustrinum orplace
for burning dead above this rose
 terraces a gay villa half hid by trees 
tombs themselves with their graceful and varied
shapes flowers and foliage that surrounded
them made no melancholy feature in prospect
hard by gate city in a small niche stood
 still form welldisciplined roman sentry
 sun shining brightly on his polished crest and
there is another inn within walls similarly adorned
 
 lance on m'liich he leant i'lie gate itself was
divided into three arches centre one for vehicles
those at side for footpassengers and on
either side rose massive walls which girt 
city composed patched repaired at a thousand
different epochs according as war time or 
earthquake had shattered that vain protection a t
frequent intervals rose square towers whose summits
broke in picturesque rudeness regular
line wall and contrasted well with modern
buildings gleaming whitely by
 curving road which in that direction leads
from pompeii to herculaneum wound out sight
amidst hanging vines above which frowned 
 sullen majesty vesuvius
hast thou heard news old medon said
a young woman with a pitcher in her hand as she
paused by diomed's door to gossip a moment
with slave ere she repaired to neighbouring
inn to fill vessel and coquet with 
travellers
 news what news said slave raising
his eyes moodily from ground
why there passed through gate this 

iio no doubt ere thou wert well awake such a
visiter to pompeii i
per hercle said slave indifferently
yes a present from noble pomponi
anus
a present i thought thou saidst a visiter 
it is both visiter and present know o dull and
stupid that it is a most beautiful young tiger for
our approaching games in amphitheatre hear
you that medon oh what pleasure i declare i
shall not sleep a wink till i see it they say it ha
such a roar 
poor fool said medon sadly and critically
fool me no fool old churl it is a pretty thing
a tiger especially if we could but find somebody
for him to eat we have now a lion and a tiger 
only consider that medon and for want two
good criminals perhaps we shall be forced to see
them eat each other by by your son is a
gladiator a handsome man and a strong can you
uot persuade him to fight tiger do now you
would oblige me mightily nay you would be a
benefactor to whole town
yah val said slave with great ass
 
purity think tliiue own danger ere thou
thus protest my poor boy's death
my own danger said girl frightened and
looking hastily round avert omen let thy
words fall on thine own head and girl as
she spoke touched a talisman suspended round her
neck thine own danger what danger threatens
me 
had earthquake but a few nights since no
warning said medon has it not a voice did
it not say to us all prepare for death

tramp tramp how gaily they go 
ho ho for merry merry show i
chanting in a silver and clear voice this feminine
ditty and holding np her tunic from dusty
road young woman stepped lightly across to
 crowded hostelry
my poor son said slave half aloud is
it for things like this thou art to be butchered 
oh faith christ i could worship thee in all
sincerity were it but for horror which tlioit
inspires for these bloody lists
 old man's head sank dejectedly on his
breast he remained silent and absorbed but
every now and then sith corner his sleeve
he wiped his eyes his heart was with his son 
he did not see figure that now approached from
 gate with a quick step and a somewhat fierce
and reckless gait and carriage he did not lift his
eyes till figure paused opposite place where
he sat and with a soft voice addressed him by 
name 
 
father 
my loy my lyclon is it indeed thou said
 old man joyfully ah thou wert present
to my thoughts
i am glad to hear it my father said 
gladiator respectfully touching knees and
beard slave and soon may i be always
present with thee not in thought only
yes my son but not in this world replied
 slave mournfully
talk not thus o my sire look cheerfully
for i feel so i am sure that i shall win day
and then gold i gain buys thy freedom oh 
my father it was but a few since that i was
taunted by one too whom i would gladly have
undeceived for he is more generous than rest
 his equals he is not roman he is athens
by him i was taunted with lust gain 
when i demanded what sum was prize victory
alas he little knew soul lydon 
my boy my boy said old slave as
slowly ascending steps he conducted his son
to his own lltth chamber communicating with 
entrance hall which in this villa was jeristyle
not atrium you may see it now it is 
pompeii 
third door to left on entering first door
conducts to staircase second is but a false
recess in which there stood a statue bronze
 generous affectionate pious as are thy motives
said medon when they were thus secured
from observation thy deed itself is guilt thou
ait to risk thy blood for thy father's freedom 
that might be forgiven but prize victory
is blood another oh that is a deadly sin 
no object can pmify it forbear forbear rather
would i be a slave for ever than purchase liberty
on such terms 
hush my father replied lydon somewhat
impatiently thou hast picked up in this new
creed thine which i pray thee not to speak
to me for gods that gave me strength denied
me wisdom and i understand not one word 
what thou often preaches to me thou hast
picked up i say in this new creed some singular
phantasies right and wrong pardon me if
i offend thee but reflect against whom shall i
contend oh couldst thou know those wretches
with whom for thy sake i assort thou wouldst
think i purified earth by removing one them
 
beasts whose very lips drop blood things all
savage unprincipled in their very courage ferocious
heartless senseless no tie life can bind
them they know not fear it is true but neither
know they gratitude or charity or love they are
made but for their own career to slaughter without
pity to die without dread can thy gods
whosoever they be look with wrath on a conflict
with such as these and in such a cause oh
my father wherever powers above gaze down
on earth they behold no duty so sacred so sanctifying
as sacrifice offered to an aged parent by
 piety a grateful son 
 poor old slave himself deprived 
lights knowledge and only late a convert to
 christian faith knew not with what arguments
to enlighten an ignorance at once so dark and yet
so beautiful in its error his first impulse was to
throw himself on his son's breast his next to start
away to wring his hands and in attempt to
reprove his broken voice lost itself in weeping
and if resumed lydon if thy deity methinks
thou wilt own but one be indeed that
benevolent and pitying power which thou asserted
pompeii 
him to be he will know also that thy very faith
in him first confirmed me in that determination
thou blames
how what mean you said slave
why thou knowest that i sold in my childhood
as a slave was set free at rome by will
 my master whom i had been fortunate enough
to please i hastened to pompeii to see thee i
found thee already aged and infirm under 
yoke a capricious and pampered lord thou
hadst lately adopted this new faith and its
adoption made thy slavery doubly painful to thee 
it took away all softening charm custom
which reconciles us so often to worst didst
thou not complain to me that thou wert compelled
to offices that were not odious to thee as a slave
but guilty as a nazarene didst thou not tell
me that thy soul shook with remorse when
thou wert compelled to place even a crumb 
cake before lares that watch over yon 
that thy soul was torn by a perpetual
struggle didst thou not tell me that even by
pouring wine before threshold and calling on
 name some grecian deity thou didst fear
q 
thou wert incurring penalties worse than those 
tantalus an eternity torture more terrible
than those tartarean fields didst thou
not tell me this i wondered i could not comprehend
 nor by hercules can i now but i was
thy son and my sole task was to compassionate
and relieve could i hear thy groans could i
neatness thy mysterious horrors thy constant anguish
and remain inactive no by immortal
gods thought struck me like light from
olympus i had no money but i had strength
and youth these were thy gifts i could sell
these in my turn for thee i learned amount 
thy ransom i learned that usual prize a
victorious gladiator aould doubly pay it i became
a gladiator i linked myself with those
accursed men scorning loathing while i joined 
i acquired their skill blessed be lesson it
shall teach me to free my father 
oh that thou couldst hear olinthus sighed
 old man more and more affected by virtue
 his son but not less strongly convinced 
criminality his piupose
i will hear whole world talk if thou wilt
rompeii 
answered gladiator gaily but not till thou
art a slave no more beneath thy own roof my
father thou shalt puzzle this dull brain all day
long ay and all night too if it give thee pleasure
oh such a spot as i have chalked out for thee 
it is one nine hundred and ninetynine shops
 old julia felix in sunny part city
where thou mayest bask before door in day
and i will sell oil and wine for thee
my father and then please venus or if it does
not please her since thou lovest not her name
it is all one to lydon then i say perhaps
thou mayest have a daughter too to tend thy grey
hairs and hear shrill voices at thy knee that shall
call thee ly don's father ah we shall be so
happy prize can purchase all cheer thee 
cheer up my sire and now i must away day
wears lanista waits me come thy blessing
as lydon thus spoke he had already quitted
 dark chamber his father and speaking
eagerly though in a whispered tone they now
stood at same place in which we introduced
 porter at his post
o bless thee bless thee my brave boy
vol ii f
 
said medon fervently and may great power
that reads all hearts see nobleness thine
and forgive its error 
 tall shape gladiator passed swiftly
down path eyes slave followed
its light but stately steps till glimpse
was gone and then sinking once more on his
seat his eyes again fastened themselves on 
gromid his form mute and removing as a
thing stone his heart who in our happier
age can even imagine its struggles its commotion 
may i enter said a sweet voice is thy
mistress julia within 
 slave mechanically motioned to visiter
to enter but she who addressed him could
not see gesture she repeated her question
timidly but in a louder voice
have i not told thee said slave peevishly
 enter
thanks said speaker plaintively and
 slave roused by tone looked up and recognised
 blind flower girl sorrow can sympathise
with affliction he raised himself and
pompeii 
guided her steps to head adjacent
staircase by which you descended to jura's
apartment where summoning a female slave
he consigned to her charge blind
girl

chapter vii
 dressingroom a pompeii beauty important
conversation between julia and lydia
 elegant julia sat in her chamber with her
slaves around her like eubienlum which adjoined
it room was small but much larger
than usual apartments appropriated to sleep
which were generally so diminutive that few who
have not seen bedchamber even in gayest
mansions can form any notion petty pigeonholes
in which citizens pompeii evidently
thought it desirable to pass night butin fact
bed with ancients was not that grave serious
and important part domestic mysteries which
it is with us couch itself was more like a very
narrow and small sofa light enough to be transported
easily and by occupant himself from
 take up thy bed and walk was as sir w gell somewhere
observes no metaphorical expression
pompeii 
place to place and it was no doubt constantly
shifted from chamber to chamber according to 
caprices inmate or changes season
for that side house which was crowded in
one month might perhaps be carefully avoided in
 next so susceptible were inhabitants 
 most beautiful climate in world those
alternations sun and breeze which to our hardier
frame inured to harsh skies north
would be scarcely perceptible there was also
among italians that period a singular and
fastidious apprehension too much daylight 
their darkened chambers which at first appear tous
 result a negligent architecture were 
effect most elaborate study in their porticos
and gardens they courted sun whenever
it so pleased their luxurious tastes in interior
 their houses they sought rather coolness
and shade
julia's apartment at that season was in lower
part house immediately beneath stat
rooms above and looking upon garden with
which it was on a level wide door which was
glazed alone admitted morning rays yet her
 
eye accustomed to a certain darkness was sufficiently
acute to perceive exactly what colours
were most becoming what shade 
delicate rouge gave brightest beam to her
dark glance and most youthful freshness to
her cheek
on table before which she sate was a small
and circular mirror most polished steel 
round which in precise order were ranged cosmetics
and unguents perfumes and 
paints jewels and combs ribands
and gold pins which were destined to add to
 natural attractions beauty assistance 
art and capricious allurements offashion
through dimness room glowed brightly
 vivid and various colourings wall in all
 dazzling frescos pompeian taste before 
dressingtable and under feet julia was
spread a carpet woven from looms east
near at hand on another table was a silver basin
and ewer an extinguished lamp most exquisite
workmanship in which artist had represented
a cupid reposing under spreading branches 
a myrtle tree and a small roll papyrus containing
 softest elegies tibullus before 
pompeii 
door wliicli communicated with cublculum 
hung a curtain richly broidered with gold flowers
such was dressingroom a beauty eighteen
centuries ago
 fair julia leaned indolently back on her
seat while ornatrix i e hairdresser slowly
piled one above other a mass small curls 
dexterously weaving false with true and
carrying avhole fabric to a height that seemed
to place head rather at centre than 
summit human form
her tunic a deep amber which well set off
her dark hair and somewhat embroiled complexion
swept in ample folds to her feet which
were cased in slippers fastened round 
slender ankle by white thongs while a profusion
 pearls were embroidered in slipper itself
which was purple and turned slightly upward
as do turkish slippers at this day an old
slave skilled by long experience in all arcana
 toilette stood beside hairdresser with
 broad and studded girdle her mistress over
her arm and giving from time to time mingled
with judicious flattery to lady herself instructions
to mason ascending pile
 
put that pin rather more to right lower
stupid one do you not observe how even
those beautiful eyebrows are one would think
you avere dressing corunna whose face is all one
side now put in flowers what fool not
that dull pink you are not suiting colours to 
dim cheek coloris it must be brightest
flowers that can alone suit cheek young
julia
gently said lady stamping her small
foot violently you pull my hair as if you were
plucking up a weed
dull thing continued directress 
ceremony do you not know how delicate is your
mistress you are not dressing coarse horsehair
 widow fulvia now then riband
that's right fair julia look in mirror 
saw you ever anything so lovely as yourself 
when after innumerable comments difficulties
and delays intricate tower was at length completed
 next preparation was that giving
to eyes soft languish produced by a dark
powder applied to lids and brows a small
patch cut in form a crescent skilfully
pompeii 
placed by rosy lips attracted attention to their
dimples and to teeth to which already every
art had been applied in order to heighten dazzle
 their natural whiteness
to another slave hitherto idle was now consigned
 charge arranging jewels 
earrings pearl two to each ear massive
bracelets gold chain formed rings 
same metal to which a talisman cut in crystals
was attached graceful buckle on left
shoulder in which was set an exquisite cameo
 psyche girdle purple riband richly
wrought with threads gold and clasped by interlacing
serpents and lastly various rings
fitted to every joint white and slender fingers
 toilette was now arranged according
to mode rome fair julia regarded
herself with a gaze complacent vanity
and reclining again upon her seat she bade 
youngest her slaves in a listless tone read to
her enamoured couplets tibullus this
lecture was still proceeding when a female slave
admitted nydia into presence lady place

salve julia said flower girl arresting
her steps within a few paces from spot where
julia sat and crossing her arms upon her breast 
i have obeyed your commands
you have done well flower girl answered
 lady approach you may take a seat
one slaves placed a stool by julia and
nydia seated herself
julia looked hard at thessalian for some
moments in rather an embarrassed silence she
then motioned her attendants to withdraw and to
close door when they were alone she said
looking mechanically from nydia and forgetful
that she was with one who could not observe her
countenance
you serve neapolitan lone
i am with her at present answered
nydia
is she as handsome as they say 
i know not replied nydia how can 
judge
ah i shoukl have remembered but thou
hast ears if not eyes do thy fellow slaves tell
pompeii 
thee she is handsome slaves talking with one
another forget to flatter even their mistresses
they tell me that she is beautifully
hem say they that she is tall 
yes
why so am i darkhaired 
i have heard so
so am i and doth glaueus visit her
much 
daily returned nydia with a halfsuppressed
sigh
daily indeed does he find her handsome p
i should think so since they are so soon to be
wedded
wedded cried julia turning pale even
through false roses on her cheek and starting
from her couch nydia did not comes perceive
 emotion she had caused julia remained a
long time silent but her heaving breast and flashing
eyes would have betrayed to one who could
have seen wound her vanity sustained
they tell me thou art a thessalian said she
at breaking silence
 op
and truly 
thessaly is land magic and witches
 talismans and love philters said julia
it has ever been celebrated for its sorcerers
returned nydia timidly
knowest thou then blind thessalian any
lovecharms 
i v said flower girl colouring how
should i no assuredly not
 worse for thee i could have given thee
gold enough to have purchased thy freedom hadst
thou been more wise
but what asked nydia can induce 
beautiful and wealthy julia to ask that question
 her servant has she not money and youth and
loveliness are they not love charms enough to
dispense with magic 
to all but one person in world answered
julia haughtily but methinks thy blindness is
infectious and but no matter
and that one person said nydia eagerly
is not glaucus replied julia with customary
deceit her sex glaucus no 
pompeii 
nydia drew her breath more freely and after
a short pause juha recommenced 
but talking glaucus and his attachment to
this neapolitan reminded me influence 
lovespells which for aught i know or care she
may have exercised upon him blind girl i love
and shall julia live to say it am loved not in
return this humbles nay not humbles but it
stings my pride i would see this ingrate at my
feet not in order that i might raise but that i
might spurn him when they told me thou wert
thessalian i imagined thy young mind might
have learned dark secrets thy clime
alas no murmured nydia would it
had 
thanks at least for that kindly wish said
julia unconscious what was passing in 
breast flower girl
but tell me thou hearest gossip slaves
always prone to these dim beliefs always relady
to apply to sorcery for their own low loves hast
thou ever heard any eastern magician in this
city who possesses art which thou art igno
 
rant no vain chiromancer no juggler 
marketplace hut some more potent and mighty
magician india or egypt 
 egypt yes said nydia shuddering 
what pompeian has not heard arbaces
arbaces true replied julia grasping at 
recollection they say he is a man above all
 petty and false impostures dull pretenders 
that he is versed in learning stars and
 secrets ancient nox why not in 
mysteries love 
if there be one magician living whose art is
above that others it is that dread man answered
nydia and she felt her talisman while she
spoke
he is too wealthy to divine for money continued
julia sneeringly can i not visit him 
it is an evil mansion for young and 
beautiful replied nydia i have heard too
that he languishes in 
an evil mansion said julia catching only
 first sentence why so 
 orgies his midnight leisure are impure
and polluted at least so says rumour
pompeii
m
by ceres by pan and by cybele thou dost
but provoke my curiosity instead exciting my
fears returned wayward and pampered pompeian
 i will seek and question him his love if
to these orgies love be admitted why more
likely that he knows its secrets
nydia did not answer
i will seek him this very day resumed
julia nay why not this very hour 
at daylight and in his present state thou
hast assuredly less to fear answered nydia
yielding to her own sudden and secret wish to
learn if dark egyptian were indeed possessed
 those spells to rivet and attract love which
 thessalian had so often heard
and who would dare insult rich daughter
 diomed said julia haughtily i will go
may i visit thee afterwards to learn result
 asked nydia anxiously
kiss me for thy interest in julia's honour
answered lady yes assuredly this eve
we sup abroad come hither at same hour tomorrow
and thou shalt know all i may have to
employ thee too but enough for present
 
stay take this bracelet for new thought thou
hast inspired me with remember if thou serves
julia she is grateful and she is generous
i cannot take thy present said nydia jutting
aside bracelet but young as i am i
can sympathize unsought with those who love 
and love in vain
 mayest thou so returned julia thou
speakest like a free woman and thou shalt yet be
free farewell 
pompeii lis
chapter viii
julia seeks abates result that interview
arbaces was seated in a chamber which opened
on a kind balcony or portico that fronted his
garden his cheek was pale and worn with 
sufferings he had endured but his iron frame had
already recovered from severest effects that
accident which had frustrated his fell designs in 
moment victory air that came fragrantly
to his brow revived his languid senses and 
blood circulated more freely than it had done for
 through his shrunken veins
so then thought he storm fate
has broken and blown over evil which my
love predicted threatening life itself has chanced
and yet i live it came as stars foretold 
and now long bright and prosperous career
which was to succeed that evil if i survived it
 
smiles beyond i have passed i have subdued
 latest danger my destiny now i have but
to lay out gardens my future fate intensified
and secure first then all my pleasures 
even before that love shall come revenge 
this boy greek who has crossed my passion 
thwarted my designs baffled me even when 
blade was about to drink his accursed blood shall
not a second time escape me but for method
 my vengeance that let me ponder well 
oh ate if thou art indeed a goddess fill me
with thy fullest inspiration egyptian sank
into an intent reverie which did not seem to present
to him any clear or satisfactory suggestions
he changed his position restlessly as he revolved
scheme after scheme which no sooner occurred
than it was dismissed several times he struck his
breast and giowned aloud nth desire vengeance
and a sense his impotence to accomplish
it while thus absorbed a boy slave timidly
entered chamber
a female evidently rank from her dress
and that single slave who attended her
pompeii 
waited below and sought an audience with arfaces

a female his heart beat quick is she
young 
her face is concealed by her veil but her
form is slight yet round as that youth
admit her said egyptian for a moment
his vain heart dreamt stranger might be lone
 first glance visiter now entering 
apartment sufficed to undeceive so erring a fancy
true she was about same height as lone and
perhaps same age true she was finely and
richly formed but where was that undulating and
ineffable grace which accompanied every motion 
 peerless neapolitan chaste and decorous
garb so simple even in care its arrangement
 dignified yet bashful step majesty
 womanhood and its modesty 
pardon me that i rise with pain said arfaces
gazing on stranger i am still suffering
from recent illness
do not disturb thyself o great egyptian 
returned julia seeking to disguise fear she
 
already experienced beneath ready resort 
flattery and forgive an unfortunate female who
seeks consolation from thy wisdom
draw near fair stranger said arbaces and
speak without apprehension or reserve
julia placed herself on a seat beside egyptian
and wonderingly gazed round an apartment
whose elaborate and costly luxuries shamed even
 ornate enrichment her father's mansion 
fearfully too she regarded hieroglyphical inscriptions
on walls faces mysterious
images which at every corner gazed ukn her 
 tripod at a little distance and above all 
grave and remarkable countenance arbats
himself a long white robe like a veil half
covered his raven locks and flowed to his feet 
his face was made even more impressive by its
present paleness and his dark and penetrating
eyes seemed to pierce shelter her veil
and explore secrets her vain and unfeminine
soul
and what said his low deep voice brings thee
o maiden to house eastern stranger 
his fame replied julia
pompeii 
 in what said he with a strange and slight
smile
canst thou ask o wise arbaces is not foreknowledge
 very gossip theme pompeii 
some little lore have i indeed treasured up
replied arbaces but in what can such serious
and sterile secrets benefit ear beauty 
alas said julia a little cheered by accustomed
accents adulation does not sorrowfly
to wisdom for relief and they who love unrequited
are not they chosen victims grief 
ha said arbaces can unrequited love bethe
lot so fair a form whose modelled proportions
are visible even beneath folds thy
graceful robe deign o maiden to lift thy veil
that i may see at least if face correspond in
loveliness with form
not unwilling perhaps to exhibit her charms
and thinking they were likely to interest magician
in her fate jura after some slight hesitation
raised her veil and revealed a beauty ahich
but for art had been indeed attractive to fixed
gaze egyptian
thou comest to me for advice in unhappy love
 
said he well turn that face on ungrateful
one what other lovecharm can i give thee 
oh cease these comtestes said julia it
is a lovecharm indeed that i would ask from thy
skill 
fair stranger replied arbaces somewhat
scornfully lovespells are not among a portion 
 secrets i have wasted midnight oil to attain
is it indeed so then pardon me great arfaces
and farewell 
stay said arbaces who despite his passion
for lone was not unmoved by beauty his
visiter and had he been in flush a more
assured health might have attempted to console
 fair julia by other means than those supernatural
wisdom 
stay although i confess that i have left 
witchery philters and potions to those whose
trade is in such knowledge yet am i myself not so
dull to beauty but that in earlier youth i may have
employed them in my oati behalf i may give thee
advice at least if thou wilt be candid with me 
tell me then first art thou unmarried as thy dress
betokens 
pompeii

yes said julia
and being unblest with fortune wouldst thou
allure some wealthy suitor 
i am richer than he who disdains me
strange and more strange and thou lovest
him who loves not thee 
i know not if i love him answered julia
haughtily but i know that i would see myself
triumph over a rival i would see him who rejected
me my suitor i would see her whom he
has preferred in her turn despised
a natural ambition and a womanly said 
egyptian in a tone too grave for irony yet
more fair maiden wilt thou confide to me 
name thy lover can he be pompeian and
despise wealth even if blind to beauty
he is athens answered julia looking
downe
ha cried egyptian impetuously as 
blood rushed to his cheek there is but one
athenian young and noble in pompeii can it be
glaucus whom thou speakest 
ah betray me not so indeed they call him
 egyptian sunk back gazing vacantly on
 
 averted face merchant's daughter and
muttering inly to himself this conference with
which he had hitherto only trifled amusing himself
at credulity and vanity his visiter 
might it not minister to his revenge 
i see thou canst assist me not said julia
offended by his continued silence guard at
least my secret once more farewell 
maiden said egyptian in an earnest
and serious tone thy suit hath touched me
i i minister to thy will listen to me i
have not myself dabbled in these lesser mysteries
but i know one who hath at base 
vesuvius less than a league from city there
dwells a powerful witch beneath rank dews
 new moon she has gathered herbs which
possess virtue to chain love in eternal fetters
her art can bring thy lover to thy feet stk
her and mention to her name arbaocs 
she fears that name and will five thee her niost
extent philters
alas answered julia i know not road
to home her whom thou speakest 
way short though it be is long to tiaverse for
pompeii 
a girl who leaves unknown house her father
 country is entangled with wild vines
and dangerous with precipitous caverns i dare
not trust to mere strangers to guide me reputation
 women my rank is easily tarnished
and though i care not who knows that i love
glaucus i would not have it imagined that 
obtained his love by a spell
were i but three advanced in health
said egyptian rising and walking as if to
thy his strength across chamber but with
irregular and feeble steps i myself would accompany
thee well thou must avait
but glaucus is soon to wed that hated neapolitan
 
yes in early part next month
so soon art thou well advised this 
from lips her own slave
it shall not be said egyptian impetuously
 fear nothing glaucus shall be thine
yet how when thou obtained it canst thou
administer to him this potion 
my father has invited him and i believe 

 
neapolitan also to a banquet on day following
tomorrow shall then have opportunity to
administer it
so be it said egyptian with eyes flashing
such fierce joy that julia's gaze sank tremblingly
beneath them
tomorrow eve then order thy litter thou
hast one at thy command 
surely yes returned purseproud julia
order thy litter at two miles distance from
 city is a house entertainment frequented by
 wealthier pompeians from excellence 
its baths and beauty its gardens there
canst thou pretend only to shape thy course 
there ill or dying i will meet thee by statue
 silenus in copse that skirts garden 
and i myself mill guide thee to witch let
us wait till with evening star goats 
herdsman are gone to rest when dark twilight
conceals us and none shall cross our steps
go home and fear not by hades swears arfaces
 sorcerer egypt that lone shall never
wed with glaucus 
pompeii 
and that glances shall be hie added julia
filling up incomplete sentence
thou hast said it replied arbaces and
julia half frightened at this unhallowed appointment
but urged on by jealousy and pique 
rivalship even more than love resolved to fulfil it
left alone arbaces burst forth 
bright stars that never lie ye already begin
 execution your promises success in love
and victory over foes for rest my smooth
existence in very hour when my mind
could devise no clue to goal vengeance have
ye sent this fair fool for my guide he paused
in deep thought yes said he again but in a
calmer voice i could not myself have given to
her poison that shall be indeed a philter his
death might be thus tracked to my door but
 witch ay there is fit natural agent
 my designs 
he summoned one his slaves bade him hasten
to track steps julia and acquaint himself
with her name and condition this done he
stepped forth into portico skies were
serene and clear but he deeply read in signs

 their vaiioiis cliaiige beheld in one mass 
cloud far on horizon which wind began
slowly to agitate that a storm was brooding
above
it is like my vengeance said he as he gazed 
 sky is clear it cloud moves on
poripeii 
chapter ix
a storm in south witch's cavern
it was when heats noon died gradually
away from earth that glaucus and one went
forth to enjoy cooled and grateful air at
that time various carriages were in use among
romans one most used by richer
citizens when they required no companion in
their excursions was higa already described in
 early portion this work that appropriated
to matrons was termed ccnpentum which
had commonly taro wheels ancients used
also a sort litter a vast sedanchair more
commodiously arranged than modern inasmuch
as occupant thereof could lie doavn at
for public festivals and games they used one more luxurious
and costly called plenum with four wheels
 
ease instead being perpendicularly and stiffly
jostled np and down there was another carriage
used both for travelling and for excursions
in country it was commodious containing
three or four persons with ease having a covering
which could be raised at pleasure and in short
answering very much purpose though very
different in shape from modern brisk it
was a vehicle this description that lovers
accompanied by one female slave lone now
used in their excursion about ten miles from
 city there was at that day an old ruin 
remains a temple evidently grecian and as for
glaucus and lone everything grecian possessed
an interest they had agreed to visit these ruins 
it was thither they were now bound
theirroad lay among vines and olive groves till
winding more and more towards higher ground
 vesuvius path grew rugged mules
moved slowly and with labour and at every
opening in wood they beheld those grey and
horrent caverns indenting parched rock which
strabo has described but which various revolt
they had also xclla or sedan in which they sate as
we do
pompeii 
lotions time and volcano have removed from
 present aspect mountain sun
sloping towards his descent cast long and deep
shadows over mountain here and there they
still heard rustic reed shepherd amongst
copses beech wood and w wild oak sometimes
they marked form silkhaired and graceful
capella with its wreathing horn and bright grey
eye avhicli still beneath austrian skies recalls
 eclogues maro browsing halfway up 
hills and grapes already purple with 
smiles deepening summer glowed out from
 arched festoons which hung pendent from
tree to tree above them light clouds floated
in serene heavens sweeping so slowly athwart
 firmament that they scarcely seemed to stir
while on their right they caught ever and anon
glimpses waveless sea with some light
bark skimming its smface and sunlight
breaking over deep in those countless and
softest hues so peculiar to that delicious sea
how beautiful said glaucus in a halfwhispered
tone is that epithet by which we
call earth our mother with what a kindly and
 
equal love she pours her blessings upon her children 
and even to those sterile spots to which nature
has denied beauty she yet contrives to dispense
her smiles witness arbutus and vine
which she wreathes over arid and burning soil
 yon extinct volcano ah in such an hour
and scene as this well might we imagine that
 laughing face faun should peep forth
from those green festoons or that we might
trace steps mountain nymph through
 thickest mazes glade but 
nymphs ceased beautiful lone when thou wast
created
there is no tongue that flatters like a lover's
and yet in exaggeration his feelings flattery
seems to him commonplace strange and prodigal
exuberance which soon exhausts itself by overflowing
 they tell us that esteem which
follows passion is happier than passion itself it
may be true springs fancy hope 
ambition all urged into one channel return to
their natural streams love is a revolution there
is no harmony no order there is therefore no
settled happiness while it lasts but when re
pipei 
volution is over we are astonished at our past
frenzy we may love still we may le beloved 
but we are m love no more for my part i
think there are some kinds imperfect happiness
which are better than perfect take
away desire from heart and you take air
from earth
they arrived at ruins they examined
them with that fondness with which we trace 
hallowed and household vestiges our own ancestry
 they lingered there till hesperus appeared in
 rosy heavens and then returning homeward
in twilight they were more silent than they
had been for in shadow and beneath 
stars they felt more oppressively their mutual
love
it was at this time that storm which 
egyptian had predicted began to creep visibly over
them at first a low and distant thunder gave
warning approaching conflict elements
and then rapidly rushed above dark ranks 
 serried clouds suddenness storms in
that climate is something almost preternatural and
might well suggest to early superstition notion
 a divine agency a few laj'ge drops broke heavily
among boughs that half overhung their
path and then swift and intolerably bright 
forked lightning darted across their very eyes and
was swallowed up by encreasing darkness
swifter good carrucarius cried glaucus to
 driver tempest comes on apace
 slave urged on mules they went savift
over uneven and stony road clouds thickened
near and more near broke thunder and
fast rushed dashing rain
dost thou fear whispered glaucus as he
sought excuse in storm to come nearer to lone
not with thee said she softly
at that instant carriage fragile and illcontrived
as despite their graceful shapes were for
practical uses most such inventions at that time
struck violently into a deep rut over which
lay a log fallen wood driver with a curse
stimulated his mules yet faster for obstacle
 wheel was torn from socket and carriage
suddenly overset
glaucus quickly extricating himself from 
vehicle hastened to assist lone who was forts

lately unhurt with some difficulty they raised
 carrack or carriage and found that it ceased
any longer even to afford them shelter springs
that fastened covering were snapped asunder
and rain poured fast and fiercely into interior
in this dilemma what was to be done they
were yet some distance from city no house
no aid seemed near
there is said slave a smith about a
mile off i could seek him and he might fasten at
least wheel to carrack but jupiter how
 rain beats my mistress will be wet before i
come back
run thither at least said glaucus we
must find best shelter we can till you return
 lane was overshadowed with trees beneath
 amplest which glaucus drcav lone
he endeavoured by stripping his own cloak
to shield her yet more from rapid rain 
but it descended with a fury that broke through
all puny obstacles and suddenly while glaucus
was yet whispering courage to his beautiful charge
 lightning struck one trees immediately
before them and split with a mighty crash its
 
huge trunk in twain this awful incident apprised
them danger they braved in their present
shelter and glaucus looked anxiously round for
some less perilous place refuge we are
now said he halfway up ascent vesuvius
 there ought to be some cavern or hollow
in vineclad rocks could we but find it in
which deserting nymphs have left a shelters
while thus saying he moved from trees and
looking wistfully towards mountain discovered
through advancing gloom a red and tremulous
light at no considerable distance that must
come said he from hearth some shepherd
or vinedresser it ill guide us to some
hospitable retreat wilt thou stay here while
i yet no that would be to leave thee to
danger
i will go with you cheerfully said lone 
open as space seems it is better than 
treacherous shelter these boughs
half leading half carrying lone glaucus accompanied
by trembling slave advanced towards
 light which yet bmned blue and steadfastly
at length space was no longer open wild
pompeii 
vines entangled their steps and laid from them
save by imperfect intervals guiding beam
but faster and fiercer came rain and lightning
assumed its most deadly and blasting form 
they were still therefore impelled onward hoping
 if light eluded them to arrive at some
cottage or some friendly cavern vines grew
more and more intricate light was entirely
snatched from them but a narrow path which
they tiod with labour and pain guided only by
 constant and long lingering flashes storm
continued to lead them towards its direction 
rain ceased suddenly precipitous and rough crags
 scorched lava frowned before them rendered
more fearful by lightning that illumined 
dark and dangerous soil sometimes blaze
lingered over irongrey heaps scoria covered
in part with ancient mosses or stunted trees as
if seeking in vain for some gentler product earth
more worthy its ire and sometimes leaving 
whole that part scene in darkness 
lightning broad and sheeted hung redly over 
ocean tossing far below until its waves seemed
glowing into fire and so intense was blaze
 
that it brought vividly into view even sharp
outline more distant windings hay
from eternal museum with its lofty how to
 beautiful sorrentum and giant hills behind
our lovers stopped in perplexity and doubt when
suddenly as darkness that gloomed between
 fierce flashes lightning once more wrapped
them round they saw near but high before them
 mysterious light another blaze in which heaven
and earth were reddened made visible to them
 whole expanse no house was near but just
where they had beheld light they thought they
saw in recess a cavern outline a
human form darkness once more returned 
 light no longer paled beneath fires 
heaven burnt forth again they resolved to ascend
towards it they had to wind their way among
vast fragments stone here and there overhung
with wild bushes but they gained nearer and
nearer to light and at length they stood opposite
 mouth a kind cavern apparently
formed by huge splinters rock that had fallen
transversely athwart each other and looking into
pompeii 
 gloom each drew back involuntarily with a
superstitious fear and chill
a fire burned in far recess cave andover
it was a small caldron on a tall and thin
column iron stood a rude lamp over that
part wall at base which burned 
fire hung in many rows as if to dry a profusion
 herbs and weeds a fox couched before 
fire gazed upon strangers with its bright and
red eye its hair bristling and a low growl stealing
from between its teeth in centre cave
was an earthen statue which had three heads a
singular and fantastic cast they were formed by
 real skulls a dog a horse and a boar a
low tripod stood before this wild representation
 popular hecate
but it was not these appendages and appliances
 cave that thrilled blood those who
gazed fearfully therein it was face its inmate
before fire with light shining full
upon her features sate a woman considerable
age perhaps in no country are there seen so
many hags as in italy in no country does beauty
 
so awfully change iu age to hideousness most
appalling and revolting but old woman now
before them was not one these specimens 
 extreme human ugliness on contrary 
her countenance betrayed remains a regular
but high and aquiline order feature with
stony eyes turned upon them with a look that
met and fascinated theirs they beheld in that
fearful countenance very image a corpse 
 same glazed and lustreless regard 
blue and shrunken lips drawn and hollow
jaw dead lank hair a pale grey 
livid green ghastly skin which seemed all
surely tinged and tainted by grave 
it is a dead thing said glaucus
nay it stirs it is a ghost or larvae altered
lone as she clung to athenians breast
oh away away groaned slave it
is witch vesuvius
who are ye said a hollow and ghostly
voice and what do ye here 
 sound terrible and deathlike as it was 
suiting m'cll countenance speaker and
seeming rather voice some bodiless 

leer styx than having mortal would have
made lone shrink back into pitiless fury 
storm hut glaucus though not without some
misgiving drew her into cavern
we are stormbeaten wanderers from 
neighbouring city said he and decoyed hither
by yon light we crave shelter and comfort 
your hearth
as he spoke fox rose from giound and
advanced towards strangers showing from 
to its white teeth and deepening in its menacing
growl
down slave said witch and at 
sound her voice beast dropped at once
covering its face with its bush and keeping only
its quick vigilant eye fixed upon invaders 
its repose come to fire if ye will said
she turning to glaucus and his companions i
never welcome living thing save owl fox
 toad and viper so i cannot welcome ye 
but come to fire without welcome why stand
upon form 
 language in which hag addressed them
was a strange and barbarous latin interlarded
 
with many words some more rude and ancient
dialect she did not stir from her seat hut gazed
stonily upon them as glaucus now released lone
 her outer wrapping garments and making her
place herself on a log wood which was only
other seat he perceived at hand fanned with his
breath embers into a more elowino flame
 slave encouraged by boldness her superiors
divested herself also her long pallas and
crept timorously to opposite corner 
hearth
we disturb you i fear said silver voice
 lone in conciliation
 witch did not reply she seemed like one
who has awakened for a moment from dead
and then relapsed once more into eternal slumber

tell me said she suddenly and after a longpause
 are ye brother and sister 
no said lone blushing
are ye married 
not so replied glaucus
io lovers ha ha ha and witch
pompeii 
laughed so loud and so long that caverns rang
again
 heart lone stood still at that strange
mirth glaueus muttered a rapid counter spell to
 omen and slave turned as pale as 
cheek witch herself
why dost thou laugh old crone p said
glaueus somewhat sternly as he concluded his invocation

did i laugh said hag absently
she is in her dotage whispered glaueus 
as he said thus he caught glance 
hag who fixed upon him a malignant and vivid
glare
thou lies said she abruptly
thou art an uncourteous welcomer returned
glaueus
hush provoke her not dear glaueus i
whispered lone
i i tell thee why i laughed when i discovered
ye were lovers said old woman
it was because it is a pleasure to old and
withered to look upon young hearts like yours 
 
and to know time will come when ye will
loathe each other loathe loathe ha ha ha 
it was now ione's turn to pray against 
easing prophecy
zv advertise omen gods forbid said
she yet poor woman thou knowest little 
love or thou wouldst know that it never changes
was i young once think ye f returned 
hag quickly and am i old and hideous and
deathly now such as is form so is heart
with these words she sank again into a stillness
profound and fearful as if cessation life
itself
hast thou dwelt here long said glaucus 
after a pause feeling uncomfortably oppressed
beneath a silence so appalling
ah long yes
it is but a drear abode
ha thou mayst well say that hell is beneath
us i replied hag pointing her bony
finger to earth and i will tell thee a
secret dim things below are preparing wrath
for ye above you young and thoughtless
 and beautiful
pompeii 
thou interest but evil affords ill becoming 
hospitable said glaucus and in future i will
brave tempest rather than thy welcome
thou wilt do well none should ever seek
me save wretched 
and why wretchedness asked athenian
i am witch mountain replied 
sorceress with a ghastly grin my trade is to
give hope to hopeless for crossed in love i
have philters for avaricious promises treasure
 for malicious potions revenge for
 happy and good i have only what life
has curses trouble me no more
with this grim tenant cave relapsed
into a silence so obstinate and sullen that glaucus
in vain endeavoured to draw her into farther conversation
she did not evince by any alteration
 her locked and rigid features that she even
heard him fortunately however storm which
was brief as violent began now to relax 
rain grew less and less fierce and at as 
clouds parted moon burst forth in purple
opening heaven and streamed clear and full
into that desolate abode never had she shone
 
perhaps on a group more worthy painter's
art young all beautiful lone seated
by that rude fire her lover already forgetful 
 presence hag at her feet gazing upward
to her face and whispering sweet words 
 pale and affrighted slave at a little distance 
and ghastly hag resting her deadly eyes upon
them yet seemingly serene and fearless for 
companionship love hath such power were
these beautiful beings things another sphere
in that dark and unholy cavern aith its
gloomy quaintness appurtenance fox
regarded them from his corner with his keen and
glowing eye and as glaucus now turned towards
 avitcli he perceived for first time just
under her seat bright gaze and crested head
 a larqe snake whether it was that vivid
colouring athenian cloak thrown over 
shoulders lone attracted reptile's anger its
crest began to glow and rise as if menacing and
preparing itself to spring upon neapolitan 
glaucus caught quickly at one halfburned
logs upon hearth and as if enraged at 
action snake came forth from its shelter and
pompeii 
with a loud hiss raised itself on till its
height nearly approached that greek
witch cried glaucus command thy creature
or thou wilt see it dead
it has been despoiled its venom said 
witch aroused at his threat but ere words
had left her lip snake had sprung upon glaucus
quick and watchful agile greek leapt
lightly aside and struck so fell and dexterous a blow
on head snake that it fell prostrate and
writhing among embers fire
 hag sprang up and stood confronting
glaucus with a face which would have befitted
 fiercest furies so utterly dire and
wrathful was its expression yet even in horror
and ghastliness preserving outline and trace
 beauty and utterly free from that coarse grotesque
at which imaginations north have
sought source terror
thou hast said she in a slow and steady
voice which belied expression her face so
much was it passionless and calm thou hast
had shelter under my roof and warmth at my
hearth thou hast returned evil for good thou
 
hast smitten and haply slain thing that loved
me and was mine nay more creature above
all others consecrated to gods and deemed venerable
by man now hear thy punishment by
 moon who is guardian sorceress 
by orcus who is treasurer wrath i curse
thee and thou art curst iiay thy love be
blasted may thy name be blackened may 
infernal mark thee may thy heart wither and
scorch may thy hour recall to thee jn'o
plies voice sfrga vesuvius and thou
she added turning sharply towards lone and
raising her right arm when glaucus burst impetuously
on her speech
hag cried he forbear jnle thou hast
cursed and i commit myself to gods i defy
and scorn thee but breathe but one mord against
yon maiden and i will convert oath on thy
foul lips to thy dying groan beware 
i have done replied hag laughing
wildly for in thy doom is she who loves thee
accursed and not less that i heard her lips
a peculiar sanctity was attached by romans as indeed
by perhaps every ancient people to serpents wliicli they kept
tame in their houses and often introduced at their meals
pipeii 
breathe thy name and know by what word to
commend thee to daemons glaucus thon
art doomed so saying witch turned from
 athenian and kneeling down beside her
wounded favourite which she dragged from 
hearth she turned to them her face no more
o glaucus said lone greatly terrified 
what have we done let us hasten from this
place storm has ceased good mistress
forgive him recall thy words he meant but to
defend himself accept this peaceoffering to unsay
 said f and lone stooping placed her purse on
 hag's lap
away said she bitterly away 
oath once woven fates only can untie 
away r
come dearest said glaucus impatiently
thickest thou that gods above us or below
hear impotent ravings dotage come i
long and loud rang echoes cavern
with dread laugh saga she deigned no
farther reply
 lovers breathed more freely when they
gained open air yet scene they had witvol
ii h
 
hissed words and hiughter witch 
still fearfully dwelt with lone and even glaucus
could not thoroughly shake oif impression they
bequeathed storm had subsided save now
and then a low thunder muttered at distance
amidst darker clouds or a momentary flash 
lightning affronted sovereignty moon
with some difficulty they regained road 
where they found vehicle already sufficiently
repaired for their departure and carrucarius
calling loudly upon hercules to tell him where his
charge had vanished
glaucus vainly endeavoured to cheer exhausted
spirits lone and scarce less vainly to
recover elastic tone his own natural gaiety
they soon arrived before gate city as
it opened to them a litter borne by slaves impeded
 way
it is too late for egress cried sentinel to
 inmate litter
not so said a voice which lovers started
to hear it was a voice they well recognized i
am bound to villa jniarcus polybius i shall
return shortly i am barbados egyptian
pompeii 
 scruples him gate were removed
and litter passed close beside carriage that
bore lovers
arbaces at this hour scarce recovered too
methinks whither and for what can he leave 
city said glaucus
alas replied lone bursting into tears my
soul feels still more and more omen evil
preserve us o ye gods or at least she murmured
inly preserve my glaucus 

chapter x
x'he lord burning belt and airs minion
fate writes her prophecy in red letters but
who shall read them
arbaces had tarried only till cessation 
 tempest allowed him under cover night to
seek saga vesuvius borne by those his
trustier slaves in avliom in all more secret expeditions
he was accustomed to confide he lay extended
along his litter and resigning his sanguine
heart to contemplation vengeance gratified
and love possessed slaves in so short a journey
moved very little slower than ordinary
pace mules and arbaces soon arrived at 
commencement a narrow path which lovers
had not been fortunate enough to discover but
which skirting thick vines led at once to 
habitation witch here he arrested 
pompeii 
litter and bidding his slaves conceal themselves
and vehicle among vines from observation
 any chance passenger he mounted alone
with steps still feeble but supported by a long
staff drear and sharp ascent
not a drop rain fell from tranquil heaven
but moisture dripped mournfully from 
laden boughs vine and now and then collected
in tiny pools in crevices and hollows 
 rocky way
strange passions these for a philosopher
thought arbaces that lead one like me just new
from bed death and lapped even in health
amidst roses luxury across such nocturnal
paths as this but passion and vengeance treading
to their goal can make an elysium a
tartarus high clear and melancholy shone
 moon above road that dark wayfarer
glassing herself in every pool that lay before
him and sleeping in shadow along sloping
mount he saw before him same light
that had guided steps his intended victims
but no longer contrasted by blackened clouds
 it shone less redly clear
 
he paused as at length lie approached 
mouth cavern to recover breath and then
with his wonted collected and stately mien he
crossed unhallowed threshold
 fox sprang up at ingress this newcomer
and by a long howl announced another
visiter to his mistress
 witch had resumed her seat and her aspect
 gravelike and grim repose by her feet upon a
bed dry weeds which half covered it lay 
wounded snake but quick eye egyptian
caught its scales glittering in reflected
light opposite fire as it writhed now contracting
now lengthening its folds in pain and
unsated anger
down slave said witch as before to
 fox and as before animal dipopped to 
ground mute but vigilant
rise servant nox and erebus said arfaces
commandingly a superior in thine art
salutes thee rise and welcome him
at these words hag turned her gaze upon
 egyptian's towering form and dark features
she looked long and fixedly upon him as he stood
pompeii 
before her in his oriental robe and folded arms
and steadfast and haughty brow who art
thou she said at that tallest thyself greater
in art than saga burning fields and
 daughter perished etruriann race 
i am he answered arbaces from whom
all cultivators magic from north to south from
east to west from ganges and nile to 
vales thessaly and shores yellow
tiber have stooped to learn
there is but one such man in these places
answered witch whom men outer
world unknowing his higher attributes and more
secret fame call arbaces egyptian to us a
higher nature and deeper knowledge his rightful
appellation is hermes burning girdle
look again returned arbaces i am he
as he spake he drew aside his robe and revealed
a cincture seemingly fire that burnt around his
waste clasped in centre by a plate wherein was
engraved some sign apparently vague and unintelligible
but which was evidently not unknown to
 saga she rose hastily and threw herself at
 feet arbaces i have seen then said she
 
in a voice deep humility lord 
mighty girdle vouchsafe my homage
rise said egyptian i have need 
thee
so saying he placed himself on that same log 
vvood on which lone had rested before and motioned
to witch to resume her seat
thou sayest said he as she obeyed that
thou art a daughter ancient etruriann tribes 
 mighty walls whose rockbuilt cities yet
frown above robber race that hath seized upon
their ancient reign partly came those tribes
from greece partly were they exiles from a more
burning and primeval soil in either case art
thou egyptian lineage for grecian masters
 aboriginal helot were among restless
sons nile banished from her bosom equally
then o saga i art thou ancestors that swore
allegiance to mine own by birth as by knowledge
art thou subject arbaces hear me then
and obey 
 witch bowed her head
 etruria it may be superfluous to mention were
celebrated for their enchantments
pompeii
whatever art we possess in sorcery continued
arbaces we are sometimes driven to natural
means to attain our object ring and 
crystal ashes and herbs do not give
herring divinations neither do higher mysteries
 moon yield even possessor 
girdle a dispensation from necessity employing
ever and anon human measures for a
human object mark me then thou art deeply
skilled methinks in secrets more deadly
herbs thou knowest those which arrest life which
burn and scorch soul from out her citadel or
freeze channels young blood into that ice
which no sun can melt do i overrate thy skill 
speak and truly v
mighty hermes such lore is indeed mine own
deign to look at these ghostly and corpselike features
 they have waned from hues life
merely by watching over rank herbs which
simmer night and day in yon caldron
 egyptian moved his seat from so unblest
or so unhealthful a vicinity as witch spoke
aitxtuxoficcyriix f kutdxofiavrtia
 
it is well said he thou hast learnt that
maxim all deeper knowledge which saith 
despise body to make wise mind but
to thy task there corinth to thee by tomorrow's
starlight a vain maiden seeking thine art a
love charm to fascinate from another eyes that
should utter but soft tales to her own instead
 thy philters give maiden one thy most
powerful poisons let lover breathe his vows
to shades
 witch trembled from head to foot
oh pardon pardon dread master said she
falteringly but this i dare not law in
these cities is sharp and vigilant they will seize
they will slay me
for what purpose then thy herbs and thy
potions vain saga said arbaces sneeringly
 witch hid her loathsome face with her hands
oh years ago said she in a voice unlike her
usual tones so plaintive was it and so soft i
was not thing that i am now i loved i fancied
myself beloved
and what connection hath thy love witch
with my commands said arbaces impetuously
pompeii 
patience resumed witch patience i
implore i love j another and less fair than i 
yes by nemesis less fair allied from me my
chosen i was that dark etruriann tribe to
whom most all were known secrets 
gloomier magic my mother was herself a saga 
she shared resentment her child from her
hands i received potion that was to restore me
his love and from her also poison that was
to destroy my rival oh crush me dread walls 
my trembling hands mistook phials my lover
fell indeed at my feet but dead dead since
then what has been life to me i became suddenly
old i devoted myself to sorceries my
race still by an irresistible impulse i curse myself
with an awful penance still i seek most noxious
herbs still i concoct poisons still i imagine
that i am to give them to my hated rival still i
pour them into phial still i fancy that they
shall blast her beauty to dust still i wake and
see quivering body foaming lips glazing
eyes my aldus murdered and by me
 skeleton frame avitch shook beneath
strong convulsions
 
arbaces gazed upon her with a curious though
contemptuous eye
and this foul thing has yet human emotions
thought he she still cowers over ashes 
same fire that consumes arbaces such are we all 
mystic is tie those mortal passions that
unite greatest and least
he did not reply till she had somewhat recovered
herself and now sate rocking herself to and fro
in her seat with glassy eyes fixed on opposite
flame and large tears rolling down her livid
cheeks
a grievous tale is thine in truth said arfaces
 but these emotions are fit only for our
youth age should harden our hearts to all things
but ourselves as every year adds a scale to 
shellfish so should each year wall and encrust
 heart think those frenzies no more 
and now listen to me again by revenge
that was dear to thee i command thee to obey
me it is for vengeance that i seek thee this
youth whom i would sweep from my path has
crossed me despite my spells this thing purple
and broidery smiles and glances soulless
rompeir 
and mindless with no charm but that beauty
accursed be it this insect this glaucus i
tell thee by orcus and by nemesis he must
die
and working himself up at every word 
egyptian forgetful his debility his strange
companion everything but his own vindictive
rage strode with large and rapid steps gloomy
cavern
glaucus saidst thou mighty master said
 witch abruptly and her dim eye glared at
 name with all that fierce resentment at 
memory small affronts so common amongst 
solitary and shunned
ay so he is called but what matter 
name let it not be heard as that a living
man three from this date 
hear me said witch breaking from a
short reverie into which she was plunged after
this sentence egyptian hear me 
i am thy thing and thy slave spare me if i give
to maiden thou speakest that which would
destroy life glaucus t shall be surely detected
 dead ever find avengers nay dread
 
man if thy visit to me be tracked if thy hatred
to glaucus be known thou mayest have need 
thy archest magic to protect thyself
ha said arbaces stopping suddenly short
and as a proof that blindness with which
passion darkens eyes even most acute 
this was first time when risk that he
himself run by this method vengeance had
occurred to a mind ordinarily wary and circumspect
but continued witch if instead that
which shall arrest heart i give that which
shall sear and blast brain which shall make
him who quaffs it unfit for uses and career 
life an abject raving benighted thing smiting
sense to drivelling youth to dotage will not thy
vengeance be equally sated thy object equally
attained 
oh witch no longer servant but 
sister equal arbaces how much brighter
is woman's wit even in vengeance than ours how
much more exquisite than death is such a doom 
and continued hag gloating over her
fell scheme in this is but little danger for by
ten thousand methods which men forbear to seek
pompeii 
can our victim become mad he may have been
among vines and seen a nymph or vine
itself may have had same effect lia ha i
they never inquire too scrupulously into these
matters in which gods may be agents and
let worst arrive let it be known that it is a
lovecharm why madness is a common effect 
philters and even fair she that gave it finds
indulgence in excuse mighty hermes have
i ministered to thee cunningly
thou shalt have twenty years longer date for
thisbe returned arbaces i will write anew 
epoch thy fate on face pale stars 
thou shalt not serve in vain master 
flaming belt and here saga carve thee out 
by these golden tools a warmer cell in this dreary
cavern one service to me shall countervail a thousand
divinations by sieve and shears in gaping
rustics so saying he cast upon floor a
heavy purse which clinked not unmusically to 
ear hag who loved consciousness 
possessing means to purchase comforts she
to see a nymph was to become mad according to classic and
popular superstition
 op
disdained farewell said arbaces fail not
outwatch stars in concocting thy beverage 
thou shalt lord it over thy sisters at walnuttree
when thou tallest them that thy patron and
thy friend is hermes egyptian tomorrow
night we meet again
he stayed not to hear valediction or 
thanks avitch with a quick step he passed
into moonlit air and hastened down 
mountain
 witch who followed his steps to threshold
stood long at entrance cavern 
gazing fixedly on his receding form and as 
sad moonlight streamed upon her shadowy form
and deathlike face emerging from dismal
rocks it seemed as if one gifted indeed by supernatural
magic had escaped from dreary orcus 
and foremost its ghostly throng stood at its
black portals vainly summoning his return or
vainly sighing to rejoin him hag then slowly
 celebrated and immemorial rendezvous witches
at benevento winged serpent attached to it long an object
 idolatry in those parts was probably consecrated by egyptian
superstitions
pompeii 
reentering cave picked groaningly up heavy
purse took lamp from its stand and passing
 remotest depth her cell a black and
abrupt passage which was not visible save at a
near approach closed round as it was with jutting
and sharp crags yawned before her she went
several yards along this gloomy path which sloped
gradually downwards as if towards bowels 
 earth and lifting a stone deposited her treasure
in a hole beneath which as lamp pierced
its secrets seemed already to contain coins 
various value wrung from credulity or gratitude
 her visitors
i love to look at you said she apostrophizing
 monies for when i see you i feel that i am
indeed power and i am to have twenty years
longer life to increase your store o thou great
hermes 
she replaced stone and continued her path
onward for some paces when she stopped before a
deep irregular fissure in earth here as she
bent strange rumbling hoarse and distant sounds
might be heard while ever and anon with a loud
and grating noise which to use a homely but 
 
ful simile seemed to resemble grinding steel
upon wheels volumes steaming and dark smoke
issued forth and rushed spirally along 
cavern
 shades are noisier than their wont said
 hag shaking her grey locks and looking into
 cavity she beheld far down glimpses a
long streak light intensely but darkly red
strange she said shrinking back it is only
within two that dull deep light hath
been visible what can it portend 
 fox who had attended steps his fell
mistress uttered a dismal howl and ran cowering
back to inner cave a cold shuddering seized
 hag herself at cry animal which
causeless as it seemed superstitions time
considered deeply ominous she muttered her
placatory charm and tottered back into her
cavern where amidst her herbs and incantations
she prepared to execute orders egyptian
he called me dotard said she as smoke
curled from hissing caldron when jaws
drop and grinders fall and heart scarce
beats it is a pitiable thing to dote but when
pompeii 
she added with a savage and exulting grin 
young and beautiful and strong are suddenly
smitten into idiocy ah that is terrible 
burn flame simmer herb swelter toad i cursed
him and he shall be cursed 
on that night and at same hour which witnessed
 dark and unholy interview between
arbaces and saga apsecides was baptised
 
chapter xl
events progress plot thickens web is
woven blt net changes hands
and you have courage then julia to
seek witch vesuvius this evening in company
too with that fearful man 
why nydia replied julia timidly dost
thou really think there is anything to dread 
these old hags with their enchanted mirrors 
their trembling sieves and their moongathered
herbs are i imagine but crafty impostors who
have learnt perhaps nothing but very charm
for which i apply to their skill and which is
drawn but from knowledge fiefs herbs
and simples wherefore should i dread 
dost thou not fear thy companion 
what arbaces by dean i never saw
pompeii 
lover more courteous than that same magician 
and were he not so dark he would be even
handsome
blind as she was nydia had penetration to
perceive that julia's mind was not one that 
gallantries arbaces were likely to terrify she
therefore dissuaded her no more but nursed in
her excited heart wild and encreasing desire
to know if sorcery had indeed a spell to fascinate
love to love
let me go with thee noble julia said she
at length my presence is no protection but t
should like to be beside thee to 
thine offer pleases me much replied 
daughter diomed yet how canst thou contrive
it we may not return until late they will
miss thee
lone is indulgent replied nydia if thou
wilt permit me to sleep beneath thy roof i will say
that thou an early patroness and friend hast invited
me to pass day with thee and sing thee
my thessalian songs her courtesy will readily
grant to thee so light a boon
nay ask for thyself said haughty
 op
julia stoop to request no favour from 
neapolitan v
well be it so i will take my leave now 
make my request which i know will be readily
granted and return shortly
do so and thy bed shall be prepared in my
own chamber
with that nydia left fair pompeian
on her way back to lone she was met by 
chariot glaucus on nhose fiery and surveying
steeds was riveted gaze crowded street
he kindly stopped for a moment to speak to 
flower girl
blooming as thine own roses my gentle nydia
and how is thy fair mistress recovered i
trust from effects storm
i have not seen her this morning answered
nydia but
but what draw back horses are too
near thee
but think you lone will permit me to pass 
day with julia daughter diomed she wishes
it and was kind to me when i had few friends
pompeii 
 gods bless thy grateful heart i will answer
for ione's permission
then i may stay over night and return tomorrow
 said nydia shrinking from praise
she so little merited
as thou and fair julia please commend me
to her and liarkye nydia when thou hearest
her speak note contrast her voice with that
 silvertoned lone fate
his spirits entirely recovered from effect 
 past night his locks weaving in wind 
his joyous and elastic heart bounding with every
spring his parthian steeds a very prototype 
his country's god full youth and love 
glaucus was borne rapidly to his mistress
enjoy while ye may present who can read
 future 
as evening darkened julia reclined within
her litter which was capacious enough also to admit
her blind companion took her way to rural
baths indicated by arbaces to her natural levity
 disposition her enterprise brought less terror
than pleasurable excitement above all she
 
glowed at thought her coming triumph over
 hated neapolitan
a small but gay group was collected round 
door villa as her litter passed by it to 
private entrance baths apportioned to 
women
methinks by this dim light said one 
 bysanders i recognize slaves 
diomed
true clodius said sallust it is probably
 litter his daughter julia she is rich my
friend why dost thou not proffer thy suit to her
why i had once hoped that glaucus would
have married her she does not disguise her attachment
 and then as he gambles freely and with
illsuccess 
 sesterces would have passed to thee wise
clodius a wife is a good thing when it belongs
to another man 
but continued clodius as glaucus is i
understand to wed neapolitan i think i must
even try my chance with rejected maid after
all lamp hymen will be gilt and vessel
will reconcile one to odour flame
pompeii vigo
i shall only protest my sallust against diomedes
making thee trustee to his daughter's fortune
ha ha let us within my commission 
wine and garlands wait us
dismissing her slaves to that part house
set apart for their entertainment julia entered 
baths with nydia and declining offers 
attendants passed by a private door into garden
behind
she comes by appointment be sure said one
 slaves
what is that to thee said a superintendant
sourly she pays for baths and does not waste
 saffron such appointments are best part
 trade hark do you not hear widow
fulvia clapping her hands run fool run 
julia and nydia avoiding more public part
 garden arrived at place specified by 
egyptian in a small circular plot grass 
stars gleamed upon statue silenus 
it was an ancient roman law that no one should make a
woman his heir this law was evaded by parent's assigning
his fortune to a friend in trust for his daughter but trustee
might keep it if he liked law had however fallen into
disuse before date this story

merry god reclined upon a fragment rock 
 lynx bacchus at his feet and over his
mouth he held with extended arm a bunch 
grapes which he seemingly laughed to welcome
ere he devoured
i see not magician said julia looking
round when as she spoke egyptian slowly
emerged from neighbouring foliage and 
light fell palely over his sweeping robes
salve sweet maiden but ha whom hast
thou here we must have no companions 
it is but blind flower girl wise magician
replied julia herself a thessalian
oh nydia said egyptian i know
her well
nydia drew back and shuddered
thou hast been at my house methinks said
he approaching his voice to nydia's ear thou
knowest oath silence and secrecy now as
then or beware 
yet he added musingly to himself why confide
more than is necessary even in blind 
julia canst thou trust thyself alone with me bepompeii

lieve me magician is less formidable than he
seems
as he spoke he gently clreav julia aside
 witch loves not many visitors at once
said he leave nydia here till your return she
can be no assistance to us and for protection 
your own beauty suffices your own beauty and
your own rank yes julia i know thy name and
birth come trust thyself with me fair rival 
 youngest naiads 
 vain julia was not as we have seen easily
affrighted she was moved by flattery arfaces
and she readily consented to suffer nydia
to await her return nor did nydia press her
presence at sound egyptian's voice
all her terror him seemed to return she felt a
sentiment pleasure at learning she was not to
travel in his companionship
she returned to house and in one 
private chambers waited their return many and
bitter were thoughts this wild ffirl as she
sate there in her eternal darkness she thought
 her own desolate fate far from her native land

far from land cares that once assuaged 
april sorrows childhood deprived light
 day with none but strangers to guide her steps
accursed by one soft feeling her heart 
loving and without hope save dim and unholy
ray which shot across her mind as her thessalian
fancies questioned force spells and 
gifts magic 
nature had soavn in heart this poor girl
 seems virtue never destined to ripen 
lessons adversity are not always salutary sometimes
they soften and amend but as often they indurate
and pervert if we consider ourselves more
harshly treated by fate than those around us and
do not acknowledge in our own deeds equity 
 severity we become too apt to deem 
world our enemy to case ourselves in defiance
to wrestle against our softer self and to indulge
 darker passions which are so easily fermented
by sense injustice sold early into
slavery sentenced to a sordid taskmaster exchanging
her situation only yet more to embitter
her lot kindlier feelings naturally profuse in
 breast nydia were nipped and blighted
pompeii 
her sense right and wrong was confused by a
passion to which she had so madly surrendered
herself and same intense and tragic emotions
which we read in women classic age 
a pyrrha a medea which hurried and savept
away whole soul when once delivered to love 
ruled and rioted in her breast
time passed a light step entered chamber
where nydia yet indulged her gloomy meditations

o thanked be immortal gods said julia
i have returned i have left that terrible cavern 
come nydia let us away forthwith 
it was not till they were seated in litter
that julia again spoke
oh said she tremblingly such a scene 
such fearful incantations and dead face 
hag but let us talk not it i have obtained
 potion she pledges its effect my rival
shall be suddenly indifferent to his eye and i
i alone idol glaucus 
glaucus exclaimed nydia
ay i told thee girl at first that it was not
 athenian whom i loved but i see now that
 
i may trust thee wholly it is beautiful
greek 
what then were nydia's emotions she had
connived she had assisted in tearing glaucus from
lone but only to transfer by all power 
magic his affections yet more hopelessly to another
her heart swelled almost to suffocation she gasped
for breath in darkness vehicle julia
did not perceive agitation her companion 
she went on rapidly dilating on promised effect
 her acquisition and on her approaching triumph
over lone every now and then abruptly digressing
to horror scene she had quitted
 unmoved mien arbaces and his authority
over dreadful saga
meanwhile nydia recovered her selfpossession 
a thought flashed across her she slept in 
chamber julia she might possess herself 
potion
they arrived at house diomed and descended
to julia's apartment where nights repast
awaited them
drink nydia thou must be cold air alas
chill tonight as for mo my veins are yet ice
pompeii 
and julia unhesitatingly quaffed deep draughts
 spiced wine
thou hast potions said nydia let me
hold it in my hands how small phial is 
what colour is draught 
clear as crystal replied julia as she retook
 philter thou couldst not tell it from this
water witch assures me it is tasteless small
though phial it suffices for a life's fidelity it is
to be poured into any liquid and glaucus will
only know what he has quaffed by effects
exactly like this water in appearance 
yes sparkling and colourless as this how
bright it seems it is as very essence moonlit
dews bright thing how thou shines on my
hopes through thy crystal vase 
and how is it sealed 
but by one little stopper withdraw it now 
 draught gives no odour strange that that
which speaks to neither sense should thus command
all 
is effect instantaneous 
usually but sometimes it remains dormant
for a few hours
 
o hoar sweet this perfume said nydia
suddenly as she took up a small bottle on 
table and bent over its fragrant contents
thickest thou so bottle is set with gems
 some value thou wouldst not have bracelet
yester morn wilt thou take bottle 
it ought to be such perfumes as these that
should remind one who cannot see generous
julia if bottle be not too costly 
oh i have a thousand costlier ones take it
child 
nydia bowed her gratitude and placed 
bottle in her vest
and draught would be equally efficacious
whoever administers it 
if most hideous hag beneath sun
bestowed it such is its asserted virtue that
glaucus would deem her beautiful and none but
her 
julia warmed by wine and reaction her
spirits was now all animation and delight she
laughed loud and talked on a hundred matters
nor was it till niffht had advanced far topompeii

wards morning that she summoned her slaves
and undressed
when they were dismissed she said to nydia 
i will not suffer this holy draught to quit my
presence till hour comes for its uses lie
under my pillow bright spirit and give me happy
dreams 
so saying she placed potion under her
pillow nydia's heart beat violently
why dost thou drink that unmixed water
nydia take wine by its side
i am fevered replied blind girl and 
water cools me i will place this bottle by my
bedside it refreshes in these summer nights avhen
 dews sleep fall not on our lips fair julia
i must leave thee avery early so lone bids 
perhaps before thou art awake accept therefore
now my congratulations
thanks when next we meet you may find
glaucus at my feet
they had reteed to their couches and julia
worn out by excitement day soon slept 
but anxious and burning thoughts rolled over 
mind wakeful thessalian she listened to
 calm breathing julia and her ear accustomed
to finest shades sound speedily assured
her deep slumber her companion
now befriend me venus i said she softly
she rose gently and poured perfume from
 gift julia upon marble floor she rinsed
it several times carefully with water that was
beside her and then easily finding bed 
julia for night to her was as day she pressed
her trembling hand under pillow and seized
 potion julia stirred not her breath regularly
fanned burning cheek blind
girl nydia then opening phial poured its
contents into bottle which easily contained
them and then refilling former reservoir 
potion with that limpid water which julia had
assured her it so resembled she once more placed
 phial in its former place she then stole
again to her couch and waited with what
thoughts dawning day
 sun had risen julia slept still nydia
noiselessly dressed herself placed her treasure

pompeii 
carefully in her vest took up her stair and
hastened to quit house
 porter medon saluted her kindly as she
descended steps that led to street she
heard him not her mind was confused and lost in
 whirl tumultuous thought each thought a
passion she felt pure morning air upon her
cheek but it cooled not her scorching veins
glaucus she murmured all lovecharms
 wildest magic could not make thee love
me as i love thee lone ah away hesitation 
away remorse glaucus my fate is in thy smile
and thine o hope o joy transport i this
fate is in these hands

a page influence evil eye
this superstition to which i have more than once alluded
throughout this work still flourishes in magna brescia with
scarcely diminished vigour i remember conversing at naples
with a lady highest rank and intellect and information
very uncommon amongst noble italians either sex when i
suddenly observed her change colour and make a rapid and singular
motion with her finger my god that man she
whispered tremblingly
what man 
see count he has just entered
he ought to be much flattered to cause such emotion doubtless
he has been one signora's admirers
admirer heaven forbid he has evil eye his look
fell full upon me something dreadful will certainly happen
i see nothing remarkable in his eyes
so much worse danger is greater for being disguised
he is a terrible man time he looked upon
my husband it was at cards and he lost half his income at a
sitting his illluck was miraculous count met my little
boy in gardens and poor child broke his arm that evening
oh what shall i do something dreadful will certainly
happen and heavens he is admiring my cap 
does every one find eyes count equally fatal and
his admiration equally exciting 
every one he is universally dreaded and what is very
strange he is so angry if he sees you avoid him 
pompeii 
that is very strange indeed wretch 
at naples superstition works well for jewellers so
many charms and talismans as they sell for ominous fascination
 malocchio in pompeii talismans were equity
numerous but not always so elegant a shape nor so decorous
a character but generally speaking a coral ornament
was as it now is among favourite averted evil influence
 thebes about pontus were supposed to have an
hereditary claim to this charming attribute and could even kill
grownup men with a glance as for africa wheie belief also
still exists certain families could not only destroy children but
wither up trees they did this not with curses but praises in
our time politicians have often possessed this latter faculty and
 moment they take to praising an institution it is time to
pray god for it malus oculus was not always different
from eyes other people but persons especially 
fairer sex with double pupils to organ were above all to be
shunned and dreaded syrians were said to possess this
fatal deformity in all countries even in north eye
has ever been held chief seat fascination but nowadays
ladies with a single pupil manage work destruction pretty
easily so much do we improve upon our forefathers

chapter i
reflections on zeal early christians 
two mien come to a perilous resolve walls have
ears particularly sacred walls 
whoever regards early history christianity
will perceive how necessary to its triumph
was that fierce spirit zeal which fearing no
danger accepting no compromise inspired its
champions and sustained its martyrs in a dominant
church genius intolerance betrays its
cause in a weak and a persecuted church 
same genius mainly supports it was necessary
to scorn to loathe to abhor creeds other
men in order to conquer temptations which
they presented it was necessary rigidly to believe
not only that gospel was true faith but
 sole true faith that saved in order to nerve
 
 disciple to austerity its doctrine and to
encourage him to sacred and perilous chivalry
 converting polytheist and heathen
 sectarian sternness which confined virtue and
heaven to a chosen few which saw demons in
other gods and penalties hell in another
religion made believer naturally anxious to
convert all to whom he felt ties human
affection and circle thus traced by benevolence
to man was yet more widened by a desire
for glory god it was for honour 
 christian faith that christian boldly forced
his tenets upon scepticism some repugnance
 others sage contempt philosopher
 pious shudder people his very
intolerance supplied him with his fittest instruments
 success and soft heathen began at
 to imagine there must indeed be something
holy in a zeal wholly foreign to his experience
which stopped at no obstacle dreaded no danger
and even at torture or on scaffold referred
a dispute far other than calm differences 
speculative philosophy to tribunal an eter
pompeii 
nal judge it was thus that same fervour
which made christian middle aofe a
bigot without mercy made christian 
early a hero without fear
 these more fiery daring and earnest natures
not least ardent was olinthus no sooner
had appetites been received by rites baptism
into bosom church than 
nazarene hastened to make him conscious 
 impossibility to retain office and robes
 priesthood he could not it was evident
profess to worship god and continue even
outwardly to honour idolatrous altars 
fiend
nor was this all sanguine and impetuous
mind olinthus beheld in power appetites
 means divulging to deluded people 
juggling mysteries oracular isis he thought
heaven had sent this instrument its design in
order to disabuse eyes crowd and prepare
 way perchance for conversion a
whole city he did not hesitate then to appeal to
all newkindled enthusiasm appetites to
 
arouse his courage and to stimulate his zeal
they met according to previous agreement 
evening after baptism appetites in 
grove cybele which we have before described
at next solemn consultation oracle
said olinthus as he proceeded in warmth 
his address advance yourself to railing
proclaim aloud to people deception they
endure invite them to enter to be themselves 
witness gross but artful mechanism imposture
thou hast described to me fear not 
 lord who protected daniel shall protect
thee we community christians will be
amongst crowd we will urge on shrinking
 and in first flush popular indignation
and shame i myself upon those very
altars will plant palmbranch typical 
gospel and to my tongue shall descend rushing
spirit living god
heated and excited as he was this suggestion
was not unpleasing to appetites he was rejoiced
at so early an opportunity distinguishing his
faith in his new sect and to his holier feelings
pompeii 
were added those a vindictive loathing at 
imposition he had himself suffered and a desire to
avenge it in that sanguine and elastic overboard
 obstacles a necessary blindness to all who undertake
venturous and lofty actions neither olinthus
nor proselyte perceived all difficulties
to success their scheme avliich might be
found in reverent superstition people
themselves who would probably be loath before
 sacred altars great egyptian goddess to
believe even testimony her priest against her
power
appetites then assented to this proposal with a
readiness which delighted olinthus they parted
m'ith understanding that olinthus should
confer with more important his christian
brethren on this great enterprise should receive
their advice and assurances their support
on eventful day it so chanced that one 
 festivals isis was to be held on second
day after this conference festival proffered a
ready occasion for design they appointed
to meet once more on next evening at 
 
same spot and in that meeting was finally to be
settled order and details disclosure for
 following day
it happened that latter part this conference
had been held near sacellum or small
chapel which i have described in earlier part
 this work and so soon as forms 
christian and priest had disappeared from 
grove a dark and ungainly figure emerged from
behind chapel
i have tracked you with some effect my brother
flamen said eavesdropper you 
priest isis have not for mere idle discussion
conferred with this gloomy christian alas that
i could not hear all your precious plot enough i
find at least that you meditate revealing sacred
mysteries and that tomorrow you meet again at
this place to plan how and when may
osiris sharpen my ears then to detect whole 
your unheardof audacity when i have learnt
more i must confer at once with arbaces we
will frustrate you my friends deep as you think
pompeii 
yourselves at present my breast is a loekecl
treasury your secret
so saying calenus for it was he wrapped his
robe round him and strode thoughtfully homeward

 
chapter ii
a classic host cook and kitchen apiecides seeks
lone their conversation
it was then day for diomedes banquet to
 most select his friends graceful
glaucus beautiful lone official pansa 
highborn clodius immortal fulvius exquisite
lepidus epicure sallust were not 
only honoured his festival he expected also an
invalid senator from rome a man considerable
repute and favour at court and a great warrior
from herculaneum who had fought with titus
against jews and having enriched himself
prodigiously in wars was always told by his
friends that his country was eternally indebted
to his disinterested exertions i party howpompeii

ever extended to a yet greater number for
although critically speaking it was at one time
thought inelegant among romans to entertain
less than three or more than nine at their
banquets yet this rule was easily disregarded by
 ostentatious and we are told indeed in
history that one most splendid these
entertainers usually feasted a select party three
hundred diomed however more modest contented
himself with doubling number 
muses his party consisted eighteen no unfashionable
number in present day more
 merrier says proverb for my part at a
dinner i have always found it exactly reverse

it was morning diomed's banquet and
diomed himself though he greatly affected 
gentleman and scholar retained enough 
his mercantile experience to know that a master's
eye makes a ready servant accordingly with
his tunic girdled on his portly stomach his easy
slippers on his feet a small wand in his hand
wherewith he now directed gaze and now
vol ii k
 
corrected back some duller menial
he went from chamber to chamber his costly
villa
he did not disdain even a visit to that sacred
apartment in which priests festival prepare
their offerings on entering kitchen his
ears were agreeably stunned by noise dishes
and pans oaths and commands small as this
indispensable chamber seems to have been in
all houses pompeii it was nevertheless
usually fitted up with all that amazing variety 
stoves and shapes stewpan and saucepans cutters
and moulds without which a cook spirit no
matter whether he be an ancient or a modern declares
it utterly impossible that he can give you
anything to eat and as fuel was then as now dear
and scarce in those regions great seems to have
been dexterity exercised in preparing as many
things as possible with as little fire an admirable
contrivance this nature may be still seen
in neapolitan museum viz a portable kitchen
about size a folio volume containing stoves
for four plats and an apparatus for heating water
pompeii 
or other beverages it would be an excellent appendage
to our modern cheap libraries containing
as much food for body as they do for 
mind with this difference you would satisfactorily
recur to first work much more frequently
than you would to 
across small kitchen flitted many forms
which quick eye master did not recognise

oh oh grumbled he to himself that
cursed congrio hath invited a whole legion 
cooks to assist him they won't serve for nothing
and this is another item in total my
day's expenses by bacchus thrice lucky shall t
be if slaves do not help themselves to some 
 drinking vessels ready alas are their hands
capacious are their tunics me misery r
 cooks however worked on seemingly heedless
 apparition diomed
ho euclid your eggpan what is this 
largest it only holds thirtythree eggs in 
houses usually serve smallest eggpan holds
fifty if need be unconscionable rogue thought diomed
he talks eggs as if they were a sesterce a
hundred 
by mercury v cried a pert little culinary
disciple scarce in his noviciate who ever saw
such antique sweetmeat shapes as these it is
impossible to do credit to one's art with such
rude materials why sallust commonest sweetmeat
shape represents whole siege troy
hector and paris arid helen with little
astyanax and wooden horse into bargain

silence fool said congrio cook 
house who seemed to leave chief part 
battle to his allies my master diomed is not
one those expensive goodfornoughts who must
have fashion cost what it will
thou lies base slave cried diomed in a
great passion and thou contest me already
enough to have ruined lucullus himself come out
 thy den i want to talk to thee
 slave with a sly wink at his confederates
obeyed command
pompeii 
 man three letters said diomed with a
face solemn anger how didst thou dare to
invite all those rascals into my house i see thief
written in every line their faces
yet i assure you master that they are men
 most respectable character best cooks 
 place it is a great favour to get them but
for my sake 
thy sake unhappy congrio interrupted
diomed and by what purloined monies mine
by what reserved filings from marketing by
what goodly meats converted into grease and sold
in suburbs by what false charges for bronzes
marred and earthenware broken hast thou been
enabled to make them serve thee for thy sakes
nay master do not impeach my honesty 
may gods desert me if 
swear not again interrupted choleric
diomed for then gods will smite thee fora
perjurer and i shall lose my cook on eve 
dinner but enough this at present keep a
 common witty objurgation from bilateral word
fur thief
sharp eye on thy illfavoured assistants and tell
me no tales tomorrow vases broken and cups
miraculously vanished or thy whole back shall be
one pain and hark thee i thou knowest thou hast
made me pay for those phrygian attains enough
per hercle to have feasted a sober man for a year
together see that they be not one iota overroasted
 time o congrio that i gave a banquet to
my friends when thy vanity did so boldly undertake
 becoming appearance a median crane thou
knowest it came up like a stone from aetna as
if all fires phlegethon had been scorching
out its juices be modest this time congrio
wary and modest modesty is nurse great
actions and in all other things as in this if thou
wilt not spare thy master's purse at least consult
thy master's glory
there shall not be such a scena seen at pompeii
since hercules
softly softly thy cursed boasting again 
 attain phrygia or ionia bird thus anglicised
in plural was held in peculiar esteem by romans 
attain canis suavissima then lib ix cap and 
it was a little bigger than a partridge
pompeii 
but i say congrio yon homununculus yon pigmy
assailant my cranes yon perttongue neophyte
 kitchen was there aught but insolence on
his tongue when he maligned comeliness 
my sweetmeat shapes i would not be out 
fashion congrio
it is but custom us cooks replied
congrio gravely to undervalue our tools in
order to increase effect our art sweetmeat
shape is a fair shape and a lovely but i
would recommend my master at first occasion
to purchase some new ones a 
that will suffice exclaimed diomed who
seemed resolved never to allow his slave to finish
his sentences now resume thy charge shine 
eclipse thyself let men envy diomed his cook 
let slaves pompeii style thee congrio 
great go yet stay thou hast not spent all
 monies i gave thee for marketing 
all alas nightingales tongues and 
roman macula and oysters from britain
 candidly divine macula porch juvenal x 
a rich and delicate species sausage
 
and sunday other things too numerous now to recite
are yet left unpaid for but what matter 
every one trusts archimagirus diomed 
wealthy
o unconscionable prodigal what waste 
what profusion i am ruined but go hasten 
inspect taste perform surpass thyself let
 roman senator not despise poor pompeian
away slave and remember phrygian attains

 chief disappeared within his natural domain
and diomed rolled back his portly presence to 
more courtly chambers all was to his liking 
flowers were fresh fountains played briskly 
 mosaic pavements were smooth as mirrors
where is my daughter julia he asked
at bath
ah that reminds me time wanes and i
must bathe also
our story returns to appetites on awaking
that day from broken and feverish sleep which
archimagirus was lofty title chief cook
pompeii 
had followed his adoption a faith so strikingly
and sternly at variance with that in which his
youth had been nurtured young priest
could scarcely imagine that he was not yet in a
dream he had crossed fatal river past
was henceforth to have no sympathy with 
future two worlds were distinct and separate
that which had been from that which was to be
to what a bold and adventurous enterprise he had
pledged his life to unveil mysteries in which
he had participated to desecrate altars he had
served to denounce goddess whose ministering
robe he wore slowly he became sensible 
hatred and horror he should provoke amongst
 pious even if successful if frustrated in his
daring attempt what penalties might he not incur
for an offence hitherto unheard for which
no specific law derived from experience was prepared
and which for that very reason precedents
dragged from sharpest armoury obsolete
and inapplicable legislation would probably be
distorted to meet his friends sister his
youth could he expect justice though he might

receive compassion from them this brave and
heroic act would by their heathen eyes be regarded
perhaps as a heinous apostasy at best as a
pitiable madness
he dared he renounced everything in this
world in hope securing that eternity in
 next which had so suddenly been revealed to
him while these thoughts on one hand invaded
his breast on other hand his pride
his courage and his virtue mingled with reminiscences
 revenge for deceit indignant disgust
at fraud conspired to raise and to support him
 conflict was sharp and keen but his new
feelings triumphed over his old and a mighty
argument in favour wrestling with sanctities
 old opinions and hereditary fortis might be
found in conquest over both achieved by that
humble priest had early christians been more
controlled by solemn possibilities custom
less democrats in pure and lofty acceptation
 that perverted word christianity would
have perished in its cradle 
as each priest in succession slept several nights

together in chambers temple term
imposed on appetites was not yet completed and
when he had risen from his couch attired himself
as usual in his robes and left his narrow
chamber he found himself before altars 
 temple
in exhaustion his late emotions he had
slept far into morning and vertical sun already
poured its fervid beams over sacred place
salve appetites said a voice whose natural
asperity was smoothed by long artifice into
an almost displeasing softness tone thou
art late abroad has goddess revealed herself
to thee in visions 
could she reveal her true self to people
calenus how intenseness would be these altars 
that replied calenus may possibly be
true but deity is wise enough to hold commune
with none but priests
a time may come when she will be unveiled
without her own acquiescence
it is not likely she has triumphed for countless
ages and that which has so long stood 
 
test time rarely succumbs to lust novelty
but hark ye young brother these sayings are in
discreet
it is not for thee to silence them replied
appetites haughtily
so hot yet i will not quarrel with thee
why my appetites has not egyptian convinced
thee necessity our dwelling together
in unity has he not convinced thee wisdom
 deluding people and enjoying ourselves 
if not oh brother he is not that great magician
he is esteemed
thou then hast shared his lessons said appetites
with a hollow smile
ay but i stood less in need them than
thou nature had already gifted me with 
love pleasure and desire gain and power
long is way that leads voluptuary to 
severities life but it is only one step from
pleasant sin to sheltering hypocrisy beware 
vengeance goddess if shortness that
step be disclosed 
beware thou hour when tomb shall be
pompeii 
rent and rottenness exposed returned appetites
solemnly vale 
with these words he left flamen to his
meditations when he got a few paces from 
temple he turned to look back calenus had
already disappeared in entry room 
priests for it now approached hour that
repast which called cranium by ancients
answers in point date to breakfast 
moderns white and graceful fane gleamed
brightly in sun upon altars before it
rose incense and bloomed garlands 
priest gazed long and wistfully upon scene
it was time that it was ever beheld
by him 
he then turned and pursued his way slowly
towards house lone for before possibly
 tie that united them was cut in twain 
before uncertain peril next day was
incurred he was anxious to see his surviving
relative his fondest as his earliest friend
he arrived at her house and found her in 
garden with nydia
 
this is kind apaecides said lone joyfully 
and how eagerly have i wished to see thee 
what thanks do i not owe thee how churlish
hast thou been to answer none my letters to
abstain from coming hither to receive expressions
 my gratitude oh thou hast assisted
to preserve thy sister from dishonour what 
what can she say to thank thee now thou art
come at 
my sweet lone thou west me no gratitude
for thy cause was mine let us avoid that subject
let as recent to that impious man how hateful
to both us i may have a speedy opportunity
to teach world nature his pretended
wisdom and hypocritical severity but let us sit
down my sister i am wearied with heat 
sun let us sit in yonder shade and for a little
while longer be to each other what we have
been
beneath a wide planetree with cistus and
 arbutus clustering round them living fountain
before green sward beneath their feet
 gay cicada once so dear to athens rising
pompeii 
merrily ever and anon amidst grass butterfly
beautiful emblem soul dedicated to
psyche and which has continued to furnish illustrations
to christian bard rich in glowing
colours caught from sicilian skies hovering above
 sunny flowers itself like a winged flower in
this spot and this scene brother and 
sister sate together for time on earth
you may tread now on same place but 
garden is no more columns are shattered
 fountain hath ceased to play let traveller
search amongst ruins pompeii for 
house lone its remains are yet visible but i
will not betray them to gaze commonplace
tourists he who is more sensitive than herd
will discover them easily when he has done so let
him keep secret
they sate down and nydia glad to be alone
retired to farther garden
lone my sister said young convert
place your hand upon my brow let me feel your
in sicily are found perhaps most beautiful varieties 
 butterfly
 
cool touch speak to me too for your gentle
voice is like a breeze that hath freshness as well
as music speak to me but forbear to bless me 
utter not one word those forms speech which
our childhood was taught to consider sacred 
alas and what then shall i say our language
 affection is so woven with that worship
that words grow chilled and trite if i
banish from them allusion to our gods
our gods r murmured appetites with a
shudder thou slightest my request already
shall i speak then only to thee isis 
 evil spirit no rather be dumb forever
unless at least thou canst but away away
this talk not now will we dispute and cavil 
not now will we judge harshly each other
thou regarding me as an apostate and i all sorrow
and shame for thee as an idolater no my
sister let us avoid such topics and such thoughts
in thy sweet presence a calm falls over my spirit
for a little while i forget as i thus lay my
temples on thy bosom as i thus feel thy gentle
arm embrace me i think that we are children
pompeii 
once more and tint heaven smiles equally
upon both for oh if hereafter i escape no
matter what ordeal and it be permitted me to address
thee on one sacred and awful subject should
i find thine ear closed and thy heart hardened
what hope for myself could countervail despair
for thee in thee my sister i behold a likeness
made beautiful made noble myself shall 
mirror live for ever and form itself be broken
as potter's clay ah no no thou wilt
listen to me yet dost thou remember how we
went into fields by baiae hand in hand together
to pluck flowers spring even
so hand in hand shall we enter eternal
garden and crown ourselves with imperishable
asphodel 
wondering and bewildered by words she could
not comprehend but excited even to tears by 
plaintiveness their tone lone listened to these
outpouring a full and oppressed heart in truth
appetites himself was softened much beyond his ordinary
mood which to outward seeming was usually
either sullen or impetuous for noblest desires
 
are a jealous nature they engross they absorb
 soul and often leave splenetic humours
stagnant and unheeded at surface unheeding
 petty things around us we are deemed morose 
impatient at earthly interruption to diviner
dreams we are thought irritable and churlish
for as there is no chimera gainer than hope
that one human heart shall find sympathy in another
so none ever interpret us with justice and
none no not our nearest and our dearest ties
forbear with us in mercy when we are dead
and repentance comes too late both friend and
foe may wonder to think how little there was in
us to forgive 
i will talk to thee then our early years
said lone shall yon blind girl sing to thee 
 childhood her voice is sweet and musical
and she hath a song on that theme which contains
none those allusions it pains thee to hear
dost thou remember words my sister 
asked appetites
methinks yes for tune which is simple
fixed them on my memory
pompeii 
sing to me then thyself my ear is not in
unison with unfamiliar voices and thine lone
full household associations has ever been to me
more sweet than all hireling melodies lycia
or crete sing to me 
lone beckoned to a slave that stood in portico
and sending for her lute sang when it arrived
to a tender and simple air following
verses 

it is not that our earlier heaven
escapes its april showers
or that to childhood's heart is given
no snake amidst flowers
ah twined with grief
each brightest leaf
that's wreath'd us by hours 
young though we be past may sting
 present feed its sorrow 
but hope shines bright on every thing
that waits us with morrow

like sunlit glades
 dimmest shades
some rosy beam can borrow

it is not that our later years
 cares are woven wholly 
but smiles less swiftly chase tears
and wounds are healed more slowly
and memory's vow
to lost ones now
makes joys too bright unholy
and ever fled irisbow
that smiled when clouds were o'er us 
if storms should burst cheered we go
a drearier waste before us 
and with toys
 childish joys
we've broke staff that bore us 
wisely and delicately had lone chosen that
song sad though its burthen seemed for ashen weare
deeply mournful discordant above all others is
pompeii 
 voice mirth fittest spell is that borrowed
from melancholy itself for dark thoughts
can be softened down when they cannot be
brightened and so they lose precise and rigid
outline their truth and their colours melt into
 ideal as leech applies as a remedy to 
internal sore some outward irritation which by a
gentler wound draws away venom that which
is more deadly thus in rankling festers 
mind our art is to divert to a milder sadness on 
surface pain that gnawed at core and so
with appetites yielding to influence silver
voice that reminded him past and told but
 half sorrow born to present he forgot
his more immediate and fiery sources anxious
thought he spent hours in making lone alternately
sing to and converse with him and
when he rose to leave her it was with a calmed
and lulled mind
lone said he as he pressed her hand
should you hear my name blackened and maligned
will you credit aspersion 
never my brother never 
 
dost tlioii not imagine according to thy belief
that evildoer is punished hereafter and
 good rewarded 
can you doubt it 
dost thou think then that he who is truly
good should sacrifice every selfish interest in his
zeal for virtue 
he who doth so is equal gods
and thou believes that according to purity
and courage with which he thus acts shall be
his portion bliss beyond grave 
so are we taught to hope
kiss me my sister one question more thou
art to be wedded to glaucus perchance that marriage
may separate us more hopelessly but not 
this speak i now thou art to be married to glaucus
 dost thou love him nay my sister answer
me by words
yes murmured lone blushing
dost thou feel that for his sake thou couldst
renounce pride brave dishonour and incur death 
i have heard that when women really love it is to
that excess
pompeii 
my brother all this could i do for glaucus
and feel that it were not a sacrifice there is no
sacrifice to those who love in what is borne for
 one we love
enough shall woman feel thus for man and
man feel less devotion to his god 
he spoke no more his whole countenance
seemed instinct and inspired with a divine life
 his chest swelled proudly his eyes glowed
on his forehead was writ majesty a
man who can dare be noble he tmiied to
meet eyes lone earnest wistful fearful 
he kissed her fondly strained her warmly to
his breast and in a moment more he had left 
house
long did lone remain in same place mute
and thoughtful maidens again and again
came to warn her deepening noon and her
engagement to diomed's banquet at length she
woke from her reverie and prepared not with 
pride beauty but listless and melancholy 
for festival one thought alone reconciled her
to promised visit she should meet glaucus 
 
she could confide to him her alarm and uneasiness
fob her brother
love there is one blessing that distinguishes
above all others thy chaste and sacred ties from
thy guilty and illicit eros from enters 
to those alone whom ave love without a crime we
impart confidence all our household and
familiar cares to erring love is only passion 
there are but mistress and lover for
 sinless bond embraces fondness
 sanctity and faith every other connection
 it was not in mouth helen but andromache
that homer put those touching words
so true in sentiment from eldest to latest
time 
and while my hector still survives i see
my father mother brethren all in thee i
pompeii 
chapter iii
a fashionable party and a dinner a la side
in pompeii
meanwhile sallust and glaucus were slowly
strolling towards house diomed despite
 habits his life sallust was not devoid 
many estimable qualities he would have been an
active friend an useful citizen in short an excellent
man if he had not taken it into his head to be a
philosopher brought up in schools in which
roman plagiarism worshiped echo grecian
wisdom he had imbued himself with those doctrines
by which later epicurean corrupted
 simple maxims their great master he gave
himself altogether up to pleasure and imagined
there was no sage like a boon companion still
 
however he had a considerable degree learning
mit and good nature and hearty frankness 
his very vices seemed like virtue itself beside 
utter corruption clodius and prostrate effeminacy
 lepidus and therefore glaucus liked lira
 best his companions and he in turn appreciating
 nobler qualities athenian loved
him almost as much as a cold muraena or a bowl
 best valerian
this is a vulgar old fellow this diomed
said sallust but he has some good qualities in
his cellar 
and some charming ones in his daughter

true glaucus but you are not much moved
by them methinks fancy clodius is desirous to
be your successor
he is welcome at banquet her
beauty no guest be sure is considered a musca
you are severe but she has indeed something
 corinthian about her they will be
avellniatched after all what goodnatured fellows
unwelcome and uninvited guests were called musca or flies
pompeii 
we are to associate with that gambling 

pleasure unites strange varieties answered
glaucus he amuses me 
and flatters but then he pays himself well 
he powders his praise with golddust
you often hint that he plays unfairly think
you so really 
my dear glaucus a roman noble has his dignity
to keep up dignity is very expensive clodius
must cheat like a scoundrel in order to live like a
gentleman
ha ha well late i have renounced 
dice ah sallust when i am wedded to lone
i trust i may yet redeem a youth follies
we are both born for better things than those
in which we sympathise now born to render
om worship in nobler temples than stye 
epicurus
alas returned sallust in rather a melancholy
tone what do we know more than this life is
short beyond grave all is dark there is no
wisdom like that which says enjoy 
 
by bacchus i doubt sometimes if we do
enjoy utmost which hfe is capable
i am a moderate man returned sallust and
do not ask utmost we are like malefactors
and intoxicate ourselves with wine and
myrrh as we stand on brink death but if
we did not do so abyss would look very disagreeable
i own that i was inclined to be gloomy
until i took so heartily to drinking that is a
new life my glaucus
yes but it brings us next morning to a
new death
why next morning is unpleasant i
own but then if it were not so one would never
be inclined to read i study betimes because by
 gods i am generally unfit for anything else
till noon
fie scythian 
pshaw fate pentheus to him who
denies bacchus 
well sallust with all your faults you are
 best profligate i ever met and verily if
i were in danger life you are only man
rompeii 
in all italy who would stretch out a finger to
save me
perhaps should not if it were in middle
 supper but in truth we italians are fearfully
selfish
so are all men who are not free said glaucus
with a sigh freedom alone makes men sacrifice
to each other
freedom then must be a very fatiguing thing
to an epicurean answered sallust but here
we are at our host's
as diomed's villa is one most considerable
in point size any yet discovered
at pompeii and is moreover built much according
to specific instructions for a suburban
villa laid down by roman architect it may
not be uninteresting briefly to describe plan 
 apartments through which our visitors passed
they entered then by same small vestibule
at which we have before been presented to 
aged medon and passed at once into a colonnade
technically termed peristyle for main
difference between suburban villa and 
 
town mansion consisted in placing in first
 said colonnade in exactly same place
as that which in town mansion was occupied
by atrium in centre peristyle
was an ojien court which contained 

from this peristyle descended a staircase to 
offices another narrow passage on opposite
side communicated with a garden various small
apartments surrounded colonnade appropriated
probably to country visitors another door to 
left on entering communicated with a small
triangular portico which belonged to baths
and behind was wardrobe in which were kept
 vests holiday suits slaves and
perhaps master seventeen centuries afterwards
were found those relics ancient finery
calcined and crumbling kept longer alas than
their thrifty lord foresaw
return we to peristyle and endeavour now
to present to reader a coupdoeil whole
suite apartments which immediately stretched
before steps visitors
pompeii

let him then first imagine coins 
portico hung with festoons flowers coins
themselves in lower part painted red and 
walls around glowing with various frescos then
looking beyond a curtain three parts drawn aside
 eye caught tablinum or saloon which was
closed at will by glazed doors now slid back into
 walls on either side this tablinum were
small rooms one which was a kind cabinet 
gems and these apartments as well as tablinum
communicated with a long gallery which opened at
either upon terraces and between terraces
and communicating with central part 
gallery alas a hall in which banquet was that
day prepared all these apartments though almost
on a level with street were one story
above garden and terraces communicating
with gallery were continued into corridors
raised above pillars which to right and
left skirted garden below
beneath and on a level with garden ran 
apartments we have already described as chiefly
appropriated to julia
 
in gallery then just mentioned diomed received
his guests
 merchant affected greatly man letters
and therefore he also affected a passion for everything
greek he paid particular attention to
glaucus
you will see my friend said he with a
wave his hand that i am a little classical
here a little cecropian eh hall in which
we shall sup is borrowed from greeks it is
an secus cyzicene noble sallust they have
not i am told this sort apartment in rome
oh replied sallust with a half smile you
pompeians combine all most eligible in greece and
in rome may you diomed combine viands as
well as architecture 
you shall see you shall see my sallust
replied merchant we have a taste at pompeii
 and we have also money
they are two excellent things replied sallust
 but behold lady julia 
a main difference as i have before remarked in
 manner life observed onions athenians
pompeii 
and romans was that with first modest
women rarely or never took part in entertainments
 with latter they were common
ornaments banquet hut when they were
present at feast it usually terminated at an
early hour
magnificently robed in avhite interwoven with
pearls and threads gold handsome julia
entered apartment 
scarcely had she received salutation 
two guests ere pansa and his wife lepidus claudius
and roman senator entered almost simultaneously
 then came widow fulvia then
 poet fulvius like to widow in name if in
nothing else warrior from herculaneum accompanied
by his umbra next stalked in afterwards
 less eminent guests lone yet
tarried
it was mode among courteous ancients
to flatter whenever it was in their power accordingly
it was a sign illbreeding to seat themselves
immediately on entering house their
host after performing salutation which was

usually accomplished by same cordial shake 
 right hand which we ourselves retain and
sometimes by yet more familiar embrace they
spent several minutes in surveying apartment
and admiring bronzes pictures or 
furniture with which it was adorned a mode
very impolite according to our refined english
notions which place good breeding in indifference 
we would not for world express much admiration
at a man's house for fear it should bethought
we had never seen anything so fine
before 
a beautiful statue this bacchus said 
roman senator
a mere trifle replied diomed
what charming paintings said fulvia
mere trifles answered owner
exquisite candelabra cried warrior
exquisite echoed his umbra
trifles trifles reiterated merchant
meanwhile glaucus found himself by one 
windows gallery which communicated with
 terraces and fair julia by his side
pompeii 
is it an athenian virtue glaucus said 
merchant's daughter to shun those whom we
once sought 
fair juha no 
yet methinks it is one qualities 
glaucus
glaucus never shuns a frietid replied 
greek with some emphasis on word
may julia rank among number his
friends 
it would be an honour to emperor to
find a friend in one so lovely
you evade my question returned enamoured
jidia but tell me is it true that you
admire neapolitan lone 
does not beauty constrain our admiration 
ah subtle greek still do you fly meaning
 my words but say shall julia be indeed your
friend 
if she will so favour me blessed be gods 
 day in which i am thus honoured shall be
ever marked in white
yet even while you speak your eye is rests
 
less your colour comes and goes you move away
involuntarily you are impatient to join lone
for at that moment lone had entered and
glaucus had indeed betrayed emotion noticed
by jealous beauty
can admiration to one woman make me unworthy
 friendship another sanction not
so o julia libels poets on your sex
well you are right or i will learn to think
so glaucus yet one moment you are to wed
lone is it not so 
if fates permit such is my blessed hope
accept then from me in token our new
friendship a present for your bride nay it is
 custom friends you know always to present
to bride and bridegroom some such little
marks their esteem and favouring wishes
julia i i cannot refuse any token friendship
from one like you i will accept gift as an
omen from fortune herself
 then after feast when guests retire
you will descend with me to my apartment and
receive it from my hands remember said
pompeii 
julia as she joined vdfe pansa and left
glaucus to seek lone
 widow fulvia and spouse castile
were engaged in high and grave discussion
o fulvia i assure you that account
from rome declares that frizzling mode 
dressing hair is growing antiquated they
only now wear it built up in a tower like julia's
or arranged as a helmet valerian fashion
like mine you see it has a fine effect i think
i assure you vespius vespius was name 
 herculaneum hero admires it greatly
and nobody wears hair like yon neapolitan
in greek way 
what parted in front with knot behind 
oh no how ridiculous it is it reminds one 
a statue diana yet this lone is handsome
eh
so men say but then she is rich she is
to marry athenian i wish her joy he will
not be long faithful i suspect those foreigners
are very faithless
 ho jidia said fulvia as merchant's
 
daughter joined them have you seen tiger
yet 
no 
why all ladies have been to see him
he is so handsome 
i hope we shall find some criminal or other
for him and lion replied julia your husband
turning to pansa's wife is not so active
as he should be in this matter
why really laws are too mild replied
 dame helmet there are so few offences
to which punishment arena can be
awarded and then too gladiators are growing
effeminate stoutest bestiarii declare they
are willing enough to fight a boar or a bull but as
for a lion or tiger they think game too much
in earnest
they are worthy a mitre replied julia in
disdain
mitres were worn sometimes by men and considered a great
mark effeminacy to be fit for a mitre was therefore to be fit
for very little else it is astonishing how many modern opinions
are derived from antiquity doubtless it was this classical notion
 mitres that incited ardour mr ripon to expel 
bishops there is a vast deal wickedness in latin 
pompeii 
oh have you seen new house fulvius
 dear poet said pansa's wife
no is it handsome 
very such good taste but they say my dear
that he has such improper pictures he won't
show them to women how illbred 
those poets are always odd said widow
but he is an interesting man what pretty verses
he writes we improve very much in poetry it is
impossible to read old stuff now
i declare i am your opinion returned 
lady helmet there is so much more force
and energy in modern school
 warrior sauntered up to ladies
it reconciles me to peace said he when i
see such faces
oh you heroes are ever flatterers returned
fulvia hastening to appropriate compliment
specially to herself
by this chain which i received from emperor's
own hand replied warrior playing
with a short chain which hung round neck
like a collar instead descending to breast
 
according to fashion peaceful by
this chain you wrong me i am a hkmt man a
soldier shouki be so
how do you find ladies pompeii generally
 said julia
by venus most beautiful they favour me a
little it is true and that inclines my eyes to double
their charms
we love a warrior said wife pansa
i see it by hercules it is even disagreeable to
be too celebrated in these cities at herculaneum
they climb roof my atrium to catch a glimpse
 me through compendium admiration
 one's citizens is pleasant at first but burthensome
afterwards
true true o vespius cried poet joining
 group i find it so myself
you said stately warrior scanning 
small form poet with ineffable disdain in
what legion have yoxi served 
you may see my spoils my exuviae in 
forum itself returned poet with a significant
glance at women i have been among 
pompeii
tentcompanions contuhernahs great
mantua himself
i know no general from mantua said 
warrior gravely what campaign have you served 
that helicon
i never heard it
nay vespius he does hut joke said julia
laughing
joke by mars am i a man to be joked 
yes liars himself was in love with mother
 jokes said poet a little alarmed
know then o vespius that i am poet
fulvius it is i who make warriors immortal
 gods forbid whispered sallust to julia
 if vesuvius were made immortal what a
specimen tiresome braggadocio would be transmitted
to posterity 
 soldier looked puzzled when to infinite
relief himself and his companions signal for
 feast was given
as we have already witnessed at house 
glaucus ordinary routine a pompeian entertainment
 reader is spared any second detail 
 
 courses and manner in which they avere
introduced
diomed who was rather ceremonious had appointed
a nomenclator or appointer places to each
guest
 reader understands that festive board was
composed three tables one at centre and
one at each wing it was only at outer side 
these tables that guests reclined inner space
was left untenanted for greater convenience 
 waiters or ministry extreme corner one
 wings was appropriated to julia as lady
 feast that next her to diomed at one
corner centre table was placed aedile 
at opposite corner roman senator these
were posts honour other guests
were arranged so that young gentleman or
lady should sit next each other and more
advanced in years be similarly matched an
agreeable provision enough but one which must
often have offended those who wished to be thought
still young
 chair lone was next to couch 
pompeii 
glaucus seats were veneered with tortoiseshell
and covered with quilts stuffed with
feathers and ornamented with costly embroideries
 babylon modern ornaments 
epergne or plateau were supplied by images 
 gods wrought in bronze ivory and silver
 sacred saltcellar and familiar lares were
not forgotten over table and seats a
rich canopy was suspended from ceiling at
each corner table were lofty candelabra
for though it was early noon room was darkened
while from tripods placed in different parts
 room distilled odour myrrh and
frankincense and upon abacus or sideboard
large vases and various ornaments silver were
ranged much with same ostentation but with
more than same taste that we find displayed
at a modern feast
 custom grace was invariably supplied by
that libations to gods and vesta as queen
in formal parties women sate in chairs men reclined
it was only in bosom families that same ease
was granted to both sexes reason is obvious
s 
 household gods usually received first that
graceful homage
this ceremony being performed slaves
showered flowers upon couches and floor
and crowned each guest with rosy garlands intricately
woven with ribands tied by rind 
lindentree and each intermingled with ivy
and amethyst supposed preventives against
 effect wine wreaths women only
were exempted from these leaves for it was not
 fashion for them to drink wine in public it
was then that president diomed thought it
advisable to institute a basileus or director 
feast an important office sometimes chosen by
lot sometimes as now by master 
entertainment
diomed was not a little puzzled as to his election
 invalid senator was too grave and too infirm
for proper fulfilment his duty aedile
pansa was adequate enough to task but then
to choose next in official rank to senator
was an affront to senator himself while deliberating
between merits others he
pompeii t
caiight mirthful glance sallust and by a
sudden inspiration named jovial epicure to
 rank director or arbiter bibendi
sallust received appointment with becoming
humility
i shall be a merciful king said he to those
who drink deep to a recusant midas himself
shall be less inexorable beware 
 slaves handed romid basins perfumed
water by which elevation feast commenced 
and now table groaned under initiatory
course
 conversation at first desultory and scattered
allowed lone and glaucus to carry on those
sweet whispers which are worth all eloquence
in world julia watched them with flashingeyes

how soon shall her place be mine thought she
but clodius who sate in centre table so as
to observe well countenance julia guessed
her pique and resolved to profit by it he addressed
her across table in set phrases 
gallantry and as he was high birth and a
 
showy person vain juha was not so much in
love as to be insensible to his attentions
 slaves in interim were constantly kept
upon alert by vigilant sallust who chased
one cup by another with a celerity which seemed
as if he were resolved upon exhausting those capacious
cellars which reader may yet see beneath
 house diomed worthy merchant
began to repent his choice as amphora after
amphora was pierced and emptied slaves
all under age manhood youngest being
about ten years old it was they who filled 
wine eldest some five years older mingled it
with water seemed to share in zeal sallust 
and face diomed began to glow as he
watched provoking complacency with which
they seconded exertions king 
feast
pardon me o senator said sallust i see
you flinch your purple hem cannot save you 
drink 
by gods said senator coughing
my lungs are already on fire you proceed with
pompeii 
so miraculous a swiftness that phaeton himself
meas nothing to you i am infirm o pleasant
sallust you must exonerate me
not i by vesta i am an impartial monarch
drink 
 poor senator compelled by laws 
table was forced to comply alas every cup
was bringing him nearer and nearer to stygian
pool
gently gently my king groaned diomed
we already begin to 
treason interrupted sallust no stern brutus
here no interference with royalty 
but our female guests 
love a toper did not ariadne dote upon
bacchus 
 feast proceeded guests grew more
talkative and noisy dessert or course was
already on table and slaves bore round
water with myrrh and hyssop for finishing elevation
at same time a small circular table that
had been placed in space opposite guests
suddenly and as by magic seemed to open
 
in centre and cast up a fragrant shower
sprinkling table and guests while as it
ceased awning above them was drawn aside
and guests perceived that a rope had been
stretched across ceiling and that one those
nimble dancers for which pompeii was so celebrated
and whose descendants add so charming a
grace to festivities ashley's or vauxhall was
now treading his airy measures right over their
heads
this apparition removed but by a cord from
one's pericranium and indulging most vehement
leaps apparently with intention alighting
upon that cerebral region would probably be regarded
with some terror by a party in may fair 
but our pompeian revellers seemed to behold 
spectacle with delighted curiosity and applauded
in proportion as dancer appeared with most
difficulty to miss falling upon head whatever
guest he particularly selected to dance above he
paid indeed senator peculiar compliment 
literally falling from rope and catching it
again with his hand just as whole party impompeii

aginetl skull roman was as much fractured
as ever that poet whom eagle took
for a tortoise
at length to great relief at least lone
who had not much accustomed herself to this entertainment
 dancer suddenly paused as a strain
 music was heard from without he danced
again still more wildly air changed dancer
paused again no it could not dissolve 
charm which was supposed to possess him he
represented one who hy a strange disorder is compelled
to dance and whom only a certain air 
music can cure at length musician seemed
to hit on right tune dancer gave one leap
swung himself down from rope alighted on
 floor and vanished
one art now yielded to another and musicians
who were stationed without on terrace
struck up a soft and mellow air to which were
sung following words made almost indistinct
by barrier between and exceeding lowness
 minstrelsy 
a dance still retained in campania

hark i through these flowers our music sends its
greeting
to your loved halls where silas shuns day 
when young god his cretan nymph was meeting
he taught pan's rustic pipe this gliding lay
soft as dews wine
shed in this banquethour
 rich libation sound's stream divine
o reverent harp to aphrodite pour i

wild rings trump o'er ranks to glory marching 
music's sublimer bursts for war are meet 
but sweet lips murmuring under wreaths o'erarching
find low whispers like their own most sweet
steal my lull'd music steal
like woman's halfheard tone
so that whoe'er shall hear shall think to feel
in thee voice lips that love his own
bacchus
pompeii 
how it was i know not bnt at that
song lone's cheek blushed more deeply than before
and glaucus had contrived beneath cover 
 table to steal her hand
it is a pretty song said fulvius patronizingly
ah if you would oblige us murmured 
wife pansa
do you wish fuhaus to sing asked king
 feast who had just called on assembly to
drink health roman senator a cup to
each letter his name
can you ask said matron with a
complimentary glance at poet
sallust snapped his fingers and whispering 
slave who came to learn his orders latter disappeared
and returned in a few moments with a
small harp in one hand and a branch myrtle
in other
 slave approached poet and with a low
reverence presented to him harp
 alas i cannot play said poet
then you must sing to myrtle it is a
greek fashion diomed loves greeks i love

greeks you love greeks we all love 
greeks and between you and me this is not 
only thing we have stolen from them however
i introduce this custom i king sing subject
sing
 poet with a bashful smile took myrtle
ill his hands and after a short prelude sang as
follows in a pleasant and welltuned voice 
s'luii iekrjfsikr if t'mm nsiiso

 merry loves one holiday
were all at gambols madly
but loves too long can seldom play
without behaving sadly
they laughed they toyed they romped about
and then for change they all fell out
fie fie how can they quarrel so
my lesbia ah for shame love
methinks tis scarce an hour ago
when we did just same love
 suggested by two pompeian pictures in inliiseum at naples
which represent a dove and a helmet enthroned by cupids
loves tis thought were free till then
they had no king nor laws dear 
but gods like men should subject be
say all ancient saws dear
and so our crew resolved for quiet
to choose a king to curb their riot
a kiss ah i what a grievous thing
for both methinks twould be child
if i should take some prudish king
and cease to be so free child i

among their toys a casque they found
it was helm ares 
with horrent plumes crest was crown'd
it frightened all lares
so fine a king was never known 
they placed helmet on throne
my girl since valour wins world
they chose a mighty master 
but thy sweet flag smiles unfurl'd
would win world much faster 
 

 casque soon found loves too wild
a troop for him to school them 
for warriors know how one such child
has aye contrived to fool them
they plagued him so that in despair
he took a wife plague to share
if kings themselves thus find strife
 earth unshared severe girl 
why just to halve ills life
come take your partner here girl

within that room bird love
 whole affair had eyed then 
 monarch hailed royal dove
and placed her by his side then 
what mirth amidst loves was seen
 long live they cried our king and queen i
ah lesbia would that thrones were mine
and crowns to deck that brow love 
and yet i know that heart thine
for me is throne enow love i

 urchins thought a milder mate
their king could not have taken 
but when queen in judgment sate
they found themselves mistaken
 art to reign she'd learnt above
and ne'er was despot like dove
in thee i find same deceit 
too late alas i a learner 
for where a mien more gently sweet 
and where a tyrant sterner 
this song which greatly suited gay and
lively fancy pompeians was received with
considerable applause and widow insisted on
crouching her namesake with very branch 
myrtle to which he had sig it was easily twisted
into a garland and immortal fulvius was
crowned amidst clapping hands and shouts 
lo triumph song and harp now circulated
round party a new myrtle branch being
 
handed about stopping at each person who could
be prevailed upon to sing
 sun began now to decline though revellers
who had worn away several hours perceived
it not in their darkened chamber and 
senator who was tired and warrior who had to
return to herculaneum rising to depart gave 
signal for general dispersion
tarry yet a moment my friends said diomed
 if you will go so soon you must at least
take a share in our concluding game
so saying he motioned to one ministry
and whispering him slave went out and presently
returned with a small bowl containing
various tablets carefully sealed and apparently exactly
similar each guest was to purchase one 
these at nominal price lowest piece 
silver and sport this lottery which was 
favourite diversion augustus who introduced it
according to plutarch sympos lib i it seems that 
branch myrtle or laurel was not carried round in order but
passed from first person on one couch to first on another
and then from second on one to second on other
and so on
pompeii 
consisted in inequality and sometimes incongruity
 prizes nature and amount 
which were specified within tablets for instance
 poet with a wry face drew one his
own poems no physician ever less willingly swallowed
his own draught warrior drew a case
 bodkins which gave rise to certain novel witticisms
relative to hercules and distaff 
widow fulvia obtained a large drinking cup julia
a gentleman's buckle and lepidus a ladies
patchbox most appropriate lot was drawn
by gambler clodius who reddened with anger
on being presented to a set cogged dice a certain
damp was thrown upon gaiety which these
various lots created by an accident that was considered
ominous glaucus drew most valuable
 all prizes a small marble statue 
fortune grecian workmanship on handing
it to him slave suffered it to drop and it
broke in pieces
 several cogged dice were found in pompeii some 
virtues may be modern but it is quite clear that all vices
are ancient

a shiver went round assembly and each
voice cried spontaneously dii advertise omen r
glaucus alone though perhaps as superstitious
as rest affected to be unmoved
sweet neapolitan whispered he tenderly to
lone who had turned pale as broken marble
itself i accept omen it signifies that in obtaining
thee fortune can give no more she breaks
her image when she blesses me with thine
in order to divert impression which this
incident had occasioned in an assembly which
considering civilization guests would
seem miraculously superstitious if at present
day in a country party we did not often see a lady
grow hypochondriacal on leaving a room 
thirteen sallust now crowning his cup sith
flowers gave health their host this was
followed by a similar compliment to emperor 
and then with a parting cup to mercmy to send
them pleasant slumbers they concluded entertainment
by a libation and broke up 
party
carriages were little used in pompeii partly
pompeii 
owing to extreme narrowness streets
partly to convenient smallness city
most guests replacing their sandals which
they put off in banquetroom and induing their
cloaks left house on foot attended by their
slaves
meanwhile having seen lone depart glaucus
turning to staircase which led down to 
rooms julia was conducted by a slave to an
apartment in which he found merchant's
daughter already seated
glaucus said she looking down i see that
you really love lone she is indeed beautiful
julia is charming enough to be generous
replied greek yes i love lone amidst
all youth who court you may you have one
worshipper as sincere 
i pray gods to grant it see glaucus
these pearls are present i destine to your
bride may juno give her health to wear them 
so saying she placed a case in his hands containing
a row pearls some size and price it
was so much custom for persons about to be
 
married to receive these gifts that glaueus could
have httle scruple in accepting necklace
though gallant and proud athenian inly resolved
to requite gift by one thrice its value
julia then stopping short his thanks poured forth
some wine into a small bowl
you have drunk many toasts with my father
said she smiling one now with me health
and fortune to your bride 
she touched cup with her lips and then presented
it to glaueus customary etiquette
required that glaueus should drain whole contents
 he accordingly did so julia unknowing 
deceit which nydia had practised upon her watched
him with sparkling eyes although with
had told her that effect might not be immediate
she yet sanguinely trusted to an expeditious
operation in favour her charms she was disappointed
when she found glaueus coldly replace 
cup and converse with her in same unmoved
but gentle tone as before and though she detained
him as long as she decorously could do no
change took place in his manner
powell 
but tomorrow thought she exultingly recovering
her disappointment tomorrow his for
glaucus 
alas for him indeed 
 
chapter iv
 story halts for a moment at an episode
restless and anxious appetites consumed 
day in wandering through most sequestered
walks in vicinity city sun was
slowly setting as he paused beside a lonely part 
 samos ere yet it wound amidst evidences
 luxury and power only through opening's in
 woods and vines were caught glimpses 
white and gleaming city in which was heard in
 distance no din no sound nor busiest hum
 men amidst green banks crept 
lizard and grasshopper and here and there in
 brake some solitary bird burst into sudden
song as suddenly stilled there was deep calm
around but not calm night air still
breathed freshness and life day 
pompeii

grass still moved to stir insecthorde 
and on opposite bank graceful and white
capella passed browsing through herbage and
paused at wave to drink
as appetites stood musingly gazing upon 
waters he heard beside him low bark a
dog
be still poor friend said a voice at hand
 stranger's step harms not thy master 
convert recognised voice and turning he beheld
 old mysterious man whom he had seen in 
congregation nazarenes
 old man was sitting upon a fragment 
stone covered with ancient mosses beside him were
his staff and scrip at his feet lay a small shagged
dog companion in how many a pilgrimage
perilous and strange 
 face old man was as balm to 
excited spirit neophyte he approached
and craving his blessing sate down beside him
thou art provided as for a jonney father
said he wilt thou leave us yet 
my son replied old man in
store for me on earth are few and scanty i employ
them as becomes me traveling from place to place
comforting those whom god has gathered together
in his name and proclaiming glory his son
as testified to his servant
thou hast looked they tell me on face 
christ 
and face revived me from dead
know young proselyte to true faith that i am
he whom thou readiest in scroll apostle
in far judea and in city nain there
dwelt a widow humble spirit and sad heart 
for all ties life one son alone was spared
to her and she loved him with a melancholy
love for he was likeness lost and 
son died reed on which she leant was
broken oil was dried up in widow's cruise
they bore dead upon his bier and near 
gate city avhen crowd were gathered
there came a silence over sounds woe for
 son god was passing by mother
who followed bier wept not noisily but all
who looked upon her saw that her heart was
pompeii
crushed and lord pitied her and he touched
 bier and said i say unto thee arise and
 dead man woke and looked upon face 
 lord oh that calm and solemn brow that
unutterable smile that careworn and sorrowful
face lighted up with a gods benignity it chased
away shadows grave i rose i spoke 
i was living and in my mother's arms yes 
am dead revived people shouted 
funeral horns rang forth merrily there was a cry
god has visited his people i heard them
not i felt i saw nothing but face 
redeemer 
 old man paused deeply moved and 
youth felt his blood creep and his hair stir he
was in presence one who had known 
mystery death 
till that time renewed widow's son
i had been as other men thoughtless not
abandoned taking no heed but things 
love and life nay i had inclined to gloomy
faith earthly sadducee but raised from
 dead from awful and desert dreams that
 
these lips never dare reveal recalled upon earth
to testify powers heaven once more mortal
 witness immortality i drew a new
being from grave oh fated o lost jerusalem
 him from whom came my life i beheld
adjudged to agonised and parching death 
far in mighty crowd i saw light rest and
glimmer over cross i heard hooting mob
i cried aloud i raved i threatened none
heeded me i was lost in whirl and 
roar thousands but even then in my agony
and his own methought glazing eye 
son man sought me out his lip smiled as when
it conquered death it hushed me and i became
calm he who defied grave for another 
what was grave to him sun shone
aslant pale and powerful features and then
died away darkness fell over earth how
long it endured i know not a loud cry came
through gloom a sharp and bitter cry and
all was silent
but who shall tell terrors night i
walked along city earth reeled to and
pompeii 
fro and houses trembled to their base 
living had deserted streets but not dead 
through gloom i saw them glide dim
and ghastly shapes in cerements grave
with horror and woe and warning on their
unmoving lips and lightness eyes they swept by
me as i passed they glared upon rae i had
been their brother and they bowed their heads in
recognition they had risen to tell having
that dead cadi rise 
again old man paused and when he resumed
it was in a calmer tone
from that night i resigned all earthly thought
but that serving him a preacher and a pilgrim
i have traversed remotest corners 
earth proclaiming his divinity and bringing new
converts to his fold i come as wind and as
 wind depart sowing as wind sows 
seeds that enrich world
son on earth we shall meet no more forget
not this hour what are pleasures and
 pomps life as lamp shines life
glitters for an hour but souls light is 
 
star that burns for ever jn heart illimitable
space
it was then that their converse fell upon general
and sublime doctrines immortality it soothed
and elevated young mind convert
which yet clung to many damps and shadows
 that cell faith which he had so lately left 
it was air heaven breathing on prisoner
released at there was a strong and marked
distinction between christianity old man
and that olinthus that first was more
soft more gentle more divine hard heroism
 olinthus had something in it fierce and intolerant
 it was necessary to part he was doomed
to play it had in it more courage 
martyr than charity saint it aroused
it excited it nerved rather than subdued and softened
but whole heart that divine old
man was bathed in love smile deity
had burned away from it leaven earthlier
and coarser passions and left to energy 
hero all meekness child
pompeii 
and now said he rising at length as 
sun's ray died in west now in cool
 twilight i pursue ray way towards imperial
rome there yet dwell some holy men who
like me have beheld face christ and them
would i see before i die
but night is chill for thine age my father
and way is long and robber haunts it 
rest thee till tomorrow
kind son what is there in this scrip to tempt
 robber and night and solitude these
make ladder round which angels cluster and
beneath which my spirit can dream god oh 
none can know what pilgrim feels as he walks
on his holy course nursing no fear and foreseeing
no danger for god is with him he hears 
winds murmur glad tidings woods sleep in
 shadow almighty wings stars are 
scriptures heaven token love and 
witness immortality night is pilgrim's day
with these words old man pressed ascites
to his breast and taking up his staff and scrip 
 
dog bounded cheerily before him and with flow
steps and downcast eyes he went his way
 convert stood watching his bended form
till trees shut glimpse from his view 
and then as stars broke forth he woke from
his musings with a start reminded his appointment
with olinthus
pompeii
chapter v
 philtee its effect
when glaucus arrived at his own home he
found nydia seated under portico his garden
in fact she had sought his house in 
mere chance that he might return at an early hour 
anxious fearful anticipative she resolved upon
seizing earliest opportunity availing herself
 lovecharm while at same time she half
hoped opportunity might he deferred strange
mixture boldness and timidity that when young
wq have all experienced how often in our morning
walks or in nightly crowd in our first youth
have all us at once sought and shunned 
mistress our heart gone miles in hope 
whispering one sweet word and returned home 
word unsaid heaven be praised that we husband
s 
our time better after a little experience and when
we have less youth and love to throw away 
it was then in that feared turning mood her
heart beating her cheek flushing that nydia
awaited possibility glaucus's return before
 night he crossed portico just as first
stars began to rise and heaven above had
assumed its most purple robe
ho my child wait you for me 
nay i have been tending flowers and
did but linger a little while to rest myself
it has been warm said glaucus placing
himself also on one seats beneath colonnade

very
wilt thou summon davis wine i have
drunk heats me and i long for some coolingdrink

here at once suddenly and unexpectedly 
very opportunity that nydia awaited presented
itself himself at his own free choice he afforded
to her that occasion she breathed quick i
will prepare for you myself said she smn
pompeii 
mer draught that lone loves hone and weak
wme cooled in snow
thanks said unconscious glaueus if
lone loves it enough it would be grateful were
it poison
nydia frowned and then smiled she withdrew
for a few moments and returned with 
howl containing beverage glaueus took it
from her hand what would not nydia have
given then for one hour's prerogative sight to have
watched her hopes ripening to effect to have seen
 first dawn imagined love to have worshipped
with more than persian adoration rising
 that sun which her credulous soul believed was
to break upon her dreary night far different as
she stood then and there were thoughts 
emotions blind girl from those vain
pompeian under a similar suspense in 
what poor and frivolous passions had made up 
daring whole what petty pique what small
revenge what expectation a paltry triumph
had swelled attributes that sentiment she
dignified with name love but in wild

heart thessalian all was pure uncontrolled
unmodified passion erring unwomanly frenzied
 but debased by no elements a more sordid
feeling filled with love as with life itself how
could she resist occasion winning love in
return 
she leant for support against wall and her
face before so flushed was now white as snow
and with her delicate hands clasped convulsively
together her lips apart her eyes on ground
she waited next words glaucus should
utter
glaucus had raised cup to his lips he had
already drained about a fourth its contents
avhen his eye suddenly glancing upon face 
nydia he was so forcibly struck by its alteration
by its intense and painful and strange expression
that he paused abruptly and still holding cup
near his lids exclaimed 
why nydia nydia i say art thou ill or in
pain nay thy face speaks for thee what ails
my poor child as he spoke he put down 
cup and rose from his scat to approach her when
pompeii 
a sudden pang shot coldly to his heart and was
followed by a wild confused dizzy sensation at 
brain floor seemed to glide from under him
his feet seemed to move on air a mighty and
unearthly gladness rushed upon his spirit he felt
too buoyant for earth he longed for wings
nay it seemed in buoyancy his new existence
as if he possessed them he burst involuntarily
into a loud and thrilling laugh he clapped
his hands he bounded aloft heoas as a pythoness
inspired suddenly as it came this preternatural
transport passed though only partially assay
he now felt his blood rushing loudly and rapidly
through his veins it seemed to swell to exult 
to leap along as a stream that has burst its bounds
and hurries to ocean it throbbed in his ear
with a mighty sound he felt it mount to his brow
he felt veins in temples stretch and swell
as if they could no longer contain violent and
increasing tide then a kind darkness fell over
his eyes darkness but not entire for through
 dim shade he saw opposite walls glows out
and figures painted thereon seemed ghostlike

to creep and glide what alas most strange lie did
not feel himself ill he did not sink or quail beneath
 dread frenzy that was gathering over him
 novelty feelings seemed bright and
vivid he felt as if a younger health had been infused
into his frame he was gliding on to madness
 and he knew it not 
nydia had not answered his first question she
had not been able to reply his wild and fearful
laugh had roused her from her passionate suspense 
she could not see his fierce gesture she could
not mark his reeling and unsteady step as he paced
unconsciously to and fro but she heard broken
words incoherent insane that gushed from his
lips she became terrified and appalled she hastened
to him feeling with her arms until she
touched his knees and then falling on ground
she embraced them weeping with terror and excitation

oh speak to me speak you do not hate
me speak speak 
by bright goddess a beautiful land this
pompeii 
cyprus ho how they fill us with wine instead
 blood now they open veins faun
yonder to show how it bubbles and sparkles come
hither jolly old god thou rides on a goat eh 
what long silky hair he has he is worth all 
coursers parthia but a word with thee this
wine thine is too strong for us mortals oh
beautiful boughs are at rest i green waves
 forest have caught zephyr and drowned
him i not a breath stirs leaves and i view
 dreams sleeping with folded wings upon 
motionless oak and i look beyond and i see a
blue stream sparkle in silent noon a fountain 
a fountain springing aloft ah my fount thou
wilt not put out rays my grecian sun
though thou priest ever so hard with thy nimble
and silver arms and now what form steals yonder
through boughs she glides like a moonbeam 
she has a garland oakleaves on her head in
her hand is a vase upturned from which she pours
pink and tiny shells and sparkling waters oh
look on yon face man ne er before saw its like
 
see i we are alone only i and she in wide
forest there is no smile upon her lips she
moves grave and sweetly sad ha fly it is a
nymph it is one wild napaeae whoever
sees her becomes mad fly i see she discovers
me
oh i glaucus glaucus do you not know me 
rave not so wildly or thou wilt i'll me with a
word
a new change seemed now to operate upon
 jarring and disordered mind unfortunate
athenian he put his hands upon nydia's
silken hair he smoothed locks he looked
wistfully upon her face and then as in broken
chain thought one or two links were yet unsevered
it seemed that her countenance brought
its associations lone and with that remembrance
his madness became yet more powerful
and it was swayed and tinged by passion as he
burst forth 
i swear by venus by diana and by juno
that though i have now world on my shoulders
presiding over hills and woods
pompeii 
as my countryman hercules ah dull rome whoever
was truly great was greece why you would
be godless if it were not for us i say as my countryman
hercules had before me i would let it fall
into chaos for one smile from lone ah beautiful
adored he added in a voice inexpressibly fond
and plaintive thou lovest me not thou art unkind
to me egyptian hath belied me to
thee thou knowest not what hours i have spent
beneath thy casement thou knowest not how i
have outwatched stars thinking thou my
sun wouldst rise at and thou lovest me not
thou forsakes me oh do not leave me now 
i feel that my life will not be long let me gaze on
thee at least into i am bright
land thy fathers i have trod heights 
phyle i have gathered hyacinth and rose
amidst olive groves ulysses thou shouldst
not desert me for thy fathers were brothers to
my own and they say this land is lovely and
these climes serene but i will bear thee with me 
ho dark form why rises thou like a cloud
between me and mine death sits calmly dread
 
upon tliy brow on thy lip is smile that slays 
thy name is orcus but on earth men call thee
arbaces see i know thee fly dim shadow thy
spells avail not
glaucus i glaucus murmured nydia releasing
her hold and falling beneath excitement
 her dismay remorse and anguish insensible
on floor
who calls said he in a loud voice lone
it is she they have borne her off we will save
her where is my stilus ha i have it i
come lone to thy rescue i come i come 
so saying athenian with one bound passed
 portico he traversed house and rushed with
swift but vacillating steps and muttering audibly
to himself down starlit streets direful
potion burnt like fire in his veins for its effect was
made perhaps still more sudden from wine he
had drunk previously used to excesses 
nocturnal revellers citizens with smiles and
winks gave way to his reeling steps they naturally
imagined him under influence 
roman god not vainly worshipped at pompeii 
pipeii 
but they who looked twice upon his face started
in a nameless fear and smile withered from
their lips he passed more populous streets 
and pursuing mechanically way to lone's house
he traversed a more deserted quarter and entered
now lonely grove cybele in which appetites
had held his interview with olinthus
chapter vi
a reunion jjifyerent actors streams that
flowed apparently apart rush into one gulf
impatient to learn whether fell drug had
yet been administered by julia to his hated rival
and with what effect arbaces resolved as 
evening came on to seek her house and satisfy
his suspense it was customary as i have before
said for men at that time to carry abroad with
them tho tablets and stilus attached to their
girdle and vith girdle they were put off
when at home in fact under appearance 
a herary instrument romans carried about
with them in that same stilus a very sharp and
formidable weapon it was with his stilus that
from this stilus may be derived stiletto italians
pompeii 
cassius stabbed caesar in senatehouse inclining
then his girdle and his cloak arbaces left his
house supporting his steps which were still somewhat
feeble though hope and vengeance had conspired
greatly with his own medical science which
was profound to restore his natural strength by
his long staff arbaces took his way to villa 
diomed
and beautiful is moonlight south
in those climes night so quickly glides into
 day that twilight scarcely makes a bridge between
them one moment darker purple in 
sky a thousand rosehues in water 
shade half victorious over light and then burst
forth at once countless stars moon is up
night has resumed her reign 
brightly then and softly bright fell moonbeams
over antique grove consecrated to cybele
 stately trees whose date went beyond
tradition cast their long shadows over soil
while through openings in their boughs 
stars shone still and frequent whiteness 
 small sacellum in centre grove
 
amidst dark foliage had in it something abrupt
and startling it recalled at once purpose
to which wood was consecrated its holiness
and solemnity
with a swift and stealthy pace calenus gliding
under shade trees reached chapel
and gently putting back boughs that completely
closed around its rear settled himself in his concealment
 a concealment so complete what with
 fane in front and trees behind that no
unsuspicious passenger could possibly have detected
him again all was apparently solitary in
 grove afar oif you heard faintly voices 
some noisier revellers or music that played
cheerily to groups that then as now in those
climates during nights summer lingered in
 streets and enjoyed in fresh air and 
liquid moonlight a milder day
from height on which grove was placed
you saw through intervals trees 
broad and purple sea rippling in distance
 white villas stable in curving shore
and dim sectarian hills muffling with 
pompeii rl 
delicious sky presently tall figure arfaces
in his way to house diomed entered
 extreme grove and at same
instant appetites also bound to his appointment
with olinthus crossed egyptian's path
hem appetites said arbaces recognising
 priest at a glance when we met you
were my foe t have wished since then to see you
for i would have thee still my pupil and my friend's
appetites started at voice egyptian
and halting abruptly gazed upon him with a countenance
full contending bitter and scornful
emotions
villain and impostor v said he at length thou
hast recovered then from jaws grave
but think not again to weave around me thv
guilty meshes retiarius i am armed against
thee 
hush v said arbaces in a very low voice 
but his pride which in that descendant kings
was great betrayed wound it received from
 insulting epithets priest in quiver
 his lip and flush his tawny brow
 
hush more low thou mayest be overheard
and if other ears than mine had drunk those sounds
why
dost thou threaten what if whole city
had heard me 
 manes my ancestors woidd not have
suffered me to forgive thee but hold and hear
me thou art enraged that i would have offered
violence to thy sister nay peace peace but one
instant i pray thee thou art right it was 
frenzy passion and jealousy i have repented
bitterly my madness forgive me i who never
implored pardon living man beseech thee now to
forgive me nay i will atone insult i ask
thy sister in marriage start not consider what
is alliance yon holyday greek compared to
mine wealth unbounded birth that in its far
antiquity leaves your greek and roman names
 things yesterday science but that thou
knowest give me thy sister and my whole life
shall atone a moments error
egyptian were even i to consent my sister
loathes vcrv air thou breathes but i have
pompeii s
niy own wrongs to forgive i may pardon thee that
thou hast made me a tool to thy deceits but
never that thou hast seduced me to become 
abettor thy vices a polluted and a perjured
man tremble even now i prepare hour in
which thou and thy false gods shall be unveiled
thy lewd and circe life shall be dragged to day
thy mumming oracles disclosed fane 
 idol isis shall be a by word and a scorn 
royal name arbaces a mark for hooting
hisses execration tremble 
 flush on egyptian's broad was succeeded
by a livid paleness he looked behind before
around to feel assured that none was by and then
he fixed his dark and dilating eye on priest
with such a gaze wrath and menace that one
perhaps less supported than ascites by fervent
daring a divine zeal could not have
faced with unflinching look that lowering aspect
as it was however young convert met it
unmoved and returned it with an eye proud
defiance
appetites said egyptian in a tremulous
 
and inward tone beware what is it thou
wouldst meditate speakest thou reflect pause
before thou request from hasty influences 
wrath as yet divining no settled purpose or from
some fixed design 
i speak from inspiration true god
whose servant i now am answered christian
boldly and in knowledge that by his grace
human courage has already fixed date thy
hypocrisy and thy demon's worship ere thrice
 sun has dawned thou wilt know all dark
sorcerer tremble and farewell 
all fierce and lurid passions which he inherited
from his nation and his clime at all times but ill
concealed beneath blandness craft and 
coldness philosophy were released in breast
 egyptian rapidly one thought chased another
 he saw before him an obstinate barrier to
even a lawful alliance with lone fellowchampion
 glaucus in struggle which had baffled
his designs reviler his name threatened
desecrator goddess he served while he disbelieved
 avowed and approaching revealer 
pompeii 
his own impostures and vices his love his
repute nay his very ife might he in danger 
 day and horn seemed even to have been fixed
for some design against him he knew by 
words convert that apsecides had adopted
 christian faith he knew indomitable
zeal which led on proselytes that creed
such was his enemy he grasped his stilus 
that enemy was in his power they were now
before chapel one hasty glance once more
he cast around he saw none near silence and
solitude alike tempted him
die then in thy rashness he muttered 
away obstacle to my rushing fates 
and just as young christian had turned to
depart arbaces raised his hand high over left
shoulder appetites and plunged his sharp weapon
twice into his breast
apsecides fell to ground pierced to heart
he fell mute without even a groan at very
base sacred chapel
arbaces gazed upon him for a moment with 
fierce animal joy conquest over a foe but press
 
gently full sense clanger to avliich he was
exposed flashed upon him he wiped his weapon
carefully in long giass and with very garments
 his victim drew his cloak round him and
was about to depart when he saw coming up 
path right before him figure a young man
whose steps reeled and vacillated strangely as he
advanced quiet moonlight streamed full upon
his face which seemed by whitening ray colourless
as marble egyptian recognised 
face and form glaucus unfortunate and
benighted greek was chanting a disconnected
and mad song composed from snatches 
hymns and sacred odes all jarringly woven together

ha thought egyptian instantaneously
divining his state and its terrible cause so then
 helldraught works and destiny hath sent thee
hither to crush two my foes at once 
quickly even ere this thought occurred to him
he had withdrawn on one side chapel and
concealed himself amongst boughs from that
lurkingplace he watched as a tiger in its lair
pompeii 
 advance his second victim he noted 
wandering and restless fire in bright and beautiful
eyes athenian convulsions that distorted
his statuelike features and writhed his hueless
lip he saw that greek was utterly deprived
 reason nevertheless as glaucus came up to 
dead body appetites from which dark red
stream flowed slowly over grass so strange
and ghastly a spectacle could not fail to arrest him
benighted and erring as was his glimmering sense
he paused placed his hand to his brow as if to
collect himself and then saying 
what ho endymion steepest thou so soundly
 what has moon said to thee thou makes
me jealous it is time to wake he stooped down
with intention lifting up body
forgetting feeling not his own debility tke
egyptian sprung from his hidingplace and as 
greek bent struck him forcibly to ground
over very body christian then raising
his powerful voice to its loudest pitch he
shouted 
ho citizens ho help me run hither 
 
hither a murder a murder before your very
fane help or murderer escapes as he
spoke he placed his foot on breast glaucus
an idle and superfluous precaution for potion
operating with fall greek lay there
motionless and insensible save that now and
then his lips gave vent to some vague and raving
sounds
as he there stood awaiting coming those
his voice still continued to summon perhaps some
remorse some compunctious visiting for despite
his crimes he was human haunted breast 
 egyptian defenceless state glaucus 
his wandering words his riven reason smote him
even more than death appetites and he said
half audibly to himself 
poor clay poor human reason where is 
soul now i could spare thee o my rival rival
never more but destiny must be obeyed my safety
demands thy sacrifice with that as if to drown
compunction he shouted yet more loudly and
drawing from girdle glaucus stilus it
contained he steeped it in blood murdered
man and laid it beside corpse
pompeii 
and now fast and breathless several 
citizens came thronging to place some with
torches which moon rendered unnecessary
but which flared red and tremulously against 
darkness trees they surrounded 
spot
lift up yon corpse said egyptian and
guard well murderer
they raised body and great was their
horror and sacred indignation to discover in that
lifeless clay a priest adored and venerable
isis but still greater perhaps was their surprise
when they found accused in brilliant and
admired athenian
glaucus cried bystanders with one
accord is it even credible 
i would sooner whispered one man to his
neighbors believe it to be egyptian himself

here a centurion thrust himself into gathering
crowd with an air authority
how blood spilt who murderer 
 bystanders pointed to glaucus
 
he by mars he has rather air being
 victim who accuses him 
 said abates drawling himself up haughtily
and jewels which adorned his dress flashing in
 eyes soldier instantly convinced that
worthy warrior witness's respectability
pardon me your name said he
abates it is well known methinks in pompeii
passing through grove i beheld before
me greek and priest in earnest conversation
i was struck by reeling motions 
first his violent gestures and loudness his
voice he seemed to me either drunk or mad
suddenly i saw him raise his stilus darted
forward too late to arrest blow he had
twice stabbed his victim and was bending over
him when in my horror and indignation i struck
 murderer to ground he fell without a
struggle which makes me yet more suspect that he
was not altogether in his senses when crinu
was perpetrated for recently recovered from a
severe illness my blow was comparatively feeble
and frame glaucus as you see is strong
and youthful
pompeii 
his eyes are open now his liss move said
 soldier speak prisoner what sayest thou
to charge 
 charge ha ha why it was merrily
done when old hag set her serpent at me and
hecate stood by laughing from ear to ear what
could i do but i am ill i faint serpent's
fiery tongue hath bitten me bear me to bed and
send for your physician oldaesculapius himself
will attend me if you let him know that i am
greek oh mercy mercy i burn marrow
and brain i burn 
and with a thrilling and fierce groan athenian
fell back in arms bystanders
he raves said officer compassionately
and in his delirium he has struck priest
hath any one present seen him today
i said one spectators beheld him
in morning he passed my shop and accosted
me he seemed well and sane as stoutest
 us
and i saw him half an hour ago said another
passing up streets muttering to himself
 
avitli strange gestures and just as egyptian
had described
a corroboration witness it must be too
true he must at all events to praetor a pity
so young and so rich but crime is dreadful 
a priest isis in his very robes too and at 
base itself our most ancient chapel l
at these words crowd were reminded more
forcibly than in their excitement and curiosity
they had yet been heinousness sacrilege
they shuddered in pious horror
no wonder earth has quaked said one
when it held such a monster 
away with him to prison away cried
they all
and one solitary voice was heard shrilly and
joyously above rest
 beasts will not want a gladiator iow
 ho ho for merry morris show
it was voice young woman whose
conversation with medon has been repeated
true true it chances in season for 
games cried several and at that thought all
pipeii 
pity for accused seemed vanished his youth
his beauty but fitted him better for purpose
 arena
bring hither some planks or if at hand
a litter to bear dead said arbaces a
priest isis ought scarcely to be carried to
his temple by vulgar hands like a butchered
gladiator
at this bystanders reverently laid 
corpse appetites on ground with face
upwards and some them went in search 
some contrivance to bear body untouched by
 profane
it was just at that time that crowd gave
way to right and left as a sturdy form forced itself
through and olinthus christian stood immediately
confronting egjqtian but his
eyes at first only rested with inexpressible
grief and horror on that gory side and upturned
face on which agony violent death yet
lingered
murdered he said is it thy zeal that has
brought thee to this have they detected thy
vol ii o
 
noble purpose and by death prevented their own
shame 
he turned his head abruptly and his eyes fell
full on solemn features egyptian
as he looked you might see in his face and
even slight shiver his frame repugnance
and aversion which christian felt for
one whom he knew to be so dangerous and so
criminal it was indeed gaze bird
upon basilisk so silent was it and so prolonged
but shaking oif sudden chill that
had crept over him olinthus extended his right
arm towards arbaces and said in a deep and loud
voice 
murder hath been done upon this corpse 
where is murderer stand forth egyptian 
for as lord liveth i believe thoi art 
man 
an anxious and perturbed change might for one
moment be detected on dusky features 
arbaces but it gave way to frowning expression
 indignation and scorn as awed and
arrested by suddenness and vehemence 
pompeii 
charge spectators pressed nearer and nearer
upon two more prominent actors
i know said graces proudly who is my
accuser and i guess wherefore he thus arraigns me
men and citizens know this man for most bitter
 nazarenes if that or christians be their
proper name what marvel that in his malignity
he dares accuse even an egyptian murther
 a priest egypt 
i know him i know dog shouted
several voices it is olinthus christian or
rather atheist he denies gods 
peace brethren said olinthus with dignity
and hear me this murdered priest isis
before his death embraced christian faith 
he revealed to me dark sins sorceries 
yon egyptian mummers and delusions 
 fane isis he was about to declare them
publicly he a stranger unoffending without
enemies who should shed his blood but one
 those who feared his witness who might
fear that testimony most arbaces 
egyptian 
 
you hear him said arbaces you hear him 
he blasphemes ask him if he believe iu isis 
do i believe iii an evil demon returned olinthus
boldly
a groan and shudder past through assembly
nothing daunted for prepared at every time for
peril and in present excitement losing all
prudence christian continued 
back idolaters this clay is not for your vain
and polluting rites it is to us to followers
 christ that offices due to a christian
belong i claim this dust in name gieat
creator who has recalled spirit 
with so solemn and commanding a voice and
aspect christian spoke these words that even 
crowd forbore to utter aloud execration fear
and hatred which in their hearts they conceived
and never perhaps since lucifer and archangel
contended for body mighty lawgiver
was there a more striking subject for 
painter's genius than that scene exhibited 
dark trees stately fane moon full on 
corpse deceased torches tossing wildly
pompeii
to and fro in rear various faces 
motley audience insensible form athenian
supported in distance and in foreground
and above all forms arbaces and
 christian first drawn to his full height
far taller than herd around his arms folded
his brow knit his eyes fixed his lip slightly
curled in defiance and disdain bearing
on a brow worn and farrowed majesty an
equal command features stern yet frank 
 aspect bold yet open quiet dignity 
whole form impressed with an ineffable earnestness
hushed as it were in a solemn sympathy with 
awe he himself had created his left hand pointing
to corpse his right hand raised to
heaven
 centurion pressed forward again
in first place hast thou olinthus or
whatever be thy name any proof charge
thou hast made against arbaces beyond thy vague
suspicion 
olinthus remained silent egyptian laughed
contemptuously
 
dost thou claim body a priest isis
as one nazarene or christian sect 
i do
swear then by yon fane yon statue cybele
by yon most ancient sacellum in pompeii that
 dead man embraced your faith 
vain man i disown your idols i abhor your
temples how can i swear by cybele then 
away away with atheist away i 
earth will swallow us if we suffer these blasphemers
in a sacred grove away with him to death
to beasts added a female voice in 
centre crowd we shall have one apiece now
for lion and tiger 
if o nazarene thou disbelieve in cybele
which our gods dost thou own resumed 
soldier unmoved by cries around
none 
 hark to him hark cried crowd
o vain and blind continued christian
raising his voice can you believe in images 
wood and stone do you imagine that they have
eyes to see or ears to hear or hands to help ye 
pompeii
is yon minute thing carved by man's art a goddess
 hath it made mankind alas by mankind
was it made lo convince yourselves its
nothingness your folly 
and as he spoke he strode across to fane and
ere any bystanders were aware his purpose
he in his compassion or his zeal struck
 statue wood from its pedestal
see cried he your goddess cannot avenge
herself is this a thing to worship 
farther words were denied to him so gross and
daring a sacrilege one too most sacred 
their places worship filled even most lukewarm
with rage and horror with one accord 
crowd rushed upon him seized and but for 
interference centurion they would have
torn him to pieces
peace said soldier authoritatively 
refer we this insolent blasphemer to proper
tribunal time has been already wasted bear we
both culprits to magistrates place 
body priest on litter carry it to his
own home
 pompeii
at this moment a priest this stepped forward
 i claim these remains according to 
custom priesthood
 flamen be obeyed said centurion
how is murderer 
insensible or asleep
were his crime less i could pity him 
on
arbaces as he turned met eye that priest
 isis it was calenus and something there was
in that glance so significant and sinister that 
egyptian muttered to himself 
could he have witnessed deed 
a girl darted from crowd and gazed hard
on face olinthus by jupiter a stout
knave f i say we shall have a man for tiger
now one for each beast huzza 
huzza shouted mob a man for 
lion and another for tiger what luck 
huzza

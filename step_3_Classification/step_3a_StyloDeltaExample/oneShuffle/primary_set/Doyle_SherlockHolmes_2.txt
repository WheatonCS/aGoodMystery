so obvious that you
will find little credit to be gained out of this case

there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he
answered laughing besides we may chance to hit upon some
other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to
mr lestrade you know me too well to think that i am boasting
when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by
means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of
understanding to take the first example to hand i very clearly
perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand
side and yet i question whether mr lestrade would have noted
even so self-evident a thing as that

how on earth 

my dear fellow i know you well i know the military neatness
which characterises you you shave every morning and in this
season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less
and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until
it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the
jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated
than the other i could not imagine a man of your habits looking
at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a
result i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and
inference therein lies my métier and it is just possible that
it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before
us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in
the inquest and which are worth considering

what are they

it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after
the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary
informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not
surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts
this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any
traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the
coroner's jury

it was a confession i ejaculated

no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence

coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at
least a most suspicious remark

on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which i
can at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be
he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the
circumstances were very black against him had he appeared
surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i
should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such
surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances
and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man his
frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent
man or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and
firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not
unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of
his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day
so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and
even according to the little girl whose evidence is so
important to raise his hand as if to strike him the
self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark
appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a
guilty one

i shook my head many men have been hanged on far slighter
evidence i remarked

so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged

what is the young man's own account of the matter

it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters
though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive
you will find it here and may read it for yourself

he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire
paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the
paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own
statement of what had occurred i settled myself down in the
corner of the carriage and read it very carefully it ran in this
way

mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called
and gave evidence as follows i had been away from home for
three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the
morning of last monday the rd my father was absent from home at
the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he
had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom shortly after
my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and
looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out
of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was
going i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of
the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit
warren which is upon the other side on my way i saw william
crowder the game-keeper as he had stated in his evidence but
he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father i had
no idea that he was in front of me when about a hundred yards
from the pool i heard a cry of cooee which was a usual signal
between my father and myself i then hurried forward and found
him standing by the pool he appeared to be much surprised at
seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there a
conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows
for my father was a man of a very violent temper seeing that his
passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned
towards hatherley farm i had not gone more than yards
however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me
to run back again i found my father expiring upon the ground
with his head terribly injured i dropped my gun and held him in
my arms but he almost instantly expired i knelt beside him for
some minutes and then made my way to mr turner's lodge-keeper
his house being the nearest to ask for assistance i saw no one
near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by
his injuries he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and
forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no
active enemies i know nothing further of the matter

the coroner did your father make any statement to you before
he died

witness he mumbled a few words but i could only catch some
allusion to a rat

the coroner what did you understand by that

witness it conveyed no meaning to me i thought that he was
delirious

the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father
had this final quarrel

witness i should prefer not to answer

the coroner i am afraid that i must press it

witness it is really impossible for me to tell you i can
assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which
followed

the coroner that is for the court to decide i need not point
out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case
considerably in any future proceedings which may arise

witness i must still refuse

the coroner i understand that the cry of cooee was a common
signal between you and your father

witness it was

the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw
you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol

witness with considerable confusion i do not know

a juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions
when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father
fatally injured

witness nothing definite

the coroner what do you mean

witness i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into
the open that i could think of nothing except of my father yet
i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay
upon the ground to the left of me it seemed to me to be
something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps
when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was
gone

do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help

yes it was gone

you cannot say what it was

no i had a feeling something was there

how far from the body

a dozen yards or so

and how far from the edge of the wood

about the same

then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen
yards of it

yes but with my back towards it

this concluded the examination of the witness

i see said i as i glanced down the column that the coroner
in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy
he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his
father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his
refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and
his singular account of his father's dying words they are all
as he remarks very much against the son

holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon
the cushioned seat both you and the coroner have been at some
pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the
young man's favour don't you see that you alternately give him
credit for having too much imagination and too little too
little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would
give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from
his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying
reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth no
sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what
this young man says is true and we shall see whither that
hypothesis will lead us and now here is my pocket petrarch and
not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the
scene of action we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be
there in twenty minutes

it was nearly four o'clock when we at last after passing through
the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn
found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of ross a
lean ferret-like man furtive and sly-looking was waiting for
us upon the platform in spite of the light brown dustcoat and
leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic
surroundings i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of
scotland yard with him we drove to the hereford arms where a
room had already been engaged for us

i have ordered a carriage said lestrade as we sat over a cup
of tea i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be
happy until you had been on the scene of the crime

it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered it
is entirely a question of barometric pressure

lestrade looked startled i do not quite follow he said

how is the glass twenty-nine i see no wind and not a cloud
in the sky i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need
smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country
hotel abomination i do not think that it is probable that i
shall use the carriage to-night

lestrade laughed indulgently you have no doubt already formed
your conclusions from the newspapers he said the case is as
plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer
it becomes still of course one can't refuse a lady and such a
very positive one too she has heard of you and would have your
opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing
which you could do which i had not already done why bless my
soul here is her carriage at the door

he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the
most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life her
violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her
cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her
overpowering excitement and concern

oh mr sherlock holmes she cried glancing from one to the
other of us and finally with a woman's quick intuition
fastening upon my companion i am so glad that you have come i
have driven down to tell you so i know that james didn't do it
i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it
too never let yourself doubt upon that point we have known each
other since we were little children and i know his faults as no
one else does but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly such a
charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him

i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes
you may rely upon my doing all that i can

but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion
do you not see some loophole some flaw do you not yourself
think that he is innocent

i think that it is very probable

there now she cried throwing back her head and looking
defiantly at lestrade you hear he gives me hopes

lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am afraid that my colleague
has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said

but he is right oh i know that he is right james never did
it and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the
reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because
i was concerned in it

in what way asked holmes

it is no time for me to hide anything james and his father had
many disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that
there should be a marriage between us james and i have always
loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young
and has seen very little of life yet and and well he
naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet so there
were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them

and your father asked holmes was he in favour of such a
union

no he was averse to it also no one but mr mccarthy was in
favour of it a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as
holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her

thank you for this information said he may i see your father
if i call to-morrow

i am afraid the doctor won't allow it

the doctor

yes have you not heard poor father has never been strong for
years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken
to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his
nervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive
who had known dad in the old days in victoria

ha in victoria that is important

yes at the mines

quite so at the gold-mines where as i understand mr turner
made his money

yes certainly

thank you miss turner you have been of material assistance to
me

you will tell me if you have any news to-morrow no doubt you
will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do
tell him that i know him to be innocent

i will miss turner

i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if
i leave him good-bye and god help you in your undertaking she
hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we
heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street

i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a
few minutes silence why should you raise up hopes which you
are bound to disappoint i am not over-tender of heart but i
call it cruel

i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said
holmes have you an order to see him in prison

yes but only for you and me

then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out we have
still time to take a train to hereford and see him to-night

ample

then let us do so watson i fear that you will find it very
slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours

i walked down to the station with them and then wandered through
the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel
where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a
yellow-backed novel the puny plot of the story was so thin
however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were
groping and i found my attention wander so continually from the
action to the fact that i at last flung it across the room and
gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the
day supposing that this unhappy young man's story were
absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely
unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between
the time when he parted from his father and the moment when
drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade it was
something terrible and deadly what could it be might not the
nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts
i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which
contained a verbatim account of the inquest in the surgeon's
deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left
parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon i marked the spot
upon my own head clearly such a blow must have been struck from
behind that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when
seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father still it
did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his
back before the blow fell still it might be worth while to call
holmes attention to it then there was the peculiar dying
reference to a rat what could that mean it could not be
delirium a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become
delirious no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how
he met his fate but what could it indicate i cudgelled my
brains to find some possible explanation and then the incident
of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy if that were true the
murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his
overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to
return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was
kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off what a
tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was i
did not wonder at lestrade's opinion and yet i had so much faith
in sherlock holmes insight that i could not lose hope as long
as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young
mccarthy's innocence

it was late before sherlock holmes returned he came back alone
for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town

the glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down
it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able
to go over the ground on the other hand a man should be at his
very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not
wish to do it when fagged by a long journey i have seen young
mccarthy

and what did you learn from him

nothing

could he throw no light

none at all i was inclined to think at one time that he knew
who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced
now that he is as puzzled as everyone else he is not a very
quick-witted youth though comely to look at and i should think
sound at heart

i cannot admire his taste i remarked if it is indeed a fact
that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as
this miss turner

ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale this fellow is madly
insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was
only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away
five years at a boarding-school what does the idiot do but get
into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a
registry office no one knows a word of the matter but you can
imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not
doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows
to be absolutely impossible it was sheer frenzy of this sort
which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father
at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss
turner on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself
and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would
have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth it was with
his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in
bristol and his father did not know where he was mark that
point it is of importance good has come out of evil however
for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious
trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and
has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the
bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them i
think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all
that he has suffered

but if he is innocent who has done it

ah who i would call your attention very particularly to two
points one is that the murdered man had an appointment with
someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his
son for his son was away and he did not know when he would
return the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry
cooee before he knew that his son had returned those are the
crucial points upon which the case depends and now let us talk
about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all
minor matters until to-morrow

there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke
bright and cloudless at nine o'clock lestrade called for us with
the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe
pool

there is serious news this morning lestrade observed it is
said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is
despaired of

an elderly man i presume said holmes

about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life
abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this
business has had a very bad effect upon him he was an old friend
of mccarthy's and i may add a great benefactor to him for i
have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free

indeed that is interesting said holmes

oh yes in a hundred other ways he has helped him everybody
about here speaks of his kindness to him

really does it not strike you as a little singular that this
mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have
been under such obligations to turner should still talk of
marrying his son to turner's daughter who is presumably
heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner
as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would
follow it is the more strange since we know that turner himself
was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not
deduce something from that

we have got to the deductions and the inferences said
lestrade winking at me i find it hard enough to tackle facts
holmes without flying away after theories and fancies

you are right said holmes demurely you do find it very hard
to tackle the facts

anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it
difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth

and that is 

that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that
all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine

well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said holmes
laughing but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley
farm upon the left

yes that is it it was a widespread comfortable-looking
building two-storied slate-roofed with great yellow blotches
of lichen upon the grey walls the drawn blinds and the smokeless
chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight
of this horror still lay heavy upon it we called at the door
when the maid at holmes request showed us the boots which her
master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the
son's though not the pair which he had then had having measured
these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes
desired to be led to the court-yard from which we all followed
the winding track which led to boscombe pool

sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent
as this men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of
baker street would have failed to recognise him his face flushed
and darkened his brows were drawn into two hard black lines
while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter
his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips
compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long
sinewy neck his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal
lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated
upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell
unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick
impatient snarl in reply swiftly and silently he made his way
along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of
the woods to the boscombe pool it was damp marshy ground as is
all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon
the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either
side sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and
once he made quite a little detour into the meadow lestrade and
i walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous
while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the
conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a
definite end

the boscombe pool which is a little reed-girt sheet of water
some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the
hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner
above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see
the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich
landowner's dwelling on the hatherley side of the pool the woods
grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass
twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
which lined the lake lestrade showed us the exact spot at which
the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground
that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the
fall of the stricken man to holmes as i could see by his eager
face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read
upon the trampled grass he ran round like a dog who is picking
up a scent and then turned upon my companion

what did you go into the pool for he asked

i fished about with a rake i thought there might be some weapon
or other trace but how on earth 

oh tut tut i have no time that left foot of yours with its
inward twist is all over the place a mole could trace it and
there it vanishes among the reeds oh how simple it would all
have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo
and wallowed all over it here is where the party with the
lodge-keeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or
eight feet round the body but here are three separate tracks of
the same feet he drew out a lens and lay down upon his
waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to
himself than to us these are young mccarthy's feet twice he
was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are
deeply marked and the heels hardly visible that bears out his
story he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are
the father's feet as he paced up and down what is this then it
is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening and this
ha ha what have we here tiptoes tiptoes square too quite
unusual boots they come they go they come again of course
that was for the cloak now where did they come from he ran up
and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we
were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a
great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood holmes traced
his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
his face with a little cry of satisfaction for a long time he
remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks
gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and
examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of
the tree as far as he could reach a jagged stone was lying among
the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained then
he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the
highroad where all traces were lost

it has been a case of considerable interest he remarked
returning to his natural manner i fancy that this grey house on
the right must be the lodge i think that i will go in and have a
word with moran and perhaps write a little note having done
that we may drive back to our luncheon you may walk to the cab
and i shall be with you presently

it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove
back into ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he
had picked up in the wood

this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out
the murder was done with it

i see no marks

there are none

how do you know then

the grass was growing under it it had only lain there a few
days there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken it
corresponds with the injuries there is no sign of any other
weapon

and the murderer

is a tall man left-handed limps with the right leg wears
thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak smokes indian
cigars uses a cigar-holder and carries a blunt pen-knife in his
pocket there are several other indications but these may be
enough to aid us in our search

lestrade laughed i am afraid that i am still a sceptic he
said theories are all very well but we have to deal with a
hard-headed british jury

nous verrons answered holmes calmly you work your own
method and i shall work mine i shall be busy this afternoon
and shall probably return to london by the evening train

and leave your case unfinished

no finished

but the mystery

it is solved

who was the criminal then

the gentleman i describe

but who is he

surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a
populous neighbourhood

lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am a practical man he said
and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking
for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg i should become the
laughing-stock of scotland yard

all right said holmes quietly i have given you the chance
here are your lodgings good-bye i shall drop you a line before
i leave

having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where
we found lunch upon the table holmes was silent and buried in
thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds
himself in a perplexing position

look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit
down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little i don't
know quite what to do and i should value your advice light a
cigar and let me expound

 pray do so

well now in considering this case there are two points about
young mccarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly
although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one
was the fact that his father should according to his account
cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying
reference to a rat he mumbled several words you understand but
that was all that caught the son's ear now from this double
point our research must commence and we will begin it by
presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true

what of this cooee then

well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the
son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chance that
he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the
attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but
cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used
between australians there is a strong presumption that the
person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was
someone who had been in australia

what of the rat then

sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened
it out on the table this is a map of the colony of victoria
he said i wired to bristol for it last night he put his hand
over part of the map what do you read

arat i read

and now he raised his hand

ballarat

quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his
son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter
the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat

it is wonderful i exclaimed

it is obvious and now you see i had narrowed the field down
considerably the possession of a grey garment was a third point
which granting the son's statement to be correct was a
certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite
conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak

certainly

and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only
be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could
hardly wander

quite so

then comes our expedition of to-day by an examination of the
ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that
imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal

but how did you gain them

you know my method it is founded upon the observation of
trifles

his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length
of his stride his boots too might be told from their traces

yes they were peculiar boots

but his lameness

the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than
his left he put less weight upon it why because he limped he
was lame

but his left-handedness

you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded
by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from
immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can
that be unless it were by a left-handed man he had stood behind
that tree during the interview between the father and son he had
even smoked there i found the ash of a cigar which my special
knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian
cigar i have as you know devoted some attention to this and
written a little monograph on the ashes of different
varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found the
ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
where he had tossed it it was an indian cigar of the variety
which are rolled in rotterdam

and the cigar-holder

i could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefore he
used a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the
cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt pen-knife

holmes i said you have drawn a net round this man from which
he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as
truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him i see the
direction in which all this points the culprit is 

mr john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of
our sitting-room and ushering in a visitor

the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure his
slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of
decrepitude and yet his hard deep-lined craggy features and
his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual
strength of body and of character his tangled beard grizzled
hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air
of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an
ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were
tinged with a shade of blue it was clear to me at a glance that
he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease

pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently you had my
note

yes the lodge-keeper brought it up you said that you wished to
see me here to avoid scandal

i thought people would talk if i went to the hall

and why did you wish to see me he looked across at my
companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question
was already answered

yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words it
is so i know all about mccarthy

the old man sank his face in his hands god help me he cried
but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you
my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at
the assizes

i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely

i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it
would break her heart it will break her heart when she hears
that i am arrested

it may not come to that said holmes

what

i am no official agent i understand that it was your daughter
who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests
young mccarthy must be got off however

i am a dying man said old turner i have had diabetes for
years my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a
month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol

holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand
and a bundle of paper before him just tell us the truth he
said i shall jot down the facts you will sign it and watson
here can witness it then i could produce your confession at the
last extremity to save young mccarthy i promise you that i shall
not use it unless it is absolutely needed

it's as well said the old man it's a question whether i
shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but i
should wish to spare alice the shock and now i will make the
thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but
will not take me long to tell

you didn't know this dead man mccarthy he was a devil
incarnate i tell you that god keep you out of the clutches of
such a man as he his grip has been upon me these twenty years
and he has blasted my life i'll tell you first how i came to be
in his power

it was in the early 's at the diggings i was a young chap
then hot-blooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at
anything i got among bad companions took to drink had no luck
with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you
would call over here a highway robber there were six of us and
we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time
to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings
black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our party
is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang

one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and
we lay in wait for it and attacked it there were six troopers
and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of
their saddles at the first volley three of our boys were killed
however before we got the swag i put my pistol to the head of
the wagon-driver who was this very man mccarthy i wish to the
lord that i had shot him then but i spared him though i saw his
wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every
feature we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made
our way over to england without being suspected there i parted
from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and
respectable life i bought this estate which chanced to be in
the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money
to make up for the way in which i had earned it i married too
and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice
even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down
the right path as nothing else had ever done in a word i turned
over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past all was
going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me

i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in
regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his
foot

here we are jack says he touching me on the arm we'll be
as good as a family to you there's two of us me and my son and
you can have the keeping of us if you don't it's a fine
law-abiding country is england and there's always a policeman
within hail

well down they came to the west country there was no shaking
them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land
ever since there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness
turn where i would there was his cunning grinning face at my
elbow it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more
afraid of her knowing my past than of the police whatever he
wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without
question land money houses until at last he asked a thing
which i could not give he asked for alice

his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was
known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that
his lad should step into the whole property but there i was
firm i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that
i had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that
was enough i stood firm mccarthy threatened i braved him to do
his worst we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses
to talk it over

when i went down there i found him talking with his son so i
smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone
but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in
me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my
daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she
were a slut from off the streets it drove me mad to think that i
and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a
man as this could i not snap the bond i was already a dying and
a desperate man though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb
i knew that my own fate was sealed but my memory and my girl
both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue i
did it mr holmes i would do it again deeply as i have sinned
i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it but that my girl
should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
than i could suffer i struck him down with no more compunction
than if he had been some foul and venomous beast his cry brought
back his son but i had gained the cover of the wood though i
was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in
my flight that is the true story gentlemen of all that
occurred

well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man
signed the statement which had been drawn out i pray that we
may never be exposed to such a temptation

i pray not sir and what do you intend to do

in view of your health nothing you are yourself aware that you
will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the
assizes i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is
condemned i shall be forced to use it if not it shall never be
seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or
dead shall be safe with us

farewell then said the old man solemnly your own deathbeds
when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace
which you have given to mine tottering and shaking in all his
giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room

god help us said holmes after a long silence why does fate
play such tricks with poor helpless worms i never hear of such
a case as this that i do not think of baxter's words and say
there but for the grace of god goes sherlock holmes

james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a
number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and
submitted to the defending counsel old turner lived for seven
months after our interview but he is now dead and there is
every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily
together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their
past



adventure v the five orange pips

when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes
cases between the years and i am faced by so many which
present strange and interesting features that it is no easy
matter to know which to choose and which to leave some however
have already gained publicity through the papers and others have
not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend
possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of
these papers to illustrate some too have baffled his
analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without
an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and
have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and
surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
him there is however one of these last which was so remarkable
in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted
to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are
points in connection with it which never have been and probably
never will be entirely cleared up

the year furnished us with a long series of cases of greater
or less interest of which i retain the records among my
headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the
adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant
society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a
furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the
british barque sophy anderson of the singular adventures of the
grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the
camberwell poisoning case in the latter as may be remembered
sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead man's watch to
prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that
therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time a
deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the
case all these i may sketch out at some future date but none of
them present such singular features as the strange train of
circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe

it was in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales
had set in with exceptional violence all day the wind had
screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that
even here in the heart of great hand-made london we were forced
to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and
to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which
shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like
untamed beasts in a cage as evening drew in the storm grew
higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in
the chimney sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the
fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime while i at the
other was deep in one of clark russell's fine sea-stories until
the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text
and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of
the sea waves my wife was on a visit to her mother's and for a
few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker
street

why said i glancing up at my companion that was surely the
bell who could come to-night some friend of yours perhaps

except yourself i have none he answered i do not encourage
visitors

a client then

if so it is a serious case nothing less would bring a man out
on such a day and at such an hour but i take it that it is more
likely to be some crony of the landlady's

sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there
came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door he
stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and
towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit

come in said he

the man who entered was young some two-and-twenty at the
outside well-groomed and trimly clad with something of
refinement and delicacy in his bearing the streaming umbrella
which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told
of the fierce weather through which he had come he looked about
him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and i could see that his
face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is
weighed down with some great anxiety

i owe you an apology he said raising his golden pince-nez to
his eyes i trust that i am not intruding i fear that i have
brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug
chamber

give me your coat and umbrella said holmes they may rest
here on the hook and will be dry presently you have come up from
the south-west i see

yes from horsham

that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is
quite distinctive

i have come for advice

that is easily got

and help

that is not always so easy

i have heard of you mr holmes i heard from major prendergast
how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal

ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards

he said that you could solve anything

he said too much

that you are never beaten

i have been beaten four times three times by men and once by a
woman

but what is that compared with the number of your successes

it is true that i have been generally successful

then you may be so with me

i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me
with some details as to your case

it is no ordinary one

none of those which come to me are i am the last court of
appeal

and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you
have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of
events than those which have happened in my own family

you fill me with interest said holmes pray give us the
essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards
question you as to those details which seem to me to be most
important

the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out
towards the blaze

my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have
as far as i can understand little to do with this awful
business it is a hereditary matter so in order to give you an
idea of the facts i must go back to the commencement of the
affair

you must know that my grandfather had two sons my uncle elias
and my father joseph my father had a small factory at coventry
which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling he
was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business
met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire
upon a handsome competence

my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and
became a planter in florida where he was reported to have done
very well at the time of the war he fought in jackson's army
and afterwards under hood where he rose to be a colonel when
lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where
he remained for three or four years about or he came
back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham
he had made a very considerable fortune in the states and his
reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his
dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to
them he was a singular man fierce and quick-tempered very
foul-mouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring
disposition during all the years that he lived at horsham i
doubt if ever he set foot in the town he had a garden and two or
three fields round his house and there he would take his
exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave
his room he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very
heavily but he would see no society and did not want any
friends not even his own brother

he didn't mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the
time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so this
would be in the year after he had been eight or nine years
in england he begged my father to let me live with him and he
was very kind to me in his way when he was sober he used to be
fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would
make me his representative both with the servants and with the
tradespeople so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite
master of the house i kept all the keys and could go where i
liked and do what i liked so long as i did not disturb him in
his privacy there was one singular exception however for he
had a single room a lumber-room up among the attics which was
invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or
anyone else to enter with a boy's curiosity i have peeped
through the keyhole but i was never able to see more than such a
collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such
a room

one day it was in march a letter with a foreign stamp
lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate it was not a
common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all
paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort from
india said he as he took it up pondicherry postmark what can
this be opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little
dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate i began to
laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight
of his face his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his
skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he
still held in his trembling hand k k k he shrieked and
then my god my god my sins have overtaken me

what is it uncle i cried

death said he and rising from the table he retired to his
room leaving me palpitating with horror i took up the envelope
and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the
gum the letter k three times repeated there was nothing else
save the five dried pips what could be the reason of his
overpowering terror i left the breakfast-table and as i
ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key
which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small
brass box like a cashbox in the other

they may do what they like but i'll checkmate them still
said he with an oath tell mary that i shall want a fire in my
room to-day and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer

i did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to
step up to the room the fire was burning brightly and in the
grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned
paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it as i
glanced at the box i noticed with a start that upon the lid was
printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the
envelope

i wish you john said my uncle to witness my will i leave
my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to
my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to
you if you can enjoy it in peace well and good if you find you
cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest
enemy i am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing but i can't
say what turn things are going to take kindly sign the paper
where mr fordham shows you

i signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with
him the singular incident made as you may think the deepest
impression upon me and i pondered over it and turned it every
way in my mind without being able to make anything of it yet i
could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left
behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed
and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives i
could see a change in my uncle however he drank more than ever
and he was less inclined for any sort of society most of his
time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the
inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy
and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a
revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man
and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by
man or devil when these hot fits were over however he would
rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him
like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror
which lies at the roots of his soul at such times i have seen
his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it
were new raised from a basin

well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to
abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those
drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when
we went to search for him face downward in a little
green-scummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there
was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep
so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity
brought in a verdict of suicide but i who knew how he winced
from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself
that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed
however and my father entered into possession of the estate and
of some pounds which lay to his credit at the bank

one moment holmes interposed your statement is i foresee
one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened let me
have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and
the date of his supposed suicide

the letter arrived on march his death was seven weeks
later upon the night of may nd

thank you pray proceed

when my father took over the horsham property he at my
request made a careful examination of the attic which had been
always locked up we found the brass box there although its
contents had been destroyed on the inside of the cover was a
paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and
letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath
these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had
been destroyed by colonel openshaw for the rest there was
nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many
scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in
america some of them were of the war time and showed that he had
done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier
others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern
states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had
evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag
politicians who had been sent down from the north

well it was the beginning of when my father came to live at
horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the
january of on the fourth day after the new year i heard my
father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the
breakfast-table there he was sitting with a newly opened
envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the
outstretched palm of the other one he had always laughed at what
he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel but he looked
very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
himself

why what on earth does this mean john he stammered

my heart had turned to lead it is k k k said i

he looked inside the envelope so it is he cried here are
the very letters but what is this written above them

put the papers on the sundial i read peeping over his
shoulder

what papers what sundial he asked

the sundial in the garden there is no other said i but the
papers must be those that are destroyed

pooh said he gripping hard at his courage we are in a
civilised land here and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind
where does the thing come from

from dundee i answered glancing at the postmark

some preposterous practical joke said he what have i to do
with sundials and papers i shall take no notice of such
nonsense

i should certainly speak to the police i said

and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort

then let me do so

no i forbid you i won't have a fuss made about such
nonsense

it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate
man i went about however with a heart which was full of
forebodings

on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went
from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is
in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill i was glad
that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from
danger when he was away from home in that however i was in
error upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram
from the major imploring me to come at once my father had
fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the
neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull i
hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered
his consciousness he had as it appears been returning from
fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him
and the chalk-pit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in
bringing in a verdict of death from accidental causes
carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death i
was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of
murder there were no signs of violence no footmarks no
robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads
and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease
and that i was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been
woven round him

in this sinister way i came into my inheritance you will ask me
why i did not dispose of it i answer because i was well
convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an
incident in my uncle's life and that the danger would be as
pressing in one house as in another

it was in january that my poor father met his end and two
years and eight months have elapsed since then during that time
i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that
this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended
with the last generation i had begun to take comfort too soon
however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in
which it had come upon my father

the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and
turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried
orange pips

this is the envelope he continued the postmark is
london eastern division within are the very words which were
upon my father's last message k k k and then put the
papers on the sundial

what have you done asked holmes

nothing

nothing

to tell the truth he sank his face into his thin white
hands i have felt helpless i have felt like one of those poor
rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it i seem to be in
the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight
and no precautions can guard against

tut tut cried sherlock holmes you must act man or you are
lost nothing but energy can save you this is no time for
despair

i have seen the police

ah

but they listened to my story with a smile i am convinced that
the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all
practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really
accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with
the warnings

holmes shook his clenched hands in the air incredible
imbecility he cried

they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in
the house with me

has he come with you to-night

no his orders were to stay in the house

again holmes raved in the air

why did you come to me he cried and above all why did you
not come at once

i did not know it was only to-day that i spoke to major
prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to
you

it is really two days since you had the letter we should have
acted before this you have no further evidence i suppose than
that which you have placed before us no suggestive detail which
might help us

there is one thing said john openshaw he rummaged in his coat
pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured blue-tinted
paper he laid it out upon the table i have some remembrance
said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i
observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the
ashes were of this particular colour i found this single sheet
upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it
may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from
among the others and in that way has escaped destruction beyond
the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much i think
myself that it is a page from some private diary the writing is
undoubtedly my uncle's

holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper
which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from
a book it was headed march and beneath were the
following enigmatical notices

th hudson came same old platform

th set the pips on mccauley paramore and
 john swain of st augustine

th mccauley cleared

th john swain cleared

th visited paramore all well

thank you said holmes folding up the paper and returning it
to our visitor and now you must on no account lose another
instant we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told
me you must get home instantly and act

what shall i do

there is but one thing to do it must be done at once you must
put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass
box which you have described you must also put in a note to say
that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that
this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such
words as will carry conviction with them having done this you
must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do
you understand

entirely

do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present i
think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our
web to weave while theirs is already woven the first
consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens
you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the
guilty parties

i thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his
overcoat you have given me fresh life and hope i shall
certainly do as you advise

do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself in
the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that
you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger how do you
go back

by train from waterloo

it is not yet nine the streets will be crowded so i trust that
you may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too
closely

i am armed

that is well to-morrow i shall set to work upon your case

i shall see you at horsham then

no your secret lies in london it is there that i shall seek
it

then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news
as to the box and the papers i shall take your advice in every
particular he shook hands with us and took his leave outside
the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered
against the windows this strange wild story seemed to have come
to us from amid the mad elements blown in upon us like a sheet
of sea-weed in a gale and now to have been reabsorbed by them
once more

sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk
forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire then he
lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue
smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling

i think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we
have had none more fantastic than this

save perhaps the sign of four

well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems
to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the
sholtos

but have you i asked formed any definite conception as to
what these perils are

there can be no question as to their nature he answered

then what are they who is this k k k and why does he pursue
this unhappy family

sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the
arms of his chair with his finger-tips together the ideal
reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a
single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the
chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which
would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe a whole
animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who
has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents
should be able to accurately state all the other ones both
before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the
reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study
which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the
aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest
pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to
utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this
in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all
knowledge which even in these days of free education and
encyclopaedias is a somewhat rare accomplishment it is not so
impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge
which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have
endeavoured in my case to do if i remember rightly you on one
occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits
in a very precise fashion

yes i answered laughing it was a singular document
philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i
remember botany variable geology profound as regards the
mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry
eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime
records unique violin-player boxer swordsman lawyer and
self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco those i think were the
main points of my analysis

holmes grinned at the last item well he said i say now as
i said then that a man should keep his little brain-attic
stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the
rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library where he
can get it if he wants it now for such a case as the one which
has been submitted to us to-night we need certainly to muster
all our resources kindly hand me down the letter k of the
american encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you
thank you now let us consider the situation and see what may be
deduced from it in the first place we may start with a strong
presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for
leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their
habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for
the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love
of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of
someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis
that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from
america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by
considering the formidable letters which were received by himself
and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those
letters

the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the
third from london

from east london what do you deduce from that

they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship

excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that
the probability the strong probability is that the writer was
on board of a ship and now let us consider another point in the
case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and
its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days
does that suggest anything

a greater distance to travel

but the letter had also a greater distance to come

then i do not see the point

there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man
or men are is a sailing-ship it looks as if they always send
their singular warning or token before them when starting upon
their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign
when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in a
steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter
but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed i think that those
seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which
brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the
writer

it is possible

more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly
urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to
caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which
it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one
comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay

good god i cried what can it mean this relentless
persecution

the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital
importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship i think
that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them
a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way
as to deceive a coroner's jury there must have been several in
it and they must have been men of resource and determination
their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may
in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an
individual and becomes the badge of a society

but of what society

have you never said sherlock holmes bending forward and
sinking his voice have you never heard of the ku klux klan

i never have

holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee here it
is said he presently

ku klux klan a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to
the sound produced by cocking a rifle this terrible secret
society was formed by some ex-confederate soldiers in the
southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local
branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee
louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida its power was
used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of
the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country
of those who were opposed to its views its outrages were usually
preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
but generally recognised shape a sprig of oak-leaves in some
parts melon seeds or orange pips in others on receiving this
the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might
fly from the country if he braved the matter out death would
unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and
unforeseen manner so perfect was the organisation of the
society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a
case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with
impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the
perpetrators for some years the organisation flourished in spite
of the efforts of the united states government and of the better
classes of the community in the south eventually in the year
 the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have
been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date

you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that
the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the
disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers it may
well have been cause and effect it is no wonder that he and his
family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track
you can understand that this register and diary may implicate
some of the first men in the south and that there may be many
who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered

then the page we have seen 

is such as we might expect it ran if i remember right sent
the pips to a b and c that is sent the society's warning to
them then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or
left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a
sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let
some light into this dark place and i believe that the only
chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have
told him there is nothing more to be said or to be done
to-night so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for
half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable
ways of our fellow-men


it had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a
subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the
great city sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came
down

you will excuse me for not waiting for you said he i have i
foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of
young openshaw's

what steps will you take i asked

it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries
i may have to go down to horsham after all

you will not go there first

no i shall commence with the city just ring the bell and the
maid will bring up your coffee

as i waited i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and
glanced my eye over it it rested upon a heading which sent a
chill to my heart

holmes i cried you are too late

ah said he laying down his cup i feared as much how was it
done he spoke calmly but i could see that he was deeply moved

my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading tragedy
near waterloo bridge here is the account

between nine and ten last night police-constable cook of the h
division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and
a splash in the water the night however was extremely dark and
stormy so that in spite of the help of several passers-by it
was quite impossible to effect a rescue the alarm however was
given and by the aid of the water-police the body was
eventually recovered it proved to be that of a young gentleman
whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his
pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham
it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch
the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and
the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge
of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats the body
exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that
the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident
which should have the effect of calling the attention of the
authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages

we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and
shaken than i had ever seen him

that hurts my pride watson he said at last it is a petty
feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride it becomes a personal
matter with me now and if god sends me health i shall set my
hand upon this gang that he should come to me for help and that
i should send him away to his death he sprang from his chair
and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a
flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and
unclasping of his long thin hands

they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last how could
they have decoyed him down there the embankment is not on the
direct line to the station the bridge no doubt was too
crowded even on such a night for their purpose well watson
we shall see who will win in the long run i am going out now

to the police

no i shall be my own police when i have spun the web they may
take the flies but not before

all day i was engaged in my professional work and it was late in
the evening before i returned to baker street sherlock holmes
had not come back yet it was nearly ten o'clock before he
entered looking pale and worn he walked up to the sideboard
and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously
washing it down with a long draught of water

you are hungry i remarked

starving it had escaped my memory i have had nothing since
breakfast

nothing

not a bite i had no time to think of it

and how have you succeeded

well

you have a clue

i have them in the hollow of my hand young openshaw shall not
long remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish
trade-mark upon them it is well thought of

what do you mean

he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he
squeezed out the pips upon the table of these he took five and
thrust them into an envelope on the inside of the flap he wrote
s h for j o then he sealed it and addressed it to captain
james calhoun barque lone star savannah georgia

that will await him when he enters port said he chuckling
it may give him a sleepless night he will find it as sure a
precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him

and who is this captain calhoun

the leader of the gang i shall have the others but he first

how did you trace it then

he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with
dates and names

i have spent the whole day said he over lloyd's registers
and files of the old papers following the future career of every
vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in
 there were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were
reported there during those months of these one the lone star
instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported
as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to
one of the states of the union

texas i think

i was not and am not sure which but i knew that the ship must
have an american origin

what then

i searched the dundee records and when i found that the barque
lone star was there in january my suspicion became a
certainty i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present
in the port of london

yes

the lone star had arrived here last week i went down to the
albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by
the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah i wired
to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and
as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the
goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight

what will you do then

oh i have my hand upon him he and the two mates are as i
learn the only native-born americans in the ship the others are
finns and germans i know also that they were all three away
from the ship last night i had it from the stevedore who has
been loading their cargo by the time that their sailing-ship
reaches savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter and
the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these
three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder

there is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans
and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the
orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as
resolute as themselves was upon their track very long and very
severe were the equinoctial gales that year we waited long for
news of the lone star of savannah but none ever reached us we
did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a
shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough
of a wave with the letters l s carved upon it and that is
all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone star



adventure vi the man with the twisted lip

isa whitney brother of the late elias whitney dd principal
of the theological college of st george's was much addicted to
opium the habit grew upon him as i understand from some
foolish freak when he was at college for having read de
quincey's description of his dreams and sensations he had
drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the
same effects he found as so many more have done that the
practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many
years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object of
mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives i can see
him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pin-point
pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble
man

one night it was in june there came a ring to my bell
about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the
clock i sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needle-work
down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment

a patient said she you'll have to go out

i groaned for i was newly come back from a weary day

we heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps
upon the linoleum our own door flew open and a lady clad in
some dark-coloured stuff with a black veil entered the room

you will excuse my calling so late she began and then
suddenly losing her self-control she ran forward threw her arms
about my wife's neck and sobbed upon her shoulder oh i'm in
such trouble she cried i do so want a little help

why said my wife pulling up her veil it is kate whitney
how you startled me kate i had not an idea who you were when
you came in

i didn't know what to do so i came straight to you that was
always the way folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds
to a light-house

it was very sweet of you to come now you must have some wine
and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or
should you rather that i sent james off to bed

oh no no i want the doctor's advice and help too it's about
isa he has not been home for two days i am so frightened about
him

it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her
husband's trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend
and school companion we soothed and comforted her by such words
as we could find did she know where her husband was was it
possible that we could bring him back to her

it seems that it was she had the surest information that of late
he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the
farthest east of the city hitherto his orgies had always been
confined to one day and he had come back twitching and
shattered in the evening but now the spell had been upon him
eight-and-forty hours and he lay there doubtless among the
dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the
effects there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar
of gold in upper swandam lane but what was she to do how could
she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and
pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him

there was the case and of course there was but one way out of
it might i not escort her to this place and then as a second
thought why should she come at all i was isa whitney's medical
adviser and as such i had influence over him i could manage it
better if i were alone i promised her on my word that i would
send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the
address which she had given me and so in ten minutes i had left
my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me and was speeding
eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at
the time though the future only could show how strange it was to
be

but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my
adventure upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the
high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east
of london bridge between a slop-shop and a gin-shop approached
by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the
mouth of a cave i found the den of which i was in search
ordering my cab to wait i passed down the steps worn hollow in
the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet and by the
light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door i found the latch
and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the
brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the
forecastle of an emigrant ship

through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying
in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads
thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a
dark lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer out of the black
shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright
now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of
the metal pipes the most lay silent but some muttered to
themselves and others talked together in a strange low
monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then
suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own
thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour at
the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal beside
which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old
man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his elbows upon
his knees staring into the fire

as i entered a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe
for me and a supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth

thank you i have not come to stay said i there is a friend
of mine here mr isa whitney and i wish to speak with him

there was a movement and an exclamation from my right and
peering through the gloom i saw whitney pale haggard and
unkempt staring out at me

my god it's watson said he he was in a pitiable state of
reaction with every nerve in a twitter i say watson what
o'clock is it

nearly eleven

of what day

of friday june th

good heavens i thought it was wednesday it is wednesday what
d'you want to frighten a chap for he sank his face onto his
arms and began to sob in a high treble key

i tell you that it is friday man your wife has been waiting
this two days for you you should be ashamed of yourself

so i am but you've got mixed watson for i have only been here
a few hours three pipes four pipes i forget how many but i'll
go home with you i wouldn't frighten kate poor little kate
give me your hand have you a cab

yes i have one waiting

then i shall go in it but i must owe something find what i
owe watson i am all off colour i can do nothing for myself

i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of
sleepers holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying
fumes of the drug and looking about for the manager as i passed
the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my
skirt and a low voice whispered walk past me and then look
back at me the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear i
glanced down they could only have come from the old man at my
side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very
wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between
his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his
fingers i took two steps forward and looked back it took all my
self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
astonishment he had turned his back so that none could see him
but i his form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull
eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and
grinning at my surprise was none other than sherlock holmes he
made a slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he
turned his face half round to the company once more subsided
into a doddering loose-lipped senility

holmes i whispered what on earth are you doing in this den

as low as you can he answered i have excellent ears if you
would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend
of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with
you

i have a cab outside

then pray send him home in it you may safely trust him for he
appears to be too limp to get into any mischief i should
recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to
say that you have thrown in your lot with me if you will wait
outside i shall be with you in five minutes

it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes requests for
they were always so exceedingly definite and put forward with
such a quiet air of mastery i felt however that when whitney
was once confined in the cab my mission was practically
accomplished and for the rest i could not wish anything better
than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular
adventures which were the normal condition of his existence in a
few minutes i had written my note paid whitney's bill led him
out to the cab and seen him driven through the darkness in a
very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den
and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes for two
streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot
then glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and
burst into a hearty fit of laughter

i suppose watson said he that you imagine that i have added
opium-smoking to cocaine injections and all the other little
weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical
views

i was certainly surprised to find you there

but not more so than i to find you

i came to find a friend

and i to find an enemy

an enemy

yes one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural
prey briefly watson i am in the midst of a very remarkable
inquiry and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent
ramblings of these sots as i have done before now had i been
recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an
hour's purchase for i have used it before now for my own
purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have
vengeance upon me there is a trap-door at the back of that
building near the corner of paul's wharf which could tell some
strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless
nights

what you do not mean bodies

ay bodies watson we should be rich men if we had pounds
for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den it
is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside and i fear that
neville st clair has entered it never to leave it more but our
trap should be here he put his two forefingers between his
teeth and whistled shrilly a signal which was answered by a
similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle
of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs

now watson said holmes as a tall dog-cart dashed up through
the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from
its side lanterns you'll come with me won't you

if i can be of use

oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still
more so my room at the cedars is a double-bedded one

the cedars

yes that is mr st clair's house i am staying there while i
conduct the inquiry

where is it then

near lee in kent we have a seven-mile drive before us

but i am all in the dark

of course you are you'll know all about it presently jump up
here all right john we shall not need you here's half a
crown look out for me to-morrow about eleven give her her
head so long then

he flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through
the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets which
widened gradually until we were flying across a broad
balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly
beneath us beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and
mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of
the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of
revellers a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a
star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of
the clouds holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his
breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought while i sat
beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which
seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in
upon the current of his thoughts we had driven several miles
and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban
villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoulders and lit up
his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he
is acting for the best

you have a grand gift of silence watson said he it makes
you quite invaluable as a companion pon my word it is a great
thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are
not over-pleasant i was wondering what i should say to this dear
little woman to-night when she meets me at the door

you forget that i know nothing about it

i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before
we get to lee it seems absurdly simple and yet somehow i can
get nothing to go upon there's plenty of thread no doubt but i
can't get the end of it into my hand now i'll state the case
clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see a
spark where all is dark to me

proceed then

some years ago to be definite in may there came to lee
a gentleman neville st clair by name who appeared to have
plenty of money he took a large villa laid out the grounds very
nicely and lived generally in good style by degrees he made
friends in the neighbourhood and in he married the daughter
of a local brewer by whom he now has two children he had no
occupation but was interested in several companies and went into
town as a rule in the morning returning by the from cannon
street every night mr st clair is now thirty-seven years of
age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very
affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know
him i may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far
as we have been able to ascertain amount to pounds s while
he has pounds standing to his credit in the capital and
counties bank there is no reason therefore to think that money
troubles have been weighing upon his mind

last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier
than usual remarking before he started that he had two important
commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy
home a box of bricks now by the merest chance his wife
received a telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his
departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable
value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the
offices of the aberdeen shipping company now if you are well up
in your london you will know that the office of the company is
in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where
you found me to-night mrs st clair had her lunch started for
the city did some shopping proceeded to the company's office
got her packet and found herself at exactly walking through
swandam lane on her way back to the station have you followed me
so far

it is very clear

if you remember monday was an exceedingly hot day and mrs st
clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab
as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself
while she was walking in this way down swandam lane she suddenly
heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her
husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning
to her from a second-floor window the window was open and she
distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly
agitated he waved his hands frantically to her and then
vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that
he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind
one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town
in he had on neither collar nor necktie

convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the
steps for the house was none other than the opium den in which
you found me to-night and running through the front room she
attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor at
the foot of the stairs however she met this lascar scoundrel of
whom i have spoken who thrust her back and aided by a dane who
acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street filled
with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the
lane and by rare good-fortune met in fresno street a number of
constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat the
inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the
continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to
the room in which mr st clair had last been seen there was no
sign of him there in fact in the whole of that floor there was
no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who
it seems made his home there both he and the lascar stoutly
swore that no one else had been in the front room during the
afternoon so determined was their denial that the inspector was
staggered and had almost come to believe that mrs st clair had
been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box
which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it out there fell
a cascade of children's bricks it was the toy which he had
promised to bring home

this discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple
showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious
the rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an
abominable crime the front room was plainly furnished as a
sitting-room and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon
the back of one of the wharves between the wharf and the bedroom
window is a narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered
at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water the
bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below on
examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill
and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of
the bedroom thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were
all the clothes of mr neville st clair with the exception of
his coat his boots his socks his hat and his watch all were
there there were no signs of violence upon any of these
garments and there were no other traces of mr neville st
clair out of the window he must apparently have gone for no
other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon
the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by
swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of
the tragedy

and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately
implicated in the matter the lascar was known to be a man of the
vilest antecedents but as by mrs st clair's story he was
known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few
seconds of her husband's appearance at the window he could
hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime his defence
was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no
knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone his lodger and that he
could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
gentleman's clothes

so much for the lascar manager now for the sinister cripple who
lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was
certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st
clair his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which
is familiar to every man who goes much to the city he is a
professional beggar though in order to avoid the police
regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas some
little distance down threadneedle street upon the left-hand
side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the
wall here it is that this creature takes his daily seat
cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he
is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the
greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him i
have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of
making his professional acquaintance and i have been surprised
at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time his
appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him
without observing him a shock of orange hair a pale face
disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has
turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a
pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular
contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid
the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he
is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be
thrown at him by the passers-by this is the man whom we now
learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been
the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest

but a cripple said i what could he have done single-handed
against a man in the prime of life

he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in
other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man
surely your medical experience would tell you watson that
weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional
strength in the others

pray continue your narrative

mrs st clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the
window and she was escorted home in a cab by the police as her
presence could be of no help to them in their investigations
inspector barton who had charge of the case made a very careful
examination of the premises but without finding anything which
threw any light upon the matter one mistake had been made in not
arresting boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes
during which he might have communicated with his friend the
lascar but this fault was soon remedied and he was seized and
searched without anything being found which could incriminate
him there were it is true some blood-stains upon his right
shirt-sleeve but he pointed to his ring-finger which had been
cut near the nail and explained that the bleeding came from
there adding that he had been to the window not long before and
that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from
the same source he denied strenuously having ever seen mr
neville st clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in
his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police as to
mrs st clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband
at the window he declared that she must have been either mad or
dreaming he was removed loudly protesting to the
police-station while the inspector remained upon the premises in
the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue

and it did though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they
had feared to find it was neville st clair's coat and not
neville st clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded and
what do you think they found in the pockets

i cannot imagine

no i don't think you would guess every pocket stuffed with
pennies and half-pennies pennies and half-pennies it
was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide but a
human body is a different matter there is a fierce eddy between
the wharf and the house it seemed likely enough that the
weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked
away into the river

but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the
room would the body be dressed in a coat alone

no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough suppose
that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the
window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed
what would he do then it would of course instantly strike him
that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments he would seize
the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it
would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has little
time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried
to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his
lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street
there is not an instant to be lost he rushes to some secret
hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he
stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the
pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking he throws it out and
would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard
the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the
window when the police appeared

it certainly sounds feasible

well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a
better boone as i have told you was arrested and taken to the
station but it could not be shown that there had ever before
been anything against him he had for years been known as a
professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very
quiet and innocent one there the matter stands at present and
the questions which have to be solved what neville st clair was
doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is
he now and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearance are
all as far from a solution as ever i confess that i cannot
recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties

while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of
events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great
town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and
we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us
just as he finished however we drove through two scattered
villages where a few lights still glimmered in the windows

we are on the outskirts of lee said my companion we have
touched on three english counties in our short drive starting in
middlesex passing over an angle of surrey and ending in kent
see that light among the trees that is the cedars and beside
that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already i have
little doubt caught the clink of our horse's feet

but why are you not conducting the case from baker street i
asked

because there are many inquiries which must be made out here
mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and
you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for
my friend and colleague i hate to meet her watson when i have
no news of her husband here we are whoa there whoa

we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its
own grounds a stable-boy had run out to the horse's head and
springing down i followed holmes up the small winding
gravel-drive which led to the house as we approached the door
flew open and a little blonde woman stood in the opening clad
in some sort of light mousseline de soie with a touch of fluffy
pink chiffon at her neck and wrists she stood with her figure
outlined against the flood of light one hand upon the door one
half-raised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head
and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips a standing
question

well she cried well and then seeing that there were two
of us she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw
that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders

no good news

none

no bad

no

thank god for that but come in you must be weary for you have
had a long day

this is my friend dr watson he has been of most vital use to
me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it
possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this
investigation

i am delighted to see you said she pressing my hand warmly
you will i am sure forgive anything that may be wanting in our
arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so
suddenly upon us

my dear madam said i i am an old campaigner and if i were
not i can very well see that no apology is needed if i can be of
any assistance either to you or to my friend here i shall be
indeed happy

now mr sherlock holmes said the lady as we entered a
well-lit dining-room upon the table of which a cold supper had
been laid out i should very much like to ask you one or two
plain questions to which i beg that you will give a plain
answer

certainly madam

do not trouble about my feelings i am not hysterical nor given
to fainting i simply wish to hear your real real opinion

upon what point

in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive

sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question
frankly now she repeated standing upon the rug and looking
keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair

frankly then madam i do not

you think that he is dead

i do

murdered

i don't say that perhaps

and on what day did he meet his death

on monday

then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how
it is that i have received a letter from him to-day

sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been
galvanised

what he roared

yes to-day she stood smiling holding up a little slip of
paper in the air

may i see it

certainly

he snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out
upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently i
had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder the
envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend
postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day
before for it was considerably after midnight

coarse writing murmured holmes surely this is not your
husband's writing madam

no but the enclosure is

i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go
and inquire as to the address

how can you tell that

the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried
itself the rest is of the greyish colour which shows that
blotting-paper has been used if it had been written straight
off and then blotted none would be of a deep black shade this
man has written the name and there has then been a pause before
he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not
familiar with it it is of course a trifle but there is
nothing so important as trifles let us now see the letter ha
there has been an enclosure here

yes there was a ring his signet-ring

and you are sure that this is your husband's hand

one of his hands

one

his hand when he wrote hurriedly it is very unlike his usual
writing and yet i know it well

dearest do not be frightened all will come well there is a
huge error which it may take some little time to rectify
wait in patience neville written in pencil upon the fly-leaf
of a book octavo size no water-mark hum posted to-day in
gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb ha and the flap has been
gummed if i am not very much in error by a person who had been
chewing tobacco and you have no doubt that it is your husband's
hand madam

none neville wrote those words

and they were posted to-day at gravesend well mrs st clair
the clouds lighten though i should not venture to say that the
danger is over

but he must be alive mr holmes

unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent
the ring after all proves nothing it may have been taken from
him

no no it is it is his very own writing

very well it may however have been written on monday and only
posted to-day

that is possible

if so much may have happened between

oh you must not discourage me mr holmes i know that all is
well with him there is so keen a sympathy between us that i
should know if evil came upon him on the very day that i saw him
last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet i in the dining-room
rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that
something had happened do you think that i would respond to such
a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death

i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman
may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical
reasoner and in this letter you certainly have a very strong
piece of evidence to corroborate your view but if your husband
is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away
from you

i cannot imagine it is unthinkable

and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you

no

and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane

very much so

was the window open

yes

then he might have called to you

he might

he only as i understand gave an inarticulate cry

yes

a call for help you thought

yes he waved his hands

but it might have been a cry of surprise astonishment at the
unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands

it is possible

and you thought he was pulled back

he disappeared so suddenly

he might have leaped back you did not see anyone else in the
room

no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and
the lascar was at the foot of the stairs

quite so your husband as far as you could see had his
ordinary clothes on

but without his collar or tie i distinctly saw his bare
throat

had he ever spoken of swandam lane

never

had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium

never

thank you mrs st clair those are the principal points about
which i wished to be absolutely clear we shall now have a little
supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day
to-morrow

a large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our
disposal and i was quickly between the sheets for i was weary
after my night of adventure sherlock holmes was a man however
who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for
days and even for a week without rest turning it over
rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view
until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his
data were insufficient it was soon evident to me that he was now
preparing for an all-night sitting he took off his coat and
waistcoat put on a large blue dressing-gown and then wandered
about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from
the sofa and armchairs with these he constructed a sort of
eastern divan upon which he perched himself cross-legged with
an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front
of him in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there an
old briar pipe between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the
corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him
silent motionless with the light shining upon his strong-set
aquiline features so he sat as i dropped off to sleep and so he
sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up and i found
the summer sun shining into the apartment the pipe was still
between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was
full of a dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap of
shag which i had seen upon the previous night

awake watson he asked

yes

game for a morning drive

certainly

then dress no one is stirring yet but i know where the
stable-boy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out he
chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed
a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night

as i dressed i glanced at my watch it was no wonder that no one
was stirring it was twenty-five minutes past four i had hardly
finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was
putting in the horse

i want to test a little theory of mine said he pulling on his
boots i think watson that you are now standing in the
presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe i deserve
to be kicked from here to charing cross but i think i have the
key of the affair now

and where is it i asked smiling

in the bathroom he answered oh yes i am not joking he
continued seeing my look of incredulity i have just been
there and i have taken it out and i have got it in this
gladstone bag come on my boy and we shall see whether it will
not fit the lock

we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into
the bright morning sunshine in the road stood our horse and
trap with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head we both
sprang in and away we dashed down the london road a few country
carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but
the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as
some city in a dream

it has been in some points a singular case said holmes
flicking the horse on into a gallop i confess that i have been
as blind as a mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than
never to learn it at all

in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily
from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey
side passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the
river and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the
right and found ourselves in bow street sherlock holmes was well
known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted
him one of them held the horse's head while the other led us in

who is on duty asked holmes

inspector bradstreet sir

ah bradstreet how are you a tall stout official had come
down the stone-flagged passage in a peaked cap and frogged
jacket i wish to have a quiet word with you bradstreet
certainly mr holmes step into my room here it was a small
office-like room with a huge ledger upon the table and a
telephone projecting from the wall the inspector sat down at his
desk

what can i do for you mr holmes

i called about that beggarman boone the one who was charged
with being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st
clair of lee

yes he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries

so i heard you have him here

in the cells

is he quiet

oh he gives no trouble but he is a dirty scoundrel

dirty

yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his
face is as black as a tinker's well when once his case has been
settled he will have a regular prison bath and i think if you
saw him you would agree with me that he needed it

i should like to see him very much

would you that is easily done come this way you can leave
your bag

no i think that i'll take it

very good come this way if you please he led us down a
passage opened a barred door passed down a winding stair and
brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each
side

the third on the right is his said the inspector here it
is he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door
and glanced through

he is asleep said he you can see him very well

we both put our eyes to the grating the prisoner lay with his
face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing slowly and
heavily he was a middle-sized man coarsely clad as became his
calling with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his
tattered coat he was as the inspector had said extremely
dirty but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its
repulsive ugliness a broad wheal from an old scar ran right
across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up
one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in a
perpetual snarl a shock of very bright red hair grew low over
his eyes and forehead

he's a beauty isn't he said the inspector

he certainly needs a wash remarked holmes i had an idea that
he might and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me
he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my
astonishment a very large bath-sponge

he he you are a funny one chuckled the inspector

now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable
figure

well i don't know why not said the inspector he doesn't
look a credit to the bow street cells does he he slipped his
key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell the
sleeper half turned and then settled down once more into a deep
slumber holmes stooped to the water-jug moistened his sponge
and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the
prisoner's face

let me introduce you he shouted to mr neville st clair of
lee in the county of kent

never in my life have i seen such a sight the man's face peeled
off under the sponge like the bark from a tree gone was the
coarse brown tint gone too was the horrid scar which had
seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the
repulsive sneer to the face a twitch brought away the tangled
red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale
sad-faced refined-looking man black-haired and smooth-skinned
rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment
then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and
threw himself down with his face to the pillow

great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing
man i know him from the photograph

the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons
himself to his destiny be it so said he and pray what am i
charged with

with making away with mr neville st oh come you can't be
charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of
it said the inspector with a grin well i have been
twenty-seven years in the force but this really takes the cake

if i am mr neville st clair then it is obvious that no crime
has been committed and that therefore i am illegally
detained

no crime but a very great error has been committed said
holmes you would have done better to have trusted your wife

it was not the wife it was the children groaned the prisoner
god help me i would not have them ashamed of their father my
god what an exposure what can i do

sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him
kindly on the shoulder

if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up said
he of course you can hardly avoid publicity on the other hand
if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible
case against you i do not know that there is any reason that the
details should find their way into the papers inspector
bradstreet would i am sure make notes upon anything which you
might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities the case
would then never go into court at all

god bless you cried the prisoner passionately i would have
endured imprisonment ay even execution rather than have left
my miserable secret as a family blot to my children

you are the first who have ever heard my story my father was a
schoolmaster in chesterfield where i received an excellent
education i travelled in my youth took to the stage and
finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london one day
my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the
metropolis and i volunteered to supply them there was the point
from which all my adventures started it was only by trying
begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to
base my articles when an actor i had of course learned all the
secrets of making up and had been famous in the green-room for
my skill i took advantage now of my attainments i painted my
face and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good
scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a
small slip of flesh-coloured plaster then with a red head of
hair and an appropriate dress i took my station in the business
part of the city ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a
beggar for seven hours i plied my trade and when i returned
home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no
less than s d

i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until
some time later i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ
served upon me for pounds i was at my wit's end where to get
the money but a sudden idea came to me i begged a fortnight's
grace from the creditor asked for a holiday from my employers
and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise in
ten days i had the money and had paid the debt

well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous
work at pounds a week when i knew that i could earn as much in
a day by smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on
the ground and sitting still it was a long fight between my
pride and the money but the dollars won at last and i threw up
reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first
chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets
with coppers only one man knew my secret he was the keeper of a
low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane where i could
every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings
transform myself into a well-dressed man about town this fellow
a lascar was well paid by me for his rooms so that i knew that
my secret was safe in his possession

well very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of
money i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london
could earn pounds a year which is less than my average
takings but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making
up and also in a facility of repartee which improved by
practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city
all day a stream of pennies varied by silver poured in upon me
and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take pounds

as i grew richer i grew more ambitious took a house in the
country and eventually married without anyone having a
suspicion as to my real occupation my dear wife knew that i had
business in the city she little knew what

last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my
room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw
to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the
street with her eyes fixed full upon me i gave a cry of
surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my
confidant the lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from
coming up to me i heard her voice downstairs but i knew that
she could not ascend swiftly i threw off my clothes pulled on
those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig even a wife's
eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise but then it
occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and that
the clothes might betray me i threw open the window reopening
by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in
the bedroom that morning then i seized my coat which was
weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from
the leather bag in which i carried my takings i hurled it out of
the window and it disappeared into the thames the other clothes
would have followed but at that moment there was a rush of
constables up the stair and a few minutes after i found rather
i confess to my relief that instead of being identified as mr
neville st clair i was arrested as his murderer

i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain i
was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and
hence my preference for a dirty face knowing that my wife would
be terribly anxious i slipped off my ring and confided it to the
lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together
with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to
fear

that note only reached her yesterday said holmes

good god what a week she must have spent

the police have watched this lascar said inspector bradstreet
and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to
post a letter unobserved probably he handed it to some sailor
customer of his who forgot all about it for some days

that was it said holmes nodding approvingly i have no doubt
of it but have you never been prosecuted for begging

many times but what was a fine to me

it must stop here however said bradstreet if the police are
to hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boone

i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take

in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps
may be taken but if you are found again then all must come out
i am sure mr holmes that we are very much indebted to you for
having cleared the matter up i wish i knew how you reach your
results

i reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five
pillows and consuming an ounce of shag i think watson that if
we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast



vii the adventure of the blue carbuncle

i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second
morning after christmas with the intention of wishing him the
compliments of the season he was lounging upon the sofa in a
purple dressing-gown a pipe-rack within his reach upon the
right and a pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly
studied near at hand beside the couch was a wooden chair and
on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable
hard-felt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several
places a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
purpose of examination

you are engaged said i perhaps i interrupt you

not at all i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss
my results the matter is a perfectly trivial one he jerked his
thumb in the direction of the old hat but there are points in
connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and
even of instruction

i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows
were thick with the ice crystals i suppose i remarked that
homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to
it that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of
some mystery and the punishment of some crime

no no no crime said sherlock holmes laughing only one of
those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have
four million human beings all jostling each other within the
space of a few square miles amid the action and reaction of so
dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events
may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be
presented which may be striking and bizarre without being
criminal we have already had experience of such

so much so i remarked that of the last six cases which i
have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any
legal crime

precisely you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler
papers to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the
adventure of the man with the twisted lip well i have no doubt
that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category
you know peterson the commissionaire

yes

it is to him that this trophy belongs

it is his hat

no no he found it its owner is unknown i beg that you will
look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual
problem and first as to how it came here it arrived upon
christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is i
have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of peterson's
fire the facts are these about four o'clock on christmas
morning peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was
returning from some small jollification and was making his way
homeward down tottenham court road in front of him he saw in
the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and
carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder as he reached the
corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger
and a little knot of roughs one of the latter knocked off the
man's hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and
swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him
peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his
assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and
seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him
dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the
labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham
court road the roughs had also fled at the appearance of
peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of
battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this
battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose

which surely he restored to their owner

my dear fellow there lies the problem it is true that for
mrs henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to
the bird's left leg and it is also true that the initials h
b are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are
some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in
this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any
one of them

what then did peterson do

he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning
knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me
the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs
that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it
should be eaten without unnecessary delay its finder has carried
it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose
while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who
lost his christmas dinner

did he not advertise

no

then what clue could you have as to his identity

only as much as we can deduce

from his hat

precisely

but you are joking what can you gather from this old battered
felt

here is my lens you know my methods what can you gather
yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this
article

i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
ruefully it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round
shape hard and much the worse for wear the lining had been of
red silk but was a good deal discoloured there was no maker's
name but as holmes had remarked the initials h b were
scrawled upon one side it was pierced in the brim for a
hat-securer but the elastic was missing for the rest it was
cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places
although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
discoloured patches by smearing them with ink

i can see nothing said i handing it back to my friend

on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail
however to reason from what you see you are too timid in
drawing your inferences

then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat

he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective
fashion which was characteristic of him it is perhaps less
suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there
are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others
which represent at least a strong balance of probability that
the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the
face of it and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the
last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days he
had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a
moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his
fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink
at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that
his wife has ceased to love him

my dear holmes

he has however retained some degree of self-respect he
continued disregarding my remonstrance he is a man who leads a
sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is
middle-aged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the
last few days and which he anoints with lime-cream these are
the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat also
by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid
on in his house

you are certainly joking holmes

not in the least is it possible that even now when i give you
these results you are unable to see how they are attained

i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i
am unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that

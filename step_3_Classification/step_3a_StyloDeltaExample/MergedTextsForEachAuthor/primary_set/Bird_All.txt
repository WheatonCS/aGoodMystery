introduction


nature and the memory of strange deeds of renown have flung over the
valley of mexico a charm more romantic than is attached to many of the
vales of the olden world for though historic association and the spell
of poetry have consecrated the borders of leman and the laurel groves of
tempe and providence has touched both with the finger of beauty yet
does our fancy in either dwell upon objects which are not so much the
adjuvants of romance as of sentiment in both we gather food rather for
feeling than imagination we live over thoughts which are generated by
memory and our conceptions are the reproductions of experience but
poetry has added no plenary charm history has cast no over-sufficient
light on the haunts of montezuma on the valley of lakes though filled
with the hum of life the mysteries of backward years are yet brooding
and the marvels of human destiny are whispered to our ears in the sigh
of every breeze in the rustling of every tree which it stirs on the
shore and in the sound of every ripple it curls up on the lake one
chapter only of its history and that how full of marvels has been
written or preserved the rest is a blank a single chain of
vicissitudes a few consecutive links in the concatenation of
events have escaped the rest is a secret strange captivating and
pregnant of possibilities this is the proper field for romantic
musings

so at least thought a traveller or to speak more strictly a
rambler whose idle wanderings from place to place directed by ennui
or whim did not deserve the name of travels who sat one pleasant
evening of october - on the hill of chapoltepec regarding the
spectacle which is disclosed from the summit of that fair promontory

the hum of the city came faintly to his ear the church-towers flung
their long shadows over the gardened roofs the wildfowl flapped the
white wing over the distant sheets of water which stretched in a
chain from chalco to san cristobal the shouts of indian boatmen were
heard at a distance on the canal of la viga and the dark forms of
others trotting along the causeway that borders it were seen returning
to their huts among the chinampas quiet stole over the valley the
lizard crept to his hole the bat woke up in the ruined chambers of the
viceroy's palace that crowns the hill of chapoltepec or started away
from his den among the leaves of those mossy majestic and indeed
colossal cypresses which at its base overshadow the graves of aztec
kings and sultanas at last the vesper-bells sounded in the city and
the sun stooped under the western hills leaving his rays still
glittering with such hues as are only seen in a land of mountains on
the grand peaks of popocatepetl and the white woman the farthest but
yet the noblest summits of all in that girdle of mountain magnificence
which seems to shut out mexico from the rest of the world

as these bright tints faded into a mellow and harmonious lustre casting
a sort of radiant obscurity over vale and mountain lake and steeple
the thoughts of the wanderer for the romance of the spectacle and the
hour had pervaded his imagination crept back to the ages of antiquity
and to those mystic races of men the earliest of the land who had
built their cities and dug their graves in this alpine paradise now
possessed by a race of whom their world had not dreamed he gazed and
mused until fancy peopled the scene around him with spectral life and
his spirit's eye was opened on spectacles never more to be revealed to
the corporeal organ it opened on the day when the land was a
wilderness shaking for the first time under the foot of a stranger and
he beheld as in a vision the various emigrations and irruptions into
the vale of men born in other climates they came like the tides of
ocean and as such passed away like shadows and so departed the
history of ages was compressed into the representation of a moment and
an hundred generations assembled together as one people rushed by in
successive apparitions

first over the distant ridges of nochistongo there stole or seemed to
steal a multitude of men worn with travel yet bearing idols on their
backs in whose honour for now they had reached their land of promise
they built huge pyramids to outlive their gods and themselves and
scattering over the whole plain covered it at once with cornfields and
cities the historian for this unknown race brought with it science as
well as religion sat him in the grove to trace the pictured annals of
his age the astronomer ascended to the tower to observe the heavens
and calculate the seasons of the new land while the multitude
forgetting the austere climes of their nativity sat down in peace and
joy under the vines and fruit-trees that made their place of habitation
so beautiful thus they rested and multiplied until the barbarians of
the hills the earlier races and perhaps the aborigines of the
land descended to take counsel of their wisdom and follow in the ways
of civilization then came a cloud bringing a pestilence in whose hot
breath the rivers vanished the lakes turned to dust and the mountains
to volcanoes the trees crackled and fell as before a conflagration and
men lay scorched with the leaves as thick and as dead on the plain
and the few who had strength to fly betook themselves to the hills and
the seaside to forget their miseries and their arts and become
barbarians thus began and thus ended in mexico the race of
toltecs the first and the most civilized of which mexican
hieroglyphics the legacy of this buried people to their
successors have preserved the memory

but the rains fell at last the lakes filled the forests grew and
other tribes the chechemecs and acolhuacans with others many in
number and strangers to each other coming from the same distant north
but bringing not the civilization of the first pilgrims sat in their
seats and mingling together into one people began at last after long
seasons of barbarism to emerge from the gloom of ignorance and acquire
the arts and understand the destinies of man

to these came by the same trodden path a herd of men ruder than any
who had yet visited the southern valleys aztecs in family but
called by their neighbours and foes nahuatlacas or people of the
lakes consisting of many tribes the chief of which was that which
bore upon a throne of bulrushes an image of the god mexitli the
destroyer from whom in its days of grandeur it took its name from
this crew of savages the most benighted and blood-thirsty and at
first the feeblest of all so base that history presents them as the
only nation of bondmen known to the region of anahuac and so sordid
that in the festivals of religion they could provide for their deity
only the poor offering of a knife and flower fated now to fight the
battles of their task-masters and now condemned to knead the bread of
independence from the fetid plants and foul reptiles of the lake from
this herd of barbarians grew as it seemed in a moment's space the
vast the powerful and in many respects the magnificent empire of the
montezumas in his mind's eye the stranger could perceive the salt
tezcuco restored to its ancient limits beating again upon the porphyry
hill on which he sat and the city of the island with her hundred
temples and her thousand towers rising from the shadows and heaving
again with the impulses of nascent civilization it was at this moment
when the travail of centuries was about to be recompensed when the
carved statue the work of many successive pygmalions was beginning to
breathe the breath and feel the instincts of moral animation that a
mysterious destiny trampled upon the little spark and crushed to atoms
the body it was warming from the eastern hills came the voice of the
old world the sound of the battle-trumpet the smoke of artillery
rolled over the lake and in a moment more the shout of conquest and
glory was answered by the groan of a dying nation

as this revery ended in the brain of the stranger and the conqueror and
the captive of the vision vanished away together he began to contrast
in his mind the past condition of the new world with the present and
particularly of those two portions which at the time of their
invasion had outlived the barbarism of nature and were teeming with
the evidences of incipient greatness as for this fair valley of mexico
there was scarcely an object either of beauty or utility the creation
of christian wants or christian taste to be seen for which his memory
could not trace a rival or superior which existed in the day of
paganism the maize fields the maguey plantations the orchards and
flower-gardens that beautify the plains and sweeping slopes these
were here long ages ago with the many villages that glisten among
them all indeed but the white church and steeple the lakes which are
now noisome pools were they not lovelier when they covered the
pestilential fens and when the rose-garden floated over their blue
surface the long rows of trees marking the line of the great
calzadas or causeways the approaches to mezico but poorly supply
the place of aboriginal groves the haunts of the doe and the
centzontli while the calzadas themselves stretching along over bog and
morass have entirely lost the charm they possessed when washed on
either side by rolling surges even the aqueducts though they sprang
not from arch to arch over the valley as at the present time were not
wanting and where the church spires of the metropolis pierce the
heaven the sacred tabernacles of the gods rose from the summits of
pyramids the changes in the physical spectacle among the valleys of
peru were perhaps not much greater but what happy mutations in the
character and condition of man what advance of knowledge and virtue
had repaid the havoc and horror which were let loose three hundred
years ago on the lands of montezuma and the incas the question was one
to which the rambler could not conceive an answer without pain

the ways of providence he murmured are indeed inscrutable the
designs of him who layeth the corner-stone and buildeth up the fabric of
destiny unfathomable two mighty empires the only states which seemed
to be leading the new world to civilization were broken and at an
expense of millions of lives barbarously destroyed and for what
purpose to what good end how much better or happier are the present
races of peru and mexico than the past hope speaks in the breath of
fancy time may perhaps teach us the lesson of mystery and these
magnificent climates now given up a second time to the sway of man in
his darkest mood to civilized savages and christian pagans may be
made the seats of peace and wisdom and perhaps if mankind should again
descend into the gloom of the middle ages their inhabitants will
preserve as did the more barbarous nations in all previous
retrogressions the brands from which to rekindle the torches of
knowledge and thus be made the engines of the reclamation of a world

the traveller muttered the conclusion of his speculations aloud and
insensibly to himself in the spanish tongue totally unconscious of the
presence of a second person until made aware of it by a voice
exclaiming suddenly as if in answer and in the same language 

right very right pecador de mi sinner that i am that i should
not have thought it for the honour of god and my country

the voice was sharp abrupt and eager but very quavering the stranger
turned and perceived that the words came from a man dressed in a long
loose surtout or gown of black texture none of the newest with a hat
of manilla grass umbrageous as an oak-top he looked old and infirm
his person was very meager his cheeks were of a mahogany hue and
hollow and the little hair that stirred over them in the evening
breeze was of a sable silvered his eyes were large restless
exceedingly bright and irascible he carried swinging in his hand
without seeming to use it much for in truth his gait was too
irregular and capricious to admit such support a staff to the head of
which was tied a bunch of flowers and he bore under his arm as they
seemed to the unpractised eye of the observer a bundle of books a
cluster of veritable quartos so antique and worn that the string
knotted round each seemed necessary to keep together its dilapidated
pages the whole air of the man was unique but not mean and the
traveller did not doubt at the first glance that he belonged to some
inferior order of ecclesiastics and was perhaps the curate of a
neighbouring village

right you have said the truth he continued regarding the traveller
eagerly and as the latter thought with profound veneration i must
speak with you very learned stranger for i perceive you are a
philosopher very great thanks to you may you live a thousand years in
a single word you have revealed the secret that has been the enigma of
a long life made good the justice of heaven and defended the fame of
my country god be thanked i am grateful to your wisdom you speak like
a saint you are a philosopher

the traveller stared with surprise on the speaker but though thus moved
by the abruptness of the address and somewhat inclined to doubt its
seriousness there was something so unusual in the mode and quality of
the compliment as to mollify any indignation which he might have felt
rising in his breast

father said he reverend father for i perceive you are one of the
clergy  

the poor licentiate cristobal johualicahuatzin curate of the parish
of san pablo de chinchaluca interrupted the ecclesiastic meekly and
in fact with the greatest humility

then indeed very excellent and worthy father cristobal resumed the
stranger courteously though i do not pretend to understand you  

the padre raised his head his meekness vanished he eyed the traveller
with a sharp and indignant frown

gachupin he cried you are a man with two souls you are wise and
you are foolish and you speak bad spanish why do you insult me

the stranger stared at his new acquaintance with fresh amazement

insult you father he exclaimed i declare to you i have this
moment woke out of a revery and i scarcely know what you have said or
what i have answered or what you are saying and what i am answering if
i have offended you i ask your pardon

enough right said the curate with an air of satisfaction you are
a philosopher you are right you were in a revery you have done me no
wrong i have intruded upon your musings i beg your pardon i thank
you very heartily you have instructed my ignorance and appeased my
repining you have taught me the answer to a vast and painful riddle
and now i perceive why providence hath given over my native land to
seeming ruin and permitted it to become a place of dust and sand of
dry-rot and death the day of darkness shall come again it is coming
man merges again into gloom and now we fall into the age of stone when
the hearts of men shall be as flint this then shall be the valley of
resuscitation after it is first plenus ossibus full of skeletons an
ossuary a place of moral ossification here then shall the wind blow
the voice sound the spirit move the bone unite to his bone the sinew
come with the flesh and light and knowledge animating the mass into an
army send it forth to conquer the world not as an army of flesh with
drum and trump sword and spear banner and cannon to kill and destroy
to ravage and depopulate but as a phalanx of angels with healing on
their wings to harmonize and enlighten to pacify and adorn yes you
have taught me this excellent sage and you shall know my gratitude
for great joy is it to the child of moteuczoma to know there shall be
an end to this desolation this anarchy this horror

 vigilare metu exanimis noctesque diesque
 formidare  

came i into the world to watch in sorrow and fear for ever hijo mio
give me thy hand i love thee the vale of anahuac is not deformed for
nothing christian man has ruined it but not for a long season

the cura delivered this rhapsody with extreme animation his eye
kindled he spoke with a rapid and confused vehemence and the stranger
began to doubt the stability of his understanding he flung his bundle
to the earth and grasped the hand of the philosopher who until this
moment was ignorant of the depth of his own wisdom while still in
perplexity unable to comprehend the strange character or indeed the
strange fancies to which he had given tongue the padre looked around
him with complacency on the scene over which a tropical moon was rising
to replace the luminary of day and continued with a gravity which
puzzled as much as did his late vivacity 

it is very true i regret it no longer but it cannot be denied the
cutting through yonder hill of nochistongo has given the last blow in a
system of devastation the canal of huehuetoca has emptied the golden
pitcher of moteuczoma it has converted the valley into a desert and
will depopulate it men cannot live upon salt

a desert father

hijo mio do you pretend to deny it cried the cura picking up his
bundle and thumping it with energy i aver and i will prove it to
your satisfaction out of these books which but hold are you a spy
will you betray me no you are not of mexico the cameo on your breast
bears the device of stars the symbol of intellectual as well as
political independence i reverence that flag i saw it when your
envoy attacked by an infuriated mob in his house in yonder very city
i stole there in spite of them sprang upon the balcony and waved it
abroad in the street frenzy vanished at the sight it was the banner of
man's friend no you are no fool with a free arm a licentious tongue
and a soul in chains therefore you shall look into these pages
concealed for years from the jealousy of misconstruction and the penal
fires of intolerance and they shall convince you that this hollow of
the mountain as it came from the hands of god and as it was occupied
by the children of nature was the loveliest of all the vales of the
earth and that since christian man has laid upon it his innovating
finger its beauty has vanished its charm decayed and it has become a
place fitting only for a den of thieves a refuge for the snake and the
water-newt the wild-hog and the vulture

to my mind father said the american no longer amazed at the
extravagant expressions of the ecclesiastic for he was persuaded his
wits were disordered to my mind it is still the most charming of
valleys and were it not that the folly and madness of its inhabitants
the contemptible ambition of its rulers and the servile supineness of
its people in fine the general disorganization of all its elements
both social and political have made it a sort of pandemonium a spot
wherein splendour and grandeur at least the possibilities and rudiments
of grandeur are mixed with all the causes of decline and perdition i
should be fain to dream away my life on the borders of its blue lakes
and under the shadow of its volcanic barriers

true true true you have said it replied the curate eagerly the
ambition of public men the feverish servility of the people forgetful
of themselves of their own rights and interests and ever anxious to
yoke themselves to the cars of demagogues to the wires wherewith they
may be worked as puppets and giving their blood to aggrandize
these the natural enemies of order and justice of reason and
tranquillity is not this enough to demoralize and destroy what people
is like mine wo for us the bondmen of the old world wake from sleep
and live while we in the blessed light of sunshine wrap the mantle
round our eyes sleep and perish revolution after revolution frenzy
after frenzy and what do we gain by revolution other nations are
liberated but we by revolution are enslaved nil medium est is
there no happy mean

it is true said the american but let us not speak of this it is
galling to be able to inveigh against folly without possessing the
medicament for its cure

thou art an american of the north said the cura thy people are
wise thy rulers are servants and you are happy why then art thou
here i thought thee a sage but i perceive thou hast the rashness of
youth art thou here to learn to despise thine own institutions why
dost thou remain the death-wind comes from the southern lakes in
fact at this moment the breeze from the south rising with the moon
brought with it a mephitic odour the effluvium of a bog famous even
in aztec days as the breath of pestilence the death-wind breathes on
thee even as this will infect thy blood when it has entered into thy
nostrils disordering thy body until thou learnest to loathe all that
seems to thee now in this scenery to be so goodly and fair so will
the gusts of anarchy rising from a distempered republic disease thy
imagination until thou comest to be disgusted with the yet untainted
excellence of thine own institutions because thou perceivest the evils
of their perversion arise and begone remain no longer with us leave
this land and bear with thee to thine own these volumes the poor
remnants of another sibylline library which will teach thee to
appreciate and preserve even as thy soul's ransom the pure and
admirable frame of government which a beneficent power has suffered you
to enjoy

and what then are these demanded the traveller curiously laying
his hand on the bundle which can teach americans to admire the beauty
of a republic and yet are not given to thine own countrymen

they are said the curate the fruits of years of reflection and
toil of deep research and profound speculation they contain a history
of mexico which when they were perfect that is before my
countrymen and here the cura began to whisper and look about him in
alarm as if dreading the approach of listeners before my
countrymen were taught to fear them and to destroy contained the
chronicles of the land from the time that the toltecas were exiled from
huehuetapallan more than twelve hundred years ago down to the moment
when augustin climbed up to the throne which hidalgo tore from the
cachupins a history wherein continued the padre with great
complacency i flatter myself though mexicans have found much to
detest americans will discover somewhat to approve

what is it said the rambler which your people have found so
objectionable

listen said the padre and you shall be informed in me here he
paused and surveyed his acquaintance with as much majesty as he could
infuse into his wasted figure and hollow countenance in me you behold
a descendant of moteuczoma xocojotzin

moteuczoma what exclaimed the traveller

are you so ignorant then demanded the padre in a heat that you
must be told who was moteuczoma xocojotzin that is the younger the
second of that name who reigned over mexico the very magnificent and
unfortunate emperor so basely decoyed into captivity so ruthlessly
oppressed and as i may say by a figure of speech for literally it
is not true so truculently slain by the illustrious don hernan cortes
the conqueror of mexico perhaps you are also ignorant of the great
names of tizoc of xocotzin and of ixtlilxochitl

i have no doubt replied the american with courteous humility that
in the histories of mexico which i have ever delighted to read in the
books of de solis of clavigero of bernal diaz del castillo and
especially in that of dr robertson i have met these illustrious
names but you must allow that to one ignorant of the language and of
the mode of pronouncing such conglomerated grunts it must be extremely
difficult if not wholly impossible to rivet them in the memory

the curate snatched up his bundle and surveyed the stranger with a look
in which it was hard to tell whether anger or contempt bore the greater
sway

de solis diaz clavigero robertson he at last exclaimed irefully
basta demasiado what a niño a little child a pobre yankee
have i fallen upon that i should waste my words on a man who studies
mexican history out of the books of these jolterheads

the padre was about to depart without bestowing another word on the
offender the american was amused at the ready transition of the curate
from deep reverence to the most unbounded contempt he was persuaded the
wits of the poor father were unsettled and felt there was the greater
need to humour and appease him and besides he was curious to discover
what would be the end of the adventure

father said he with composure before you condemn me for acquiring
my little knowledge from these books you should put it in my power to
read better the padre looked back what information should be
expected from incompetent writers from jolterheads when i have perused
the histories of father cristobal it will then be my fault if i am
found ignorant of the names of his imperial ancestors

ay de mi said the curate striking his forehead why did i not
think of that before santos santísimos i am not so quick-witted as i
was before i could forgive you more readily had you not named to me
that infidel scotchman who calls the superb moteuczoma a savage and
all the tlatoani the great princes and princesses the people and all
barbarians but what more could you expect of a heretic i forgive you
my son you are a christian

a christian father but not of the catholic faith

you will be damned said the curate hastily

a point of mere creed perhaps i should say mere form 

say nothing about it form or creed ceremony or canon you are in the
way to be lost open your ears unbind your eyes hear see and
believe poor miserable darkened creature how can your heretical
understanding be made to conceive and profit by the great principles of
philosophy when it is blind to the truths of religion

reverend padre said the traveller drily my people are a people of
heretics and yours of catholic believers which has better understood
or better practised the principles of the philosophy you affect to
admire

the padre smote his forehead a second time the sneer is in this case
just the sin of the enlightened is greater than the crime of the
ignorant and so is the punishment the chosen people of god were
chastised with frequent bondage and finally with expatriation and
entire dispersion for crimes which in heathen nations were punished
only with wars and famine but let us not waste time in argument as
babes may be made the organs of wisdom so may heretics be suffered as
the instruments of worldly benefaction what thou sayest is true
unbelievers as ye are ye will comprehend and be instructed by truths
which in this land would be misconceived and opposed and from you may
the knowledge you gain be reflected back on my own people in these
books which i commit to you for a great purpose you will learn who
were those worthies of whom i spoke you will perceive how
ixtlilxochitl the king of tezcuco was descended from the house that
gave birth to moteuczoma this illustrious name inherit i from my
mother with its glory it has conferred the penalty to be suspected
opposed and trampled three historians of the name my ancestors have
already written in vain jealousy has locked up their works in darkness
in the veil of manuscript the privilege of chronicling and perverting
the history of the land is permitted only to spaniards to strangers to
gachupins twenty years since and more the books i composed wherein
the truth was told and the injustice of spanish writers made manifest
were condemned by ignorance and bigotry to such flames as consumed at
tezcuco all the native chronicles of anahuac but what was written in
my books was also recorded in the brain fire could not be put to my
memory twenty years of secret labour have repaired the loss behold
here is my history i give it to you my enemies must be content with
the ashes

the padre rubbed his hands with exultation as the traveller surveyed
the bundle

why should you fear a similar fate for these volumes now said the
latter times are changed

the times but not the people hide them let no man see them or the
pile will be kindled again all will be lost i cannot repair the loss a
second time for now i am old five years have i borne them with me
night and day seeking for some one cunning and faithful wise like
thyself to whom to commit them i have found thee thou art the man i
am satisfied buen provecho much good may they do you not you only
but your people not your people alone but the world affection for
country is love of mankind true patriotism is philanthropy five years
have i borne them with me by night and by day

really i think that this betokened no great fear for their safety

the padre laughed though the gachupin and the bigot would rob me of a
spanish dissertation yet neither would envy me the possession of a few
rolls of hieroglyphics

as he spoke he knelt upon the ground untied the string that secured
one of the apparent volumes and beginning to unfold the ms as one
would a very nicely secured traveller's map displayed in the
moonlight a huge sheet of maguey paper emblazoned in gaudy colours
with all kinds of inexplicable devices as he exhibited his treasure he
looked up for approbation to the american the pobre yankee surveyed
him with a humorous look

father said he you have succeeded to admiration under this goodly
disguise not only in concealing your wisdom from the penetration of
your countrymen but as i think the whole world

the padre raised his finger to his nose very significantly saying with
a chuckle of delight the delight of a diseased brain in the success of
its cunning 

this time i knew i should throw dust in their eyes even though they
might demand for their satisfaction to look into my work you
perceive that this volume done up after the true manner of ancient
mexican books unrolls from either end the first pages and the last
of each volume contain duplicates of the first and the last chapters
done in mexican characters the rest is in spanish and i flatter
myself in very choice spanish hoc ego rectè i knew what i was
about one does not smuggle diamonds in sausages without stuffing in
some of the minced meat here is the jewel

so saying and spreading the sheet at its full length so as to discover
his hidden records the padre rose to his feet and began to dance about
with exultation

and what am i to do with these volumes said the traveller after
pondering awhile over the manuscripts

what are you to do with them dios mio are you so stupid take them
hide them in your bosom as you would the soul of some friend you were
smuggling into paradise leave this land forthwith on any pretence
bear them with you translate them into your own tongue and let them be
given to the world if they do not after they have received the seal of
your approbation make their way back to this land they will at least
serve some few of the many objects for which they were written they
will set the character of my great ancestors in its true light and
teach the world to think justly of the unfortunate people from whom i
have the honour to be descended and in addition they will open the
eyes of men to some of the specks of barbarism which yet sully their own
foreheads as for my countrymen were it even possible they could be
persuaded to spare these pages and to read them they would read them
in vain they are a thousand years removed from civilization and the
wisdom of this book would be to them as folly the barbaric romance
which loiters about the brains even of european nations is the pith and
medulla of a mexican head the poetry of bloodshed the sentiment of
renown the first and last passion and the true test of the savage
state are not yet removed from us we are not yet civilized up to the
point of seeing that reason reprobates human happiness denounces and
god abhors the splendour of contention your own people the happiest
and most favoured of modern days are perhaps not so backward

the heretic sighed the padre went on and with the smile of
generosity tying at the same time the string that secured the
volume and knotting it again into the bundle

the profits which may accrue from the publication i freely make over
to you as some recompense for the trouble of translation and the
danger you run in assuming the custody danger i say heaven forbid i
should not acquaint you that the discovery of these volumes on your
person besides insuring their speedy and irretrievable destruction
will expose you to punishment perhaps to the flames which will be
kindled for them and this the more readily that you are an
unbeliever pray my son listen to me suffer me to convert you
alas you shake your head what a pity i am compelled to entrust this
great commission to a man who refuses to be a christian

buen padre let us say nothing about that judge me not by the creed i
profess but by the acts i perform let us despatch this business the
moon is bright but the air is raw and unwholesome i would willingly do
your bidding not doubting that the world will be greatly advantaged
thereby but father here is the difficulty to do justice to your
composition i should myself possess the skill of an author but
really i feel my incompetency i am no bookmaker

and am i said the descendant of moteuczoma indignantly i am an
historian

i crave your pardon but i am not

and who said you were demanded the historian with contempt do i
expect of you the qualifications or the labours of an historian do i
ask you to write a book to rake for records in dusty closets and wormy
shelves to decypher crabbed hands and mouldered prints to wade through
the fathers of stupidity until your brain turns to dough and your eyes
to pots of glue to gather materials with the labour of a pearl-diver
and then to digest and arrange to methodise and elucidate with the
patient martyrdom of an almanac-maker who asks you this do i look for
a long head an inspired brain a wit a genius ni por sueño by no
means i ask you to read and render to translate to do the tailor's
office and make my work a new coat any one can do this

father said the traveller your arguments are unanswerable do me
the favour to send or to bring your production to the city to the
calle  

send bring se burla vm cried the padre looking aghast do you
want to ruin me know that by the sentence of the archbishop and the
command of the viceroy i am interdicted from the city and know that i
would sooner put my soul into the keeping of a parrot than my books
into the hands of a messenger

a viceroy did you say father it has been many long years since a
king's ape has played his delegated antics in mexico to please you
however i will bear the sacred treasure in my own hands earnestly
desiring you notwithstanding your fears which are now groundless and
the prohibition which must be at this period invalid to do me the
favour of a visit in person as soon as may suit your conveniency
inasmuch as there are many things i esteem needful to be  

the padre had seized on the hands of the speaker in testimony of his
delight but before the latter had concluded his discourse he was
interrupted by a voice at a distance calling as it seemed on the
cura for this worthy starting with fear and listening a moment
suddenly took to his heels and before the traveller could give vent to
his surprise was hidden among the shadows of the cypress trees

may i die said the philosopher in no little embarrassment but this
lunatic cura has left me to lug away his lucubrations his
hieroglyphical infants for which i am to make new coats on my own
shoulders well i can but carry them to the city and seek some means
of restoring them to his friends or commit them to a more fitting
depository pray heaven i meet no drunken indian or debauched soldado
on my way

by great good fortune he was able in a few days with the assistance
of a friendly mexican to solve the secret of the padre's confidence

you have seen him then said the excellent señor don andres
santa-maria de arcaboba laughing heartily at the grave earnestness with
which his heretical friend inquired after the eccentric padre he
offered you his hieroglyphics ah i perceive no man passes scot-free
the crazy cura ever his books in his hand much praise with the offer
and seven times seven maledictions when you refuse his bantlings

he is crazy then

demonios were you long finding it out ever since the old
archbishop burned his first heathenish volumes he has done naught
but  

i beg your pardon burn his books the old archbishop pray
enlighten me a little on the subject of the good father's history

tis done in a moment said don andres the only wonder is that he
did not himself give you the story that being commonly the prelude to
his petition the mother of don cristobal was an indian damisela
delighting in the euphonical cognomen of ixtlilxochitl a name which i
am told belonged to some old pagan king or other the lord knows
who as for myself i know nothing about it but this set the padre mad
or what's the same thing it made him an historian tis a silly thing
to trouble one's noddle about the concerns of our granddads let them
sleep rest to their bones asi sea they made him a licenciado and
then cura of some hacienda or other out among the hills i know nothing
about it he wrote a book in which he proved that the old heathen
montezuma the great cacique was a saint and hernan cortes who
conquered the land a sinner it may be so quien sabe who knows who
cares this was before the revolution that is before the first we
have had five hundred since i never counted them somehow the
viceroy vanegas took a dislike to the book and so did the archbishop
they set their heads together got the good old fathers of the
brotherhood we have no brotherhood now neither religious nor social
every man is his own brother as the king says in the english play did
you ever read calderon they got the old fathers to vote it
dangerous i suppose because they did not understand it so they
burned it and commanded johualicahuatzin that's another indian
king so he calls himself his father was the señor marhojo a creole
a lieutenant in the viceroy's horse a very worthy christian who was
hanged somewhere for sedition but cristobal writes after his mother's
name as being more royal what was i saying oh yes they ordered
the licentiate back to his hacienda then what became of him the lord
knows i don't then came hidalgo the valiant priest of dolores with
his raggamuffin patriots i don't mean any reflection being a patriot
myself though no fighter but hidalgo had a horrid crew about him
where was i oh ay hidalgo came to knock the city about our ears and
cristobal being seized with a fit of blood-thirstiness joins me the
gang they say he came with an old sabre of flint i don't know the
name it belonged to some king in the family then calleja whom they
made viceroy the devil confound him he cut my uncle's throat with
some fourteen thousand others at guanaxuato one day to save
powder calleja chased hidalgo to aculco and there he beat him
cristobal's brother he had a brother a very fine young fellow a
patriot major was killed at cristobal's side cristobal was knocked on
the head somebody said with his own royal weapon i don't
know where's the difference they broke his skull and took him
prisoner y pues what then being a notorious crazy man and very
savagely mauled they did not hang him ever since he has been madder
than ever he writes histories and to save them from viceroys he
takes all our presidents for viceroys to my mind they are but
that's nothing you know bustamente a mighty great man santa anna will
beat him but don't say so well to save his books from the
president-viceroys or viceroy-presidents cristobal offers them to
every body he meets with a petition to take them over the seas and
publish them that's all the indians at the hacienda love him and
take care of him ha ha he caught you did he what did he say

he gave me his books said the traveller

fuego you took them ha ha now will the poor padre die happy

i will return them to his relations

relations they are all in heaven he is the last of the
ixtlilxochitls ha ha i beg your pardon amigo mio i beg your
pardon but if you offer them to any body never believe me but folks
will take you for cristobal the second el segundo maniatico or some
one he has hired to do the work of donation ha ha cielo mio pity me
say nothing about it burn them

at least let us look over them

olla podrida look over a beggar's back a pedler's sack or a
dictionary any thing reasonable burn them or take them to america
to your north and deposit them in a museum as the commonplace books of
montezuma vamos que me manda vm will you ride to the
alameda pobre cristobal he will die happy  

the traveller returned to his own land he bore with him the books of
cristobal twenty times did he essay to make examination of their
contents and twenty times did he yawn in mental abandonment over
their chaotic pages not indeed that they seemed so very incoherent
in style and manner but because the cautious historian as it seemed
with a madman's subtlety had hit upon the device of so scattering and
confusing the pages that it was next to impossible that any one after
reading the first should discover the clue to the second each volume
as has been hinted consisted of a single great sheet folded up in the
manner of a pocket map both sides were very carefully written over the
paragraphs clustered in masses or pages but without numbers and but
for the occurrence here and there of pages of hideous hieroglyphics
such as were never seen in a christian book the whole did not seem
unlike to a printed sheet before it is carried to the binder the task
of collating and methodising the disjointed portions required in the
words of the padre himself the devotedness which he had figured as the
patient martyrdom of an almanac-maker it was entirely too much for the
traveller he laid the riddle aside for future investigation but
cristobal was not forgotten

a year afterwards in reading a mexican gazette which had fallen into
his hands his eye wandered to the little corner which appeals so
placidly to the feelings of the contemplative the place of obituaries
his attention was instantly captivated by a name in larger characters
than the others was it could it be pobre cristobal el licenciado
cristobal santiago marhojo y ixtlilxochitl cura de la hacienda de
chinchaluca ordinariamente llamado el maniatico historiador   the
same but what is this the common immortality of a long paragraph the
heretic rubbed his eyes several mss historical memoirs relating to
the earlier ages of the aztec monarchy the work of his own hand have
been discovered and a lucky accident revealing the expedient which he
adopted to render them illegible or at least inexplicable to common
readers they have been found to be in all respects sane and coherent
the work less of a madman than an eccentric but profound scholar the
pages are arranged like those in the form of the printer and being cut
by a knife without unfolding   the heretic started up and drew forth
the long-neglected tomes it is said that a north american a year
ago received and carried away many of the volumes which the
eccentric clergyman was accustomed to offer to strangers it is hoped
if this should meet his eye   enough if thy work be at all
readable departed padre it shall have the new coat

great was the surprise of the philosopher when having at the
suggestion of the gazetteer cut the folded sheet of a volume he beheld
the chaos of history reduced to order there they were the annals of
aztecs and toltecs of chechemecs and chiapanecs and a thousand other
ecs from the death of nezahualcojotl the imperial poet up to the
confusion of tongues here's a nut for the philosophers quoth the
traveller but now for a peep at montezuma poor cristobal what a
wonderful big book you have made of it

how many days and nights were given to the examination of the history
we do not think fit to record it is enough that the inheritor of this
treasure discovered with satisfaction that if cristobal had been mad
he had been mad after a rule dramatically so he was sane in the right
places a thousand eccentricities were indeed imbodied in his work
the result doubtless of a single aberration in which he persuaded
himself that men were yet barbarians and that civilization even to the
foremost of nations was yet unknown under the influence of this
conceit he was constantly betrayed for he was a philanthropist into
sharp animadversion upon popular morals and he stigmatized as vices of
the most brutal character many of those human peculiarities which the
world has consented to esteem the highest virtues in other respects he
was sane somewhat judicious and as far as could be expected in an
historian a teller of the truth

his work consisted of several divisions it was in fact a series of
annals relating to different epochs of these that volume which
treated of the conquest of mexico had the most charms for the
traveller and he thought it would possess the most interest for the
world it was this which he determined to introduce to the public it
differed greatly from common histories in one particular it descended
to minutiæ of personal adventure and was indeed as much a general
memoir of the great conquistadores as a history of the fall of
tenochtitlan of this the writer was himself sensible the running title
of the division as recorded in his own hand being una cronica de la
conquista de megico y historia verdadera de los conquistadores
particularmente de esos caballeros á quienes descuidaron celebrar los
escritores antiguos por cristobal johualicahuatzin santiago marhojo y
ixtlilxochitl that is to say a chronicle of the conquest of
mexico and true history of the conquerors especially of those
cavaliers who were neglected by the ancient authors

the first portion of this for there were several treated of those
events which occurred between the departure of the first army of
invasion from cuba and its expulsion from mexico and this portion the
executor of cristobal resolved to present to the world

in pursuance of this resolution he instituted a long and laborious
comparison of the ms with the most authentic printed histories the
result of which was a conviction which we beg the reader constantly to
bear in mind that although the good padre had introduced and upon
authority which his editor could not discover the characters of certain
worthy cavaliers of whom he had never heard the relation in all other
particulars corresponded precisely with the narratives of the most
esteemed writers the events the great and the minute alike of the
whole campaign were in point of fact identical with those chronicled
by the best authors and in no way did this history differ from others
except in the introduction of the above-mentioned forgotten or neglected
cavaliers such as the knight of calavar and his faithful esquire and
in the recital of events strictly personal to them it is true the
narrative was more diffuse perhaps we should say verbose but
cristobal lived in an age of amplification it was here alone that the
traveller felt himself bound to take liberties with the original for
though the march of mind and the general augmentation of ideas have
made prolixity a common characteristic of each man in his own person
they have not made him more tolerant of it in another he shaved
therefore and he cut he amputated and he compressed and he felt the
joy of an editor when exercising the hydraulic press of the mind

this will be excused in him he expunged as much of the philosophy as he
could the few principles at variance with worldly propensities which
he left in the book must be referred to another responsibility the
hallucinations of philanthropy are at the worst harmless

for the title adopted in this the initial chronicle he confesses
himself answerable the peculiar appetites of the literary community
the result of intellectual dyspepsia require and justify empiricism in
nomenclature a good name is sugar and sweetmeats to a bad book if it
should be objected that he has called the historia verdadera a
romance let it be remembered that the world likes romance better than
truth as the booksellers can testify and that the history of mexico
under all aspects but that of fiction is itself  a romance

 

 note it was said by the learned scaliger of the basque
 language that those who spoke it were thought to understand
 one another a thing which he did not himself believe for
 fear that the reader from the specimens of mexican words he
 will meet in this history should imagine that the mexican
 tongue was not meant even to be spoken we think fit to
 apprise him that all such words are to be pronounced as they
 would be uttered by a spaniard in his language for example
 the g when before the vowels e and i the j always and in
 certain cases the x have the value of the aspirate thus the
 name of the city the chief scene of our history has been
 spelled at different times mexico mejico and megico
 yet is always pronounced may-he-co the sound of our w he
 represents by hu as huascar for wascar and indeed ju
 has nearly the same sound as in juan the names
 johualicahuatzin anahuac xocojotzin mexitli and chihuahua
 pronounced howalicawatzin anawac hocohotzin meheetlee and
 chewawa will serve for examples but this is a thing not to be
 insisted on so much as the degree of belief which should be
 accorded to the relation

 esto importa poco á nuestro cuento basta que en la narracion
 de el no se salga un punto de la verdad don quijote

chapter i


in the year of grace fifteen hundred and twenty upon a day in the month
of may thereof the sun rose over the islands of the new deep and the
mountains that divided it from an ocean yet unknown and looked upon the
havoc which in the name of god a christian people were working upon
the loveliest of his regions he had seen in the revolution of a day
the strange transformations which a few years had brought upon all the
climes and races of his love the standard of portugal waved from the
minarets of the east a portuguese admiral swept the persian gulf and
bombarded the walls of ormuz a portuguese viceroy held his court on the
shores of the indian ocean the princes of the eastern continent had
exchanged their bracelets of gold for the iron fetters of the invader
and among the odours of the spice islands the fumes of frankincense
ascended to the god of their new masters he passed on his course the
breakers that dashed upon the sands of africa were not whiter than the
squadrons that rolled among them the chapel was built on the shore and
under the shadow of the crucifix was fastened the first rivet in the
slavery of her miserable children then rose he over the blue atlantic
the new continent emerged from the dusky deep the ships of discoverers
were penetrating its estuaries and straits from the isles of fire even
to the frozen promontories of labrador and the roar of cannon went up
to heaven mingled with the groans and blood of naked savages but peace
had descended upon the islands of america the gentle tribes of these
paradises of ocean wept in subjection over the graves of more than half
their race hamlets and cities were springing up in their valleys and on
their coasts the culverin bellowed from the fortress the bell pealed
from the monastery and the civilization and vices of europe had
supplanted the barbarism and innocence of the feeble native still as
he careered to the west new spectacles were displayed before him the
followers of balboa had built a proud city on the shores and were
launching their hasty barks on the surges of the new ocean the hunter
of the fountain of youth was perishing under the arrows of the wild
warriors of florida and armed spaniards were at last retreating before
a pagan multitude one more sight of pomp and of grief awaited him he
rose on the mountains of mexico the trumpet of the spaniards echoed
among the peaks he looked upon the bay of ulua and as his beams stole
tremblingly over the swelling current they fell upon the black hulls
and furled canvas of a great fleet riding tranquilly at its moorings
the fate of mexico was in the scales of destiny the second army of
invaders had been poured upon her shores in truth it was a goodly
sight to look upon the armed vessels that thronged this unfrequented
bay for peacefully and majestically they slept on the tide and as the
morning hymn of the mariners swelled faintly on the air one would have
thought they bore with them to the heathen the tidings of great joy and
the good-will and grace of their divine faith instead of the earthly
passions which were to cover the land with lamentation and death

with the morning sunbeam stole into the harbour one of those little
caravels wherein the men of those days dared the perils of unknown
deeps and sought out new paths to renown and fortune and as she drew
nigh to the reposing fleet the hardy adventurers who thronged her deck
gazed with new interest and admiration on the shores of that empire
the fame of whose wild grandeur and wealth had already driven from
their minds the dreams of golconda and the moluccas no fortress frowned
on the low islands no city glistened among the sand-hills on shore the
surf rolled on the coast of an uninhabited waste the tents of the
armourer and other artisans the palm-thatched sheds of the sick and
some heaps of military stores covered with sails and glimmering in the
sun were the only evidences of life on a beach which was in after
times to become the site of a rich and bustling port but beyond the
low desert margin of the sea and over the rank and lovely belt of
verdure which succeeded the glittering sand-hills rose a rampart of
mountains green with an eternal vegetation over which again peered
chain after chain and crag after crag with still the majestic perote
and the colossal orizaba frowning over all until those who had dwelt
among the pyrenees or looked upon the alps as some of that adventurous
company had done dreamed what wealth should be in a land whose first
disclosure was so full of grandeur

of the four-score individuals who crowded the decks of the little
caravel there was not one whose countenance at that spectacle did not
betray a touch of the enthusiasm the mingled lust of glory and of
lucre which had already transformed so many ruffians into heroes
among this motley throng might be seen all sorts of martial madmen from
the scarred veteran who had fought the moors under the walls of oran to
the runagate stripling who had hanselled his sword of lath on the curs
of seville from the hidalgo who remembered the pride of his ancestors
in the cloak of his grandsire to the boor who dreamed of the crown of a
pagan emperor in a leather shirt and cork shoes here was a brigand
who had cursed the santa hermandad of all castile and now rejoiced over
a land where he could cut throats at his leisure there a gray-haired
extortioner whom roguery had reduced to bankruptcy but who hoped to
repair his fortune by following the pack of man-hunters and picking up
the offals they despised or cheating them of the prizes they had
secured here too was a holy secular who came to exult over the
confusion and destruction of all barbarians who should see nothing
diviner in the crucifix than in their own idols the greater number
however was composed of debauched and decayed planters of the islands
who ceased to lament their narrow acres and decreasing bondmen snatched
away by the good fortune of some fellow-profligate when they thought of
territories for an estate and whole tribes for a household indeed in
all the group however elevated and ennobled for the moment by the
excitement of the scene and by the resolute impatience they displayed
to rush upon adventures well known to be full of suffering and peril
there was but one whom a truly noble-hearted gentleman would have chosen
to regard with respect or to approach with friendship

this was a young cavalier who in propriety of habiliments in
excellence of person and in nobleness of carriage differed greatly
from all and to say the truth he himself seemed highly conscious of
the difference since he regarded all his fellow-voyagers saving only
his own particular and armed attendants with the disdain befitting so
distinguished a personage his frame tall and moderately athletic was
arrayed in hose and doublet of a dusky brown cloth slashed with purple
his cap and cloak were of black velvet and in the band of one and on
the shoulder of the other were symbols of his faith and his
profession the first being a plain crucifix of silver and the second
a cross of white cloth of eight points inserted in the mantle in
addition to these badges of devotion he wore a cross of gold pointed
like the former and suspended to his neck by a chain of such length and
massiveness as to imbue his companions with high notions of his rank
and affluence

the only point in which he exhibited any feeling in common with his
companions was in admiration of the noble prospect that stretched
before him and which was every moment disclosing itself with newer and
greater beauty as the wind wafted his little vessel nearer to it his
cheek flushed his eye kindled and smiting his hands together in his
ardour he dropped so much of his dignity as to address many of his
exclamations to the obsequious but not ungentle master

by st john señor capitan he cried with rapture this is a most
noble land to be wasted upon savages

true señor don amador replied the thrice-honoured master a noble
land a rich land a most glorious land and i warrant me man has
never before looked on its equal

for my part said the youth proudly i have seen some lands that
in the estimation of those who know better may be pronounced divine
among which i may mention the greek islands the keys of the nile the
banks of the hellespont and the hills of palestine not to speak of
italy and many divisions of our own country yet to be honest i must
allow i have never yet looked upon a land which at the first sight
impressed me with such strange ideas of magnificence

what then will be your admiration noble cavalier said the captain
when you have passed this sandy shore and yonder rugged hills and
find yourself among the golden valleys they encompass for all those who
have returned from the interior thus speak of them and declare upon
the gospels and their honour no man can conceive properly of paradise
until he has looked upon the valleys of mexico

i long to be among them said the youth and the sooner i am mounted
on my good steed fogoso whom god restore to his legs and his spirit
for this cursed ship has cramped both i say the sooner i am mounted
upon my good horse and scattering this heathen sand from under his
hoofs the better will it be for myself as well as for him hark'ee
good captain i know not by what sort of miracle i shall surmount
yonder tall and majestic pinnacles but it will be some consolation
while stumbling among them to be able at least to pronounce their
names what call you yon mountain to the north with the huge
coffer-like crag on its summit

your favour has even hit the name in finding a similitude for the
crag said the captain the indians call it by a name which signifies
the square mountain but poor mariners like myself who can scarce
pronounce their prayers much less the uncouth and horrible
articulations of these barbarians are content to call it the coffer
mountain it lies hard by the route to the great city and is said to be
such a desolate fire-blasted spot as will sicken a man with horror

and yon kingly monster continued the cavalier that raises his snowy
cone up to heaven and mixes his smoke with the morning clouds that
proudest of all what call you him

spaniards have named him orizaba said the master but these godless
pagans who cover every human object with some diabolical superstition
call that peak the starry mountain because the light of his
conflagration seen afar by night shines like to a planet and is
thought by them to be one of their gods descending to keep watch over
their empire

a most heathenish and damning belief said the youth with a devout
indignation and i do not marvel that heaven has given over to bondage
and destruction a race stained with such beastly idolatry but
nevertheless señor capitan and notwithstanding that it is befouled
with such impious heresies i must say that i have looked upon mount
olympus a mountain in greece whereon they say dwelt the accursed old
heathen gods whom heaven confound before the time that our blessed
saviour hurled them into the pit and yet that mountain olympus is but a
hang-dog turk's head with a turban compared to this most royal orizaba
that raiseth up his front like an old patriarch and smokes with the
glory of his maker

and yet they say continued the captain that there is a mountain of
fire even taller and nobler than this and that hard by the great city
but your worship will see this for yourself with many other wonders
when your worship fights the savages in the interior

if it please heaven said the cavalier i will see this mountain and
those other wonders whereof you speak but as to fighting the savages
i must give you to know that i cannot perceive how a man who has used
his sword upon raging mussulmans with a sultan at their head can
condescend to draw it upon poor trembling barbarians who fight with
flints and fish-bones and run away a thousand of them together from
six not over-valiant christians

your favour said the captain has heard of the miserable poltroonery
of the island indians who truth to say are neither turks nor moors of
barbary but señor don amador de leste you will find these dogs of
mexico to be another sort of people who live in stone cities instead of
bowers of palm-leaves have crowned emperors in place of feathered
caciques are marshalled into armies with drums banners and generals
like christian warriors and finally go into battle with a most
resolute and commendable good will they will pierce a cuirass with
their copper lances crush an iron helmet with their hardened war-clubs
and as has twice or thrice happened with the men of hernan
cortez they will with their battle-axes of flint smite through the
neck of a horse as one would pierce a yam with his dagger truly señor
caballero these mexicans are a warlike people

what you tell me said don amador i have heard in the islands as
well as that these same mountain indians roast their prisoners with
pepper and green maize and think the dish both savoury and wholesome
all which matters excepting only the last which is reasonable enough
of such children of the devil i do most firmly disbelieve for how
were they not cowardly caitiffs could this rebellious cavalier the
valiant hernan cortes with his six hundred mutineers have forced his
way even to the great city tenochtitlan and into the palace of the
emperor by my faith and here the señor don amador twisted his finger
into his right mustachio with exceeding great complacency these same
mexicans may be brave enemies to the cavaliers of the plantations who
have studied the art of war among the tribes of santo domingo and cuba
but to a soldier who as i said before has fought the turks and that
too at the siege of rhodes they must be even such chicken-hearted
slaves as it would be shame and disgrace to draw sword upon

the master of the caravel regarded don amador with admiration for a
moment and then said with much emphasis may i die the death of a
mule if i am not of your way of thinking most noble don amador to
tell you the truth these scurvy mexicans of whose ferocity and courage
so much is said by those most interested to have them thought so are
even just such poor spiritless contemptible creatures as the arrowauks
of the isles only that there are more of them and to be honest i
know nothing that should tempt a soldier and hidalgo to make war on
them except their gold of which the worst that can be said is first
that there is not much of it and secondly that there are too many
hands to share it there is neither honour nor wealth to be had in
tenochtitlan but if a true soldier and a right noble gentleman as the
world esteems don amador de leste should seek a path worthy of himself
he has but to say the word and there is one to be found from which he
may return with more gold than has yet been gathered by any fortunate
adventurer and more renown than has been won by any other man in the
new world ay by st james and diadems may be found there provided
one have the heart to contest for them with men who fight like the
wolves of catalonia and die with their brows to the battle

now by st john of jerusalem said amador kindling with enthusiasm
that is a path which as i am a true christian and castilian i should
be rejoiced to tread for the gold of which you speak it might come if
it would for gold is a good thing even to one who is neither needy nor
covetous but i should be an idle hand to gather it as for the diadems
i have my doubts whether a man not born by the grace of god to inherit
them has any right to wear them unless indeed he should marry a
king's daughter but here the kings are all infidels and i vow to
heaven i would sooner burn at a stake along with a christian beggar
than sell my soul to perdition in the arms of any infidel princess
whatever but for the renown of subduing a nation of such valiant pagans
as those you speak of and of converting them to the true faith that
is even such a thought as makes my blood tingle within me and were i
in all particulars the master of my own actions i should say to you
right worthy and courageous captain for truly from those honourable
scars on your front and temple and from your way of thinking i esteem
you such a man point me out that path and with the blessing of
heaven i will see to what honour it may lead me

your favour said the captain has heard of the great island
florida and of the renowned señor don ponce de leon its discoverer

i have heard of such names both of isle and of man i think said don
amador but to say truth señor comandante you have here in this new
world such a multitude of wonderful territories and of heroic men
that were i to give a month's labour to the study i think i should not
master the names of all of them truly in rhodes where the poor
knights of the hospital stood at bay before solyman el magnifico and
did such deeds as the world had not heard of since the days of leonidas
and his brave knights of sparta i say even in rhodes where all men
thought of their honour and religion and never a moment of their blood
we heard not of so many heroes as have risen up here in this corner of
the earth in a few years chasing of the wild indians

the señor ponce de leon said the captain without regarding the sneer
of the proud soldier the señor ponce de leon adelantado of bimini and
of florida in search of the miraculous fountain of youth which the
indians say lies somewhere to the north landed eight years ago with
the crews of three ships all of them bigger and better than this little
rotten sangre de cristo whereof i myself commanded one of the
extraordinary beauty and fertility of the land of florida thus
discovered i will say nothing your favour will delight more to hear me
speak of its inhabitants these were men of a noble stature and full of
such resolution that we were no sooner ashore than they fell upon us
and i must say we found we were now at variance with a people in no
wise resembling those naked idiots of cuba or these cowardly hinds of
mexico they cared not a jot for swordsman arcubalister or musketeer
to our rapiers they opposed their stone battle-axes which gushed
through the brain more like a thunderbolt than a christian espada no
crossbowman could drive an arrow with more mortal aim and fury than
could these wild archers with their horn bows for know señor they
have in that country of florida some prodigious animal which yields
them abundant material for their weapons and what filled us with much
surprise and no little fear instead of betaking themselves to their
heels at the sound of our firelocks as we looked for them to do no
sooner had they heard the roar of these arms than they fetched many
most loud and frightful yells to express their contempt of our warlike
din and rushed upon us with such renewed and increasing violence that
to be honest as a christian of my years should be we were fain to
betake ourselves to our ships with what speed and good fortune we
could and now señor you will be ashamed to hear that our courage was
so much mollified by this repulse and our fears of engaging further
with such desperadoes so urgent and potent that we straightway set
sail and in the vain search for the enchanted fountain quite forgot
the nobler objects of the voyage

what you have said quoth don amador convinces me that these savages
of florida are a warlike people and worthy the wrath of a brave
soldier but you have said nothing of the ores and diadems whereof i
think you first spake and which heaven save the mark by some strange
mutation of mind have made a deeper impression on my imagination than
such trifles should

we learned of some wounded captives we carried to the ships continued
the master as well at least as we could understand by their signs
that there was a vast country to the north-west where dwelt nations of
fire-worshippers governed by kings very rich and powerful on the
banks of a great river and from some things we gathered it was thought
by many that the miraculous fountain was in that land and not in the
island bimini and this think i myself for señor i have seen a man
who with others had slaked his thirst in every spring that gushes from
that island and by my faith he died of an apoplexy the day after his
arrival in the habana wherefore it is clear that marvellous fountain
must be in the country of the fire-worshippers but notwithstanding all
these things señor our commander don ponce would resolve upon naught
but to return to the bahamas where our ships were divided each in
search of the island called bimini it was my fortune to be despatched
westward and here what with the aid of a tempest that blew from the
east and some little hankering of mine own appetites after that land of
the fire-worshippers i found myself many a league beyond where any
christian had ever navigated before where a fresh and turbid current
rolled through the deep bearing the trunks of countless great trees
many of them scorched with fire whereupon i knew that i was near to the
object of my desires which however the fears and the discontent of my
crew prevented my reaching i was even compelled to obey them and
conduct them to cuba

señor capitan said amador who had listened to the master's narrative
with great attention i give you praise for your bold and most
commendable daring in having sailed so far and i condole with you for
your misfortune in being compelled to abide the government of a crew of
such runagate and false companions whom i marvel exceedingly you did
not hang every man of em to some convenient corner of your ship as
was the due of such disloyal knaves but yet credit me i see not what
this turbid and fresh flood and what these floating trees had to do
with the gold and the diadems of which you were speaking

señor said the captain earnestly i have navigated the deep for
perhaps more years than your favour has lived and it was my fortune to
be with the admiral  

with colon cried the youth

with his excellency the admiral don cristobal colon the discoverer
of this new world replied the master proudly in his own good ship
when we sailed into the serpent's mouth which we knew not then laved
the shores of the great continent and i remember that when the admiral
had beheld the trees floating in the current and had tasted of the
fresh water of that boiling gulf he told us that these came from a
great river rolling through a mighty continent and in after times the
words of the admiral were proved to be just for there his captain the
young pinzon found the great river oronoko

there is no man said don amador who more reverences the memory of
the admiral than i and i feel the more regard for yourself that you
have sailed with him on his discoveries moreover i beg your pardon
insomuch as i have been slow to unravel your meaning but now i
perceive you think you had reached that river of the infidel
fire-worshippers whom god confound with fire and flame as doubtless he
will and hath no man again sought the mouth of that river i marvel you
did not yourself make a second attempt

i could not prevail upon any cavaliers rich enough for the
undertaking said the master to league with me in it men liked not
the spirit of the northern savages and in truth there were a thousand
other lands where the barbarians could be subdued with less peril and
as they thought with a better hope of gain and yet by our lady that
river bore with it the evidences of the wealth on its banks for what
were those scorched trees but the relics of the fires with which the
kings of the land were smelting their ores and what quantity of gold
must there not have been where such prodigious furnaces were kindled

by the mass said amador with ardour you speak the truth it is
even a most wonderful land and if a few thousand pesoes would float an
expedition by my faith i think i could find them

a few thousand pesoes and the countenance of such a leader as don
amador de leste a knight of the holy and valiant order of san juan  

a knight by right but not by vow said don amador hastily i give
you to understand señor capitan that i am not a sworn brother of that
most ancient honourable and knightly order but an humble volunteer
attached for certain reasons of my own to them and privileged by the
consent of his most eminent highness the grand master to wear these
badges wherein i am arrayed in acknowledgment that i did some service
not unworthy knighthood in the trenches of rhodes

your favour will not lead the less worthily for that said the
captain i know an hundred cavaliers who would throw their ducats as
well as their arms into the adventure prescribed by the señor don
amador and a thousand cross-bows with three or four score
arquebusiers would flock to the standard as soon as we had preached
through the islands a crusade to the fire-worshippers and a pilgrimage
to the waters of life

and is it truly believed said amador eagerly that such waters are
to be found in these heathen lands

who can doubt it said the captain the indians of the bahamas have
spoken of them for years no spaniard hath ever thought of questioning
their existence and at this moment so great is the certainty of
finding them that my old leader don ponce is collecting round him men
for a second expedition with which he will depart i know not how soon
but i know don ponce the draught of youth is not for him he will seek
the fountain on his great island of florida and find it not it will
bubble only to the lips of those who seek it near the great river of the
great continent

by heaven said don amador what might not a man do who could drink
of this miraculous fountain a draught of it would have carried the
great alejandro so far into the east as to have left but small work for
the knaves of portugal and then our friends dios mio we could keep
our friends by us for ever but hold señor capitan a thought strikes
me have you ever heard the opinion of a holy clergyman on this subject
is it lawful for a man to drink of such a fountain

by my faith replied the master i have never heard priest or layman
advance an argument against its lawfulness and i know not how it should
be criminal since providence hath given us the privilege to drink of
any well whose waters are not to our misliking

for my part said amador i must say i have my doubts whether
providence hath given us any such privilege the exercise of which in
general would greatly confound the world by over-peopling it and in
particular would seem in a measure to put man in a condition to defy
his maker and to defeat all the ends of divine goodness and justice
for how should a man be punished for his sins who had in him the power
of endless life and how should a man keep from sinning who had no fear
of death and the devil and finally how should we ever receive any of
the benefits of the most holy atonement after drinking such a
life-preserving draught for it is my opinion señor capitan no man
would wish to go to heaven who had the power of remaining on earth

by my soul said the captain earnestly this is a consideration which
never occupied me before and i shall take counsel upon it with the
first holy man i meet

at all events said the cavalier there is inducement enough to make
search after this river were it only to fight the fire-worshippers
convert them to the true faith and see what may be the curiosities of
their land yet i must give you warning it will rest with another whom
i am now seeking whether i may league with you in this enterprise or
not give me his consent and leading and i will take leave of these
poor rogues of tenochtitlan as soon as i have looked a little upon
their wonders and then with the blessing of god and st john have at
the valiant fire-worshippers with all my heart but how now señor
capitan what means your pilot to cast anchor here among the fleet and
not carry us forthwith to the shore

i dare not proceed farther said the captain without the authority
of the señor cavallero admiral of this squadron and governor of this
harbour of san juan de ulua it is necessary i should report myself to
him for examination on board the capitana and receive his
instructions concerning my cargo and fellow-voyagers

his instructions concerning your fellow-voyagers said don amador
sternly i for one am a voyager who will receive no instructions for
the government of my actions neither myself nor by proxy and with
god's blessing i will neither ask permission to disembark nor allow it
to be asked for myself or for my grooms and the señor cavallero or
any other señor that thinks to stop me had better grind both sides of
his sword by way of preparation for such folly

your favour has no cause for anger said the master moderately this
is the custom and the law and it becomes the more necessary to enforce
it in the present situation of things your favour will receive no
check but rather assistance and it is only necessary to assure the
admiral you do not come as a league and helpmate of the mutineer
cortes to receive free license a safe-conduct and perhaps even
guides to go whithersoever you list throughout this empire this
señor is only a form of courtesy such as one cavalier should expect of
another and no more

truly then if you assure me so said don amador complacently i
will not refuse to go myself in person to his excellency the admiral
and the more readily that i fancy from the name there is some sort of
blood-relationship between his excellency and myself but by heaven i
would rather at present be coursing fogoso over yon glittering sand
than winding a bolero on my cousin's deck though he were a king's
admiral




chapter ii


don amador de leste was interrupted in the agreeable duty the last to
be performed in the little caravel of inquiring into the health and
condition of his war-horse fogoso by a summons or as it was more
courteously expressed an invitation to attend the admiral on board his
own vessel giving a thousand charges to his attendants all of which
were received with due deference and humility he stepped into the boat
which in a few moments he exchanged for the decks of the
capitana not however without some doubt as to the degree of
loftiness he should assume during the interview with his excellency the
admiral his kinsman his pride had already twice or thrice since his
appearance among the islands of the new world been incensed by the
arrogant assumption of their petty dignitaries to inquire into and
control the independence of his movements and he remembered with high
displeasure that the royal adelantado of cuba the renowned velasquez
a man of whom as he was pleased to say he had never heard so much as
the name until he found himself within his territories had not only
dared to disregard the privileges of his birth and decorations but had
well-nigh answered his ire and menaces by giving him to chains and
captivity nor when at last the pious exertions of the good friars of
santiago had allayed the growing storm and appeased his own
indignation by urging the necessity their governor was under to examine
into the character and objects of all persons who by declining to
visit the new el dorado under the authority of the commander might
reasonably be suspected of a desire to join his rebellious
lieutenant not even then could the proud amador forget that whatever
might be the excuse his independence had been questioned and might
be again by any inflated official whom he should be so unlucky as to
meet his doubt however in this case was immediately dispelled by the
degree of state and ceremony with which he was received on board the
capitana and conducted to his excellency and the last shadow of
hesitation departed from his brow when he beheld the admiral prepared
to welcome him with such courtesy and deference as were only accorded to
the most noble and favoured

if i do not err said the admiral with a bow of great reverence and
a smile of prodigious suavity i behold in the señor don amador de
leste a gentleman of valencia whom i make free as i shall be proud
to welcome as my countryman and kinsman

señor almirante replied amador with equal amenity my mother was a
valencian and of the house of cavallero wherefore i take it for
granted we are in some sort related but in what degree i am not able
to determine nor do i think that a matter very important to be
questioned into since in these savage corners of the earth the
farthest degree of consanguinity should draw men together as firmly as
the closest

you are right señor cavalier and kinsman said the admiral affinity
of any degree should be a claim to the intimacy and affection of
brotherhood and although this is the first time i have enjoyed the
felicity to behold my right worthy and much honoured cousin i welcome
him with good will to such hospitalities as my poor bark and this
barbarous clime can afford marvelling however amid all my
satisfaction what strange fortune has driven him to exchange the
knightly combats of christendom for the ignoble campaigns of this wild
hemisphere

as to that most noble and excellent cousin said the cavalier i
will not scruple to inform your excellency together with all other
matters wherein as my kinsman you are entitled to question previous
to which however i must demand of your goodness to know how far your
interrogatories are to bear the stamp of office and authority the
satisfaction of my mind on which point will materially affect the
character of my answers

surely said the admiral courteously and seemingly with great
frankness i will only presume to question you as a friend and
relative and as such no farther than it may suit your pleasure to
allow my office i will only use so far as it may enable me to assist
you in your objects if as i will make bold to believe you may need
such assistance in this land of mexico

i thank your excellency said amador now receiving and pressing the
hand of the commander with much cordiality both for your offers of
assistance which if i may need it i will freely accept and for your
assurance you do not mean to trouble me with your authority a mark of
extreme civility and good sense which virtues under your favour i
have not found so common among your fellow-commanders in these heathen
lands as i was led to expect

the admiral smiled pleasantly on his kinsman while replying i must beg
your allowance for the presumption of my brothers in command who sooth
to say have had so much dealing with the wild indians and rough
reprobates of these regions as somewhat to have forgot their manners
when treating with gentlemen and nobles my superior and governor the
worthy and thrice-honoured velasquez whom god grant many and wiser
counsellors is rather hot of head and unreasonable of temper and has
doubtless thrown some obstructions in the way of your visit to this
disturbed land but you should remember that the junction of so brave a
cavalier as don amador de leste with the mutinous bands of the señor
cortes is a thing to excite both dread and opposition

i remember said amador that some such excuse was made for him and
that my assurance that my business had no more to do with that valiant
rebel than with his own crabbed excellency was no more believed than
the assertion of any common hind a piece of incredulity i shall take
great pleasure at some more convenient period of removing at my
sword's point from his excellency's body

i am grieved you should have cause to complain of the governor said
the señor cavallero and verily i myself cannot pretend to justify his
rash and tyrannical opposition especially in the matter of yourself
who i take it for granted come hither as the kinsman of the knight
calavar to search out and remove that crack-brained cavalier from these
scenes of tumult and danger

the knight calavar said the young soldier sternly like other men
has his eccentricities and follies but if god has smitten him with a
sorer infirmity than others he has left him so much strength of arm and
resoluteness of heart and withal has given him friends of so
unhesitating a devotion that it will always be wise to pronounce his
name with the respect which his great worth and valiant deeds have
proved to be his due

surely said the admiral good-humouredly it is my boast that i can
claim through yourself to be distantly related to this most renowned
and unhappy gentleman and while i would sharply rebuke a stranger for
mentioning him with discourtesy i held myself at liberty to speak of
him with freedom to yourself

i beg your pardon then said amador if i took offence at your
utterance of a word which seemed to me to savour more of the heartless
ridicule with which the world is disposed to remark a mental calamity
than the respectful pity which it is my opinion in such cases should
be always accorded your excellency did right to suppose my business in
this hemisphere was to seek out the knight calavar not however as you
have hinted to remove him from among the savages for i give you to
understand he is ever capable of being the guide and director of his
own actions but to render him the dutiful service of his kinsman and
esquire and to submit myself to his will and government whether it be
to fight these rogues of mexico or any other heathens whatever

i give you praise for your fidelity and affection said the señor
cavallero which i think will stand the knight in good stead if it
be his pleasure to remain longer in this wild country but tell me don
amador as a cavallero of valencia i could not be ignorant of the
misfortune of our very renowned cousin yet was i never able to compass
the cause of his melancholy i remember that when he fleshed his boyish
sword for the first time among the moors of the alpujarras he was
accounted not only of valour but of discretion far beyond his years
there was no patrimony in all granada so rich and enviable as the
lordship of calavar no nobleman of spain was thought to have fairer and
loftier prospects than the young don gines gabriel de calavar none had
greater reason to laugh and be merry for before the beard had darkened
on his lip he had enjoyed the reputation of a brave soldier yet no
sooner came he to man's estate than utterly disregarding the interests
of his house and the common impulses of youth he flung himself into the
arms of the knights of rhodes vowed himself to toil and sorrow and
has ever since been remembered by those who knew him in his boyhood
as the saddest and maddest of men

so much i have heard and so much i know of the good knight said
amador with a sigh little more can i add to the story but that some
calamity the nature of which i never dared to inquire suddenly wrought
this change in him even in the midst of his youth and led him to
devote his life to the cause of the faithful

thou hast heard it suggested said cavallero significantly that in
the matter of the alpujarras his heart was hotter and his hand redder
than became a christian knight even when striking on the hearth of the
infidel

señor cousin and admiral said amador decidedly in my soul i
believe you are uttering these suggestions only from a kinsman's concern
for the honour and welfare of the party in question and therefore do i
make bold to tell you the man who in my hearing asperses the knight
calavar charging his grief of mind to be the fruit of any criminal or
dishonourable deed shall abide the issue of the slander as ruefully as
if it had been cast on the ashes of my mother

so shall he win his deservings said the commander nevertheless doth
calavar himself give some cause for these foolish surmises of which
indiscreet persons have occasionally delivered themselves for the
evident misery of heart and distraction of head the austere and
penitential self-denial of his life nay the very ostentation of grief
and contrition which is written in his deportment and blazoned on his
armour and which has gained him in these lands the appellation of the
penitent knight seem almost to warrant the suspicion of an unquiet and
remorseful conscience brooding over the memory of an unabsolved crime
but i say this not so much to justify as in part to excuse those idle
impertinents who are so free with their innuendoes i have ever
pondered with wonder on the secret of the brave knight's unrest yet i
must confess to thee i was struck with no less astonishment when
returning from nombre de dios to santiago i heard that a famous knight
hospitaller and he no other than don gines gabriel de calavar had
arrived among the islands frenzied with the opportunity of slaying
pagans at his pleasure and had already followed on the path of cortes
to mexico it gave me great pain and caused me no little marvel to
find he had come and vanished with so little of the retinue of his rank
and of the attendance necessary to one in his condition that two or
three ignorant grooms were his only attendants

i have no doubt said amador i can allay your wonder as to these
matters your excellency need not be told that the banner of the turk
now floats over the broken ramparts of rhodes and over the corses of
those noble knights of san juan who defended them for more than two
hundred years and at last perished among their ruins this is a
catastrophe that has pealed over all christendom like the roar of a
funeral bell and its sound has even pierced to these lands of twilight
no knight among all that band of warriors and martyrs as i am myself a
witness did more brave and heroical actions throughout the black and
bloody siege than my lord and kinsman calavar but the good and
ever-gracious saint the patron of this most ancient and chivalric
brotherhood saved him with a few other knights out of the jaws of
destruction and restored him again to his own country rhodes was
fallen there was no longer a home for the destitute knights they
wandered over europe whithersoever their destinies listed but
particularly wheresoever there was an infidel to be slain our monarch
of spain contemplated a crusade among the moors of barbary the
descendants of that accursed why should i not say wretched for they
are exiles that wretched race who had once o'ermastered our own
beloved land the knight calavar entered into this project with
alacrity and set himself to such preparations as should win him good
vengeance for the blood of his brothers lost at rhodes i did myself in
obedience to his will betake me to the business of seeing what honest
christians might be prevailed on to fight under his banner and while
thus engaged at a distance from my beloved lord with perhaps as i
should confess with shame less energy and more sloth than were becoming
in his follower i suffered certain worldly allurements to step between
me and my duty and for a time almost forgot my renowned and unhappy
kinsman now señor continued the youth with some little hesitation
and a deep sigh it is not necessary i should trouble you with any very
particular account of my forgetfulness and stupidity it was soon known
that the enthusiasm of our king was somewhat abated touching the matter
of the african crusade perhaps swallowed up in the interest wherewith
he regarded the new world which god and the great colon had given him
the enthusiasm of his subjects diminished in like manner there was no
more talk of africa this señor may perhaps in a measure excuse my own
lethargy but you may be assured i awoke out of it with shame and
mortification when i discovered that the good knight left to himself
and deprived of that excitement of combat or the hope of combat so
necessary to the well-being of his mind had suddenly doubtless in one
of those paroxysms of eccentricity or delirium as i may call it to
you departed from the land and was now cleaving the surges that
divided us from the new hemisphere there was nothing left for me but to
follow him in the first ship that sailed on the same adventure this i
have done i have tracked my leader from palos to cuba from cuba to
this barren coast and now with your good leave and aidance i will
take the last step of the pursuit and render myself up to his authority
in the barbaric city tenochtitlan

i respect your motive and praise your devotion most worthy cousin
said the admiral with much kindness and yet you must forgive me if i
dare to express to you some degree of pity my long acquaintance with
these countries both of isle and main has well instructed me what you
have to expect among them and i can truly conceive what sacrifices you
have made for the good knight's sake in any case i beg leave to
apprise you you can command all my services either to persist in
seeking him or to return to spain my advice is that you leave this
place forthwith in a ship which i am to-morrow to despatch to
andalusia return to your native land betake yourself to those
allurements and that lethargy which i can well believe may bring you
happiness commend yourself to your honourable lady-love and think no
more of the wild calavar here if you lose not life before you have
looked on your kinsman as there is much fear you must resolve to pass
your days in such suffering and misery and withal in ignoble warfare
with naked savages supported by such mean and desperate companions as
i am sure you were never born to

what you counsel me said amador coolly is doubtless both wisdom and
friendship nevertheless if your excellency will be good enough to
reconsider your advice you will perceive it involves such selfishness
meanness and dishonour as cannot be listened to with any propriety by
a kinsman of the knight of calavar i do not say i come hither to
condescend to this ignoble warfare though if it be worthy my good
knight i shall have no reason to scorn it i bear with me to my
kinsman the despatch of his most eminent highness the grand master of
the most illustrious order of san juan wherein although it be
recommended to him if such warfare seem to him honourable and
advantageous to the cause of christ to strike fast and well it is if
such strife be otherwise strongly urged on him to return without delay
to europe and to the isle of malta which it is announced our monarch
of spain will speedily give to the good knights it is therefore
continued the cavalier from the nature of things and of mine own will
clearly impossible i should follow your advice in default of which i
must beg such other counsel and assistance of your excellency as your
excellency may think needful to bestow only premising that as i have
many a weary league of sand and mountain to compass the sooner you
benefit me with these good things the better

your journey will be neither so long nor so wearisome as you imagine
said cavallero but i fear me will present more obstructions than you
may be prepared to encounter i take it for granted the governor
velasquez has furnished you with no commands to his general don panfilo
de narvaez since he gave you none to myself

this is even the fact said amador i entered the caravel which
brought me here as i thought in defiance of his authority and not
without apprehensions of being obliged to cut off the ears of some dozen
or two of his rogues who might be ordered to detain me nevertheless i
left the island without a contest and equally without aidance of any
kind from this discourteous ruler

i must give thee some counsel then said the admiral for i
apprehend the governor did very perfidiously as i esteem it when he
ceased his opposition rest much hope on that of his general thou art
acquainted with the character of narvaez

by my faith i am so ignorant of all matters appertaining to these
climates that saving thine own and the knight calavar's and one or
two others which i acquired this morning i am familiar only with those
of two other persons to wit of velasquez whom i consider a very
scurvy and ill-bred personage and of cortes a man whom i hold in much
esteem ever since i heard he burned his fleet to keep his followers
from running away and made prisoner of the great mexican emperor in his
own capital in addition to this i know the aforesaid governor doth
very hotly hate and hath disgraced with the titles of rebel and outlaw
this same respectable and courageous cortes but for what reason as i
have been kept in somewhat too great a passion to inquire i am yet
altogether ignorant

for one who may soon share an important part in the events of this
region i think thou showest a most princely indifference to them said
the admiral smiling i will not say the safety but the facility with
which thou mayest traverse these lands will be greatly increased by
knowing some little of their history and that knowledge i will hasten
to impart to thee and with what brevity i can if i should be led to
speak with more freedom of certain persons than may seem fitting in an
inferior and a colleague i must beseech thee to remember i am doing so
to a kinsman and for his especial information and good know then
señor don amador the person whom it pleased our viceroy the son of
colon to set over us and whom it has since pleased his most devout
majesty the emperor to confirm in the government of cuba and even to
that to add the further dignity of ruler of the kings of mexico is as
i hinted to thee before afflicted with so irascible a temper and so
jealous a fancy that were i not restrained by the office i hold under
him i should say he was at the least as mad as any other man in his
dominion the desire of immortalizing himself by some great exploit
would be commendable in him were it not accompanied by the ambition to
achieve it by the hands of another ever since the discovery of this
fair empire of montezuma by the señor cordova he has thirsted for the
glory of subduing it and has taken all the steps necessary to such a
purpose except the single one of attempting it in person an omission
not in itself important since there are an hundred other cavaliers more
capable of the task only that besides the other munitions with which
he furnishes his lieutenant he follows him ever with so plentiful a
store of distrust that it is utterly impossible his officer should have
a chance to immortalize him after much seeking of a man whose ambition
should extend no further than to the glory of winning a crown for the
purpose of seeing his excellency wear it he fixed upon the worthy
hidalgo hernan cortes a gentleman of medellin in estremadura and
despatched him on the business of conquest now no sooner was his
general gone than this jealous imagination whereof i spake instantly
presented to his mind the image of cortes as a conqueror suddenly
laying claim before the emperor and the world to the sole merit of the
conquest a spectacle so infinitely intolerable that without delay he
set himself at work to hinder cortes from making any conquest at all

surely said amador this governor velasquez is a fool as well as a
knave

heaven have him in keeping you should mention him with respect but as
you are speaking in the confidence of blood-relationship i cannot take
notice of your sarcasm said the admiral the señor cortes however
continued cavallero was by no means disposed to second the disloyal
frenzy of the governor disloyal i call it since it threatened to
deprive his majesty the emperor charles of the opportunity of adding a
new empire to his diadem on the other hand cortes was fully
determined to do his duty and thought the governor could do nothing
better than to follow his example but in the end this same cortes
though of as meek a temper as is desirable in the commander of an army
became greatly incensed at the sottish and grievous distrust of his
governor and calling his army together and representing to them the
foolish predicament in which his excellency had placed them he threw
down his truncheon with contempt and told them that as velasquez had
left them without a leader the wisest thing that remained for them was
to find another as soon as possible as for himself he disdained to
hold his commission longer under such a commander

by heaven a most proper-spirited and gallant gentleman cried amador
i honour him for the act but chiefly for the contempt it argued of
this jackfeather ruler

i must beg of your favour said the admiral gravely to remember
that his excellency is my chief and commander though in justice i
think you have some reason to censure him what remained for the army
of cortes now no longer having a general they were loath to leave the
fair empire that appeared almost in their grasp and enraged at the
governor who seemed determined to rob them of it there was only one
way to secure the conquest for their royal master they absolved
themselves of their allegiance to the governor swore themselves the
soldiers and subjects of the emperor alone and erecting themselves
into a colony forthwith elected cortes their governor and
commander-in-chief and despatched advice of the same to don carlos
with a petition for permission to pursue and conclude the conquest of
tenochtitlan in his name

a very loyal defensible and indeed praiseworthy action said don
amador with emphasis and i marvel your jealous governor did not stab
himself forthwith out of pure chagrin to be so sharply and justly
outwitted

instead of that said the admiral boiling with vexation and rage
and devoting cortes to the fiend who had first suggested him as a proper
lieutenant his excellency equipped a second army more than twice as
strong as that he had ordered cortes to raise and this one would have
thought he would have commanded in person but the old whim of
conquering by lieutenants and becoming famous by proxy still beset the
brain of his wisdom he gave the command of an army of more than a
thousand men to the señor panfilo de narvaez a biscayan of
whom the best i can say is that he swore eternal fidelity to
velasquez resolving privately in his own mind that as soon as he had
subdued cortes he would follow his example and throw off the authority
of his distrustful commander

i should call this treachery said amador but that i think the
absurdity of the chief a full excuse for the defection of the follower

the wisdom of the proceeding is now made manifest continued the
admiral it is scarce a month since it was my misfortune as commander
of the naval division of this expedition to land the forces of narvaez
on this shore here i learned with much admiration that cortes
notwithstanding the meagerness of his army had absolutely after
certain bloody combats with savages on the wayside marched into the
great city taken possession of the body of the barbarous emperor and
through him virtually of all the lands which acknowledged his sway
and you may understand how much as a true and reasonable subject of our
catholic monarch i was afflicted to learn in addition that the
sending of the new force by velasquez only served the purpose of
snatching the conquest out of our hands for cortes under a delusion
which may be pardoned him on account of its loyalty regarding himself
in obedience to the command of his followers as the only true
representative and general of our king and ourselves by consequence
as traitors and rebels to his majesty did forthwith resolve to drive us
from the land to do which it was needful he should withdraw his forces
from tenochtitlan and therefore tenochtitlan is lost

thou sayest the señor cortes hath an army not half so powerful as the
biscayan's

nay tis much short of five hundred men and weakened by a year's
campaign and still further diminished by the necessity of maintaining a
garrison in his port of vera cruz which he doth humorously denominate
the rich city and leaving another of more than a hundred men with one
of his best captains in the goodly city out of a hope which i myself
reckon both vain and foolish still to retain possession of it

and with this shattered and pitiful handful which i think cannot
exceed three hundred men said amador the brave cortes is resolute to
resist the biscayan and his thousand fresh combatants

it is even so replied cavallero

i give him the praise of a most dauntless and heroic leader cried
amador and i am eager to proffer him the hand of friendship

not only resolute to resist said the admiral but from the most
undeniable tokens impatient to attack as indeed are all his people
as an evidence of which i may tell thee that narvaez having quartered
his host at an indian city called zempoala within a few leagues of this
aforesaid stockade and rich city of the true cross he straightway
despatched certain officers military civil and religious to demand
the surrender of the same at the hands of the very young and very
simple-minded señor don gonzalo de sandoval its commandante what
answer thinkest thou was made by this foolish captain so many leagues
separated from his commander and so far from all assistance faith he
flings me the envoys into certain bags of net-work as one would live
quails and tossing them upon the backs of lusty savages in lieu of
asses despatched them forthwith over the mountains to his general and
this is the only answer my colleague and most excellent friend the
general narvaez ever received to his summons for the surrender of the
rich city of the true cross

a spirited and ever-to-be-commended youth this same bold sandoval
said amador earnestly and i begin to bethink me i shall not be loath
to remain for a time in the company of a leader who hath such worthy
spirits for his companions but tell me señor cavalier and cousin hath
cortes yet struck a blow for his honour and his right

by our lady no said the admiral and yet upon reflection
continued he i must confess that though he has not yet drawn a
christian sabre on the biscayan he has done him much hurt with a
certain weapon of gold the use of which he learned at mexico and whose
blows by the operation of a kind of magic have the virtue to paralyze
the wrath without spilling the blood of an adversary

this is a weapon of the devil said the young cavalier indignantly
which i marvel much should be used by so worthy a soldier
nevertheless as it does not shed blood the use of it may be
justifiable in a contest between brothers and countrymen wherein
humanity and mercy are always more christian qualities than the rage and
blood-thirstiness of another warfare but notwithstanding all this if
such enchanted arms if such indeed exist as i cannot believe be in
vogue among the followers of cortes i swear to god and saint john i
will eschew them as i would the gifts of the fiend and if compelled by
the command of my good knight to fight in their company it shall be
with such sword and spear as i can use with a free conscience and an
honest arm

i commend your honourable resolution said the admiral amused with
the literal straightforwardness of his kinsman but without thinking fit
to undeceive him but how long the cavalier cortes will employ so
bloodless a rapier is more than i can determine he now lies within a
few leagues of my colleague the biscayan and although apparently more
ripe for negotiation than combat i shall be much mistaken if he do not
at some convenient season so fling his crew of desperadoes at the head
of narvaez as shall make his excellency stare indeed there is now
little hope of pacification for narvaez has very grievously insulted
cortes by proclaiming him a rebel and an outlaw and setting a price on
his head and such is his hotheadedness that it was but yesterday he
compelled me to ship to cuba the king's oidor vasques whom he had
arrested for daring to speak to him of amicable treaty i look daily for
intelligence of a battle

i vow to heaven said amador his eyes sparkling with animation i
vow to heaven i have no desire to mingle in a civil fray of any kind
but if these mad fellows must be e'en at it i see no reason why i
should not stand hard by to be a witness of their bravery wherefore
most excellent cousin i must entreat of your favour to despatch me
without delay with such guides or instructions as will enable me to
reach the señor cortes before the combat begins

if it would suit thee as well to survey this spectacle from the camp of
narvaez said cavallero i could gratify thee without any difficulty
but i must apprise thee that to reach cortes it will be necessary to
pass the lines of narvaez and what obstructions he may choose to throw
in thy way is more than i can very satisfactorily determine though i
may counsel thee how best to overcome them

please heaven said amador proudly he shall make me no opposition
which he shall not answer to the cost of his body for i am here a free
hidalgo of spain knowing no authority but the king's will and mine own
a neophyte and as i may add a knight by right though unsworn of
the illustrious order of san juan bearing the instructions of his most
eminent highness the grand master to a vowed knight and therefore
liable to the command of no other man save only as before excepted
the king and he who thinks to hinder me in my passage besides
provoking the wrath of the aforesaid privileged order must as i said
before do it under the peril of mine own sword

it would not become me to question your privileges or the danger with
which they might be invaded said the admiral nor will i repeat to
you in how little regard these matters may be had by a man who has
presumed to arrest and imprison the representative of his majesty
himself and who surrounded by an army and separated from the sway of
the laws is beyond the present responsibility of any government but
that of his own conscience i can only remind you that as an emissary
of the holy order you are doubly bound to avoid a quarrel with a
christian and countryman especially when as will presently be your
case you are in the lands of the infidel i must beg to remind you
too that the biscayan holding as he believes the authority of the
king and compelled to act as may seem to him necessary for the
preservation of the king's interest should be respected accordingly
and his humours as well as his rightful commands borne without anger
or opposition

may his majesty live a thousand years said the cavalier it is no
part of my principle to oppose his pleasure wherefore if contesting
the authority of this biscayan general be such disloyalty i will
refrain from it that is as long as i can but nevertheless i will
protest against any authority that may hinder my present journey

moderation and the exercise of patience said cavallero will
doubtless secure you from restraint and insult it is quite necessary
you report the object of your travel to the commander narvaez and even
to desire his permission a courtesy that has in it nothing of
degradation to continue your journey

doubtless said amador sarcastically you will tell me as did the
señor gomez the captain of the caravel that this submission of myself
to his commands will be nothing more than the rendering of a customary
compliment to his dignity if there be any way by which i may pass by
the camp of narvaez i shall be much bound to your excellency to inform
me of it and i will pursue it be it ever so rough and long with much
more satisfaction than i can ever make my entreaties to him

there is no other way said the admiral the indian city zempoala
where narvaez has established his head-quarters lies immediately on the
path to the villa rica and the scouts of narvaez occupying all the
intermediate ground render it impossible you should pass him without
observation or them without their leader's commands i am now about to
despatch to narvaez certain reinforcements in whose company i recommend
you to travel and with whom i will send such representations to the
general as i think will secure you his instant permission and
doubtless aid to join your kinsman the good knight without delay
only let me entreat of you as your true friend and relation not
wantonly by any overbearing pride to exasperate the peevish temper of
my colleague

i will take your advice said the cavalier complacently and treat
the biscayan with as much respect as he may seem to deserve only as it
may be a long day's journey to this zempoala i must entreat your
excellency to give orders for the instant debarkation of my horses and
attendants and permit me to follow them as soon as possible

this shall be instantly done said the admiral in the meanwhile i
must beg to entertain you with the sight of one of those personages who
will be your companions on the journey




chapter iii


at the signal of the admiral an officer made his appearance received
certain commands the most agreeable of which to the young cavalier were
those in reference to his own liberation and then immediately withdrew

thou wilt now see worthy cousin said cavallero a man whom
although a base moor and infidel thou shouldst regard with some sort of
admiration since from the reports of those who brought him hither he
is endowed with a spirit and pugnacity worthy even of a christian

while the admiral spoke the door of the cabin was darkened by the
bodies of several men who at his beck advanced and stood full in the
view of the neophyte he perceived in these besides two or three
officers of the ship nothing more with a single exception than the
rough figures of ordinary sailors this exception presented itself in
the bronzed visage and wildly attired person of the moor and amador
almost started when the bright eyes of the pagan rolled from the
admiral to himself in a brief but most penetrating stare in person the
moor was somewhat above the ordinary stature but his limbs though
hardy and active enough were much attenuated his face was emaciated
and bony and the long black locks falling wildly over it gave it an
appearance exceedingly haggard a character greatly augmented by the
white eyeballs flashing like stars in its almost nubian blackness
something perhaps was to be allowed for the effect of his uncouth and
savage attire which was composed almost entirely of skins seemingly of
dogs or wolves a portion of which encircled his loins as a tunic while
the remainder lay like a cape or short cloak about his shoulders
under this latter garment however was a shirt of cotton stained with
bright colours and a kerchief of similar material glittered not so
much like a turban as a fillet round his head rude sandals strapped as
high as the midleg with shreds cut from his cloak completed the
primitive costume of the barbarian

this fellow said the admiral turning from him to one who seemed as
chief of the seamen this fellow is then the commander of that sallee
pirate you took among the canaries

commander or not i cannot say said the sailor with a shrug but
chief varlet at the gun as i am free to maintain and freer was he at
that same ordnance than was like to be safe for the good snow la
encarnacion as her ribs may yet testify but the knave speaks spanish
and if your excellency chooses to ask him can tell you his rank and
condition

no commander no pirate said the moor with a voice whose soft and
harmonious accents contrasted strangely with his rude appearance no
commander no pirate he repeated in good castilian but a poor
morisco of fez voyaging in a harmless trader to the gibbel-al-tarik

the gibbel-al-tarik said the admiral dryly would have been much
beholden for the new visit of an infidel

no commander no pirate no infidel said the moor earnestly but a
poor shepherd of fez brought to a knowledge of the true faith and
driven from the home of his fathers for the exercise of it to the land
of his fathers enemies

moor said the admiral composedly there are three reasons why i
should not believe thee first because thou art a moor and therefore
born to be a liar and deceiver secondly because unless god should
have worked a greater miracle for the good of a besotted heathen than he
often vouchsafes to prayerful christians there is no possibility thou
couldst be converted to the faith among the sands of barbary and
thirdly because the fact that thou art skilful in the management of
ordnance is sufficient proof thou canst not be an ignorant shepherd of
fez whose hands are more commonly trained to the spear and arrow than
to the quoin and linstock

he manages them said the sailor as if he had been born with them in
his hands as i have made proof sometimes for my amusement during the
tedium of the voyage

if my lord will listen to me said the moor eagerly though humbly i
will make it apparent that i speak nothing but the truth my father
drew his first breath among the almogavars of the desert his son opened
his eyes among the hills of granada

ha cried the admiral thou art then one of the accursed tribe of
mine own land

a morisco of the alpujarras said the moor submissively whom in my
very early youth it pleased my father to have baptized in the holy
faith as was the command of his most faithful and ever-blessed majesty
the king fernando the conqueror of the kings of granada this will
show my lord that i speak the words of a christian as an almogavar i
was born to be a soldier and so trained to all arms of an almogavar
the knife and dart the spear and axe the cross-bow and musket as well
as other weapons of christians this will show my lord how it came that
i was found skilful at the cannon

thou speakest like a cunning and most honest man said the admiral
gravely but all this revelation does not show me how an almogavar of
granada became a herdsman of the desert and after that how the
herdsman of the desert was transformed into the gunner of a sallee
corsair or as thou callest her a harmless trader on her innocent
voyage to gibraltar

may it please my lord said the almogavar bending for a moment his
troubled eyes on the admiral as if to resolve himself whether or not
these questions were put to him in mockery and then casting them
instantly on the floor may it please my lord to remember that after
the fall of granada and the subjugation of the alpujarras many moors
christian as well as pagan preferring rather to lament their miseries
at a distance than in their own enslaved country chose to accept the
merciful permission of the king and withdrew from the land altogether
this did i my lord's servant and slave i fled to the country of my
father and although there i suffered many indignities and hardships
as well as constant peril as being suspected to be an apostate to the
faith of the land i had been content to drag out a wearisome life but
for one grief that was sharper than others

i will shrive thee as patiently as thy confessor said the admiral
but while thou art speaking the sharpest of thy calamities it will be
much proof to me of the sincerity of thy religion if thou use language
somewhat of the briefest

my son said the moor hurriedly my son that was the lamp of my
eye-sight the perfume of my nostrils the song and music of my soul
was in great danger to be led astray and converted back to infidelity
to save him from the contagion of heathenism i resolved to return to
granada where though he might grow up to bondage he should be free
from the thrall of darkness it was better he should be a slave than an
infidel with these thoughts and these hopes in my heart i embarked in
the sallee trader when it was my hard fate to be arrested in my course
by these men of the canaries

thy course said the admiral was none of the straightest and how
thou couldst find thy way to gibraltar by way of the fortunate isles is
much more than my nautical experience can teach me to understand

a great storm said the moor with the deepest humility drove us
from our course and it was the will of god that when the tempest
subsided we should find ourselves beset by two strong ships which
nothing but the fears and desperation of our captain could have tempted
him to think of resisting we fought and were subdued the lives of my
son and myself were preserved out of the horrors of that combat the
ships were traders of the isles bound to these new lands they brought
us hither where there is nothing left us but to claim the privileges of
our faith acknowledge ourselves the thrall and bondmen of his majesty
the king and entreat of my lord to send us when it may suit his good
pleasure to our homes and our altars in granada

the moor concluded his speech with a degree of eagerness approaching
almost to vehemence the admiral indifferently rejoined 

thy name is abdalla  

abdoul al sidi said the moor hastily when my father gave me up to
be baptized he called me in token of his true devotion and humility
esclavo de la cruz but in my days of darkness i was known as abdoul al
sidi a poor almogavar but descended from the ancient lords of fez

sidi abdalla or sir slave of the cross whichever it may please you to
be called said the admiral coolly in respect to your lordly descent
and most dignified title which i think no christian has dared to assume
since the days of the cid rodrigo i will before determining how far i
can make your fate agreeable to your wishes condescend to compare your
story with that of the brave sailor master of the encarnacion who
captured you

if i am to say any thing said the master gruffly it will be first
to pronounce this same abdalla or esclavo as he calls himself a
hypocrite and knave not to be trusted it is true there was a great
storm which might have driven his piratical galley into the
neighbourhood of the canaries but that he showed any extraordinary
ardour to escape as long as my consort was out of sight is a matter
not to be believed trusting to his skill in the management of the great
mangonneau with which the galley was armed and not doubting to
cripple me with some lucky ball before i could approach him he fell to
with right good will and it was not until my consort joined in the
melée that i was able to lay him aboard even then when our crews were
springing on his decks and his fellow-pirates had fled in dismay below
i saw him this very knave abdalla with mine own eyes lay match to the
last charge which thundered against us immediately after which with a
most devilish spirit of desperation he snatched up his boy as one
would a kitten and springing to the opposite side was in the act of
dashing himself into the sea when he was brought down by a
pistol-shot

i thought they would have murdered my poor jacinto said the
almogavar in a low voice and in my desperation desired he should
rather die the easy death of the deep than be mangled by cruel
daggers

there was much fear of that said the master for my sailors had
marked him at the linstock with no great love in faith there were some
five or six cutlasses aimed at his prostrate body but i could not bear
they should slay the boy who lay on his breast and therefore i
commanded them to hold

thou art a right worthy and noble heart said amador ardently
interrupting him for there is no reason a brave soldier even in the
heat of blood and with a pagan under his foot should strike at the
life of a boy and hadst thou done otherwise i swear to thee i was so
much moved by the relation i should have gone nigh to slay thee for thy
barbarity

and besides señor said the master complacently i was beset with
the idea that if i preserved his life and brought him to this land of
mexico i might sell him at a good price as an able cannonier such a
man as i had good reason to know being worth the value of a dozen
bloodhounds and besides he continued without regarding the
expression of disgust and contempt which drove the look of benevolence
from the visage of the cavalier i had greater reason to applaud my
clemency when i discovered that the boy jacinto besides being a comely
and very dexterous stripling was so great a master of the moorish
lute singing withal in a most agreeable manner that i was well assured
some noble cavalier among the invaders would not scruple at any price
to have him for a page

i am a christian the boy is a christian cried the moor hurriedly
and neither of us can be sold to bondage except at the command of his
most faithful and merciful majesty the emperor and king to whose
gracious will and pleasure i desire with my boy to be rendered

good cid said the admiral that is a matter wherein if his
majesty's will were certainly known thou shouldst not have to complain
of our negligence but under present circumstances we must make our
own judgment the representative of the royal wisdom and dispose of thee
in such manner as we may think most conducive to his majesty's interest
we are resolute thou wilt serve him better by directing the thunders of
his cannon against the heathen hordes of mexico than by cultivating his
vines and fig-trees on the hills of granada we must send thee to the
commander narvaez whom if thou please he will doubtless advance thee
to the command of a falconet wherewith thou mayst divert many of thy
almogavar propensities for battle and bloodshed as for the boy it not
appearing to me that the strumming of his strings or the uplifting of
his voice in ballad and redondilla are in any wise necessary to the
conquest of this barbarous empire i may be able if thou insistest upon
that to send him to spain

i take my lord at his word said abdoul trembling with eagerness and
anxiety let the boy be sent to spain to granada to either of the
ports algeciras malaga or almeria and he will find some friends
there to protect his youth and inexperience while i submit to my
harder fate in mexico

to almeria said amador quickly i have myself some acquaintance with
that town and it may perhaps advantage thee to make me thy confidant
if there be any secret friend there thou wouldst send the boy to or to
take my counsel as to what christians may be persuaded to show him
kindness

the moor regarded amador for an instant with a disturbed but piercing
eye his answer was however prevented by the admiral saying

sir slave of the cross with the consent of my very noble kinsman to
cut short all needless discussion on this subject i may as well inform
thee first that if thy boy be sent to spain it will not be to any
port of thy choosing but to such an one as may seem most fit to other
persons and which will most probably be the port of seville wherefrom
thou canst better imagine than myself how thy boy will be helped to
granada in the second place as i deem it but honesty to acquaint thee
if the youth be taken from this land he will first be sent to the
excellent señor the honourable don diego velasquez governor of cuba
to be disposed of by him as may seem most agreeable to his judgment and
i warn thee if the lad be an adept at the lute as is asserted don
diego will find him such employment in twangling to the ladies of our
brave cavaliers as will leave it uncertain how much sooner than
doomsday he will bethink him to advance the poor youth on his voyage

it is enough said the moor with a gloomy countenance god is with
us and it may be better to have the boy among the perils of death than
the seductions of pleasure let my boy stay with me and i am content to
follow my lord's bidding

he bowed his head upon his breast and at the signal of the admiral
was led away

señor capitan continued cavallero addressing the master who still
lingered in the cabin i will satisfy thee for the armament thou hast
brought by acknowledgments which thou must present to the governor
what more moors hast thou brought with thee from the galley capable of
doing service in these exigencies

the father and son are all replied the master the others as i told
your excellency had fled below from the fury of my sailors to make all
sure while rummaging about their cabin we had fastened down the
hatches we had not picked up many things of value before there was a
sudden cry that the pirate was sinking whether this happened from a
shot she may have received or because the accursed runagates below had
knocked a hole in her bottom was more than was ever determined the
alarm sent us scampering to our own vessel and in our hurry as was
natural enough we forgot the infidels in the hold so that when she
went down which she did as soon as we were well clear of her her crew
went along with her but your excellency has not told me whether i am
to receive pay for sidi and the boy

i swear to heaven said the admiral thou hast no more heart than
thine anchor thou shockest me with the detail of a catastrophe which
though affecting the lives of nothing but heathen moors is nevertheless
both dreadful and pitiable and yet thou dost abruptly demand me shall
i have payment for the two lives i saved thou wilt have payment if it
please the governor and not otherwise betake thee to thy ship i will
send thee thy warranties and the sooner thou leavest with them the
better

the master departed and again amador found himself alone with the
admiral

cousin said cavallero i am now able to comply with your wishes i
should have been rejoiced to keep you a prisoner on board the capitana
for a few days but i will not invite you when i perceive you are so
impatient for freedom your horses are doubtless at this moment rolling
on the beach your grooms are with them either combing the sand from
their manes or scraping the sea-spots from your armour a company of
artisans with a military escort is on the eve of marching to the camp
of narvaez i have given such commands as will secure you the company
and friendly aidance of that escort in addition to which i will
immediately send after you a trusty officer with despatches concerning
yourself to the general and recommendations to him to assist you in
joining your kinsman the knight calavar without delay you will easily
reach zempoala by night-fall i beseech you to salute the general with
courtesy and to-morrow you will be in the arms of your leader

i am so overjoyed said the cavalier at the thought of once more
bestriding my poor fogoso and exchanging the stupid pitching of a ship
for the bound of his gallop and curvet that i know not how i can do
otherwise than treat the biscayan with urbanity

a barge is ready to conduct you to the shore continued the admiral
leading the young soldier to the side of the vessel i pray heaven to
give you a prosperous journey and to carry you with as much safety as
honour through the weapons of the heathen multitude make my devoirs to
his noble valour the good knight of rhodes and say to the señor
cortes that though fate has arrayed me against him as an enemy i
cannot forget the friendship of our past lives nay continued
cavallero with emphasis tell him that though it does not become me
as an officer commissioned by velasquez to hold any communications with
him excepting those of simple form and civility i shall be well pleased
when heaven has removed the obstruction and left me at liberty to meet
him with full friendship and confidence this salutation said the
admiral significantly there is no reason thou shouldst impart to
narvaez for he is distrustful and suspicious to that degree that i do
not doubt he would torture its harmlessness into a matured treason

i will do your bidding said amador blithely both to the biscayan
and the cavalier of medellin and now with a thousand acknowledgments
for your favour and assistance and as many wishes for your weal and
comfort i bid you the farewell of a kinsman and true friend

and so saying and heartily shaking the hand of his excellency the
young cavalier sprang into the boat and was soon wafted to the beach




chapter iv


the rapture with which don amador de leste exchanged the confined decks
of the caravel for the boundless sands of ulua and these again for the
back of his impatient steed was fully as great as he had promised
himself profound was his joy to find the demon of ennui which had
beset the cribbed and confined charger as sorely as the cabined master
flying from his dilated nostrils and giving place to the mettlesome
ardour which had won him the title of the fiery the neigh that he sent
forth was like the welcome of the battle the fire that flashed in his
eye was bright as the red reflection of a banner and when he reared up
under his rider it was as if to paw down the opposition of crouching
spearmen a few snuffs of the morning breeze a few bounds over the
sandy hillocks and the beast that had pined in stupefaction in a narrow
stall on the sea was converted into an animal fit for the seat of a
warrior

the cavalier galloped about for a few moments while his attendants made
their preparations for the journey then returning like a thoughtful
leader to inquire into their welfare he beheld them with great
satisfaction both horse and man in good condition to commence their
adventurous campaign

the elder of his followers was a personage of years and gravity a mass
of grizzled locks fell from under his iron skull-cap and a shaggy beard
of the same reverend hue ornamented his cheeks and throat he had seen
long and sharp service for besides the many scars that marked his
swarthy visage one of which from its livid hue seemed to have been
won in recent combat a sabre-cut extending over his left cheek and
brow had darkened the sinister eye forever but his frame though
somewhat short and squat was robust and even gigantic in proportions
and the muscles springing under the narrow cuishes which together with
a heavy breast-plate made nearly the whole of his defensive armour did
not seem less of iron than their covering he was truly a man-at-arms
worthy to follow at the heels of a valiant cavalier

the second attendant though armed with little more care than the
former had contrived by the judicious distribution of riband-knots and
sashes about his person to assume a more gallant appearance and in
addition he had the smoother features and gayer looks of youth both
were provided with horses strong and not inactive and both as amador
returned were busily engaged in disposing the mails and accoutrements
of the cavalier about the bulky loins of their animals

hearken lazaro thou varlet that flingest my mailed shirt over thy
crupper as if it were a vile horse-cloth he cried to the younger
follower have more care what thou art doing give my helmet to
baltasar and let him sling it with my buckler over his broad
shoulders i will not entrust thee with such matters nor by r lady
with my pistols neither

if i may make bold to speak said baltasar bending his eye bluffly
and with a sort of rude affection on his young lord i can advise a way
to dispose of both casque and buckler more agreeably and usefully than
on the back of either lazaro or myself

thou meanest upon mine own no doubt said amador i have ever found
thee fonder of carrying the arms of a dead foeman than of a living
master though it were the knight calavar himself

that is very true said the veteran chuckling grimly at the
compliment disguised in the sarcasm

i am never loath to do such duty because then my conscience tells me
i am bearing arms which can no longer be of use to their owner

and thou desirest now to intimate that if i were arrayed in my
harness i might put it to some use

quien sabe who knows said baltasar looking around him with an
earnest eye we are now in a strange land possessed by barbarians who
are good at spear and bow and fonder of fighting from an ambuscado than
on an open field and with no true companions that i can see to look
that they be not lurking among yonder woodlands some of which i take
it for granted we have to pass i should grieve sorely to see an arrow
even in a boy's hand aimed at your honour's present hauberk of cloth
and velvet

well thy wisdom will not perish for want of utterance said amador
and in very truth i must own it has sometimes stood me in good
stead i will therefore relieve thee of thy burthen and lazaro shall
hang it to my own shoulders

he descended and the linked surcoat soon invested his person

i will also presume to recommend your honour to have these snapdragons
hung to your saddle-bow said baltasar extending the rude and
ponderous pistols weapons then scarcely creeping into notice but
within twenty years not uncommon in the hands of horsemen for if it
should come to pass that some cut-throat pagan should discharge a
missile at us from the bushes it will doubtless afford your honour much
satisfaction to shoot him dead on the spot a punishment that would not
be so certain with the weapons in my own hands or in lazaro's and
before i could bring my cross-bow from my back it is possible the knave
might have another opportunity to do us mischief

in this matter also said amador good-humouredly i will follow thy
instructions but i give thee warning there is something in the
feeling of my hauberk under this raging sun that admonishes me how soon
my brain would seethe as in a stew-pan under the cover of a steel
helmet wherefore i will have thee carry that in thine own hands until
from the change of atmosphere or the appearance of an enemy i may see
fit to alter my resolution

i have ever found said baltasar with the pertinacity of age and
perhaps of a favourite that under a broiling sun a well-polished
casque of metal is something cooler than a cloth cap a fact the reason
for which i do not myself understand and which i should esteem too
marvellous for belief had i not oft-times put it to the proof

there is even much truth in what thou art saying quoth the cavalier
and i have perhaps philosophy enough to explain the marvel to thee but
that i know philosophy is not much to thy liking there must be a cold
head however under the bright cap otherwise and with a brain as
inflammable as my own i am very well convinced that bright steel would
be just as ignitible as dull iron and so saying he again bestrode the
champing fogoso

it must be as your honour says muttered the man-at-arms but as we
are all as well prepared now to begin our journey as we will be
to-morrow i would fain know of your favour whither lies our path or
where lags the jackanapes that is to guide us i heard some talk in the
caravel of a great troop of horse and foot that was to accompany us
but unless it may have been the herd of vagabonds who a full hour
since took up their march along the sands i know not where to look for
them among these few tinkers and sailors that are strolling yonder among
the huts of bamboo

i have much reliance on the friendship and courtesy of my cousin the
admiral said amador hastily but i must confess that saving the
appearance of yonder bridled horse which may be in waiting for the
officer he told me of it looks very much now as if he had left me to
mine own guidance nay i wrong the worthy señor he cried quickly as
turning with some doubt and indignation towards the ship he beheld a
boat leave her and approach the shore with all the speed of oars the
guide he promised me is without doubt in that barge and the bridled
horse which as i can perceive even at this distance is none of the
bravest is the beast whereon he will keep us company

as amador conjectured the boat contained his promised companion who
instantly sprang upon the beach and on the caparisoned animal and in a
few moments was at the side of the cavalier he was young and handsome
an adult in stature but scarcely a man in deportment for as he removed
his cap to make the obeisance of an inferior there was a strong
tincture of confusion and trepidation in his countenance this was
perhaps owing in part to a consciousness of having merited a reprimand
for over-delay and in part also to his suddenly finding himself
confronted with so warlike a personage as the neophyte amador of the
caravel was a different person from amador armed and mounted and
indeed as he sat on his noble bay mailed and sworded and with two
goodly armsmen at his back he was such a martial figure as might have
moved an older messenger to reverence

señor caballero said the youth with a stammering voice my master
and patron the admiral has appointed me his secretary to be your
guide to the indian city zempoala and i have to beg your pardon if
waiting for the letters wherewith it was his excellency's will to charge
me and to make some needful preparation of my own i have detained your
favour somewhat longer than was agreeable

i am ever bound to thank his excellency said amador and as i well
suppose your own preparations had some weighty relation to the business
you have in charge i will not take it upon me to express any
dissatisfaction with your delay

in truth said the secretary ingenuously i was loath to depart
without such armour about me as should beseem the attendant of a true
cavalier in the fitting of which i fell into some perplexity as not
finding a corselet that did not in some manner incommode my ribs and
besides the sabres were all so unwieldy and rough about the hilts i
was in some despair i should never find one to my liking

señor secretario said amador with a smile of good-humoured contempt
surveying the youth and observing the cuirass chosen with no discretion
and donned without skill i am of opinion that in the company of
myself and my attendants you will find no occasion for such troublesome
apparel and it is my advice grounded on your admission of inexperience
in such matters that should we on our march be beset by any enemies
you take post instantly behind my veteran baltasar whose broad breast
will stand you in greater stead than your ill-chosen cuirass and whose
arm will do you better service than the sabre in your own hands

señor said the youth colouring i am no soldier nor cavalier i
have ever had my breast more bruised by the scribe's table than the
weight of a breast-plate and my fingers have heretofore known more of
the goose-quill than the sword nevertheless i am both willing and
desirous to be placed where the knowledge of weapons may be obtained
and to encounter such risks as are the helpers to knowledge it was from
no lack of beseeching on mine own part that his excellency has
heretofore denied me permission to try my fate among the cavaliers
ashore nor should i have hoped that pleasure so early but that i found
his excellency was bent to do you honour by making a confidential
servant your attendant and was therefore easily persuaded to give me
the opportunity i have so long coveted of looking a little into the
strange sights of this marvellous land

i am to understand then said amador gravely that his excellency
the admiral has entrusted the charge of guiding me to zempoala to an
individual who has never before put foot on the wilderness that divides
us from it

it is true señor said the secretary that i have never been to
zempoala but i hope your favour will not doubt me for that reason nor
take offence at the admiral i am enjoined to conduct you to the
reinforcement that set out an hour ago its tracks are plain enough
along the beach and as it is composed principally of footmen there is
no doubt we will overtake it before another hour has elapsed i am
confident i can lead your favour without difficulty to the party among
which are guides well acquainted with the country

let us set out then in heaven's name said the cavalier the day is
wasting apace the sun climbs high in the vault and the sooner we are
sheltered from its fury among some of yonder distant forests the better
will it be for us st john be our guide and the holy virgin favour
us amen let us depart




chapter v


as the secretary anticipated the tracks of the reinforcement were
plainly discernible over the sandy downs and by the margins of the
pestilent fens which gave an air of desolation to this part of the
mexican coast not much relieved by an occasional clump of palms nor by
the spectacle here and there disclosed of the broad ocean blackening
among the low islets though the hazy and verdant ramparts which
stretched between these burning deserts and the imagined paradises of
the interior ever presented a field of refreshment and interest to the
eyes of the travellers the novelty of their situation felt more or
less intensely by all was exciting and many a dream of barbaric
monarchs reposing on thrones of gold and emeralds and canopied by
flowers and feathers of dusky armies deploying among green valleys and
on the borders of fair lakes and perhaps of themselves doing the work
of heroes among these mystic multitudes wandered through their
over-troubled fancies

such visions flitted over the brain of amador but mingled with others
with which the past had more to do than the present for despite the
eager longing with which he looked forward to a meeting with his good
knight and kinsman and notwithstanding his impatient ardour to gaze
with his own eyes upon those scenes which were filling the minds of men
with wonder he looked back from a sand-hill to the distant ships and
sighed as in an instant of time his soul was borne from them over
the broad surges to the pleasant hills of spain

but with the view of the squadron vanished his memory and his
melancholy the narrow belt of sand-hills along the coast had been
exchanged for the first zone of vegetation the mimosa afforded its
shade the breeze and the paroquet chattered together on its top and
when he came at last to journey among the shadows of a forest rich in
magnificent and unknown trees and plants with here a lagoon fringed
with stately ceibas the cotton-wood trees of mexico and gigantic
canes and there a water-course murmuring among palms and other tropical
trees he gave himself up to a complacent rapture he remarked with
satisfaction the bright plumage of water-fowl the egret the pelican
the heron and sometimes the flamingo sporting among the pools gazed
with wonder after the little picaflor or humming-bird darting like
a sunbeam from flower to flower with still greater admiration listened
to the song of the calandra and the cardinal and to the magical
centzontli the hundred-tongued as it caught and repeated as if
with a thousand voices the thousand roundelays of other songsters
scattered among the boughs and it was not until the notes of a
trumpet swelling suddenly in the distance invaded his reveries that
he roused from the voluptuous intoxication of such a scene

it is the trumpet of the soldiers señor cried the secretary
joyously and it rejoices me much for i know not how much longer i
could have followed their obscure tracks through this forest and
besides i find as i must in honesty confess i have in me so little of
the skill of a leader that i would gladly submit to be led myself
especially by your worship though it were to follow you to battle as an
humble esquire

i must commend your spirit señor lorenzo fabueno for so the
secretary had called himself though i must needs believe your
inexperience in all matters of war might render such an attempt
exceedingly difficult if not altogether impossible

señor said the secretary eagerly i have the wish and doubtless
the ability in course of time to learn all the duties and to acquire
some of the skill of a soldier and under so noble a leader as your
favour i am sure i should advance much faster than ever i did in the
learning of a clerk and in addition to the little service i might
render with my sword i have such skill with the pen as might be of good
use to your honour

i have no certain assurance said amador that i shall have any
occasion to use my own sword it is utterly beyond my imagination to
discover to what use i could put the inkhorn of a secretary and
finally i know not how the course of events in these deserts may
require me to add to the number of my associates nevertheless señor
lorenzo if it be the wish of his excellency the admiral that his
secretary should be transformed into a soldier i see not how i can
refuse to give my assistance to the conversion

i know not why i should be dungeoned in a ship's cabin said lorenzo
with a sort of petulance when other youths are roaming at liberty
among these brave hills and gnawing a quill with disgust when all my
old schoolmates are carving out reputation with more manly implements i
am sure i was not born to slave forever at the desk

this may be all true as in my opinion it is both natural and
reasonable said amador with gravity for it seems to me man was
brought into the world for a nobler purpose than to scribble on paper
yet you have not made it apparent that the admiral's wishes are in this
matter consonant with your own

i know not that they are replied the secretary but as i now feel
myself at liberty with both horse and sword i cannot help feeling that
they ought to be how i can ever have the heart to return to my bondage
again is more than i can tell and i am confident if it were your
favour's desire he should grant me permission to follow you through this
land he would make no opposition the more particularly that your
favour is his kinsman

i doubt whether the consent would not be wrung from his courtesy and i
cannot well agree to rob him of one who may be a valuable servant
neither under such circumstances can i think of encouraging you in
your ardour or recommending you at present to change your pursuits
for which you are better fitted than for mine nay said the cavalier
good-naturedly observing the chagrin of the youth if you are
resolutely bent on your purpose it is my advice you make your petitions
to his excellency and when he has granted them as doubtless he will
you can with a free mind seek the patronage of some cavalier engaged
in these armies of invasion hark the trumpet sounds louder and
nearer and by my faith i see on yonder rising ground the bodies of men
and the glimmer of weapons spur thy horse a little and i pr'ythee
fling thy shoulders a jot backwards sitting erect and at ease for i
promise thee this manner of riding as if thou wouldst presently be
hugging at thy nag's neck is neither becoming nor advantageous spur
me up a little and we will join company with them

the long and straggling train with which the travellers caught up just
as it issued from the forest upon an open tract of low sandy hills and
plains was composed of motley materials a few mounted men who by
their armour and bustling activity seemed the leaders and commanders
were scattered among a horde of footmen a portion of whom were armed
and ranked as a company of military but the greater part being the
ordinary native labourers who served the office of mules and bore on
their backs the burdens of the invaders some five or six score of these
swarthy creatures followed by a dozen castilian crossbowmen and a
single horseman brought up the rear they stalked in a line one after
another each bending to his burden and in their uniformity of
equipment gait muscular figures and solemn visages added not a
little to the singularity of the spectacle a narrow strip of some
vegetable texture so rude and coarse that it seemed rather a mat than a
cloth was wrapped round the loins of each leaving their strong and
tawny bodies otherwise naked no sandal protected their soles from the
heated soil and no covering save only the long and matted locks
swinging about their countenances defended their heads from the
scorching sun a huge basket of cane the petlacalli or petaca of
the spaniards carelessly covered with matting and evidently well
charged with military stores and provision weighed upon the shoulders
of each while it was connected by a broad strap to the forehead thus
burthened however and thus exposed to a temperature which as the day
advanced seemed in the open plains nearly intolerable to their
christian companions they strode on with a slow but vigorous step each
bearing a knot of gay flowers or of brilliant feathers wherewith he
defended his face from insects and perhaps occasionally his eyes from
the dazzling reflection of the soil these were the tlamémé or
carriers of mexico

the eye of amador though at first attracted by this singular train
dwelt with more surprise and curiosity on the crossbowmen who were
sweltering in common with nearly every christian of the party under
the thick and uncouth investment of the escaupil a sort of armour
which the invaders of mexico had not disdained to borrow from their
despised enemies this consisted of nothing more than garments of
woollen or cotton cloth cut as much after the fashions of spain as was
possible quilted so thickly with cotton as to be able to resist the
arrow heads and lance-points of the indians which virtue added to the
facility with which it could be obtained and adapted to every part of
the body gave the escaupil a decided preference over the few pieces of
iron mail which the poverty of the combatants denied them the power of
extending to the whole frame in truth so common had become this
armour that there were few among the cavaliers of the conquest except
those leaders who despised so unknightly and so unsightly an attire who
were provided with any other nevertheless many distinguished captains
concealed garments of this material under their iron armour and the
common soldiers of cortes after long experience had fallen upon the
plan of quilting it in pieces imitative of morions and breast-plates
which were far from being uncouth or unwieldy but its efficacy though
strongly explained and urged by the secretary fabueno could not blind
don amador to its ungainliness as seen in the fashions of raw recruits
and even the solemn gravity of baltasar was changed to a grin of
ineffable derision and the good-humoured vivacity of lazaro to a laugh
of contempt when the secretary advised the cavalier to provide his
followers with such coats of mail

what thinkest thou lazaro rogue said don amador merrily thou
wert but a bitter groaner over the only cut it was ever thy good hap to
meet and that was by a fair and courteous pistol-shot which hath
something of an oily way about it whereas these infidel flints and
hard woods gash as painfully as an oyster-shell what sayest thou shall
i give thee an escaupil to save thee from new lamentation

may your honour live a thousand years said the serving-man the
tortoise to his shell the turk to his turban heaven never thrust a
hornet into the cocoon of a caterpillar nor a lion into a sheep's skin
wherefore i will keep my sting and my claws free from the cotton bags
the only merit of which is that when a man is wounded in them he has
lint ever ready at his fingers

for my part said baltasar i am in this matter much of lazaro's
way of thinking howsoever please your favour when i see these
lubberly lumps fight more courageously than myself in my iron trifles i
will straightway change my mind on the subject

hold thy tongue then said the cavalier lest thou give offence to
some of these worthy cotton-coats who have in no manner furnished
thee with cause for a quarrel

the cavalier rode on followed closely by his attendants courteously
returning the salutations which were everywhere rendered to his apparent
rank and martial appearance by the spanish portion of the train though
not even the glitter of his mail the proud tramp of his war-horse nor
the stout appearance of his followers drew a glance from the tlamémé
the dull apathy which the oppression of ages has flung over the spirits
of mexicans at the present epoch had already been instilled into the
hearts of this class of natives which with some others under the
prevalence of the common feudalism of barbarians were little better
than bondmen he rode slowly by them admiring the sinewy bulk of their
limbs and the ease with which they moved under their heavy burdens

the van of the train was formed by a score of footmen all arrayed in
the escaupil and all with the exception of some five or six who bore
firelocks armed with sword and spear a cavalier of goodly presence
and well mounted rode at their head and amador thinking he perceived
in him the tokens of gentle blood and manners pressed forward to salute
him the ringing of fogoso's heels arrested the attention of the leader
who turning round and beholding the gallant array of the stranger
instantly returned upon his path and met him with many courteous
expressions at the very moment of meeting amador's eye was attracted
by a figure which in making way for the steed of the leader had
well-nigh been trodden under the hoofs of his own and in which when
removed from this peril he instantly remarked the spare person and
haggard countenance of the moor holding fast to the hand of the
almogavar and indeed for an instant while the danger lasted wrapped
anxiously in his arms was a boy whose youth and terror might have won
a second notice had not the salutation of the officer immediately
occupied his attention

the señor amador de leste said he thou varlet of an infidel i will
strike thee with my lance this menacing objurgation was addressed to
the moor at the moment when most endangered he wavered with his boy
between the horses the señor amador de leste he continued as the
moor recovering himself cowered away will not be surprised to find
his coming expected and his presence welcomed by the general narvaez
or by his excellency's humble friend and captain juan salvatierra

señor salvatierra i give you good thanks replied amador and
although i know not what avant-courier has proclaimed the approach of so
obscure an individual as myself i will not for that reason receive
your courtesy less gratefully

i have with me here said salvatierra with a stately condescension
several of your fellow-voyagers of the caravel among whom it would
have been strange indeed if any had forgotten the name of so honourable
a companion

those cavaliers of the caravel said amador dryly who condescend to
claim me as a companion do me thereby a greater honour than i am
desirous to do myself sly companions are as you may see my two
men-at-arms to which we will at present add the young señor fabueno
whom as the secretary of his excellency the admiral cavallero i am not
indisposed to acknowledge

there was something in the tone of the haughty and even arrogant
neophyte that might have nettled his new friend but its only effect
beside bringing a little colour upon his rather pallid cheeks was to
rob his suavity of somewhat of its loftiness

it is for hidalgos and cavaliers of knightly orders he said and not
for ignoble adventurers to aspire to the fellowship of a valiant knight
of san juan

i am no knight of san juan said amador but a simple novice who may
one day claim admission to the illustrious order by right of birth or
not as it may please the destinies and mine own humour nevertheless i
have much pleasure to speak of the order and its valiant brothers at
every opportunity and at the present moment i am moved to ask your
favour as relying much on your knowledge what tidings have been last
had of the good knight calavar an eminent branch of that most lordly
though thunder-stricken stock

concerning the knight of calavar said salvatierra blandly it is my
grief to assure you that his madness  

call it his melancholy or his humour said amador sternly and let
it be some mitigation to your surprise if my correction sound like a
rebuke to know that i am his kinsman

again did the colour mount into the cheeks of the cavalier and again
did his courtesy or his discretion get the better of the impulse that
raised it

the kinsman of that valiant and renowned gentleman he said politely
shall command me to any epithet he chooses the señor de leste will
doubtless lament to hear that his kinsman with an eccentricity scarce
worthy his high birth and knightly dignity still stoops to be the
follower of an inferior and rebel the outcast and proclaimed outlaw
hernan cortes

as far as my own judgment is concerned in this matter señor
caballero said amador coolly i very much doubt whether i shall
lament that circumstance at all the knight calavar will not disparage
his dignity or his profession by choosing to serve where a
little-minded man might covet to command such a condescension in him
besides being a new proof of magnanimity and fidelity to his vows
whereby he is sworn never to make peace with the infidel is only an
evidence to me that the cavalier cortes whom you call a rebel and
outlaw must be a man worthy of much more respectful appellations as
indeed methinks your own reflections should show you must be the due
of any associate of the knight of calavar

the unaffected surprise and even consternation with which the follower
of narvaez heard the neophyte thus speak of his leader's enemy might
perhaps have urged amador to the utterance of commendations still more
unequivocal had not his eye at that moment been caught by the shadow on
the sand of a man striding nearer to the flanks of fogoso than he had
supposed any footman to be his own position was near the side of the
company of musketeers and spearmen mentioned before his followers not
being willing to obtrude upon the privacy of the cavaliers had fallen a
little back and the morisco as he took it for granted was lagging
some distance behind his surprise was therefore not a little excited
when looking round he beheld the almogavar so close at his side as to
be able to overhear all that was said and drinking his words with an
expression of the intensest interest

son of a dog cried salvatierra who beheld him at the same time and
who was not unwilling to vent some of the gall that amador had raised
in his bosom upon so legitimate an object i will see if i cannot
teach thee how to thrust thyself among soldiers and hidalgos

softly señor caballero cried amador observing the captain raising
his lance strike not abdalla for i have it in my power to inform you
that although in some sense your prisoner and to the eye of a
stranger a most helpless and wretched varlet he has shown himself to
be possessed of a spirit so worthy of respect that you will do yourself
foul shame to strike him

the lance of the cavalier was turned away from the shrinking moor

don amador de leste shall command my weapon whether it be to smite or
to spare said salvatierra smothering the rage which every word and
action of the neophyte seemed fated to inspire and advancing to the
head of the train

hark'ee sidi abdalla continued amador beckoning complacently to the
retiring morisco it is not in my nature to see indignity of any kind
heaped upon a man who hath not the power of vengeance and especially a
man who hath in him the virtue of courage without raising a hand in his
defence

my lord speaks the truth said abdoul with a subdued voice the
almogavar hath not the power of vengeance the strong man may strike
him the proud may trample and he cannot resist the cavalier may wound
with the lance the soldier may smite with the unthonged bow it is all
one his head is bare his breast open his hand empty he can neither
resist nor avenge

by st john of jerusalem said the cavalier warmly moved to a
stronger feeling for the friendless morisco i remember as was
confessed by that beast of a canary captain that when thine enemies
were on thy decks and thy friends fled from thy side for which they
deserved to sink to the bottom as they did thou hadst the courage to
discharge thy mangonneau into the victorious trader for which reason
chiefly but partly because thou hast avowed thyself a christian
proselyte i will take it upon me as far as it may be in my power to
be thy protector and champion

my lord is good said the moor bending his head low on his breast
and in the day of my death i will not forget his benevolence the
almogavar was born to grief trouble came at his first hour his first
breath was the sigh of granada his first cry was mingled with the
groans of his enslaved people his first look was on the tears of his
father sorrow came in youth anguish in manhood and misery is in the
footsteps of years my lord is great and powerful he protects me from
the blow of a spear he can save me from a grief that strikes deeper
than a thousand spears

as i am a true gentleman and christian said amador i will hold to
my word to give thee protection and aid as far as my power lies

the feeble boy that totters over these scorching sands said the moor
raising his eyes wistfully to the cavalier and turning them for an
instant with a look of unspeakable wildness to his son the cavalier
looked back in that momentary pause and beheld the young morisco he
seemed a boy of not more than twelve years the soldier judged only from
his stature for a garment of escaupil of unusual thickness completely
invested and concealed his figure while his face drooping as if from
weariness on his breast was hidden by a cap slouching in disorder and
by long ringlets that fell in childish profusion over his shoulders

the boy continued abdalla turning again to the neophyte and raising
his clasped hands as if in supplication is it fit his tender years
should be passed among the horrors of a camp among the dangers of a
wild war among the vices and contaminations of a brutal soldiery if it
were possible and here the voice of the almogavar trembled with
eagerness if it were possible that boy could be sent to
granada nay to barbary anywhere where for his father's sake he
should be granted a refuge and asylum then might the curse be uttered
the blow struck and abdoul receiving it as the payment of his debt
would not call upon his lord for vengeance

thou heardest from the admiral said amador how impossible would be
the gratification of such a wish since even were he parted from this
shore it rests with another who i can upon mine own knowledge
assure thee is not likely to help him on his way whether he shall not
waste his days among the planters of the islands who according to
common report are not a whit less wild and debauched than their friends
here in mexico

god is just cried the moor clasping his hands in despair

nevertheless continued amador i will not fail to make thy petition
backed with my own request to the señor narvaez and at the worst it
is not improbable some good cavalier may be found who will consent to
receive him as a page and treat him with kindness

god is just reiterated the moor with a gloomy sorrow and the arrow
of the savage may save him from the wrong of the christian

i tell thee again said amador i will not forget to do my best for
his welfare at the first opportunity but tell me abdalla the
morisco was dropping behind he returned i had forgotten to ask thee
a question for which i first called thee i was speaking to this
hot-tempered captain of the knight calavar by heaven it was thus i saw
thine eyes sparkle before is there any magic in the name that it
should move thee to such emotion

the knight calavar said the morisco was among the conquerors of the
alpujarras and how can i hear his name and not bethink me of the black
day of my country his name is in our moorish ballads and when the
orphan sings them he mourns over the fate of his father

that the knight calavar did good service among those rebellious
mountaineers i can well believe said the cavalier hastily but that
he did not temper his valour with mercy is an assertion which no man
can make to me with perfect safety as to those ballads of which you
speak i am not certain if they be not the invention of some devilish
magician opposed to honourable war and glory since it is their sole
purpose to keep one thinking of certain sorrowful particulars that may
be a consequence of victory and conquest such as tearful widows and
destitute orphans and i must declare for mine own part such is the
mischievous tendency of these madrigals that sometimes after hearing
them i have had my imagination so enchanted as to look with disgust at
war and almost to lament that i ever had struck at the life of a human
being i shall like well to have thy boy sing to me but as i will tell
him beforehand it must be of lovelorn knights and of knights going to
battle and never a word about widows and orphans




chapter vi


at midday the squadron after having accomplished more than half the
journey halted for rest and refreshment on the banks of a little river
under the shade of pleasant trees the tlamémé threw down their bundles
and apart from the rest betook themselves to their frugal meal a
plaintain a cake of maize or a morsel of some of the nameless but
delicious fruits of the clime perhaps growing at their side prepared
them for the enjoyment of slumber while the spaniards grouped among
the trees added to this simple repast the more substantial luxury of
the tasajo or jerked beef of the islands

as for the cavalier de leste not having bethought him to give orders
for the preparation of such needful munitions he was glad to accept the
invitation of the captain salvatierra to share his meal and this he did
the more readily that having entered into farther conversation with
the leader after the affair of the lance it was the good fortune of
this gentleman to stumble upon no more offensive topics in addition to
this he observed with great satisfaction that salvatierra preserving
among his subalterns the stateliness which he had vailed to the
neophyte did not mean to trouble him with their society and it was
only at his express desire that the secretary fabueno was admitted to
partake of their repast the excellent taste of the worthy commander or
perhaps the wisdom of his attendants several of whom both christian
and pagan being in constant waiting gave him an appearance of great
rank and importance had provided a stock of food which in variety and
quantity might have satisfied the hunger of half the squadron here
besides the heavenly anana the grateful manioc and other fruits and
roots with which the cavalier had become acquainted in the islands he
was introduced to the royal chirimoya the zapote and other fruits as
new as they were delicious but above all these delights with which
providence has so bountifully enriched the lands of mexico did don
amador admire the appearance of certain fowls which though neither
reeking nor smoking with their savoury juices but drawn cold from their
covering of green leaves were of so agreeable a character as to fill
his mind with transport

either this land is the very paradise of earth said he or señor
salvatierra you have the most goodly purveyors among your household
that ever loaded the table of man i will be much beholden to your
favour to know the name of this fowl i am eating which from its bulk
one might esteem a goose but which i am sure is no such contemptible
creature

that said the leader is a sort of great pheasant the name of which
i have not yet schooled my organs to pronounce but which being taken
among the hills and trained in the cottages of the indians becomes as
familiar and loving as a dog and is therefore always ready when its
master is hungry

by my life then said amador i am loath to eat it for it seems to
me the creature that loves us is more worthy to be consecrated in the
heart than immolated to the cravings of the stomach i will therefore
desire to know something of that other featherless monster at your
elbow previous to determining upon its fitness for mastification

your favour need entertain no scruples about this bird said the
captain for although domesticated and kept by the indians about their
houses in great flocks it hath too much affection for itself to trouble
itself much about its masters it is a kind of peacock and without
possessing any of the resplendent beauty of that animal it is endowed
with all its vanity and pride so that when strutting about with its
shaven head and long-gobbeted beard its feathers ruffled in a majestic
self-conceit our soldiers have sometimes for want of a better name
called it el turco

a better name could not have been invented said the neophyte for if
it be true as is sometimes asserted by those who know better than
myself that heretics and infidels are the food of the devil i know no
morsel should be more agreeable to his appetite than one of those same
pagans that give name to this foolish and savoury creature

the thoughts of amador as he sat testing the merits of the noble fowl
which is one among the many blessings america in after days scattered
over the whole world wandered from mexico to rhodes from the peaceful
enjoyment of his dinner to the uproar and horror of a siege from a dead
fowl to the turbaned turk and then by a similar vagary jumped at
once from the magnificent infidel to the poor morisco who had lately
trod the desert at his side as the image of abdoul al sidi entered his
brain he looked round and beheld the proselyte sitting with his boy in
the shadow of a palm remote from the rest and a pang smote him as he
perceived that among the scores who sat glutting their appetites
around not one had dropped a morsel of food into the hands of the
almogavar or his child

hark'ee lazaro thou gluttonous villain he cried with a voice that
instantly brought the follower staring to his side dost thou feed
like a pelican and yet refuse to share thy meal as a pelican would
with a helpless fellow of thy race take me this lump of a turk to sidi
abdalla and bid him feed his boy

i will suggest to your favour said the captain salvatierra with a
grin that lazaro be directed to bring the urchin hither with his
lute of which it is said he is no mean master and before he eats he
shall sing us a song which thus he will doubtless execute with more
perfection than after he has gorged himself into stupidity or the
asthma

i agree to that with all my heart said the neophyte the boy can
sing while we are eating provided the poor fellow be not too hungry

lazaro strode to the moriscos and in an instant as they rose amador
beheld the sidi take the instrument from his own back where he had
carried it and put it into the hands of his offspring the boy received
it and as amador thought removed the gay covering with a faltering
hand nevertheless in a few moments this preparation was accomplished
and with abdalla the stripling stood trembling from weariness or
timidity at the side of the group

moor said salvatierra before amador had commenced his benevolent
greeting the noble and valiant cavalier hath charitably commanded thou
shouldst eat thy dinner at our feet which whilst thou art doing we
will expect thy lad to entertain us with such sample of his skill in
luting and singing as may make our own repast more agreeable

that is if the boy be not too hungry said the good-natured neophyte
i should blush to owe my pleasures to any torments of his own however
slight and as i know by some little famine wherewith we were afflicted
at rhodes there is no more intolerable anguish with which one can be
cursed than this same unhumoured appetite

jacinto will sing to my lord said the almogavar submissively

but jacinto was seized with such a fit of trembling as seemed for a
time to leave him incapable and when at last he had sufficiently
subdued his terror to begin tuning his instrument he did it with so
slow and so hesitating a hand that salvatierra lost patience and
reproved him harshly and violently

it happened unluckily for the young moor that at that moment the eye
of amador wandered to fogoso and beheld him wallowing with more of the
spirit of a yeoman's hog than a warrior's charger in a certain miry
spot near to which he had been suffered to crop the green leaves he
called hastily and wrathfully to lazaro and in his indignation
entirely lost sight of his dinner his host and the musician

whelp of a heathen said salvatierra to the shrinking lad hast thou
no more skill or manners but to make this accursed jangling to which
there seems no end bestir thyself or i will teach thee activity

the boy frightened at the violence of the soldier rose to his feet
and dropping his instrument in alarm clung to abdalla the wrath of the
hot-tempered salvatierra exceeded the bounds of decorum and of humanity
he had a twig in his hand and with this he raised his arm to strike the
unfortunate urchin but just then the neophyte turned round and beheld
the act of tyranny

señor he cried with a voice even more harsh and angry than his own
and seizing the uplifted hand with no ceremonious grasp señor you
will not so far forget your manhood as to do violence to the child know
that i have taken him for this journey into my protection know also
thou canst not inflict a stripe upon his feeble body that will not
degrade thee into the baseness of a hind and that will not especially
draw upon thee the inconvenience of mine own displeasure

the heart of salvatierra sunk before the flaming countenance of the
cavalier but observing that several of his nearest followers had taken
note of the insult and were grasping their arms as if to avenge it he
said with an air of firmness

the señor de leste has twice or thrice taken occasion to requite my
courtesies with such shame as is hard to be borne and in particular by
interfering with the just exercise of my authority and i have to assure
him that when the duties of my office shall release me from restraint
his injuries shall not be unremembered

if thou art a hidalgo said the cavalier sternly thou hast the right
to command me if of ignoble blood as from thy deportment to this
trembling child i am constrained to believe i have nevertheless
eaten of thy bread and salt and cannot refuse to meet thee with such
weapons and in such way as thou mayest desire and to this obligation do
i hold myself bound and fettered

some half-dozen followers of the captain had crowded round their leader
and were lowering ominously and menacingly on the neophyte lazaro and
baltasar beheld the jeopardy of their master and silently but
resolutely placed themselves at his side nay even the youthful
fabueno though seemingly bewildered as if doubting on which side to
array himself had snatched up his bloodless sabre and it seemed for an
instant as if this unlucky rupture might end in blows the señor
salvatierra looked from his followers to the angry hidalgo the flush
faded from his cheek and it was remarked by some of his soldiers not a
little to his dispraise that when as if conquering his passion he
motioned them to retire it was with a hurried hand and tremulous lip

the señor de leste is right he said with a disturbed voice i
should have done myself dishonour to harm the boy and although the
reproof was none of the most gentle and honeyed i can still thank him
that it preserved me from the shame of giving too much rein to my
ill-temper i therefore forget the injury as one that was merited
discharge my anger as causeless and desiring rather to devote my blood
to the subjugation of pagans than to squander it in contest with a
fellow-christian offer the hand of reconciliation and of friendship to
don amador de leste

there was an appearance of magnanimity in this confession of fault and
offer of composition that won upon the good opinion of the neophyte
and he frankly gave his hand to the captain then turning to the
innocent cause of his trouble who during the time that there seemed
danger of a conflict had exhibited the greatest dismay he found him
sobbing bitterly in the arms of abdalla

poor child said the benevolent cavalier thou art fitter to touch
thy lute in the bower of a lady than to wake it among these wild and
troubled deserts it is enough abdalla conduct thy son to some shade
where he may eat and sleep and when we renew our march i will think of
some device to spare his tender feet the pain of trudging longer over
the sands

the moor laid his hand on his heart bowed with the deepest submission
and gratitude and led the boy away to a covert




chapter vii


didst thou observe brother henchman said lazaro as after having
completed his meal and taken good note of the tethers of the horses he
threw himself on the ground by the side of baltasar as if to imitate
the other members of the party who were making what preparations they
could for the indulgence of the siesta didst thou observe i say old
sinner that this moment we were like to have made experience of the
virtue of cotton corslets by my faith this gentle master mine will not
suffer our hands to be idle so long as there be savages to curse the
faith or hidalgos to cross his humours i am ever bound to the
magnanimous señor commander that he thought fit to swallow his wrath
and send me those black-browed vagabonds back to their dinner for
otherwise i assure thee there was much fear of our supping in
purgatory

for my part said baltasar raising his head from the saddle which
served him for a pillow and looking curiously round on the various
groups i am of opinion there was more discretion than dignity about
that same captain when he became so moderate of a sudden for so sure
as he was very foolish to get into a quarrel with the boy amador who i
am free to say is no way unworthy to be a kinsman and esquire of my
master the knight so surely would the boy have dinged the feathers off
his gilt casque with the first blow and how much of his head might have
followed the feathers is more than i will take upon me to determine

thou art so hungry after war said lazaro thou canst not perceive
the valour of foregoing an opportunity of battle now and then hast thou
never seen a man turn pale from anger as well as cowardice

of a truth i have said the veteran and provided there be a steady
countenance along with it this sickly hue is ever a sight to be dreaded
more than the woman's blush which some men fall into in their anger
but a coward's mouth is always playing him dog's tricks i have
sometimes seen the nether lip shake in a brave man but when the
trembling is all up in the corners as i have learned to know after
divers lessons it is a sign the heart is in a flutter there are
doubtless certain strings whereby the heart is fastened to the mouth
and it is when the corners are writhing about in this cowardly snaky
manner that the heart is drawn up further than is comfortable a thing
as i have no doubt may have sometimes happened to yourself

if it have may i become a turk's slave said lazaro with great
indignation and if it do i hope it may be transformed at that
moment from my own mouth to a dog's to be made a dinner of

thou art an ass to be in a passion at any rate said baltasar
coolly and a very improbable idiot to deny in thy vain-glory what
has happened to braver men than thyself and which i am free to
confess has sometimes chanced to myself especially in my youth when i
first went to fight the moors and i very well remember that besides
perceiving there was a sort of emptiness under my ribs on such
occasions i could feel my heart beating at the back of my throat as
plainly as i ever felt the arrow-heads tapping about my buckler but it
always went to its place again when we were come to close quarters

may i die of the bastinado if i ever felt any such thing said
lazaro proudly i was born without any such gaingiving and the only
uncomfortable feeling i have had under such circumstances was a sort
of cold creeping about the stomach as if it were raining inside of me

or as if there was a cold air brewing in your gizzard said baltasar
triumphantly that is the very same thing the emptiness i was
talking about and if you never felt the beating in your throat it was
because your heart was in such a fit of fright as to have no power of
beating left

ay that may be said lazaro with a grin that beating is a business
i keep for my arm and when that is in service my heart is ever wise
enough to be quiet but concerning the captain dost thou really esteem
him a coward

who knows said the veteran a man may be once in fear and
strong-hearted ever after yet was there such a working about that
cavalier's mouth as made me think he longed to strike don amador if he
durst and which still persuades he has some bitter thoughts about the
matter of the insult for as you may remember don amador said he was
more of a hind than a hidalgo with other such loving remarks as might
stir a man's choler for this reason i am of opinion it will be good
service of thee to thy master to keep thine eyes open while he is
taking his siesta lest mayhap some mischief might come to him
sleeping

i am ever bound to your good-natured discretion said lazaro with a
laugh i have no doubt it would be more profitable to sit for an hour
or two watching the sunbeams stealing through the wood than for the
same time to slumber and snore without any other amusement than an
occasional buffeting of one's nose to keep the flies off i will
therefore surrender this agreeable privilege to thyself as being my
senior and better while i nap a little and that so lightly that if an
emmet do but creep near my master i shall hear the rustling of his
footsteps but hark'ee baltasar there is much wit about thee for an
old man that has endured so many hard knocks and ever about once in an
hundred times i have found thy conjectures to be very reasonable what
is thy opinion concerning those infidel moors under the bush yonder and
by what sort of magic dost thou suppose they have so wrought upon our
commander that he will neither suffer lance-shaft nor cane-twig to be
laid upon them

ay there they are said baltasar looking towards the father and son
the boy lies with his head on abdalla's knee and abdalla covers him
with his skin mantle and the mantle shakes as if the boy were sobbing
under it it is my opinion the lad has been used to milder treatment
than he seems likely to meet in these parts unless don amador should
see fit to take him into his own keeping and it is also my opinion if
he be so much affected at the sight of a green twig he will go nigh to
die of terror at the flash of a savage's sword

that is an opinion i have in part formed for myself said the junior
coolly and one that i think is shared in common with every other
person in this quilted company that has looked in the manikin's face

it is as white said baltasar as that mountain top we saw from the
caravel whereas the children of common moriscos are much the hue of my
own weather-beaten boots

the boy was in a most pestilent fright said lazaro and therefore
somewhat more snowy than was natural nevertheless i have seen darker
skins among the damsels of la mancha

and he is in a manner well figured and comely said the veteran

if thou hadst said he was such a ganymede as might hold the wine-cup
and trencher to a princess i should have thought better of thine
eye-sight by cross and spear he has such eyes as i shall be glad to
find in any wench i may be predestined to marry

and his hand said baltasar is as small as a hidalgo's son's he
hath an amiable countenance and such gravity in it when not disturbed
as belongs to older years and he ever keeps it bent to the earth as if
to shun observation

ay i see what thou art driving at said lazaro significantly thou
thinkest sidi abdalla is some infidel prince of granada a zegri or
abencerrage 

i think no such thing said baltasar gruffly i have fought myself
hand to hand with a zegri while my young lord gabriel was cleaving the
head of another to which knightly and majestic infidels the wretch sidi
bears such resemblance as in comparison doth the hedge-hog to a
leopard

thou art of opinion then doubtless said lazaro that the boy
jacinto is some christian nobleman's son stolen in his infancy by sidi
to be made a sacrifice to the devil

i am no such ass said baltasar to entertain any such notion

a bird's flight by his feather a beast's rage by his claw and a man's
thoughts by his tongue said lazaro but how i am to judge thee is
more than i know what a-god's name dost thou think then of these
christian heathens

i think nothing at all said baltasar dryly i only wonder by what
chance a morisco boor came to have so tender and so handsome a boy

well heaven be with thee old oracle said lazaro laying his head on
his saddle if i should resolve thy wonder in my dreams i will
enlighten thee when i wake

the veteran gave a look to the horses to his master who by the
attentions of the captain salvatierra had been enabled to enjoy the
luxury of a hammock slung between two trees to the moor who sat
watching over his child to the tlamémé who slumbered by their
packs to the spaniards who slept as they had eaten in groups to
the few sentinels who stood nodding under the trees and then
dismissing all care as if satisfied with the security of the motley
encampment he was not slow to follow the example of his companion




chapter viii


two or three hours before sunset the sleepers were roused to renew
their march horses were saddled and armour buckled and don amador de
leste mounted his steed with great satisfaction at the thought of still
further diminishing the distance that separated him from his knight as
the train began to ford the rivulet he turned round and beckoned to
abdoul who with jacinto had taken the station assigned them behind
the musketeers

sidi abdalla said he i have thought it a great shame that thy weary
boy should trudge over these sands afoot when such men as myself and my
people are resting our lazy limbs on horseback i have therefore given
order to my soldier lazaro to take the youth behind him whereby much
discomfort and suffering may be avoided

my lord will scorn the thanks of the poor morisco said abdoul
humbly sleep and the food which it pleased my noble lord to give to
the boy have so refreshed his strength and his spirits that now in
the pleasant evening air he will journey without pain as he has often
of yore in the deserts of barbary and let not my lord be displeased to
know that jacinto will be of better heart at the side of his father
than on the saddle of my lord's servant

if it be as thou sayest said the cavalier i am content heaven
forbid i should take him from thee but for his good which doubtless
thou must know better how to compass than myself yet if he should at
any time grow weary make me acquainted with it and lazaro shall be
still prepared to give him relief

the moor bent his head to the ground and fell back while amador
followed by his attendants and the secretary rode to the head of the
train

no occurrence of moment interrupted the monotony of the journey until a
thunderstorm accompanied by rain drove them for shelter into a
forest where their march was interrupted for a time but with a
capriciousness equal to the fury with which they had gathered the
clouds parted and vanished in the sunbeams the earth was gladdened the
trees shook the liquid treasure from their leaves a breeze came from
the distant surges and resuming their path the train and cavalcade
went on their way rejoicing

as they advanced and as the day declined the country assumed a more
agreeable aspect the woods were thicker and more luxuriant the
mountains approached nearer to the sea and the streams gambolled among
piles of rocks instead of creeping sluggishly through the sands the
flowers were more abundant and the birds resuming their songs
prepared their vespers for the sinking luminary at last he set the
curlew wheeled his last flight the plover sent his last whistle from
the air and the stars stealing out from the dusky arch shed their
celestial lustre over the path of the travellers with these lamps of
heaven were also lit the torches of the cucujos those phosphorescent
beetles with which don amador had been made acquainted in the islands
but he did not the less admire the splendour of the spectacle when he
saw these resplendent insects glistening among the trees or flashing by
him like little meteors the moon rose from the sea and as her mellow
radiance streamed over the tree tops or sheeted itself on the sands
and as a thousand delicious scents came to the nostrils of the soldier
he thought he had never before not even when watching the same planet
in the calm bosom of the levantine sea looked upon a scene of more
beautiful repose the commander of the squadron had not since the
affair of the dinner thought fit frequently to trouble don amador
with his presence but by the murmurs of satisfaction and curiosity
which were breathed about him the cavalier knew he was approaching the
indian city zempoala the party issued from the wood upon what seemed a
fair waving plain dotted in certain places with clumps of trees and
doubtless in other spots enriched with plantations of maize and
bananas in the distance from a dark and shadowy mass which might have
been a lofty grove or a low hillock and whose gloom was alike broken by
the glare of insects and the flash of many flambeaux arose three lofty
towers square and white and glittering in the moonbeams as if covered
over with plates of silver

zempoala whispered an hundred voices as these gleaming fabrics came
fairly into view the languid horseman raised himself on his saddle the
foot-soldier strode onwards with a firmer and quicker step and at each
moment as the three towers reflected the moonbeams with increasing
brilliancy more torches flickered and more structures were seen shining
among the trees and it was evident to don amador that he was
approaching a city or town of no little magnitude

the secretary had pressed to his side and overhearing his exclamations
of surprise took the liberty of addressing him

señor he cried they say this pagan city is bigger and lovelier than
seville i have often before heard of the silver towers for truly when
the men of cortes first saw them they thought they were built of blocks
of plate and rode forward to hack away some samples with their swords
whereupon to their great shame and disappointment they discovered the
brilliance to be owing to a certain white and polished plaster with
which these barbarians have the art to beautify their temples

are these then the sanctuaries of the fiend said the neophyte
raising himself and surveying the structures with a frown of infinite
hostility it drives me to little esteem to know that the señor
narvaez and his companions should rest in sight of these accursed
places without hurling them to the dust

they are no longer the houses of devils said lorenzo cortes the
great rebel tore the idols from their altars and putting an image of
our blessed lady in their place consecrated them forthwith to the
service of god

i hear nothing of cortes that does not convince me he is a truly noble
and faithful cavalier said amador with emphasis

there can be no doubt of that said the secretary nevertheless if i
may presume to advise your favour i would beseech you not to mention
the name of cortes among these men of narvaez or at least not with the
respect which you may think his due

dost thou know said amador addressing fabueno so sternly as to
cause him instantly to repent his presumption dost thou know that
what thou art saying is of so base and boorish a spirit that if it be
the true prompting of thy heart thou art utterly unworthy to take upon
thee the arms as thou art wholly incapable of winning the fame of a
soldier know thou for it is good thou shouldst be told that all
hypocrisy is the offspring of cowardice and is therefore impossible to
be practised by a brave man know also that when thou art deceiving
man thou art lying to god which is an impiety not to be thought of by
an honest man and know in conclusion that when thou art called upon
for thy opinion if thou givest not that which is in thy heart thou art
guilty of that hypocrisy which is cowardice and that deceit which is
perjury

i beg your worship's pardon said lorenzo abashed and confounded and
somewhat bewildered by the chivalrous and fantastic system of honour
disclosed in the reproof of the cavalier i meant only to let your
favour know that there could be no travelling beyond this indian city
without the good will of narvaez and his officers which might not be
gained by commending their enemy and moreover señor if you will
suffer me to justify myself while i confess it would be both cowardly
and impious as your worship says to conceal or alter a sentiment when
it is called for yet was i thinking it could be in no wise
dishonourable to retain in our own mind opinions not called for
particularly when they might be disagreeable to those upon whom they
were thus as i may say forced

by my faith thou art in a measure very right said amador and i
hereby recall any expressions which may have reflected on thy courage or
thy religion for i perceive thou wert only touching upon the
obligation all men are under not to force their opinions upon others an
obligation of which i am myself so sensible that provided i am not
called upon by the questions of these people or the enforcements of
mine own honour i shall surely utter nothing to displease them but
canst thou tell me señor secretario how far from this town lies the
commander of whom we were speaking

i have heard only at the distance of two or three leagues replied
fabueno but i should think considering the wisdom of cortes he would
be fain to increase that distance as soon as he came to know the
strength of narvaez your favour may see by the many torches glimmering
through the streets and the many voices that go chanting up and down
that there is a goodly multitude with him

i see by the same tokens said amador he has a set of riotous
disorderly vagabonds who seem to think they are keeping carnival in
christendom rather than defending a camp among infidels and by st
john i know not any very good reason why the valiant cortes might not
this instant with his knot of brave men steal upon the town and
snatch it out of the hands of the biscayan there is neither out-post
in the field nor sentinel in the suburbs

there seemed some grounds for this notion of the cavalier as he
approached nearer to zempoala there was audible a concert of sounds
such as one would not have looked for in the camp of a good general a
great fire had been lit as it appeared among the silver towers the
ruddy reflection of which mingled with the purer light of the moon
had given them so shining an appearance even at a distance in this
neighbourhood as amador judged by the direction and variety of cries
was the chief place of the revellers though in divers quarters of the
town might be heard the voices and sometimes the musical instruments
of idle soldiers struggling in rivalry with the ruder songs and harsher
instruments of the natives besides the bonfires among the temples
there was another in the quarter of the town which the train was just
entering and apparently upon the very street which they were to pass
the cavalier had however underrated the vigilance of the sentinels
for just as he had concluded his denunciation the trumpet with which
salvatierra announced his approach to his companions was answered by a
flourish from the fire and there was straightway seen a group of armed
men advancing to challenge the party in fact an out-post was stationed
at the fire the worthy warriors of which in the absence of any
important duties had got together the means of amusement in the persons
of certain indian tumblers and merry-andrews who were diverting them
with feats of agility besides these tawny sons of joyance there were
others of the same race whose business it was to add to the pleasures
of the entertainment the din of the musical instruments common to
barbarians only as it seemed to amador that if there was nothing
superior in the tone or management of these which he now heard they had
an advantage over those of the islanders in being wrought with greater
skill and ornamented with a more refined taste thus of the little
drums which were suspended to the necks of the musicians and which were
at least equal in sound to the labours of europe some were carved and
painted in a very gay manner while the flutes of cane though not less
monotonous than the pipes of other savages had about them an air of
elegance from being furnished with pendants of rich flowers or
beautiful feathers

as amador rode by his attention was in a measure diverted from the
tumblers by the agitation of fogoso who regarded neither the great fire
nor the wild looking artists with friendship and when having subdued
his alarm he turned to gratify his wonder his eye was caught by the
appearance of the moor who had stolen to his side and now stood with a
countenance even more disturbed than when shrinking from the blow of
salvatierra and with hands upraised and clasped as if to beseech his
notice

my lord is benevolent to the friendless and pitiful to the orphan he
cried anxiously as soon as he perceived that amador regarded him he
has been the champion of the father and the protector of the son and
when the heart's blood of abdoul can requite his benefactor abdoul will
not deny it

good sidi said amador that i have protected both yourself and your
son jacinto from unjust violence is more than can be denied but why
it is needful to thank me so many times for the favour is more than i
can easily understand i must therefore command you to find some more
novel subject for conversation

my lord is a knight of rhodes said abdalla quickly and therefore by
vow bound to charity justice pity and all the other good virtues
acknowledged as well by infidels as christians

i am no knight a novice of the order i may be called said amador
but no knight though he added with a most dolorous sigh how soon i
may take the vows after returning from the lands of mexico is more than
i can pronounce i have therefore not bound myself by oath to any of
those virtues of which you spoke but had you been born of a nobler
blood than i can account that of the lord of fez you should have known
that being a gentleman and a christian i cannot release myself from
any of their natural obligations

for myself said abdalla though insult and danger will come to me
among these riotous soldiers who are the enemies of my race and these
barbarians who are surely the enemies of all i can submit to my
griefs but jacinto needs the arm of power to protect him if my lord
will take him to be his servant he will be merciful to misfortune the
prayers of gratitude will ascend to heaven and the love of a faithful
boy will watch ever at his side like the vigilance of an armed
follower

art thou content the boy should be parted from thee demanded amador
i know not how among these strange lands and unknown wildernesses i
may be able to take that care of his tender years which should be the
duty of a good master nor to tell thee the truth do i know in what
manner i can make use of his services  

let not my lord despise his skill said the almogavar because his
fright and weariness palsied his hand when he should have played before
him he hath good skill with the lute and he has in his memory a
thousand redondillas with which he may divert the leisure of my lord
besides this skill he hath a fidelity which nothing can corrupt and a
loving heart which once gained by kindness no temptation can lure from
his master and in these qualities will i vouch for him with my head i
know not in truth continued abdalla faltering since he has never
before served a master if he have any other qualifications but he is
quick to acquire and perhaps perhaps he may soon learn to preserve
the armour of my lord yes he will soon make himself useful to my
lord

the cleaning of my armour said amador in a very matter-of-fact
manner is a duty which belongs particularly to lazaro whose fidelity
as well as that of baltasar is of so unquestionable a character that
it fully meets all the exigencies of my course of life i would
therefore receive thy son chiefly out of a hope to be comforted at
times with his music and partly out of pity for his forlornness he
will doubtless serve me as a page and cup-bearer in which capacity
promising to give him as much protection and kindness as may be in my
power i consent to receive him

and my lord will permit that i shall often see him said abdoul
eagerly

surely i must desire thou shouldst said amador if it were possible
thou couldst be in the same army

abdalla looked at the cavalier with a bewildered and confused
countenance as if not understanding him

i must acquaint thee good sidi said amador with one fact of which
thou seemest ignorant and which may wholly change thy desires in this
matter thy destination is to this town of zempoala and mine to the
very far city tenochtitlan thy fate is to submit thee into the hands of
the general narvaez as thou hast heard to serve him as a cannonier
while mine is to betake myself to the general cortes his sworn and most
indomitable enemy thou mayest therefore inquire of thyself if thy boy
go with me whether thou wilt ever again look upon him a question that
i cannot myself answer in a satisfactory manner make thy election
therefore whether thou wilt keep him at thy side or entrust him to my
guardianship being assured that if the latter be thy desire i will
bid thee call him and straightway take him into my keeping

it cannot be said abdalla vehemently i cannot trust him from my
sight it cannot be god is just and justice may come with misery

thus lamenting abdoul al sidi retired from the side of the cavalier
and amador whose pity was not a little touched suffered his image to
be crowded from his mind by the new and strange spectacles which were
now opening upon him




chapter ix


while he still talked with the morisco don amador was able to cast his
eyes about him and to perceive on either side a great multitude of low
houses of wickered cane which seemed to him more to resemble gigantic
baskets than the habitations of men but which even in these latter
days are found sufficient to protect the humble aborigines from the
vicissitudes of that benignant clime each stood by itself in an
enclosure of shrubs and flowers and where it happened that the inmates
were within with torches or fires burning the blaze streaming through
the wattled walls illuminated every thing around and disclosed the
figures of the habitants moving about like shadows in the flame other
buildings equally humble in size were constructed of less remarkable
but not less romantic materials and where the moonbeams fell over their
earthen walls and palmy roofs both were often concealed by such a
drapery of vines and creeping flowers perhaps the odoriferous vanilla
and the beautiful convolvulus as might have satisfied the longings of a
wood-nymph as he approached nearer to the centre of the town these
lowly and lovely cottages were exchanged for fabrics of stone many of
them of considerable size and several with walls covered with the
bright and silvery plaster which ornamented the temples each of these
the dwellings of the tlatoani or as the spaniards called them in
the language of santo domingo the caciques of the city stood alone
in its garden of flowers with vines trailing and palm-trees bending
over its roof commonly in darkness though sometimes the myrtle-taper
of a fair totonac for such was the name of this provincial people of
the coast or the oily cresset of a spanish captain who had made his
quarters wherever was a house to his fancy might be seen gleaming from
behind the curtains of cotton stuff which were hung at the doors and
windows these sights had been seen by amador while yet engaged in
conversation with abdalla but when the morisco dropped sorrowfully
away he found himself on the great square of the city immediately
fronting the sanctuaries and gazing upon a scene of peculiarly wild and
novel character the centre of the square was occupied by a broad and
indeed a vast platform of earth raised to a height of eight or ten
feet ascended from all sides by half as many steps having the
appearance of a low truncated pyramid serving as a base to the three
towers which crowned it upon its summit or terrace immediately in
advance of the towers was kindled a great fire the blaze of which
besides illuminating the temple itself and all the buildings which
surrounded the square fell upon sundry groups of indian tumblers
engaged in feats of activity as well as upon a host of cavaliers who
surveyed them close at hand and many throngs of common soldiers and
natives who looked on at a distance from the square

here the detachment was halted the burthens of the tlamémé were
deposited on the earth the horses were freed from their packs and
amador at the suggestion of salvatierra dismounted and leaving fogoso
to the care of his attendants and these again to the disposition of the
captain ascended the pyramid followed by the secretary he was
somewhat surprised when this worthy commander whom he looked for to
conduct him to the general resuming much of the stately dignity he had
found it inconvenient to support on the march made him a low bow and
informed him with much gravity he would find the commander-in-chief
either on the terrace among his officers or at his head-quarters in the
middle tower the feeling of indignation which for a moment beset him
would have been expressed had not salvatierra with another bow retired
and had he not perceived at the same moment the young fabueno draw
from his girdle the letter which was doubtless to secure him the
good-will of narvaez checking therefore his anger he straightway
ascended the platform arrived at its summit he now beheld the scene
which he had imperfectly witnessed from below the great fire crackling
and roaring added the ruddy glare of a volcano to the pallid
illumination of the moon and in the combined light the operations of
the gymnasts and dancers the athletes and jugglers were as visible as
if performed in the glitter of noon-day for a moment amador thought as
had been thought by all other spaniards when looking for the first time
on the sports of these barbarous races that he had got among a group of
devils or at least of devilish magicians and he crossed himself with
an instinctive horror when he beheld so to speak three piles of men
each composed of three individuals half-naked standing one upon the
head or shoulders of another whirling about in a circle and each as
he whirled dancing on the head or shoulders of his supporter and
tossing abroad his penacho or long plume of feathers as if diverting
himself on the solid earth this spectacle entirely distracted his
attention from others scarcely less worthy of observation as was
indeed that where two men see-sawed on a pole in the air and as
might be said without support except that which was occasionally
rendered by the feet of a sinewy pagan who lay on his back and ever
and anon as the flying phantoms descended spurned them again into the
air such also was that magical dance of the cords brought from the
unknown tribes of the south wherein a score of men each holding to a
rope of some brilliant colour and each decorated with the feathers of
the parrot and the flamingo whirled in fleet gyrations round a
garlanded post till their cords were twisted together in a net of
incomprehensible complexity but which before the observer had leisure
to digest his amazement were again unravelled in the rapid and
mysterious evolutions of the dance a thousand other such exhibitions
similar in novelty but different in character were displayed at the
same moment but the eyes of the neophyte were lost to all but that
which had first astounded him and it was not till the voice of the
secretary roused him from his bewitchment that he collected his senses
and observed an officer of the household of the general standing before
him and doing him such reverence as was evidently the right of his
dignity it was then that don amador looked from the dancers to the
cavaliers whom they were diverting the fire flashed over the walls of
the square and lofty towers up to the shelving thatch of palm-leaves
under which they were grouped making with the glitter of their
half-armed persons a suitable addition to the romance of the scene in
the centre of that group which lounged before the middle and loftiest
tower in a chair or indeed as it might be called a throne of such
barbaric beauty as was known only to the magnificos of this singular
people sat a cavalier tall and somewhat majestic of stature with a
ruddy beard and yellow locks falling over an agreeable countenance in
whom not so much from the character of his deportment and the quality
of his decorations as from the evident homage rendered him by the
officers around don amador did not doubt he beheld the biscayan
general at the very moment when his eyes fell upon this smiling
dignitary he was himself perceived by the general and narvaez started
up with a sort of confusion as if ashamed to be discovered in such
trivial enjoyment by so gallant a cavalier in fact the glittering
casque of steel had supplanted the velvet cap on the head of the novice
and as he approached in full armour clad also in the dignity with which
he was wont to approach his fellows in rank don amador presented a
figure to say the least equally noble with that of the
commander and what was no slight advantage in those days with the
additional manifestation of high blood such as was certainly less
questionable in him than in narvaez it seemed for a moment as if the
general would have retreated into the temple doubtless with the view of
assuming a more stately character for the interview but perceiving that
don amador had already recognised him and was advancing he changed his
purpose and making a step forward to do honour to his visiter he stood
still to receive him the eyes of all those gallant adventurers were
turned from the dancers to the new-comer but don amador not much moved
by such a circumstance as indifferent to their curiosity as their
admiration approached with a stately gravity and making a courteous
reverence to the general said 

i have no doubt it is my felicity at this present moment to offer my
devoirs to the noble and very respected señor the general don panfilo
de narvaez on the presumption of which i amador de leste of cuenza
a novice of the holy hospital of st john of jerusalem do not hesitate
to claim the hospitalities which as an hidalgo of spain and kinsman
of the noble señor the admiral cavallero your excellency's
confederate i hold myself entitled to expect

the very noble and valiant señor don amador de leste shall not claim
those hospitalities in vain said the general with a voice whose
natural and voluminous harshness did not conceal an attempt at amenity
and i hope he will not anticipate in them too little of the roughness
of a soldier by reason that he has seen us unbending a little from the
toils of war to the foolish diversions of these ingenious barbarians

i will not take upon me to judge either of the tactics or the
recreations of your excellency said amador very coolly i will only
demand of your favour to accept at this present moment such
protestations of respect as become me in my function of suitor and in
especial to accredit my companion the secretary fabueno the messenger
of the admiral who is charged with certain letters to your excellency
of which i believe i am myself in part the subject

i receive them with respect and i welcome the very distinguished don
amador with much joy said narvaez in token of which i must beg him
to allow himself to be considered at least so long as he honours my
command with his presence as my own peculiar guest and that i may the
sooner know in what it may be my happiness to do him service i must
entreat him to enter with me into my poor quarters

with such superb expressions of etiquette the common compliments of an
over-chivalrous age and people don amador was ushered into the interior
of the temple a curtain of a certain strong and checkered matting that
served the purpose of a door was pushed aside and entering with the
general and two or three of his most favoured officers he found himself
in the heathen sanctuary a table covered with brilliant drapery of
cotton a product of the country and strewed over with pieces of
armour as well as with divers vessels wherein glowed some of the rich
wines ripened by the breath of the solano contained also a great silver
cresset filled with oil tempered with liquidambar which besides
pervading the whole atmosphere with a delicious odour shed abroad such
a light as enabled don amador to survey the apartment it was of good
height and spacious the walls were hung with arras of a sombre-hued
cotton and the floor covered with thick matting in one corner was a
ladder leading to the upper chambers two sides of it were occupied by
a low platform on which lay several mattresses stuffed with the down of
the ceiba over one of which on a small altar of wood illuminated by
tapers of the myrtle wax was a little image of the virgin in this
chamber the chief adoratory of the temple where now flashed the
weapons of the iconoclasts stood once the altar of an idol whose
fiendish lips had been often died with the blood of human sacrifices
there were rude chairs about the table and amador at the invitation of
the general did not hesitate to seat himself and cast an eye of
observation on his companions while narvaez with the assistance of the
secretary proceeded to decipher the advices of the admiral

the individuals with whom amador found himself in contact were of a
genteel and manly presence and though evidently burning with desire to
make the acquaintance of the novice of rhodes and certainly also with
curiosity to know what strange event had cast him among themselves had
yet sufficient breeding to conceal their anxieties excepting one who
although of riper years than the rest and even of more gravity of
deportment was nevertheless twice or thrice guilty of a very
inquisitive stare this don amador did himself at last perceive and
felt greatly moved to discover the cause of so remarkable a scrutiny
nevertheless before he had resolved in what manner to commence the
investigation and before the general had well looked into the advices
of the admiral they were both interrupted in their purpose by the
abrupt intrusion of an officer who approaching narvaez said something
to him in a low voice of which all that amador could distinguish were
the words twice or thrice repeated of nigromante and astrologo
the officer received a direction equally obscure with his information
and amador observed that as narvaez gave it his face flushed over with
some sudden excitement the speculations of the neophyte were soon
terminated before the curtain had yet closed upon the retreating
officer the cavalier whose curious looks had attracted his own
attention rose and addressed the general

señor general and governor he cried i doubt whether this knavish
impostor be worthy your attention he is accounted both a liar and
traitor and he can tell us nothing that will not be spoken to deceive
us

the señor don andres de duero cannot be better persuaded of the man's
character than myself said the general and he will not assure me
that a good general can refuse to listen to any intelligence of his
enemy though it be brought by a traitor the noble don amador de leste
will pardon me if i make so free with him as in his presence to
introduce and examine a prisoner or deserter i know not which on
matters which it concerns me as a commander to know and moreover
continued the biscayan with a laugh i know not what better diversion
i can give my guest than to make him acquainted with a man who pretends
to read the mysteries of the stars by night and to have a devil who
gives him knowledge of men's destinies by daylight

before amador could reply to this appeal the señor duero spoke again

surely he can bring us no information of cortes which we have not
received at better hands and as for his magical art i think your
excellency holds that in too much doubt and contempt to set much store
by its crazy revelations

what may be my doubt and what my contempt for his art said the
general is more than i have yet resolved only there is one thing of
which i am quite certain and that is that with the blessing of our
holy and immaculate lady i defy the devil and all his imps whether
they come at the bidding of a heathenish magician or a christian
enchanter and moreover that if there be any knowledge to be gained of
the devil without jeopardy of soul one is a fool not to receive it
señor continued narvaez addressing himself again to amador i may as
well tell you that the magician botello whom you will presently
behold is a favourite soldier and chief enchanter to that infidel
rebel cortes whom god confound with all his mutinous friends and
upholders high and low strong and feeble amen i say señor his
chief magician continued the general speaking so rapidly and
impetuously as utterly to prevent don amador from making the amendment
he meditated to the curse and insisting that narvaez should revoke it
as far at least as it concerned his kinsman the knight his chief
magician by whose aid it is supposed the runagate desperado has been
enabled to imprison the indian emperor and knave or not don amador it
cannot be denied that when struck down after surrendering himself
this morning by the currish soldier caboban he cursed the smiter with
a short life and a long death which curse was fulfilled upon him on
the instant for striking botello with his spear again his horse
plunged threw him violently and falling he was instantly spitted on
the spear of a footman he has been dying ever since and sometime
doubtless his agony will be over but he is as good as a dead man now

i am by no means certain said don amador that there was any
connexion between the curse of the magician and the calamity of the
soldier though as it appears to me heaven could not visit with
judgment any one more righteously than the dastard who strikes an enemy
after he has rendered himself a captive nevertheless and though i am
somewhat impatient your excellency should determine upon my own affairs
i have such respect for the superior claims of your duties that i will
willingly defer my anxiety until your excellency has examined the
prisoner

there were several very meaning glances exchanged among the cavaliers at
this speech which seemed to imply a feeling of neglect and resentment
on the part of the speaker but narvaez did not notice it or if he did
the impression was immediately driven from his mind by the entrance of
the enchanter conducted by several soldiers and officers among whom
was the captain salvatierra




chapter x


amador surveyed the prisoner though somewhat indifferently he was in
figure and age very much such a man as baltasar but in other respects
very dissimilar his face was wan and even cadaverous but this might
have been the effect of the blows he had received from the dying
soldier as was made probable by the presence of several spots of blood
encrusted over his visage his cheeks were broad and the bones
prominent his eyes very hollow and expressive of a wild solemnity
mingled with cunning his beard long and bushy and only slightly
grizzled and a rugged mustache hung over his lips so as almost to
conceal them his apparel was of black cloth none of the freshest the
principal garment of which was a long loose doublet under which was
buckled an iron breast-plate his only armour for instead of a
morion he wore a cloth hat of capacious brim stuck round with the
feathers of divers birds as well as several medals of the saints
rudely executed in silver besides these fantastic decorations he had
suspended to his neck several instruments of the cabala a pentacle of
silver and charms and talismans written over with mystical characters
as well as a little leathern pouch filled with various dried herbs and
roots this mystagogue an agent of no little importance among many of
the scenes of the conquest was led into the presence of the general
and approached him without betraying any signs of fear or embarrassment
nor on the other hand did he manifest any thing like audacity or
presumption but lifting his eyes to the visage of the biscayan he
gazed upon him with a silent and grave earnestness that seemed somewhat
to disconcert the leader

sirrah sorcerer said he since the devil has deserted you at last
call up what spirits you can muster and find me why i shall not hang
you for a spy early in the morning

tetragrammaton adonai muttered the warrior-magician in the holy
gibberish of his art with a voice of sepulchral hollowness and with a
countenance gleaming with indignation or enthusiasm in the name of
god amen i defy the devil and am the servant of his enemy and in the
land of devils of apollyon in the air beelzebub on the earth and
satan in men's hearts i forswear and defy contemn and denounce them
and i pray for and foresee the day when they shall tumble from the
high places

all this thou mayst do and all this thou mayst foresee said the
general but nevertheless thy wisdom will be more apparent to employ
itself a little in the investigation of thine own fate which i promise
thee is approaching to a crisis

i have read it in the stars i have seen it in the smoke of waters and
of blessed herbs and i have heard it from the lips of dead men and the
tongues of dreams cried the professor of the occult sciences with
much emphasis but what is the fate of botello the swordsman to that
of the leaders of men the conquerors of kings and great nations i have
read my own destinies but why shouldst thou trifle the time to know
them when i can show thee the higher mysteries of thine own

canst thou do so by my faith then i will have thee speak them very
soon said narvaez but first let me know what wert thou doing when
thou wert found prowling this morning so near to my camp

gathering the herbs for the suffumigation which shall tell me in what
part of the world thou shalt lay thy bones said the magician
solemnly the moon in the house alchil showed me many things but not
all a thick smoke came over the crystal and i saw not what i wanted i
slept under the cross with a skull on my bosom but it breathed nothing
but clouds wherefore i knew it should be only when the wolf spoke to
the vulture and the vulture to the red star that camael the angel
should unlock the lips of destiny and lead me whither i longed to
follow

i am ever bound to thee said the general with a manner in which an
attempt at mockery was mingled with a natural touch of superstition
for the extreme interest thou seemest to cherish in my fate and again i
say to thee i will immediately converse with thee on that subject but
at present señor nigromante i warn thee it will be but wisdom to
confine thy rhapsodies within the limits of answers to such
interrogatories as i shall propose thee where lies thy master the
outcast and arch-rebel my enemy

my master is in heaven said botello with a devout and lofty
earnestness and there is no outcast and rebel but he that dwelleth in
the pit under the foot of michael and he is the enemy

sirrah i speak to thee of the knave cortes cried the general
angrily when wert thou last at his side and where

at midnight on the river of canoes where he has rested as thou
knowest for a night and a day

ay said the biscayan fiercely within a league of my head-quarters
whither my clemency has suffered him to come

whither god and his good star have drawn him said the magician

and whence i will drive him to the rocks of the mountains or the
mangroves of the beach ere thou art cured of thy wounds

lo my wounds are healed said botello the hand that inflicted them
is stiff and cold and hernan cortes yet lies by the river ay the holy
unguent blessed of the fat of a pagan's heart hath dried the blood and
glued the skin and yet my captain whose fate i have seen and spoken
even from the glory of noon to the long and sorrowful shadows of the
evening marshals his band within the sound of thy matin bell and wo
be to his foeman when he is nearer or further

prattling fool said the commander if thou hadst looked to the
bright moon to-night thou wouldst have seen how soon the cotton-trees
of the river should be strung with thy leader and companions and with
thyself as a liar and an impostor in their midst

i looked said the veteran tranquilly and saw what will be seen
but not by all there was thunder in the temple and peace by the
river and more wailing than comes from the lips of the penitent
knight

the angry impetuosity with which narvaez was about to continue the
conference was interrupted by the impatience of the novice he had
listened with much disgust both to the mystic jargon of the soldier and
the idle demands and bravadoes of the general the interest with which
he discovered how short a distance separated him from his kinsman was
increased to an irresistible excitement when he heard the title with
which as the admiral had told him the knight was distinguished among
the invaders on the lips of botello rising therefore abruptly he
said

señor narvaez i have to beg your pardon if in my own impatience to
be satisfied in a matter which i have much at heart i am somewhat blind
to the importance of this present controversy if your excellency will
do me the favour to examine the letters of the admiral you will
discover that it is not so much my purpose to lay claim to your
hospitable entertainment the proffer of which i acknowledge with much
gratitude as to request your permission to pass through the lines of
your army to join my kinsman the knight calavar understanding
therefore from the words of this lunatic or enchanter whichever he
may be that i am within the short distance of a league from my good
knight to whom all my allegiance is due i see not wherefore i should
not proceed to join him forthwith instead of wasting the night in
slumber i must therefore crave of your excellency to grant me to the
camp of the señor cortes a guide to whom i will with my life and
honour guarantee a safe return or such instructions concerning my
route as will enable me to proceed alone that is to say with my
attendants

the effect of this interruption and unexpected demand on the
countenances of all was remarkable enough the cavaliers present stared
at the novice with amazement and even a sort of dismay and the
secretary fabueno looking by chance at the captain salvatierra
observed the visage of this worthy suddenly illuminated by a grin of
delight as for the general himself nothing could be more unfeigned
than his surprise nothing more unquestionable than the displeasure
which instantly began to darken his visage he rose thrust his hand
into his belt as if to give his fingers something to gripe and drawing
himself to his full height said haughtily and severely

when i invited the cavalier de leste to share the shelter of this
temple i did not think i received a friend of the traitor cortes or of
any of his people nor did i dream an adherent of this outlaw would dare
to beard me at my head-quarters with so rash and audacious a request

the señor narvaez has then to learn said amador with a degree of
moderation that could only be produced by a remembrance of his
engagement to the admiral and his promise to the secretary not
causelessly to provoke the anger of the general but nevertheless with
unchanging decision that if i boast not to be the friend of cortes
whom you call a traitor i avouch myself to be very much the creature of
mine own will and that if i cannot be termed the adherent of an outlaw
i am at least a spanish hidalgo bent on the prosecution of my designs
and making requests more as the ceremonies of courtesy than the tribute
of humility i will claim nothing more of your excellency than your
excellency is without claim inclined to grant and allowing therefore
that you invited me to your lodgings under a mistaken apprehension of my
character i will straightway release you from the obligation only
previously desiring of your excellency to reconsider your expressions
wherein as i think was an innuendo highly unjust and offensive

now by heaven exclaimed the biscayan with all the irascibility of
his race and the arrogant pride of his station i have happened upon a
strange day when a vagabond esquire wandering through my jurisdiction
asks my permission to throw himself into the arms of my enemy and when
i admonish him a little of his rashness rebukes me with insult and
defiance

a very strange day indeed muttered a voice among the cavaliers in
which amador had he not been too much occupied with other
considerations might have recognized the tones of salvatierra

biscayan said he with an eye of fire i have given you all the
respect which as a governor's governor and a captain's captain you
had a right to demand i have also done you the homage of a guest to his
host and of a gentleman to a reputed hidalgo but neither as a governor
nor commander neither as a host nor a nobleman have you the privilege
to offend with impunity or to insult without being called to a
reckoning

is this another madman of the stock of calavar that the silly admiral
hath sent me cried the enfuriated leader snatching up a sword from
the table and advancing upon the novice

señor panfilo cried amador confronting the general and waving his
hand with dignity unless thou force me by thine own violence i cannot
draw my sword upon thee on thine own floor not even although thou add
to thy wrongs a sarcasm on my knight and kinsman nevertheless i fling
this glove at thy feet in token that if thou art as valiant as thou art
ill-bred as ready to repair as to inflict an injury i will claim of
thee as soon as may suit thy convenience to meet me with weapons and
to answer thy manifold indignities

dios santísimo cried the commander foaming with rage and stamping
furiously on the floor what ho swords and pikemen shall i strike
this galofero braggart with my own hands arrest him

the blood of him that stays me be on his own head said amador
drawing his sword and striding to the entrance i will remember thee
uncourteous cavalier when i see thee in a fitter place

the arm of the governor had been arrested by duero and in the confusion
of the moment though the door of the tower was instantly beset by a
dozen gaping attendants don amador would doubtless have passed through
them without detention notwithstanding the furious commands of narvaez
but at the moment when as he waved his sword menacingly the
hesitating satellites seemed parting before him salvatierra stepped
nimbly behind and suddenly seizing his outstretched arm and calling to
the guards at the same time in an instant don amador was disarmed and a
prisoner his rage was for a moment unspeakable but it did not render
him incapable of observing the faithful boldness of the secretary

señor general cried lorenzo though with a stammering voice if your
excellency will read this letter to the end your excellency will find
my master recommends don amador as of a most noble and lofty family
and at this moment raised above arrest and detention by being charged
with authority from the grand master of rhodes

the only answer of the general was a scowl and a wave of the hand which
instantly left fabueno in the predicament of the cavalier he was
seized and before he could follow the example of his patron and draw
his sabre it was snatched from his inexperienced hand

all this passed in a moment and before the neophyte could give
utterance to the indignation which choked him he was dragged with
fabueno from the sanctuary




chapter xi


the dancers had fled from the terrace the fire had smouldered away but
in the light of the moon which shed a far lovelier radiance don
amador as he was hurried to the steps saw in place of the gay
cavaliers a few sentries striding in front of the towers and among the
artillery which frowned on either edge of the platform nevertheless if
his rage had left him inquisitive he was not allowed time to indulge
his observations he was hurried down the steps carried a few paces
further and instantly immured in the stone dwelling of some native
chief which by the substitution of a door of plank for the cotton
curtain and other simple contrivances had been easily converted into a
prison

in the meanwhile the rage of the governor burned with a fury that was
not much lessened by the remonstrances of his officers and to the
counsel of duero the personal secretary of don diego velasquez
accompanying the expedition less as an adviser than as a spy over the
general and therefore necessarily held in some respect he answered
only with heat and sarcasm

i have ever found the señor don andres he cried without regarding
the presence of botello to be more friendly with the friends of cortes
than may seem fitting in the honourable and confidential secretary of
velasquez

i will not deny that such is my temper said duero nor will i
conceal from you that such leniency springs less from affection than
interest sure am i that had your excellency from the first held out
the arms of conciliation instead of the banners of vengeance at this
moment instead of being arrayed against you in desperate hostility the
forces of cortes would have been found enrolled under your own
standard and cortes himself among the humblest and faithfullest of your
captains

while i doubt that effect said the general sharply i cannot but be
assured of the strength of don andres's interest while i listen to the
whispers of his enemies

duero coloured but replied calmly

it is not unknown to me that certain ill-advised persons have charged
me with being under the influence of a secret compact with cortes
formed before his appointment to the command of the first army of
invasion whereby i was to share a full third of the profits of his
enterprise without pretending to show the improbability of such an
agreement i will for an instant allow your excellency to take it for
granted in order that your excellency may give me credit for my present
disinterestedness in doing all i can to ruin my colleague in which i
reckon as no slight matter taking every opportunity to decoy away his
followers

if thou wilt show me in what manner submission to the whims and insults
of this insolent boy could have detached any of the mutineers from
cortes i will confess myself in error and liberate him forthwith
said the general

the insult has been passed the blow has been struck said duero
gravely and unless your excellency chooses to measure swords with him
immediately after his liberation nothing can be gained by such a step
i should rather counsel your excellency to have the prison watched with
a double guard but in arresting him you have besides giving deep
offence to your colleague the admiral for ever won the hate and
hostility of the knight of rhodes and when this is told him in the camp
of cortes it will harden the hearts of all against us

when it is told in the camp of cortes said narvaez with a bitter
smile it shall be with mine own lips and if i hang not upon a tree
afterwards the knight calavar himself it will be more out of regard
to his madness than to the dignity of his knighthood i will attack the
rebel to-morrow

your excellency is heated by anger said duero temperately or you
would observe you have a follower of the rebel for a listener

ay botello cried the general with a laugh of scorn he will carry
my counsels to cortes when the cony carries food to the serpent and the
sick ox to the carrion crow hark sirrah thou hast read the fate of
thy master will i attack him to-morrow

thou wilt not said botello with an unmoved countenance

hah cried narvaez art thou so sure of this that thou wilt pledge
thy head on the prophecy thou shall live to be hanged at sunset with
thy old comrades for spectators

heaven has written another history for to-morrow said botello
gravely and i have read that as closely as the page of to-day but
what is for myself is and no man may know it the fate in store for
the vain pride and the quick anger may in part be spoken

sirrah said narvaez remember that though the vain pride might
overlook one so contemptible as thyself the quick anger is not yet
allayed and if thou wilt not have me beat thee in the morning proceed
forthwith to discourse of our destinies

blows shall be struck said the magician earnestly but whether upon
my own head or another's whether in this temple or another place
whether in the morning or the evening i am not permitted to divulge
repent of thy sins call in a confessor and pray for wrath cometh and
sorrow is behind by the spirits that live in the stars by the elves
that dwell in stones and shrubs by the virtues that are caged in matter
where the ignorant man findeth naught but ignorance have i been made
acquainted with many things appertaining to thy fate but not all if
thou wilt i will speak thee the things i am permitted

speak then cried the general for whether thy knowledge be truth or
lies whether it come from the revelations of angels or the diabolical
instructions of fiends i will listen without fear

adonai melech under the heaven and above the abyss with my hand
on the cross and the rosary in my bosom in rome near to the
footsteps of his holiness and with one who was his favourite
astrologer studied i mine art and there is nothing in it that is not
blessed said botello with a solemn enthusiasm that made a deep
impression upon all give me a staff that i may draw the curtain from
this loop he continued

the sword of a younger officer was instantly extended the curtain
removed and the moon climbing the blue hills of paradise looked down
into the apartment the cavaliers stared at the astrologer and magician
for botello was both some with an unconcealed awe and others the
general among the rest with an endeavour at looks of contempt not in
good character with the interest they betrayed in all his proceedings
he raised his eyes to the beautiful luminary enough to create by her
mystic splendour the elements of superstition in the breast of a
rhapsodist crossed himself devoutly twice or thrice mumbled certain
inexplicable words and then said aloud with a mournful emphasis

wo to him that sits in the high place when the moon shines from the
house allatha but the time has not come and i dare not speak the hour
of its visitation

and what shall it advantage me to know my peril if i have not such
knowledge as may enable me to prevent it demanded narvaez with a
frown

and what would it benefit thee to know the time of thy peril said the
astrologer when god has not given thee the power to avert it what is
written must be fulfilled what is declared must be accomplished
listen the queen of night is in the eighteenth mansion and under that
influence discord is sown in the hearts of men sedition comes to the
earth and conspiracy hatches under the green leaf

the general turned quickly upon his officers and surveyed them with an
eye of suspicion they looked blankly one upon another until duero
laughing in a forced and unnatural manner cried

why should we listen to this madman if we are so affected by his
ravings señor general you will straightway look upon us all as
traitors

there have been villains about us before muttered the general but i
will not take the moon's word for it and the more especially that i
must receive it through this man's interpretation

it is the influence too that is good for the friendless captive
continued the magician and many a heart that beats under bonds
to-night will leap in freedom to-morrow

every way this is bad for us said duero banteringly i would advise
your excellency to clap chains on the legs of de leste and the scribe
who are i think saving the few rogues of cortes who have craved to
enter into our service the only prisoners in our possession

and dost thou think this gibberish will move me to any such
precaution cried narvaez with a compelled smile thou canst not
believe i listen to it for aught but diversion

surely not if your excellency says so but still may we guard the
prisoners without fear of being laughed at for our superstition as
long as we have faith in the discretion of all present

guard them thyself if thou wilt said the general i am not moved
enough for such condescension continue thy mummeries botello he
went on and when thou art done with the moon of which i am heartily
tired i will look for thee to introduce me to some essence that speaks
a clearer language

what wouldst thou have cried the astrologer what plainer language
wouldst thou have spoken in the house allatha is written the defection
of friends the dethronement of princes the fall of citadels in a
siege

villain and caitiff dost thou dare to insinuate that this citadel of
zempoala is in a state of siege cried the biscayan with a ferocious
frown

i speak of the things that are to come said botello what more than
this wilt thou have

it will doubtless be well interrupted duero significantly to
evacuate this city in the morning by encamping in the fields we can
certainly avoid the danger of a besieged citadel

dost thou gibe me don andres said narvaez with a brow on which
jealousy struggled with rage

the secretary of velasquez laid his hand on his heart with a gesture of
respectful deprecation

ay i see thou art stirred by these phantasms cried the governor
with a harsh laugh looking from duero to the other cavaliers what
means this my masters do ye all stare as if ye had got among you a
dead samuel telling ye of your deaths on the morrow cheer up for
by'r lady i intend if this old fellow's command of the black art runs
so far to divert you with a more horrible companion what sayest thou
botello it is whispered thou canst raise devils and force them to
speak to thee

ay said botello with a ghastly grin staring the general in the
face until the latter faltered before him wilt thou adventure then so
far canst thou whose eyes tremble at the gaze of a living creature
think to look upon the face of a fallen angel hast thou confessed
to-day and been absolved hast thou been free since the sunrise of
thoughts of treachery and feelings of wrath the pentacle and the circle
the consecrated sword and the crucifix the sign of the cross and the
muttered paternoster will not protect the unshriven sinner from the
claws of a raised demon

if thou canst raise him said narvaez stoutly do so and quickly i
fortify myself in the name of god and the holy ones against all spirits
and devils it will be much satisfaction to my curiosity to look upon
one of the accursed

they are about us in the air they are at our elbows and ears said
botello and it needs but a spell to be spoken to bring them before us
but wo to him that hath thought a sin to day when the evil one looks on
him

señor narvaez cried duero with a most expressive and contagious
alarm if it be your inclination to raise the devil you must indulge
it alone for my part i confess there have been this day certain
sinful thoughts about my bosom which have unfitted me for such an
interview and i care not who knows it my valour has in it so little
of the fire of faith i would sooner at any moment speak with ten men
than one devil god be with you señor i wish you a good evening

tarry duero stay cavaliers cried narvaez losing much of his own
dread in the contemplation of the apprehension of others why you are
such a knot of sinners as i dreamed not i had about me faith i am
ashamed of you and of you in particular duero for i thought thy
shrewdness would have seen in this knave's attempt to frighten us from
the exhibition an excellent evidence of his inability to make it

i could show thee more than thou couldst see said botello and i
know more things will come to thee than thou shall see i know with
all thy vaunting thou wouldst perish in the gaze of an angel of hell
for thy heart would be the heart of a boy and it flutters already even
at the thought of the spectacle i will show thee an essence thou
mayest look upon without alarm

do so said narvaez sternly and remember while saying what may be
necessary by way of explanation that thou speakest to the chief and
governor of these lands who will whip thy head from thy neck in spite
of all the devils if thou discoursest not with more becoming
reverence

my fate is written cried botello with neither indignation or alarm
and drawing calmly from his bosom an implement of his art he advanced
to the light and displayed it freely to the cavaliers it was or
seemed to be an antique jewel of rock-crystal not bigger than a
pigeon's egg set in the centre of a triangular disk of gold on which
last were engraved many unknown characters and figures crossing
himself twice or thrice the enchanter swung it by a little silver chain
to which it was pendent in the full blaze of the lamp so that either
of the persons present might have handled it had any been so disposed
but in truth the superstition of an age for which no marvel was too
gross no miracle too wonderful was more or less shared by all and
they merely surveyed it at a distance with curiosity and fear

this said the magician a gem more precious to the wise than the
adamant of the east but in the hands of the unfaithful more pernicious
than the tooth of a viper is the prison-house of an essence that was
once powerful among the spirits of night the great agrippa wedged him
in this stone and from agrippa when i rested at his feet in the holy
city did i receive the inestimable gift kalidon-sadabath the night
is thy season the midnight thy time of power the lord of men calls
thee from thy prison-house the armed man calls thee with the sword lo
he wakes from his slumber and will image out the destiny of the
seeker

the cavaliers starting gazed behind them with fear as if expecting to
behold some mighty fiend rising shadowy from the floor but no
intelligence more lofty or more ignoble than themselves was visible in
the sanctuary they bent their eyes upon the crystal and beheld some
with surprise and others with deep awe a little drop as of some black
liquid glittering in the very centre of the jewel

the haughty soldiers who would have rushed with cries of joy upon an
army of infidels shrank away with murmurs of hesitation when botello
extended the talisman towards them but they mistook the gesture of the
magician his arm was outstretched more to display the wonder than to
part with it he surveyed it himself a moment with much satisfaction
then turning to narvaez he said

lay thy hand upon the cross of thy sword say a paternoster over in thy
heart and thou shalt be protected from the mischief of this
inquisition while i tell thee what i behold in the face of
kalidon-sadabath

with your favour cried narvaez suddenly and boldly snatching the
enchanted crystal from the hands of botello i will choose rather to
see his visage myself than trust to your interpretations and as for
the protection i can con over a paternoster while i am looking though
why it needs to bestow so much piety upon this juggler's gewgaw is more
than i can understand

say at least the prayer cried botello earnestly for neither
enchanted crystal nor consecrated gold can hold the strong spirit from
the wicked and self-sufficient

i have much trust in the saints and in myself said the governor
coolly greatly assured and inspirited by the harmless appearance of the
little mystery nevertheless i will follow your counsel in the matter
of the prayer the more readily that it will keep my mind from
wandering to more important affairs and because in part i am somewhat
burdened with the sin of neglecting such duties when there is more
occasion for them

he drew the lamp to him grasped the crystal firmly in his hands and
bending over it so closely that his warm breath sullied its lustre
regarded it with a fixed attention the cavaliers noted the proceeding
with interest they gazed now at the jewel almost concealed in his
grasp and now at the general as his lips muttered over the inaudible
prayer suddenly and before he had half accomplished the task they
observed his brows knit and his lip fall his eye dilated with a stare
of terror a deadly paleness came over his visage and starting up and
loosing the talisman from his grasp he exclaimed wildly

by heaven there is a living creature in the stone

the sorcerer caught the magical implement as it fell from the hands of
narvaez and throwing himself upon his knees while the cavaliers looked
on in mute astonishment exclaimed 

forget not the prayer and be content to hear what is revealed by the
imp of the crystal kalidon-sadabath he flingeth abroad his arms and
is in wrath and trouble

it is true said narvaez looking to his officers in perturbation
while i looked into the shining stone the black drop increased in
size and grew into the similitude of a being whose arms were tossed
out as if in agony while spots of fire gathered round his visage

say the prayer if thou wilt not die miserably before the time that is
otherwise ordained cried botello with a stern voice that was
remarkable enough to be addressed by one of his station to the proud
and powerful commander once twice ay is there no more to be
reckoned by thee sadabath once twice yea as the star sayeth so
sayest thou once twice

what sayest thou said narvaez ceasing the prayer he had resumed to
question the oraculous adept

to thy prayer listen and ask not ay thou speakest in mystery i
turn thee to the north which thou knowest not and the south where
thou hadst thy dwelling to the east which thou abhorrest and to the
west where was thy dark chamber to the heaven whose light thou lovest
not to the pit under the earth where thou wast a wanderer and to
man's heart which was pleasanter to thee than the bonds of the crystal
in the name of the seven that are of power under the earth and of the
seven that are mighty above i call to thee kalidon-sadabath the
bright star that is quenched in shadows in fire and smoke in thunder
and with spears with blows and with bloodshed thou speakest and i
hear thee

i hear nothing save thy accursed croaking worse than that of the
crows of biscay cried narvaez hotly if thy devil have no more
intelligible gabble cast him out and call another

he speaks not but by images and phantasms pictured on the
crystal now listen for thy story cometh i see a great house on
fire 

ay i shall perish then in a conflagration said the governor
hastily i have ever had a horror of burning houses

the smoke eddies the flame roars and one sitteth blindfold under the
eaves with the flakes and cinders falling about him which he sees
not

if thou meanest that i shall rest in that stupid state under such
peril thy devil sadabath is a liar and i defy him

and he that takes thee by the hand cried botello without regarding
the interruptions is he thy friend

ay answer me that question said the governor for if i am to be led
out of the fire by a foeman i will straightway forswear my friends and
give my heart to the magnanimous

thou doest him obeisance cried the magician with extraordinary
emphasis 

villain exclaimed the general

thou placest thy neck upon the earth and he tramples it

liar and traitor roared the biscayan spurning the magician with his
foot and in his fury snatching up a weapon to despatch him

why shouldst thou stain thy hand with the blood of the dotard cried
duero interposing for a second time between the intemperate commander
and the object of his anger he is a madman incapable of understanding
what he says and were he even sane and speaking the truth your
commands to have him entertain you with his mummeries should have
ensured him against your anger

very true said narvaez with a scowl i was a fool to strike
him trample on my neck thou grizzly and cheating villain go
begone thy devil though he cannot tell thee what awaits thee in the
morning may show thee what thou deservest

i deserved not to be spurned said botello tranquilly after having
gathered up his enchanted crystal and raised himself to his feet and
the dishonour will fall not on the side that was bruised but on the
limb that was raised against it once already to-day have i cursed
the man that struck me in my captivity and he lies a corse on his
couch

it is true said a young cavalier shuddering i inquired after
caboban when i came from the prison with botello he was dead

i will curse no more to-day said the magician sorrowfully for it
is a sin upon the soul to kill with maledictions and moreover thou
that hast done me this wrong wilt suffer enough without a new
retribution

the general waved his hand angrily and impatiently and botello was led
away followed by most of the cavaliers




chapter xii


when don amador found himself alone in the prison with fabueno with no
other prospect before him than that of remaining therein till it might
please the stars to throw open the doors the rage that was too
philosophic to quarrel with stone walls gradually subsided into a
tranquil indignation nay so much command of himself did he regain
that hearing his companion bewailing his fate in a manner somewhat
immoderate as if regarding his incarceration as the prelude to a more
dismal destiny he opened his lips to give him comfort

i must counsel thee friend lorenzo he said to give over this vain
and very boyish lamentation as being entirely unworthy the spirit i
beheld thee display in presence of that biscayan boar the insult and
shame of our present imprisonment are what thou dost not share and
therefore thou shouldst not be grieved on that account and doubtless
as thou wert arrested less because thou wert in fault than because this
foolish governor was in a passion he will liberate thee when he cools
in the morning

i have no such hope said fabueno piteously don panfilo is a most
bitter and unforgiving man sudden in his wrath inexorable in his
vengeance and he has already indulged his fury at the expense of men so
much more elevated and powerful than myself that i am in great fear he
will give me to some heavy punishment for daring to oppose his
humours

know lorenzo said the novice that in that opposition thou didst
show thyself possessed of a spirit which has won my respect and unless
thou dost already repent thy boldness i will confess i am very grateful
to thee that thou didst grasp thy sword in my cause for which reason
when we are again free i will beseech the admiral to grant thee thy
wish and immediately receive thee into my service as a pupil in war

and how is your worship to be freed said lorenzo disconsolately
sure am i don panfilo will no more regard your worship's honour and
dignity than he did the privileges of the licentiate vasques de ayllon
the agent of the holy monks of san geronimo and what is more an
oidor of the king himself whom notwithstanding all these titles he
imprisoned and banished for thwarting him in a small matter

i have in my own present situation a sufficient and
never-to-be-forgotten proof of his violence and injustice said amador
nevertheless i entertain hopes of being soon at freedom for if some
lucky opportunity do not enable me myself to break my bonds i am
assured the news of this most causeless and tyrannical outrage will in
some way be carried to the ears of my kinsman the knight calavar
after which i shall be very confident of liberation and after
liberation as i may add of satisfaction on the body of my wronger
but before we give ourselves up to despondence let us see in what
manner we may be able to help ourselves we should at least look a
little to the various entrances that seem to lead into this dungeon

the apartment was spacious but low a narrow casement opened on one
side at the distance of six feet from the floor and admitted the
moonbeams by which the captives were enabled to conduct their
examination the door through which they had entered was strongly
barricaded on the outside a passage leading to the interior was
similarly secured and equally impassable the neophyte with a sigh
turned to the casement a thick grating defended it and shut out all
hopes of escape

we can do nothing unless assisted from without said amador i
would to heaven i had kept my knaves at my side with such a wary
servant as baltasar at my back and so faithful a desperado as lazaro at
my side i should have made another sort of departure from that abhorred
tower the varlets are perhaps sleeping in security without a thought
of their master nay by my faith it is not probable they should give
themselves to rest without being made acquainted with my instructions
for the night perhaps they may be lurking in the neighbourhood ready
to hear my call and to obey it at all events señor secretary i would
thou couldst mount to those iron stanchions and take note of what is
passing on the outside

iron cried the secretary quickly by san iago of compostella a
thought strikes me i know well señor that in these lands iron has
almost the value of gold and is too scarce to be wasted on the defences
of a temporary dungeon where it might be stolen too at the first
opportunity by the indians

dost thou mean to say that these bars are of wood demanded amador

indeed i think so señor and if i had but a knife or dagger and the
means of climbing into the window i would warrant to be at liberty
before morning

here is a poniard of which the villains forgot to divest me said
amador strike it against the stanchions if they be of wood we have
much hope of freeing ourselves

the secretary did as he was directed he raised himself a-tiptoe and
the sharp weapon buried itself in the flimsy barrier

if i had but something to stand on he cried eagerly how soon might
we not be free

there is neither stool nor chair in this vile den said don amador
but i will not shame to give thee the support of my shoulder and the
more readily that i think thy slight frame would be incapable of
supporting my own greater weight pause not he continued observing
that fabueno hesitated if thy foot be near my neck i shall know it is
not the foot of an enemy i will kneel to take thee on my back as the
saracen camel does to his master stretch thyself to thy full height
so as to cut through the tops of the bars after which without further
carving thou canst easily wrench them from their places

fabueno submitted to the will of the novice and amador rising without
much effort under his weight he was soon in a position to operate to
advantage

why dost thou falter demanded the novice as lorenzo after making
one or two gashes in the wood suddenly ceased his labour

señor replied the secretary in a low voice there is a guard at a
little distance sitting under the shadow of the pyramid a cavalier
stands in advance watching it is the captain salvatierra

may heaven strike me with pains and death cried amador with an
abrupt ardour that nearly tumbled the secretary from his station if i
do not covet the blood of that false and cowardly traitor who after
hiding his wrath under the cloak of magnanimity and religion was the
first to seize upon me and that from behind

what is to be done señor demanded fabueno in a whisper he will
discover me and even if i can remove the grating there will be no
possibility to descend without observation

cut through the wood as silently as thou canst said amador and
then when the window is open i will myself spring to the earth and so
occupy the dastard's notice that thou shall escape without peril cut
on and fear not

the secretary obeyed but had not yet divided a single stake when
suddenly a noise was heard as of the clattering of armour as well as
the voice of salvatierra exclaiming furiously

to your bows ye vagabonds quick and hotly drive your shafts through
and through shoot

descend said amador

but before the secretary could follow his counsel here came four
cross-bow shafts rattling violently into the window and fabueno with a
loud cry sprang or rather fell to the floor

have the knaves struck thee demanded amador as he raised the
groaning youth in his arms

ay señor replied the youth faintly i shall never see the golden
kings of mexico

be of better heart said amador leading him to where the moonlight
shone brightest on the floor art thou struck in the body if thou
diest be certain i will revenge thee where art thou hurt

i know not replied lorenzo piteously but i know i shall die o
heaven this is a pang more bitter than death must i die

be comforted said the novice cheeringly the arrow has only pierced
thy arm i will snap it asunder and withdraw it fear not there is no
peril in such hurt and i will bear witness thou hast won it most
honourably

will i not die then cried fabueno with joy pho it was the first
time i was ever hurt and i judged of the wound only by the agony pho
indeed tis but a scratch

thou bearest it valiantly said amador binding his scarf round the
wound and i have no doubt thou wilt make a worthy soldier but what
is now to be done if thou thinkest thou hast strength to support me for
a minute or two i will clamber to the window myself and remove the
bars without fear the arrows of these varlets can do me much harm
through my armour

they are not above three-score yards distant said fabueno and
señor i feel a little faint i know not moreover how i could escape
even if your honour should be so lucky as to reach the ground

i should not have forsaken thee lorenzo said the cavalier giving
over with a sigh all hope of escape there is nothing more to be
done the foul fiend seize the knave that struck thee and the dastard
that commanded the shot i would to heaven i had beaten him
soundly how feelest thou now if thou canst sleep it will be well

i have no more pain said the secretary but feel a sort of
exhaustion which will doubtless be relieved by rest

sleep then said amador and have a care that thy wounded member be
not oppressed by the weight of thy body i will myself presently follow
thy example if aught should occur to disturb thee even though it
should be but the pain of thy hurt scruple not to arouse me

the neophyte watched till persuaded the secretary was asleep then
devoutly repeating a prayer he stretched himself on his hard mat with
as much tranquillity as if reposing on a goodly bed in his own
mountain-castle and was soon lost to his troubles




chapter xiii


the cavalier was roused from his slumbers by a cause at first
incomprehensible the moonlight had vanished from the prison and deep
obscurity had succeeded but in the little light remaining he saw as
he started up the figures of several men one of whom had been tugging
at his shoulder and now whispered to him as he instinctively grasped
at his dagger

peace cavalier i am a friend and i give you liberty

i will thank thee for the gift when i am sure i enjoy it said the
neophyte already on his feet i remember thy voice thou art one of
the followers of the knave narvaez

i am one who laments without extenuating the folly of the general
said the voice of duero but tarry not to question hasten thy horse
is ready

where is the youth fabueno it is not in my power to desert the
secretary

here señor whispered lorenzo i am ready

ah friend fabueno i am glad to hear thee speak so cheerily it
assures me thy wound does not afflict thee and my varlets señor

they wait for thee don amador delay not the door is open the
magician will guide thee to thy kinsman commend me to cortes and if
thou art at any time found fighting on the pyramid of zempoala
remember that duero is not thine enemy

by heaven i should think i dream said amador stay señor i would
thank thee for thy honourable and most noble benevolence and in
addition would tax thy charity in favour of a certain moor  

tetragrammaton thou pratest as if thou wert among thy friends in
christendom and of infidels too as if there were no christians to be
thought of said a voice in which amador instantly recognised the
tones of the enchanter i said the captive should be freed but never
a jot that he should not be reduced to bonds again by his own folly be
silent and follow me

the neophyte had collected his scattered senses and instantly assuming
the prudence which he now understood was necessary to his safety he
issued from the prison the moon was sinking behind the vast and
majestic peaks of the interior a deep shadow lay over the great square
on one side of which stood the dungeon and only on the top of the
principal tower trembled a lingering ray a silence still deeper than
the darkness invested the indian city and amador could distinctly hear
the foot-fall of a sentinel as he strode to and fro over the terrace of
the pyramid he looked to that quarter whence as he judged had come
the shafts which had so nearly robbed him of his fellow-prisoner the
crossbowmen slept on their post in the mild and quiet air at the base
of the temple

give me thy hand fabueno said amador drawing his poniard again from
the sheath i will shield thee from the dogs this time and now that i
snuff the breath of freedom i think it will need a craftier knave's
trick than that of salvatierra to deprive me of it a second time

following the magician as he stole cautiously along the brothers in
misfortune crept on with a stealthy pace under the shadows of buildings
and trees till exchanging the more exposed openness of the square for
the safer gloom of a street they advanced with greater assurance and
rapidity the stone dwellings of the tlatoani gave place to the earthen
and wicker cabins of the suburbs the gray glimpses of morning had not
yet visited the east when they reached the extreme edge of the town
and betook themselves to the covert of a clump of trees under which in
the figures that were there visible don amador recognised with joy his
war-horse and his followers

rejoice in silence said botello interrupting his raptures for
there is an ear at no great distance very ready to hear thee mount and
be ready señor secretary thy sorrel is tied to the mimosa you can
look to your equipments a little while i see if heaven will not confirm
the fate of visions for i dreamed i should ride back to cortes on a
good roan charger to-day

the magician disappeared and amador scarcely suppressing his ardour
when he found that not only his attendants and horses but even the
well-fleshed sword wrested from him in the evening was in readiness to
be restored to him grasped it with exultation and sprang into the
saddle then passing towards fabueno and finding that his arm caused
him much pain in the act of mounting he assisted him to ascend with his
own hand a condescension that went to the heart of the secretary from
fabueno also he learned in a few words somewhat of the secret of their
liberation less than an hour after amador had fallen asleep and while
lorenzo was still kept awake by the pain of his wound the door of the
prison was opened and botello thrust in who comforted the secretary
with a mystic but still an unequivocal assurance of freedom before
sunrise and commanded him not to wake the novice but to follow his
example he would need invigoration from slumber to support the toils of
the coming day what previous understanding might have existed between
the enchanter and the señor duero he knew not but certain he was
botello had predicted a speedy deliverance for all and all were now
delivered

i have often considered said the novice thoughtfully that the
existence of magical powers either for the purposes of prediction or
enchantment was incompatible with the known goodness and wisdom of god
for surely if the power to foresee would have added any thing to the
happiness of man god would not have denied it to men generally and as
for the powers of enchantment as they can only be used for good or bad
purposes it seems to me that to employ them for the first would be to
accuse the divinity of an insufficient benevolence while to exercise
them for the last would imply a supposition that heaven had not all men
equally under its protection this therefore is my opinion though i
must confess that sometimes when governed more by passion or
imagination than by reason i have had my misgivings on the subject
nevertheless good fabueno in this particular case of botello i must
advise thee not too much to abuse thy credulity for i think all
circumstances go to show he grounded his prophecy of our deliverance
more on a knowledge of the resolutions of the good señor duero than on
the revelations of stars or spirits yet must i confess continued
amador that this very goodness of duero implying as it truly does a
state of opposition and rebellion to the will of the uncivil narvaez
his general is so very miraculous as almost itself to look like
magic

before the secretary could reply the sound of hoofs was heard
approaching and botello as they discovered by his voice rode up to
the trees

the dream was true the imp that speaks to slumber was not a liar he
cried exultingly we leave the jailor afoot and kalidon-sadabath
shall swing on a galloping horse god is over all by night and by
day afoot and on horse in battle and in flight amen now ride
and santiago for spain he shouted this sudden cry with a voice
that amazed amador after his often-repeated injunctions for
silence santiago for spain san pedro for the invaders and san pablo
for flying prisoners whip and spur guide and cheer and rocks and
thorns spread over the path of pursuers

as don amador anticipated the shout of the lunatic for such he began
to esteem botello was carried even to the head-quarters of the
biscayan an arquebuse was discharged from the pyramid and as the
fugitives began their flight the flourish of a trumpet in one quarter
of the town and the roll of a drum in another convinced them that the
alarm had been given and was spreading from post to post in a manner
that might prove exceedingly inconvenient the cavalier pressed to the
side of botello an achievement of some little difficulty for he
perceived his guide was well mounted

señor magico he cried as he galloped in company with him dost thou
know thou couldst not have fallen upon a better plan to oppose our
flight and perhaps reduce us again to bonds than by the indulgence of
this same untimely and obstreperous shouting

trust in god and fear not replied the magician this day shalt thou
look upon the face of cortes and though the enemy follow us yet shall
his pursuit be vain and unlucky

i will allow that such may be the termination said amador yet
notwithstanding can i perceive no advantage in being pursued but much
that is to be deprecated inasmuch as we shall exhaust that strength of
our horses in our hurry which might have been reserved for a more
honourable contingency

your valour will by-and-by perceive there is more wisdom than looks to
the moment said botello coolly without slacking his pace and
provided you can keep your followers from swerving from the path and
that inexperienced youth from falling out of his saddle i will with
my head answer for your safety

amador dropped behind a little lazaro and baltasar required no
instructions to keep them in the neighbourhood of their master and the
secretary though complaining that he rode in pain professed himself
able to keep up with the party from his henchmen as he rode don
amador obtained but little to unravel the mystery of his escape the two
attendants had been quartered alone in a deserted building in the
garden of which they were instructed to provide for their steeds they
had been roused by a cavalier who commanded them to follow him to their
master in token of whose authority he showed them the well-known blade
of the novice he had conducted them to the grove and left them with
charges to remain as they had done in tranquillity until the
appearance of don amador

at the dawn of day the neophyte became convinced he had ridden more
than the distance which he supposed separated the camps of the rival
generals and wondering at the absence of all signs of life in the
forest through which he was passing he again betook himself to botello

the magician had halted on the brow of an eminence where though the
dense wood as well as the obscurity of the hour greatly contracted the
sphere of vision he looked back as if striving to detect the figures of
pursuers among the thick shadows the shouts of men were heard far
behind but this circumstance instead of filling the mind of botello
with alarm gave on the contrary to his countenance an expression of
great satisfaction

we are pursued enchanter and yet i perceive neither tent nor
out-post of thy friends to give us refuge from our enemies said don
amador

let them come cried botello tranquilly it is worse for the stag
when the pack is scattered but better for the kite when the pheasants
have broke the covey

there may be much wisdom in thy tropes as well as in thine actions
said the novice yet am i slow to discover it in either whether we are
to be considered the stag or the hounds the hawk or the pheasants
entirely passes my comprehension but sure am i that in either case
our safety may be considered quite as metaphorical as thy speech i
understood from thee last night and i remember it very well because
it was that communication which exasperated me into a quarrel with the
governor that the river whereon cortes was encamped was but a league
from zempoala yet am i persuaded we have galloped twice that distance

he travels no straight road who creeps through the country of a
foeman said botello resuming his journey though at a more moderate
gait than before and don amador should be content if he can avoid the
many scouts and vedettes that infest the path by riding thrice the two
leagues he has compassed already

fogoso is strong and it seems to me his spirit revives at every new
step he takes through these fresh forests said the cavalier yet even
for his sake were there no other reason would i be fain to pick the
shortest road that leads to the camp of cortes i am greatly concerned
about my young friend the secretary who as thou hast doubtless
learned was last night shot through the arm with an arrow by those
knaves who kept watch at the window of the prison and therefore for
his sake am i desirous to find a resting place as soon as possible if
i should give thee my counsel a thing i am loath to do as thou
seemest experienced in all the intricacies of this woody wilderness in
which i am a stranger it would be to forsake all these crooked and
endless by-ways without delay and strike upon the shortest path
without consideration of any small party of scouts we might meet for
even excluding the wounded fabueno we are here together four strong
men armed and well mounted who fighting our way to freedom would
doubtless be an over-match for twice the number of enemies

the youth must learn the science of a soldier said botello and
suffering is the first letter of its alphabet happy will he be if in
the life he covets he encounter no more agony than he shall endure
to-day when we have time to rest i will anoint his arm with a salve
more powerful than the unguents of a physician what i do señor and
whither i guide are best as you will acknowledge when the journey is
over why should your honour desire to exchange blows with poor scouts
i shall win better thanks of the knight calavar when i conduct you to
him unharmed faster señor the pursuers are gaining on us

the neophyte gave the rein to fogoso and greatly inflamed by the
mention of his kinsman's name rode by the side of botello to demand of
him such intelligence of the knight as it might be in his power to
impart little more however had the astrologer to communicate than
amador had already acquired the knight calavar was in the camp of
cortes among the most honoured of his followers if such he could be
called who divided the perils without claiming to share the profits of
the campaign and fought less when he was commanded or entreated than
when moved by his own wayward impulses that he was in good bodily
health was also another point on which botello was able to satisfy
curiosity and as he made no mention of another subject on which don
amador scrupled to speak he was glad to believe the distractions of the
new world had given some relief to the mental maladies of his kinsman

a very little circumstance served however almost at the same moment to
reveal one of his own infirmities as the morning dawned and objects
were seen more distinctly he began to bend an eye of observation on the
horse which botello rode a spirited beast as he had already
determined by many evidences of fleetness and mettle when he came to
regard it more closely he perceived by signs not to be mistaken that
it was no other than the animal which had the day before caracoled
under the weight of salvatierra botello grinned when an exclamation
made him acquainted with the thoughts of the cavalier to the demand
where and how he had obtained possession of the charger the answer was
brief and significant the captain salvatierra like many other officers
of narvaez preferred rather to waste the moonlight nights with the
olive-cheeked dalilahs of the suburbs than with enemies and prisoners
even though they might be men of such merit and distinction as don
amador this was a peculiarity with which he did not say whether by the
instrumentality of his art or the intervention of human agents
botello had contrived to become acquainted and being also apprised of
salvatierra's favourite retreat which was at no great distance from the
grove wherein don amador had found his followers he did not hesitate to
deprive him of so superfluous an appendage as his charger

by st john cried the neophyte in a heat i would have bestowed
upon thee more cruzadoes than thou canst gain by a month's exercise of
thine art hadst thou but made me acquainted with his hiding-place i
now know the man who could strike a boy and attack one he hated from
behind is a most execrable caitiff more worthy of misprision than
revenge but despite all this i should have begun this day's labours
with more tranquillity and self-approval had i but enjoyed two moments
of conference with him previously

your worship may have a day for acquitting scores with him more
conveniently than you could have done this morning said botello

hark'ee botello cried amador eagerly it is thy absolute opinion
we are at this moment pursued is it not

i do not doubt it i hear shouts behind ever and anon

i will tell thee what i will do continued the neophyte i will tarry
here with lazaro and baltasar thou if thou thinkest fit canst advance
with the secretary i should be loath to bring him into combat before
his wound is healed and before lazaro has given him some instructions
in the management of his arms  

all this thou wilt do then said botello interrupting him on the
presumption that salvatierra is among the pursuers your worship may
satisfy yourself the vigilant cavalier is at this moment either
abiding the reproof of narvaez for his negligence or biting his thumbs
with disgust as among mounted captains he walks through the streets
of zempoala horses are not in this land so plentiful as rabbits and i
thank the blessed influences which have given to me so good a friend
this day he went on patting the neck of the steed so very good
that until there comes a new fleet from cuba the captain salvatierra
will be scarce able to follow after his charger this may satisfy your
honour on one point as to another i beg to assure you don amador
that i am no lying juggler selling my revelations for money i tell
what is told me when i am moved by the spirit that is given to dwell
within me and neither real of silver nor doubloon of gold can otherwise
buy me to open my lips




chapter xiv


to the surprise and much also to the dissatisfaction of don amador
the noon-day sun still found him struggling with his companions among
the rocks and forests it seemed to him from a review of his journey
that he had been doubling and turning for the whole morning like a boy
at blindman's-buff within a circle of a few leagues and though he
could not upon the closest inspection detect a single tree or brook
which he remembered to have passed before he shrewdly suspected it was
botello's intention to make him well acquainted with the forest before
dismissing him from its depths it was however vain to wonder and
equally fruitless to complain for the whole morning at different
intervals he was assured sometimes from hearing their shouts in the
thicket sometimes from beholding them from a hill-top crossing an
opposing eminence that his pursuers were close at his heels of which
fact and the necessity it presented to move with becoming caution the
enchanter took advantage in the construction of his answers to every
remonstrance at length perhaps two hours after noon the travellers
approached a hill whence as botello assured them they might look down
upon the river of canoes this was the more agreeable intelligence
since the day was intolerably hot and they almost longed for the
bursting of a tempest which had been brooding in the welkin for the last
half hour the drenching of which as they thought would be far more
sufferable than the combustion of sunshine they reached the hill and
from its bushy and stony side looked down upon the valley where the
river or more properly speaking the rivulet went foaming and
fretting over its rugged channel on the hither side of the stream the
vale was bare and sandy and on the other though doubtless partaking of
the same character the trees which bordered upon the water making
divers agreeable groves entirely shut out the view so that don amador
saw not as he had fondly anticipated the encampment of the invader of
mexico and the resting-place of his kinsman but if he beheld not what
he so much desired to see he surveyed another spectacle which caused
him no little wonder at a short distance and almost at the bottom of
the hill he was struck with the unexpected apparition of the army of
narvaez drawn out in order of battle as if awaiting the approach of a
foe and commanding the passage of the river he rubbed his eyes with
astonishment but there was no delusion in the view

señor said botello in a low voice as if reading his thoughts you
marvel to see this army which we left sleeping at the temple arrived
at the river before us but you forget zempoala lies only a league from
the river

let us descend and cross to the other side said amador impatiently
i see the very spot where sits the knave narvaez on his horse and if
the valiant cortes have it in intention as i do not doubt to give him
battle i should sharply regret to watch the conflict from this
hill-side

i told narvaez himself said the magician with a sort of triumph
he should not join battle with cortes to-day and he shall not when
the time comes don amador may join in the combat if he will be
content señor we cannot stir from this hill without being observed
and captured or slain the thunder roars the bolt glitters in the
heaven the storm that levels the tall ceibas will open us a path
presently even through that angry army

almost while botello spoke and before the cavalier could add words to
the disinclination with which he regarded so untimely a delay there
burst such a thunderbolt over his head as made fogoso in common with
every other horse in the party cower to the earth as if stricken by
its violence this was immediately followed by a succession of separate
explosions and of multisonous volleys less resembling the furious roar
of the ordnance of a great army than of the artillery of volcanoes and
it became immediately necessary for each man to dismount and allay as
he could the frantic terrors of his charger in the midst of this
sublime prelude the rushing of a mighty wind was added to the orchestre
of the elements and in an instant the face of day the black vapours
above and the varied valley below were hidden in a cloud of dust sand
and leaves stripped in a moment from the plains and the forest and in
an instant also the army of narvaez was snatched from the eyes of the
cavalier presently also came another sound heard even above the peal
of the thunder and the rush of the wind the roar of a great rain
booming along like a moving cataract was mingled with the harsh music
of nature and don amador looked anxiously round for some place of
shelter happily though no cavern welcomed them into its gloomy
security there was a spot hard by where certain tall and massive rocks
lay so jammed and wedged together as to present most of the
characteristics of a chamber except that there was wanting the fourth
side as well as the roof unless indeed the outstretched branches of
the great trees that grew among these fragments might have been
considered a suitable canopy a spring bubbled up from among these mossy
ruins giving nourishment to a thick growth of brambles and weeds which
added their own tangled covert to the stouter shelter of the rocks and
trunks into this nook the party guided by botello to whom it seemed
not unfamiliar penetrated forthwith and here they found themselves in
a great measure sheltered from the rain here also taking advantage of
a period of inactivity and at the instigation of don amador who
perceived with solicitude the visage of the secretary covered not only
with languor but flushed with fatigue and fever the enchanter set
about relieving the distresses of the youth he removed the bandage and
garment examined the wound bathed the inflamed member in the cool
waters of the fountain and having thus commenced proceedings with so
reasonable a preliminary he drew a little silver vessel from his
wallet containing the unguent blessed as he had before said of the
fat of a pagan's heart and which as may be repeated to those who
might doubt the efficacy of so remarkable a compound was not only much
used but highly commended by the christian soldiers of that day in
america the magician commanded fabueno to repeat a paternoster as
slowly and devoutly as possible for none of botello's conjurations
were conducted without the appearance of deep devotion and mumbling
himself another or perhaps repeating some superstitious invocation he
applied the ointment previously spread over green leaves to the wound
and when it was again bound up the secretary declared its anguish was
much mitigated as well as his whole body greatly refreshed

don amador regarded the youth for a moment with much grave kindness and
then said 

i owe this man so much gratitude for the good he seems to have and
doubtless has done thee whom i now fabueno at least until i can
receive instructions from my kinsman the admiral must esteem as being
my ward and follower that i am unwilling to offend him by seeming to
throw any discredit on his remedy nevertheless i am not less bound to
instruct thee with counsel than to repay him with thanks for which
reason i must charge thee to remember that when any miracle of a very
unusual or unnecessary character is wrought upon thyself much more of
it may possibly be the product of thine own imagination than of that
agent which seems to thee to be the only cause

faith will work miracles but fancy will not said botello gravely

if i were a better philosopher good botello said don amador i
would attempt to show thee how that which thou callest faith is in
such a case as this nothing but imagination in very fervent action
differing as much from that calm assurance which constitutes true faith
as doth a potter's pitcher gilded to resemble true gold from a golden
pitcher which difference in the latter case may be instantly
detected by ringing them and here i may tell thee botello by way of
continuing the figure that as the earthen vessel will really tinkle
more pleasantly than the vessel of gold so also will the excited
imagination give forth a sound so much more captivating than the
tranquil utterance of belief that in attempting to distinguish between
them men are often seduced into error nevertheless i will not quarrel
with thee on this subject for i perceive thou art religious and what
thy religion does not blame in thee i have no right to censure

this was a degree of liberality doubtless produced rather by the amiable
feeling of gratitude than any natural tolerance of disposition or
education for the neophyte was in all respects a representative of the
nobler spirits of his age in whom the good qualities inherited from
nature were dashed and sometimes marred by the tenets of a bad
philosophy




chapter xv


this discourse of the novice together with the magical unction of the
wound occupied so much time that when it was finished the storm had
in a great measure passed away and botello either feeling his
inability to reply to it with an allegory of equal beauty or despairing
to overcome the scepticism of the cavalier instead of answering rose
from his seat and led the way to the post on the hill-side which they
had lately deserted

drops of rain still occasionally fell from the heavens or were whirled
by the passing gusts from the boughs the clouds still careered
menacingly in the atmosphere and though the sunbeams ever and anon
burst through their rent sides and glimmered with splendour on the
shivered tops and lacerated roots of many a fallen tree it was still
doubtful at what moment the capricious elements might resume their
conflict the river that was before a brook now rolled along a turbid
torrent and seemed every moment to augment in volume and fury as its
short-lived tributaries poured down their foaming treasures from the
hills  

the boy to his bed and the fool to his fire-side cried the
enchanter with a sudden exultation as pointing down the hill he
disclosed to the cavalier the valley deprived of its late visiters the
armed men of cadmus had not risen from the soil with a more magical
celerity than had the soldiers of narvaez vanished the valley was
silent and solitary i said the tempest should open for us a path
continued botello and lo the spirit which was given to me does not
lie

i must confess quoth don amador with surprise you have in this
instance as in several others verified your prediction what juggler's
trick is this where is the hound narvaez

galloping back to zempoala to amuse himself with the dancers on the
pyramid said botello with a grin of saturnine delight he came out
against cortes and his heart failed him in the tempest he loves
better and so do his people the comfort of the temple than the strife
of these tropical elements wo be to him who would contend with a strong
man when he hides his head from the shower he shall vapour in the
morning but tremble when the enemy comes to him in dreams

and i am to understand then said amador with a voice of high scorn
and displeasure that these effeminate hinds after drawing out their
forces in the face of an enemy have taken to their heels like village
girls in a summer festival at the dashing of rain

it is even so said botello they are now hiding themselves in their
quarters while those veterans who awaited them beyond the river stand
yet to their arms and blush even to look for the shelter of a tree

let us descend then said the cavalier and join them without delay
for i believe those men of cortes are true soldiers and i long to make
their acquaintance

it is needful we do so and that quickly said the astrologer for
this river though by midnight it shall again be shrunk to a fairy
brook will in an hour be impassable

it required not many moments to convey the party to the banks of the
stream but when they had reached it it was apparent it could not be
forded without peril its channel was wild and rocky fallen and
shivered trees fringed its borders with a bristling net-work over and
among which the current raved with a noisy turbulence the cavalier
regarded it with solicitude but perceiving that the magician was urging
his horse into it without hesitation he prepared forthwith to follow
his example he saw however that the secretary faltered and feeling
as much pity for his inexperience as commiseration for the helplessness
to which as he supposed the arrow-hurt had reduced him he rode up to
him with words of comfort and encouragement

thou perceivest he said that botello goes into the water without
fear thou shall pass lorenzo without danger for besides placing
lazaro on one side of thee i will myself take station on the other if
thou shouldst by any mischance find thyself out of depth all that
thou canst do will be to trust the matter to thy horse who is
doubtless too sagacious to thrust himself into any superfluous jeopardy
be of good heart this is a small matter thou wilt one day perhaps if
thou continuest to desire the life and fame of a soldier have to pass a
more raging torrent than this and that too in the teeth of an enemy

the secretary blushed at his fears and willing to retrieve his
character dashed into the flood with an alacrity that carried him
beyond his patron for a moment he advanced steadily and securely at
the heels of botello but becoming alarmed at the sight of a tree
surging down towards him he veered a little from the direction and
instantly found his horse swimming under him before lazaro or the
cavalier could approach to his aid his discomposure got so much the
better of his discretion that he began to jerk and pull at the reins
in such a manner as to infuse some of his own disorder into the steed
don amador beheld the sorrel nag not only plunging and rearing in the
water but turning his head down the stream and swimming with the
current

give thy horse the reins and perplex him not lorenzo he cried
urging the dauntless fogoso to his rescue jerk not pull not or thou
wilt be in great danger

but before the secretary could obey the voice of don amador and before
the latter could reach him the hand of lazaro had grasped the bridle
and turned the animal's head to the bank

suppose thou wert in the midst of a company of fighting spearmen
instead of this spluttering gutter said the man-at-arms in his ear
wouldst thou distract thy beast in this school-boy fashion

the contemptuous composure of the soldier did more to restore the
spirits of fabueno than the counsels of the cavalier and yielding up
the guidance of himself as well as his animal to lazaro he was soon
out of danger

in the meanwhile don amador in his hurry to give the secretary relief
had taken so little note of his own situation that when he beheld his
ward in safety he discovered that he was himself even more disagreeably
situated a few yards below him was a cluster of rocks against which
as he discerned at a glance it would be fatal to be dashed but which
he saw not how he could avoid inasmuch as the bank above them was so
palisaded by the sharp and jutting boughs of a prostrate tree that it
seemed impossible he could effect a landing there while balancing in
doubt at a time when doubt as he well knew was jeopardy he heard a
voice suddenly crying to him from the bank

what ho señor holla ware the rocks and spur on your hope is in
the tree-top

while don amador instinctively obeyed this command and urged his steed
full towards the threatening branches he raised his head and perceived
a cavalier on a dun horse riding into the water above the rocks hard by
the tree as if to convince him of the practicability of the passage
and the shallowness of the water this unknown auxiliary stretched forth
his hand and doing to amador the service rendered by lazaro to the
secretary the neophyte instantly found himself in safety and ascending
the bank of the river not till his charge was on dry land did the
stranger relax his hand and then perhaps the sooner that don amador
seized it with a most cordial gripe and while he held it said
fervently 

i swear to thee cavalier i believe thou hast saved me from a great
danger if thou hast not absolutely preserved my life for which good
deed besides giving thee my most unfeigned present thanks i avow
myself till the day of my death enslaved under the necessity to
requite thee with any honourable risk thou canst hereafter impose

while don amador spoke he perused the countenance and surveyed the
figure of his deliverer he was a man in the prime and midway of life
tall and long-limbed but with a breadth of shoulders and development of
muscle that proved him as did the grasp with which he assisted the
war-horse from the flood to possess great bodily strength his face was
handsome and manly though with rather delicate features and a very
lofty and capacious forehead shone among thin black locks and under a
velvet cap worn in a negligent manner with a medal of a saint draggling
loosely from it his beard was black and thin like his hair and amador
plainly perceived through it the scar of a sword-cut between the chin
and mouth his garments were of a fine and dark cloth without much
ornament but his fanfarrona as it was called in the language of the
cavaliers was a gold chain of at least thrice the weight and bigness of
the neophyte's linked round his neck and supporting a pendant of
christ and the virgin and in addition don amador saw on a finger of
the hand he grasped a diamond ring of goodly size and lustre such was
the valiant gentleman who won the friendship of the neophyte not less
by his ready good will than by his excellent appearance although this
last qualification was perhaps not displayed to advantage inasmuch as
his whole attire and equipments as well as the skin and armour of his
horse were dripping with wet as if both had been lately plunged into
the river or exposed to all the rigour of the storm he replied to don
amador's courtesies with a frank and open countenance and a laugh of
good humour as if entirely unconscious of any discomfort from his
reeking condition or of any merit in the service he had rendered

i accept thy offers of friendship he said and very heartily señor
but i vow to thee when i helped thee out of the stream i thought i
should have had to give thee battle the next moment as a sworn friend
of don panfilo the biscayan

how little justice there was in that suspicion said amador you will
know when i tell you that at this moment next to the satisfaction of
finding some opportunity to requite your true service i know of no
greater pleasure the saints could send me than a fair opportunity to
cross swords with this ill-mannered general in serious and mortal
arbitrement know señor i am at this moment a captive escaped out of
the hands of that most dishonourable and unworthy person seeking my
way with my followers under guidance of a certain conjurer called
botello to the camp of the valiant señor don hernan cortes and i rejoice
in this rencounter the more because i am persuaded you are yourself a
true friend of that much-respected commander

ay by my conscience you may say so cried the blithe cavalier and
i would to heaven cortes had many more friends that love him so well as
my self but come señor you are hard by his head-quarters yet under
favour let us before seeking them say a word to botello who with
your people i perceive has crossed the river

a few steps of their horses brought the two cavaliers into contact with
the travellers with whom don amador beheld some half-a-dozen strangers
all of hidalgo appearance on horseback and dripping with wet like his
new friend but unlike him armed to the teeth with helm mail and
buckler

how now botello mi querido he cried as he rode in among the
party what news from my brother narvaez and what conjuration wert
thou enacting while he was scampering away before the bad weather

nothing but good señor said botello baring his head and bending it
to the saddle

the neophyte was surprised at this mark of homage in the enchanter whom
he had found though neither rude nor presumptuous not over-burthened
with servility looking round to the other hidalgos he discovered that
they all kept their eyes upon his companion with looks of the deepest
respect at the same moment and as the truth entered his mind he
caught the eye of his deliverer and perceived at once in this stately
though unarmed cavalier the person of the renowned cortes himself for
a moment it seemed as if the general were disposed to meet the
disclosure with a grave and lofty deportment suitable to his rank but
as don amador raised his hand to his casque with a gesture of reverence
a smile crept over his visage which was instantly succeeded by a
good-humoured and familiar laugh

thou seest señor he cried we will be masking at times even
without much regard either for our enemies or the weather but trust me
caballero you are welcome and doubtless not only to myself but to
these worthier gentlemen my friends and here the general pronounced
the names of sandoval of de morla of de leon de olid and
others all as was afterwards proved men of great note among the
invaders of mexico the neophyte saluted them with courtesy and then
turning to the general said 

i am myself called amador de leste a poor hidalgo of cuenza a novice
of the order of st john of the holy hospital and kinsman of the knight
gines gabriel de calavar to seek whom am i come to this land of mexico
and to the tents of your excellency

all bowed with great respect at this annunciation and cortes himself
half raising his drooping cap said 

i doubly welcome the cavalier de leste and whether he come to honour
me with the aid of his good sword or to rob me of the true friendship
of the knight calavar still am i most glad to see him and glad am i
that heaven has sent us a kinsman to watch by the side of the good
knight señor continued the general anticipating the questions of the
neophyte if you will moderate your impatience a little until i fulfil
my duties with my mad friend here the astrologer i will be rejoiced in
person to conduct you to your kinsman

the courteous manners of hernan cortes did more to mollify the ardour of
the novice than could any degree of stateliness he smothered his
impatience though it was burning with a stronger and an increasing
flame while the general proceeded to confer with the magician

how is it magico mio he cried i had a deserter this morning who
told me thou hadst been entrapped that my brother narvaez had
cudgelled thee with his own hands and had some thoughts of hanging
thee

such is in part the truth said botello tranquilly he was
incensed at the stars and struck me with his foot because the spirit
of the crystal gave not an answer to his liking

ay indeed cried cortes curiously and kalidon hath been speaking
to him what said kalidon-sadabath of narvaez

he said that to-night replied botello with his most solemn
emphasis the foot of cortes should be on the pyramid and that
to-morrow the biscayan should do homage to his rival

ay and kalidon told him all this said cortes quickly and as
amador thought angrily

he told only that which it was fitting the biscayan should know said
botello significantly he told him that which brought his forces into
the field to-day so that they shall sleep more soundly for their
labours to-night and yet he told him no blow should be struck in the
field he showed him many such things but he told him not in manner as
it was written in the heaven and figured in the stone that to-night
should his enemy creep upon him as he slept blind and besotted and
while his best friends guided the assailant to his bed-side

ay by my conscience cried cortes turning with meaning looks to his
companions this kalidon reads men's thoughts for it was but an half
hour since when i beheld these delicate warriors turning their backs to
the gust that i vowed in my heart i would to-night give them a
lesson for their folly what thinkest thou son sandoval will thy
sun-burnt lazy fellows of the rich city march to zempoala by night

ay by night or by day whenever they are bidden said the
sententious stripling who at this early period of the campaign and of
his life was not only the favourite of the general but his second in
fame as don amador listened to his rough voice and surveyed his bold
and frank countenance adorned with a curly beard and hair both of amber
hue he bethought him of the story of the heralds summoning him to
surrender his post into their hands and receiving an answer which they
digested in the nets of the tlamémé on the road to tenochtitlan

and thou juan velasquez de leon said the general turning to a young
and powerfully framed cavalier with a red beard and fierce countenance
who besides being clad in a heavier coat of mail than any other
present was more bountifully bedecked with golden chains and who sat
on a noble gray mare what sayest thou wilt thou play me a bout with
narvaez the captain of thy kinsman the governor velasquez

ay by my beard i will replied de leon with a thick ferocious
voice suiting the action to the word and wringing the rain-drops from
the beard he had invoked for though i love the governor i love not
his dog and if this godly enchanter will assure me the stars are
favourable to the enterprise i will be the last man to say our two
hundred and fifty men are no match for the thousand curs that bark at
the heels of the biscayan

it is written that if we attack to-night we shall prevail said
botello

if i am permitted to say anything in a matter of such importance
said the neophyte i can aver that if the people of narvaez design to
revel away this night as they did the last their commanders trifling
with jugglers and rope-dancers their guards sleeping on their posts or
straying away into the suburbs as we discovered them when we escaped at
dawn it is an opinion which i formed on the spot that some ten or
fifteen score of resolute men may take them by surprise and utterly
vanquish them

i respect the opinion of don amador said cortes as well as the
counsels of kalidon-sadabath and the stars which have never yet told me
a falsehood but how comes it botello hast thou been flying since
dawn i cannot understand the necessity thou wert under to lead my
worthy friend don amador so long a ramble and moreover i perceive that
though yesterday thou wert constrained to trudge upon foot thou art
to-day master of a steed that may almost compare with motacila the
wag-tail of my son sandoval

i stole the beast from the captain of the watch salvatierra while he
kept guard over us at some distance in the fields said the magician
while all the cavaliers laughed heartily at the explanation and as
for the long day's travel when i found myself upon a good horse i
thought i could do no better than give the alarm and draw a party in
pursuit and so entangle them among the woods or wear them out with
fatigue that they should make little opposition when we came to attack
their comrades at midnight

a shrewd and most laudable device cried cortes with unconcealed
delight i have ever found thee as good a soldier as astrologer and if
the fates be as favourable to thee as i am myself botello i can
promise thee many an acre of maize fields or gold mountains to
recompense thy services

it must be as it is written said botello gravely many a peril
shall encompass me but i know that in the worst as it has been
revealed to me i shall be rescued out of it on the wings of eagles

amen cried cortes for the day of miracles is not over if the
señor de leste he continued claim to discharge his just anger for
his imprisonment on my brother narvaez i will invite him to such a post
of honour as shall be most likely to gratify his longings and after
that if my very noble friend be inclined to exercise some of that skill
in naval warfare which he has doubtless acquired among the knights of
rhodes i will rejoice to entrust to him the attack upon the fleet of
cavallero

señor said amador though i burn to assist you in the attack on
narvaez i must first receive the command of my knight don gabriel i am
not so eager to draw sword upon the admiral for know valiant don
hernan i have discovered in cavallero a kinsman of my mother and
señor continued the neophyte i am now reminded of a message which he
charged me to deliver to your excellency wherein he begs to assure you
that though fate has arrayed him as your enemy he cannot forget the
friendship of his former life

ay cried cortes briskly does the excellent admiral say me that

he bade me also avow to you that though it became him not as an
officer of velasquez to hold any communications with you except those
of simple form and courtesy he should be well rejoiced when heaven has
removed the obstruction and left him at liberty to meet you with former
friendship and confidence

by my conscience cried the general turning to his officers and
exchanging meaning and joyous glances with them though these be
tidings which kalidon hath not revealed yet are they of such pleasant
import that i shall ever thank don amador for being the bearer of them
eh my masters he exclaimed did i not tell you when we left
tenochtitlan in gloom we should return to it in merriment that when we
sank our rotten fleet among the surges of villa rica heaven should send
us another and a better let us move on and spread these good news
through the camp  

the neophyte perceived by the exultation of the general that he had
been in a manner cajoled by cavallero but he was not sorry to think his
kinsman should rather prefer to command his fleet as the ally of cortes
than as the friend of narvaez




chapter xvi


the sun was declining fast when the travellers made their way to the
camp of cortes the river of canoes ran through a fertile valley but
this was of no great extent and towards its upper termination the
scene of the events of the day it was arid and broken with rocks
immediately beyond the river in a place made strong by rocks and
bushes impenetrable to cavalry and affording the safest covert to his
arquebusiers and crossbowmen the wary rival of narvaez had pitched his
quarters temporary huts of boughs and fresh-woven mats were seen
withering among the green shadows and from these ascended the smoke of
fires at which the soldiers were dressing their evening meal but in
advance of this primitive encampment dripping with rain like their
commanders yet standing to their arms with a patient and grave
constancy as if still in readiness for an enemy don amador beheld the
forces of cortes they had a weather-beaten and veteran appearance most
of them were apparelled in the escaupil cut in separate pieces
resembling cumbrous plate-armour and occasionally so hacked by the
weapons of the natives that the white lining gaped out somewhat
ludicrously from its darker covering those arrayed in a better
investment had their morions and breast-plates commonly covered with
rust as if kept too much occupied with perils by night and day to allow
leisure for burnishing them nevertheless they looked like disciplined
and experienced soldiers amador observed that few of them had
fire-arms the cross-bow the sword and the great lance of chinantla
with its long double head of bright copper were almost their only arms
but they handled them as if well acquainted with their value behind
this advanced guard under the shelter of the rocks and bushes he
remarked several officers a few of them mounted as well as divers
groups of indian menials and as his ear caught a low exclamation from
the general he turned his eyes and beheld the object of his long and
painful search

under the shadow of a tall tree remote from the rest and attended only
by a single armed follower on a coal-black horse heavily harnessed
which stood under his weight with a tranquillity as marble-like as his
own sat the knight of calavar he was in full armour but the iron
plates were rusted on his body and in many places shattered the plumes
were broken and disordered on his helmet the spear lay at the feet of
his steed his buckler was in the hands of his attendant and instead of
the red tabard which was worn in a season of war by the brothers of his
order the black mantle of peace with its great white cross hung or
drooped heavily from his shoulders his beaver was up and his
countenance wan and even ghastly was fully revealed the ravages of an
untimely age were imprinted upon his aspect yet notwithstanding the
hollow cheeks and grizzled beard the brow furrowed with a thousand
wrinkles the lips colourless and contracted into an expression of deep
pain he presented the appearance of a ruin majestic in its decay his
hands were clasped and lay on the pommel of the saddle and together
with his whole attitude and air indicated a state of the most profound
and sorrowful abstraction in truth he seemed the prey of thoughts
many and deep and it scarcely needed the simple and touching legend
miserere mei deus which usurped the place of a scutcheon or other
device on his shield to know that if fame sat on his saddle sorrow
rested under his bosom

no sooner had the neophyte beheld this gloomy apparition than with a
loud cry he threw himself from his horse and rushing forward he
seized the relaxed hand of the figure and pressed it to his lips with
reverence and affection but the knight not yet roused from his revery
or struggling vainly with imperfect recollections looked only into his
face with a wistful stare

patron and cousin my friend and my father cried the novice
passionately do you not know me i am amador

amador muttered the knight with a troubled look and a tone of
perplexity very well to-morrow to-morrow

he will not understand you now said the general he is often in
these trances

mi padre mi amigo cried the youth vehemently without regarding the
interruption of the commander will you not know me i am amador
look here is baltasar old baltasar your servant and favourite that
has been at your side ever from the days of the alpujarras to the fall
of rhodes

the alpujarras echoed the knight with a deep sigh wo is
me miserere mei deus

he will recollect us now said baltasar who had also descended and
who testified his fidelity by a tear that glittered in his ancient eye
i never knew that word fail to call him out of his mood though i have
often known it fling him into one master i am baltasar and here is
your honour's kinsman don amador

ay is it so indeed i thought i was dreaming said the knight art
thou here indeed my son amador give me thy brows for i am rejoiced to
find thee in the world again and stooping and flinging his arms round
his neck he kissed the forehead of the neophyte with a parental
affection

this my masters said cortes in an under voice is not a spectacle
for us let us pass on and arrange proceedings for the attack and
with his suite he instantly departed

and how dost thou prosper at almeria continued calavar mildly and
without any incoherence of manner though it was evident his thoughts
were far away hast thou found me any brave hearts who will march with
me against the infidels of barbary

dear knight and patron said amador we are not now in spain but in
the heathen lands of mexico

ay dios mio i had forgotten that said don gabriel with a
bewildered air

whither i have come said the novice to beg your pardon for my
negligence and desertion and never more to part from your side

i remember me now said the knight slowly and sadly wo is me a
sore infirmity is on my brain and sometimes i am not master of my own
acts but i remember thee my friend i remember that in an evil hour
of forgetfulness i forsook thee to come to this unknown land but i
beg thy pardon my son the dark mood took me from thee and in truth i
knew it not

the tears came into the eyes of amador as he listened to the
self-accusation of his kinsman and remembered how much the blame should
rest on his own momentary defection

it is i that must bear the reproach and i that must look for
forgiveness he cried but i will never need to be rebuked or forgiven
again for i swear dear kinsman i will follow thee truly now until my
death

and thou hast left the fair hills of spain thy true friends and thy
lady-love said calavar with a mournful voice to follow me over the
wide seas and the hostile deserts i welcome thee with gratitude for
thy love is great and thy task will be bitter i welcome thee well
amador but surely it is with sorrow for i heard thou hadst won the
love of a noble and virtuous lady and heaven forbid i should not lament
to sever thee in thy youth from the enjoyment of thy affection

a flush of shame and pain mantled the countenance of the devoted novice
as he replied 

i confess i have much need of thy forbearance dear knight but they
did me wrong who said i could forget thee for the love of woman i
acknowledge no duty that is not to thee and no passion but that of
serving thee with constancy and truth but i am sent to thee not more by
the impulses of my own love than by the commands of his most eminent
highness the grand master who leaves it to thyself as a well-beloved
and much-trusted follower of the holy order whether thou wilt remain
fighting the infidels of this new world or return at thy pleasure to
the island malta which his majesty the king and emperor don carlos of
spain and austria hath promised to bestow upon the good knights the
defenders of christendom

among the infidels of the new world then said calavar casting his
eyes meekly to heaven for i know that what poor service i may yet
render the faith must be rendered soon and if god uphold me i will
render it truly and well but thou amador my son my faithful and my
beloved i adjure thee that when my task is finished thou return to
the land of thy birth and give thyself to a life of virtue and if
possible of peace watch well the creatures that are in thy breast for
among them are devils which if thou do not chain them will rend thee
check thy wrath fetter thy fury continued the knight vehemently
and when thou drawest thy sword call on god that it may not fall
unjustly for when blood is shed that should not have been shed it
lives on the soul for ever ay de mi miserere mei deus

don amador feared as he listened with a superstitious reverence to the
adjurations of the knight that he was about to relapse into his gloomy
stupor but he was deceived the lips of calavar muttered on for a
moment as if continuing to repeat the solemn and impassioned appeal of
the psalmist and then making the sign of the cross on his breast he
turned again to the novice with a kind of dismal cheer and said 

i welcome thee again to this land amador and baltasar what now
baltasar is it possible i should forget thee i am glad to look upon
thy loyal countenance thine old friend marco will rejoice to fight
again at thy side if i do not err this is thy henchman lazaro i
greet thee well lazaro be very true to thy master and forget not thy
religion and this youth that rests behind thee if he be thy follower
my son he shall share thy welcome

i recommend the youth fabueno to thy kindness said amador well
pleased to perceive his kinsman so collected he is the secretary of
the admiral cavallero who claims to be related to your honour and
sends you the assurance of his love i have been constrained without
yet knowing the pleasure of his excellency to receive the youth into
my protection and this i did the more cheerfully that he was my
fellow-sufferer in the camp of narvaez and did for my sake very
courageously expose himself to the painful shot of a cross-bow which
now maims his right arm

if he have suffered for thee my friend i will not forget him said
the knight and i am rejoiced for his sake that now in this season of
peace we may cure his wound before we call upon him to endure another

the countenance of don amador fell he thought the knight's dream of
peace denoted that he was sinking again into abstraction

call this not the season of peace he cried the commander cortes is
resolute to fall upon his enemy narvaez the enemy of honour and it
needs we should burnish up our arms to give him help

calavar looked seriously at the youth and touching his black mantle
with an expressive gesture said 

it is the time of peace my son the time of peace for those that
follow the good st john i remember me now that cortes came down from
the mountains to fight the man narvaez and his host but these are not
infidels but christians

cousin said the cavalier warmly though this man have the name yet
do i very much doubt if he possess any of the religion of a christian
and i have to assure you i have endured such causeless indignities at
his hands such as direct insult violent seizure and shameful
imprisonment as can only be washed away with his blood

wo's me wo's me cried the knight the blood that is poured in
anger will not flow like water it will not dry like water nor will
water though blessed by the holy priest in the church wash its crust
from the hand thou seest he cried extending his gauntleted member
and gazing piteously into the face of his heated kinsman thou seest
that though for thrice five years i have washed it in brook and font
in the river that flows from the land of the cross and in the brine of
the sea it oozes still from between the scales like a well that must
trickle for ever and will not be hidden thou art very wroth with me
heaven miserere mei domine

don amador was greatly shocked and grieved that his imprudent obstinacy
had so nearly again recalled the distraction of his kinsman but it
needed not many expressions of gentleness and submission to divert the
current of his thoughts the appearance of the young and devoted
follower had come to the spirit of the penitent knight like a cool
breeze over the temples of a fevered man and having once been roused
from his gloom he could not be long insensible to the excitement of his
presence he cast an eye of kindness and affection on the youth and
obeying as one who had been long accustomed to such control the humble
suggestion of marco he turned to the tents of the encampment

 




chapter xvii


the sun had not yet set when the ray stealing through the vapours that
gathered among the distant peaks beheld the señor cortes and his little
army crossing the river of canoes a quarter-league above his encampment
was the very ford which had given him passage when with a force short
of five hundred men and a few score of wild totonacs taken with him
less as warlike auxiliaries than as beasts of burthen and hostages for
the fidelity of their tribe he set out to cross mountains of snow and
fire rocky deserts and foaming rivers in the invasion of an empire
whose limits as well as its resources and power were utterly unknown
here the stream was more shallow than at that spot where it had been the
fate of don amador to ford it the flood had also in a measure
subsided and while the mounted individuals passed it with ease the
waters came not above the breasts of the footmen don amador rode at the
side of his knight and though chafing with discontent at the thought
that he should share no part in the brave deeds of the coming night and
be but a looker-on while strangers were robbing him of his vengeance
yet did he conceal his troubles lest the exhibition of them should give
new pain to his unhappy kinsman the three attendants were behind and
fabueno though evidently regarding the knight calavar with a deep and
superstitious awe rode not far from his patron

the rivulet was crossed and the hardy desperadoes who were now marching
with spears to attack a foe of five times their own number fortified
with cannon on an eminence gathered about their leader as he sat his
horse on the bank as if expecting his final instructions and
encouragement he surveyed them not only with gravity but with
complacency and smiling as if in derision of their weakness for they
did not number much over two hundred and fifty men he said with
inimitable dryness 

my good friends and companions you are now about to fight a battle
the issue of which will depend very much on your own conduct and i have
to inform you that if as seems reasonable enough you are vanquished
there is not a man of you that shall not hang at some corner of zempoala
to-morrow

a murmur running through the whole crew marked the disgust of all at
this unsavoury exordium

the reasons for this opinion continued the leader gravely both as
to the probable fate of the battle and of yourselves in the event of
your being beaten i shall have no trouble in speaking only that like
one who knows how to use the butt as well as the blade of his lance i
shall discourse first of the hinder part of my argument that is to say
of the very great certainty with which a gibbet shall reward every man
who this night handles his weapon too tenderly know then my good
brothers that at this moment though you very loyally and truly avow
yourselves the soldiers of his majesty our king and master it hath
somehow entered into the head of the general narvaez the lieutenant of
his majesty's governor to consider you as villain rebels and
traitors an imputation so exceedingly preposterous and eccentric
that were we in a christian land you should not be required to deny
it but standing as you do with no better present judge than your
accuser it is certain your innocence could not be made apparent to his
majesty until after the gallinazas had picked the last morsel from your
bones at which time as i think you will agree with me a declaration
of your true loyalty would not be a matter of much consequence to any of
you

again a murmur accompanied by sundry ferocious looks and savage
interjections testified the discontent of the adventurers

what i say is the truth continued cortes adopting the scowl which
darkened the visages of all extending his drawn sabre above his head
and speaking with a fierce and resolute indignation in the face of
that heaven which has seen us for its honour and glory devote
ourselves to pain and peril landing friendless and unaided save by its
own divine countenance on the shores of bitter and murderous
barbarians overthrowing their bloody idols and even in the chief
sanctuaries of their diabolic superstition on the palaces of their
emperors and the pyramids of their gods erecting the standard of the
crucified saviour i say even in the face of that heaven that has seen
us do these things that will immortalize us on earth and glorify us in
heaven the man narvaez has dared to call us traitors to our king and
faith has denounced us more as infidel moors than as christian
spaniards and declaring war upon us with sword fire and free rope
has sworn to give us to the death of caitiffs and felons

the answer to this passionate appeal was loud and furious the
cavaliers clashed their swords upon their bucklers the footmen drove
their spears into the soil and foaming with rage swore they would
thus answer the calumny in the heart of their enemy

does it need i should give you more proof of the bloody and insolent
violence of narvaez said the general he hath set a price upon my
head and on the head of my loyal friend sandoval as though we were
vile bandits and assassins

what needs more words cried the young captain thus referred to he
shall have my head for the three thousand crowns if he can take it

how it happens he has not thought any other head in this company worth
buying said the commander with an adroit bitterness is an insult he
must himself explain

there was not a cavalier present that did not swear in his heart he
would avenge such forbearance with the full swing of his weapon

it must be now manifest continued cortes with composure that
defeat will be the warrant and assurance of a gallows-death to all that
may render themselves prisoners and having convinced you of this i may
now betake me to the first article of my discourse as one that concerns
the possibility of your defeat it is quite probable he went on to
say with an irony more effectual than the most encouraging argument of
hope that being but two hundred and fifty strong and enfeebled by
your divers battles with the tlascalans and the knavish herds of
cholula you will be easily beaten by a thousand men who besides being
fond of the valiant diversions of indian dancers and the martial
delights of house shelter and soft beds have hardened their bodies and
perfected their knowledge of arms among the plantain patches of cuba
and who in addition are of so magnanimous a turn that they would the
half of them at this moment rather join your ranks than draw sword
against you but why do i talk thus a live dog is better than a dead
lion and a score of waking men better than a hundred sleepers know
then ye grumbling and incensed companions if ye will conquer this
man that comes with a rope ye may botello hath shown me how the stars
are propitious and how the spirit of the crystal hath promised us
success heaven fights on our side for we fight for heaven st paul
will be with us for we contend for the privilege to convert the
heathen and santiago will not forget us for with every thrust of our
spears we strike a brave blow for spain

let us on cried all with a shout of exultation we will conquer

nay cried the general with a mock discretion rush not too eagerly
on danger let us wait a day for those two thousand brown varlets of
chinantla whom the loitering barrientos conducts hitherward for though
it be somewhat dishonourable to share a triumph with indian soldiers
yet will they doubtless make that triumph the more certain

we will win it ourselves cried the excited desperadoes

ye will have hotter work than ye think said cortes and surely i
believe ye will take to your heels like the old arrowauks of cuba
leaving me to die at the pyramid for i swear you if ye force me to
conduct you to zempoala i will not come from it alive unless as its
master

let it be proclaimed death to any one that turns his back cried an
hundred voices

ay then ye mad valiant rogues ye shall have your wish cried cortes
yielding to an excitement he had not easily suppressed rising in his
stirrups and looking round him with that fiery and fanatical enthusiasm
which was the true secret of his greatness and which left him not for a
moment even in the darkest and most perilous hour of his enterprise we
will march to zempoala with god in our hearts and the name of the holy
spirit on our lips and remembering that under such influence we
scattered the tens of thousands that beset us on the plains of
tlascala we will show this dog of a biscayan what it is to oppose the
arms of heaven amen

and amen was uttered fiercely and frantically by the adventurers as
they prepared to follow their leader but a wave of his hand checked
their ardour for a moment a few words explained the order of attack
and the duties of the several leaders of whom the young sandoval was
appointed to the most honourable and dangerous task to seize the
artillery by a coup-de-main and thus give passage for de leon in the
assault of the towers while cortes himself should stand by with a
chosen body of reserve to witness the valour of his captains and give
assistance where it might be needed again when the announcement of
these orders seemed to have taken the restraint from the ardour of his
followers the general checked them a huge and rugged cross of
cotton-wood raised its mouldering bulk before them on their path a
holy landmark raised by the piety of the invader nine months before
while on his march to tenochtitlan

under the cross will we commend ourselves to god and prepare ourselves
for battle said the leader riding forward and dismounting his
example was followed by all the cavaliers who together with the
footmen knelt upon the dank grass and baring their heads prepared for
the rites of penitence and absolution none knelt with a more devout
submission than the knight of calavar none exposed with more humility
their youthful heads to the evening breeze than did he his
silver-touched locks and withered temples and none as the holy
chaplain dictated the act of general confession and contrition echoed
his words with a more fervent sincerity under the rude crucifix in the
desert knelt those men who were about to imbrue their hands in blood
and that the blood of their countrymen

the words of penitence were said the rite of absolution pronounced and
the followers of cortes rose to their feet with their hearts full of
conquest but before the helm was buckled and the horse mounted there
came on the twilight air from the towers of zempoala the sound of the
vesper-bell of narvaez

it is long since we have worshipped at the sound of a christian bell
said cortes again flinging himself on his knees god speaks to us in
the omen we have not forgotten among infidel savages that we are
christians

as if those tones were rung in the chapel of a brother instead of the
barracks of an enemy and as if to join that enemy in one act of piety
before springing upon him sword in hand all again knelt down and the
ave-marias of two hostile armies on the brink of engagement went up to
heaven together




chapter xviii


hard by to the town of zempoala ran a little brook coursing through
agreeable meadows and here and there skirted by green forests in a
wood that overshadowed this current but at the distance of a quarter
league from it lay concealed the forces of hernan cortes waiting
patiently for the time when the squadrons of narvaez satiated with the
sports of their tawny neighbours should additionally recompense the
exploits of the day with the oblivion of slumber they had watched with
contempt and with joy for they perceived in such spectacle a symptom
of the infatuated security of their enemies the great fire that
lighted the diversions of the evening blazing on the pyramid until it
began to die away as did many of the sounds of revelry that in the
still hour of the night were borne to their ears but it was not until
their spies brought word that the last brand was flinging its decaying
lustre over the eaves of the towers that they were bidden to arise
cross the stream and array for battle

in deep silence for they knew there were sentinels on the path they
reached and forded the rivulet trooper and footman passed over and
were ranked under their several leaders and all seemed in readiness for
the assault

still however the knight of calavar sat motionless on his sable steed
as if all unaware of the tempest of war that was brewing and don amador
beheld with a pang of unutterable grief and vexation the departure of
those bold spirits to the scene of strife and honour in which he was to
have no share as he sat fuming and frowning now on the point of urging
his kinsman for permission to follow now reproaching himself in bitter
reprehension as if the unuttered wish might recall some of those
thoughts of misery which so often perplexed the brain of the crazed
knight he heard the foot-fall of a horse and perceived a cavalier
riding towards him to his grief was superadded a pang of shame as he
saw in this individual the person of cortes himself and conceived the
object of his return

i am loath to see that the noble calavar still abides by the black
mantle he said as if content to waste no arguments on the knight
but if the very valiant don amador de leste be desirous to repay upon
narvaez the injuries done to his honour or if he be minded to bestow
upon me that great favour whereof he spoke on the river of canoes there
can never come a better opportunity than this present and for the
services he may render me personally as well as a most loyal cause
this night by leading his followers with me to the pyramid i shall
ever remain in thankful remembrance

the words stuck in the throat of the novice as he replied i am the
slave of my kinsman i burn to follow you but my knight must command

he turned to calavar with a look of despair but the night which
concealed it from the eye could not preserve the reproach from the ear

stay thou by my side amador my son said calavar sorrowfully and
let no man that follows thee or me think to draw his sword this night
for we are the followers of st john and may not contend with a
christian except in self-preservation

god shield thee sir knight cried the general anxiously every man
who strikes with us to-night strikes for his own life victory
preserves us and defeat conducts us to the scaffold and i am free to
confess to thee what i dared not speak to my companions that unless
every man does his duty and god looks kindly upon all i know not how
soon we may be under the foot of our enemy

i have not refused thee my sword said the knight calmly when an
infidel stood in thy path nor will i when such opposition is again
made

but thy noble and valiant kinsman and thy people said the general
hastily they long to divide the honour of this combat and they have
no vows to restrain them every sword to-night is as valuable as a cid's
right arm

tempt them not delude them not into the commission of a great sin
that will fill their future days with remorse said calavar earnestly
but before he could add any thing further the report of an arquebuse
from the front filled the forest with its roar and cortes plunging the
spur into his charger was instantly borne out of sight

for god's sake cried amador with despairing entreaty let us cross
the brook and follow these brave men a little though we join not in
the battle

i will not refuse thee so much as that said the knight with some
little animation which was perhaps caused by the martial associations
of the explosion it is not forbidden us at least to look on and by so
doing heaven may perchance allow us the happiness to save some wretched
life

in a moment the little party had crossed the brook and spurring their
horses hard followed as they thought in the path of their late
companion but though the moon frequently displayed her resplendent
visage through loop-holes in the scudding clouds the many clumps of
trees that dotted over the meadows in the environs of zempoala so
confounded the vision that they had reached the very suburbs without
yet obtaining a view of the adventurers indeed it had so happened that
not being provided with a guide acquainted with the various approaches
to the town they fell upon one entirely different from that trodden by
the assailants not doubting however that they were following closely
upon their rear they pushed boldly on through a deserted street
echoing loudly to the clatter of their steps nor did they discover
their error until to their great surprise they found themselves
issuing upon the great square in full view of the temple

they paused an instant in confusion no tumult of shouts or fire-arms
came from the sanctuaries a deep silence brooded over the city as with
wings in fact no sound broke the solemn tranquillity of midnight save
one which was the evidence and representative of peace the faint
twangling of a lute mingling with the sweet tones of a youthful voice
came from the chief tower to hear which the sentinels had doubtless
stolen from their posts among the cannon which were now seen frowning
in solitude on the verge of the platform

before don amador could take time to ponder on the infatuated
recklessness of the biscayan general or bethink him much of the young
moor of fez whose voice it was he did not doubt that sounded so
plaintively from the tower and which by some inexplicable principle of
association instantly wafted his spirit to granada and wrung it with a
sharp and sudden anguish the clattering of a horseman riding furiously
up a neighbouring street roused him from the imperfect revery and his
heart waxed hot and fierce as the loud cry arma arma a las armas
burst from the lips of the flying sentry in a moment of time this
faithful watchman was seen dashing across the square and as he flung
himself from his steed and rushed up the steps of the pyramid still
shouting the alarm at the top of his voice there was heard another
sound following at his heels in which the practised ear of the neophyte
detected the tramp of footmen pursuing with the speed of death in a
moment also ceased the lute and the voice of the singer torches
flashed suddenly from the doors of the towers and as their light shot
over the open square there was seen a hurried mass of men running in
confusion over the area of the pyramid but the same flash that revealed
this spectacle disclosed also the wild figures and hostile visages of
the men of cortes rushing to the assault and sending forth a shout
that made the whole town ring and tremble to its foundations

it was not in the nature of man to see these sights and hear these
sounds with composure and accordingly don amador had no sooner
dismounted and flung the reins of fogoso into the hands of lazaro than
he perceived the knight of calavar on foot at his side he turned an
inflamed and perhaps a rebellious eye on his kinsman but the
countenance of calavar was bent on his own with a ghastly placidity
and as the hand of the knight was laid on his shoulder as if to
restrain his fury the youth groaned in bitterness and anger

by heaven he cried i see the very face of sandoval as he darts at
the steps o my friend my father

shed no blood said the knight with a hollow but stern and vehement
voice the avenger will follow thee by night and by day at prayers and
in battle shed no blood

we are alone too cried amador with ungovernable fire as he found
that marco lazaro and baltasar after flinging the reins of their
horses round the shrubs that grew at the corner had vanished from his
side even the varlets may strike at the knave who has wronged me yet
may i not raise my hand

shed no blood reiterated don gabriel in a sort of frenzy forget
thy rage forswear thy fury slay thyself but strike not in
vengeance miserere mei deus

all these wild words though they take moments to record were the
utterance of an instant and while the piteous plaint of the knight
calavar still winged its way to heaven and before amador could reply a
single word the shouts of the assailants as they rushed up the steps
were met by the roar of a cannon discharged by a skilful hand
illumining tree and tower with a hideous glare and flinging death and
havoc among their ranks but the foot of desperation was on the earth of
the temple and before another piece of artillery could answer to the
hollow thunder of the hills the spear of chinantla was drinking the
blood of the cannoniers at this moment and while even the young
fabueno grasped the sword in his feeble hands and turned his pale face
to the battle while amador gnashed his teeth with rage there rose
from the platform above the shouts and yells of the combatants a
shriek as though of a woman struck by the spear of some ferocious
dastard if the blow of an enemy had fallen upon his cheek the young
cavalier could not have started from the grasp of his kinsman and drawn
his sword with a more irresistible impulse but in truth the same cry
that inflamed his own brain went also to the heart of calavar and when
he dashed up the pyramid with furious haste as if to the rescue of a
sworn friend the knight of rhodes drawing his weapon followed
fiercely after

the scene that awaited the neophyte on the platform though composed of
men writhing together in thick affray did not dwell an instant on his
eye it had caught as if by providential direction in the very chaos
of combat the figure that had sent forth the cry of affliction and as
he bestrid the body of abdalla and caught up the childish minstrel from
his person he shivered with a single stroke of his sabre the spear
that in a moment would have pinned to the earth both father and son

dog of a conjurer he cried as he discovered the person of botello in
the discomfited slayer and prepared while the terrified stripling
clung convulsively to his body to shield him from the weapons of
others dog of a conjurer thy cruelty cancels thy services and i will
cleave thee for a viper

what is written is written god be thanked i knew not twas a boy
and in an instant botello vanished among the combatants

i thought thee a woman thou scared varlet cheer up abdalla they
shall not harm thee father my knight and my father wilt thou protect
my boy that i have saved and his sire the christian moor cried
amador as he perceived the knight stand staring wildly at his side i
leave them to thee surely there may be other lives to save and thus
concealing his excitement in what seemed an excuse for his disobedience
and without waiting for an answer he rushed instantly into the thickest
of the combat




chapter xix


when don amador fled from the side of calavar the instinct of his
vengeance carried him to the spot where it seemed most likely to be
gratified the chief tower as well as the two others was invested but
in the crowd of musketeers and crossbowmen who stood valiantly at its
door repelling the assailants he not only heard the voice but very
plainly perceived the tall figure of his enemy don panfilo infuriated
at the sight he rushed forwards and calling out with an indiscreet
vigour that drew both the attention of that general and the thickest
shots of his companions he quickly found himself in a situation of
great jeopardy though bullet and cross-bow shaft fell harmless from his
mail of proof the thrust of some half a score partisans aimed at his
shining and exposed breast beat down the insufficient defence of his
buckler and hurled him instantly to the ground but the voice with
which he had challenged the biscayan had been heard by friends as well
as enemies and as his faithful lazaro dashed aside the most threatening
weapon the shield of another friend was extended over his body and he
found himself raised by the hand of cortes

i knew my valiant friend would not desert me this night cried the
commander but risk thyself no further we will sack these towers
without the loss of so invaluable a life what ho yield thee
narvaez he exclaimed with a voice heard above the din yield thee up
a prisoner or thine own cannon shall bury thee under the temple

el espíritu santo and on cried fifty eager men as they rushed by
their leader and drove the followers of narvaez into the sanctuary
they vanished but the pikes and muskets bristling through the curtain
checked the audacity of the besiegers at the door and the voice of
sandoval was heard exclaiming from behind clear for the cannon and
stand aside when suddenly a fire-brand dashed by some unseen hand to
the roof lodged among the palm-leaves and in a moment the whole
superstructure was in flames

spare your powder and stand by for the rats cried lazaro for it was
he who had achieved this cunning and well-timed exploit basta so we
catch rabbits in la mancha

an hundred crowns to the knave of the fire-brand cried cortes
exultingly and three thousand paid in gold to him who lays the first
hand on narvaez burn fire smother smoke the night is ours

ay don panfilo i await thee exclaimed amador as the rushing
descent of beams and embers drove the besieged from the temple and
again discovered the person of his wronger he sprang towards the
commander who however hot and foolish of temper now bore himself like
a courageous soldier and struck fast and fiercely at his foes while
shouting good cheer to his friends but before don amador could well
reach him he saw the unfortunate man struck down and in the act of
being transfixed by many spears magnanimity for the fury of a brave
man cannot live without opposition took the place of wrath and no
sooner did he hear don panfilo exclaim with a piteous voice dios
mio i am slain and mine eye is struck out forever than he rushed to
his assistance and seemed resolved to perform in his service the same
act of valour with which he had befriended abdalla again too as he
caught an outstretched arm did he find himself confronted with botello
but this time the magician's arm was extended in the office of mercy
and as he raised the vanquished general and displayed his countenance
covered with blood oozing from his right eye he exclaimed with a
triumphal solemnity i saw him blindfold and lo his eye is blinded
with blood victory victory á dios á cristo y al espíritu santo
gracias gloria y gracias amen victory

loud was the shout with which the besiegers responded to the cry of the
magician and the disordered and unavailing shots from the other towers
were lost in the uproar of voices exclaiming viva cortes el soldado
verdadero viva don carlos el rey viva el espíritu santo el espíritu
santo santísimo

away with him cried cortes guard thy prisoner magico mio thou
hast won the prize leave shouting ye rebel hounds and bring up the
cannon what ho ye rogues of the towers will ye have quarter and
friendship or flames and cannonballs point the ordnance against the
flank towers bury me the knaves that resist us longer in the name of
god and the emperor fire

but this measure was unnecessary the shout of triumph with which the
assailants proclaimed the capture of the biscayan was carried to every
ear in the adoratories and it was at this instant that the besieged as
much bewildered by the surprise as discomfited by the fury of the
attack disheartened too by the misadventure of their general looked
from the loops of their strong-holds and made that famous blunder of
converting the host of cucujos or fire-flies into a multitude of
match-locks whereby their hearts were turned to water and their
assurance of victory humbled to the hope of capitulation

at the very moment that don amador foiled in the gratification of his
passions in one quarter turned to indulge them in another and rushed
with increasing animation to that tower around which he heard many
voices echoing the name of salvatierra he beheld that worthy captain
issue from the door fling his weapon to the earth and stretch out his
arms as if beseeching for quarter

oh thou thing of a white liver cried the young cavalier with extreme
disgust hast thou not the spirit to strike me one blow i would i had
brought thee the boy jacinto to inflame thy valour a little thou wilt
fight me a boy

as the neophyte thus gave vent to his indignation he felt his arm
touched and turning round he beheld the secretary holding a sword
ornamented with drops of blood and otherwise looking as though he had
commenced his pupilage in a manner that would not shame his instructor

well done fabueno he exclaimed encouragingly thou lookest like a
soldier already i am glad thine arm is so strong

i struck but one blow señor and i believe i have killed a man god
forgive me he cried in more affright than elation i am not sure i
did right for the very moment i struck the blow my arm twinged with a
most horrible pang which was perhaps a judgment on me for striking a
man who had done me no wrong

these things must not be thought of too much said don amador
hastily in battle we must look upon all opponents as our sworn
enemies at least so long as they keep to their feet but the battle is
over i will have thy wound looked to by some better surgeon than this
crazy conjurer

señor said fabueno i sought you out not to trouble you with my
pains but to recall you to the knight your kinsman who is in some
difficulty with certain men about the moor that may end in blows and
never a henchman but old marco by the good don gabriel

amador followed the secretary instantly and found his kinsman not
unprotected however for both marco and baltasar were at his
side surrounded by several men speaking with loud and fierce voices
among which he quickly detected the tones of the master of the
incarnation

i say and i aver cried this man as the neophyte approached the
two knaves both father and son are my slaves as can be proved by
these runagate men my sailors and no man shall have them from me
without payment of my price

ay we can bear witness to that said his companions these are true
pagan slaves captured in a fight at sea out of a barbary pirate very
honest lawful slaves and though we have deserted our captain to fight
these other pagans we will not see him robbed of his property

to the great joy of don amador he observed that his kinsman was calm
and collected and though he spoke with his usual voice of affliction
his answer was still full of dignity and gravity

the moor that is a christian cannot be enslaved neither can he be
bought and sold and these claim to be both gazies christian
moriscos i guard them at the desire of their protector who can
assuredly support their claims in which event thou must cease thy
importunity and think of them no more

they are my slaves and i will have them said the master
ferociously i meet nothing but robbers in these lands but robber
peasant or robber knight neither shall wrong me for naught

thou base and covetous cur said amador advancing before the sailor
if thou usest no better language i will strike thy head from thy
shoulders dost thou remember me sirrah did not the admiral satisfy
thee in this matter and dost thou follow me still like a blood-hound
after the prey that is not thine

calm thy rage son amador said the knight thou hast done a good act
to-night in saving the lives of this poor child and his father and
thou shall not want my aid to preserve their freedom but let us not
quarrel enough christian blood has already been shed and a woful sight
will the sun see when he presently rises let us go before cortes he
shall judge between this man and these creatures whom thou hast rescued
from destruction

i ask nothing but justice and my right grumbled the master somewhat
pacified by the angry bearing of the neophyte for this was a more
commanding argument than the mildness of calavar

he fell back and without further contention though with a lowering
look followed the two cavaliers and the moriscos in search of don
hernan




chapter xx


the morn which by this time was breaking over the sea was ushered in
with a thousand sounds of triumph and the drums of the vanquished
rolled in concert with the trumpets of the victors in truth saving to
the wounded and broken-spirited biscayan and some few cavaliers who
had remained faithful to him and to his employer the change of others
from rivalry to subjection was a circumstance more of gratulation than
regret as was proved by the ready alacrity with which they betook
themselves to the audience of their conqueror

in the gilded and feather-broidered chair in which he had first seen the
person of the unlucky narvaez don amador de leste now perceived the
figure of the conqueror a rich mantle of an orange hue thrown over his
shoulders his head bare but his heel resting on a certain footstool or
ball of variegated feathers and altogether preserving an appearance of
singular but superb state his valiant and well-beloved officers stood
ranked on either side and on either side also his resolute followers
were displayed as if performing the duties of a body-guard in this
situation of pride he prepared to receive the congratulations or the
griefs of his enemies and as if to add still further to the imposing
magnificence of the ceremony at that moment as a wild roar of conches
and drums mingling with the wilder shouts of human beings burst over
the city a great multitude of native warriors from the province of
chinantla marching in regular and alternate files of spearmen and
archers and glittering with feathers and brilliant cotton garments
strode upon the square and dividing upon either side of the pyramid
halted only when they had surrounded it with their warlike and most
romantic array the spectacle was no more surprising to the people of
narvaez than to those friends of cortes who had not before looked upon
an indian army among whom don amador was one he regarded the
picturesque barbarians with much admiration though his eye soon
wandered from them to dwell upon the leader and the ceremonious part he
was then enacting he sat in his chair like a monarch and though at
times when some conquered cavalier more honoured or better beloved
than others approached he arose and even extended his arms with a
friendly embrace in the greater number of instances he was content to
pronounce some simple words of compliment and present his hand to be
kissed a mark of homage reverentially rendered by all

it did not become don amador though he surveyed these proceedings with
some little contempt as indicating on the one side too much arrogance
and on the other too much humility to interrupt them in which
persuasion he stood patiently aside with his company watching until
such moment when he might approach with propriety being thus a witness
of the degree of friendliness which characterized the receptions as
well as the many petitions which the comers made to be accredited and
enrolled among the general's true friends and followers he began to
lose somewhat of the wonder with which he had regarded the suddenness
and facility of the victory it was apparent that most of the officers
of narvaez had long made up their minds to devote themselves to the
service of his enemy and when they had paid their compliments to don
hernan they dropped among his officers as if joining old friends and
comrades

it gave the neophyte some pain when at the conclusion of these
ceremonies he beheld the biscayan led forward in chains for he was
heavily ironed to salute his rival his casque was off a bandage
covered his eye his face was very pale and he strode forward with an
uncertain gait as if feeble from the loss of blood or agitated by
shame and despair nevertheless he spoke with a firm and manly voice
when he found himself confronted with his vanquisher

thou mayest congratulate thyself cortes said the fallen chief thy
star has the ascendant thy fate is superior and so much do i admire my
own misfortune that i could compliment thee upon it did i not know it
was wrought less by the valour of my enemies than the perfidy of my
friends

thou doest thyself as well as all others a great wrong to say so
brother narvaez said the victor gravely and it would better become
thee magnanimously to confess thou art beaten by thine own fault rather
than to follow the example of little-minded men and lay the blame upon
others

i confess that i am beaten said the captive and that the shame
of my defeat will last longer than my grave but i aver to god and i
maintain in thy teeth though i am but a captive in thy hands that this
victory is altogether so miraculous it could not have happened unless
by the corruption of my people

to heaven and my good soldiers it is all owing said cortes
composedly and so little miraculous my brother do i myself esteem
it after having twice or thrice beaten thirty thousand tlascalans at a
time all valiant men that i vow to thee on my conscience i cannot do
other than consider this triumph as altogether the least of my
achievements in mexico

it must be so since you say it responded narvaez his breast heaving
under the sarcasm with a bitter and suffocating pang yet it matters
not let the glory be ever so little the shame is not the less
notorious and though thou scornest thy reward of fame i will not fly
from mine own recompense of contempt what more is expected of me dios
mio i cannot like the rest kiss thy hand and take upon me the oaths
of service i am thy prisoner

had i been thine said cortes gravely thou wouldst have fulfilled
thy word and hanged me wouldst thou not

what matters it replied the unfortunate man with a firm voice
doubtless if the passion that beset me at the time of the
proclamation had lasted after a victory i should have been as good as
my word for which reason i will anticipate thy excuses and assure thee
out of mine own mouth thou wilt but retaliate fairly to dismiss me to
the same fate

thou canst not understand the moderation thou hast not practised said
cortes rising and speaking with dignity the foolish rage that
provoked thee to set a price upon my head i remember not the madness
that proclaimed these true and most loyal men for rebels and traitors
must be passed by as other hallucinations but as in doing this thou
hast greatly injured and jeoparded the interests of thy master the king
thou art worthy to suffer the death of a rebellious subject for as such
thou hast acted nevertheless i will do thee a grace thou wouldst not
accord to me i will conceive that however traitorous have been thy
actions thou mayest have been faithful at heart mistaken but not
disloyal in which thought i give thee thy life and will recommend
thee into the hands of his majesty for judgment and mercy

the conqueror waved his hand and narvaez was led away to terminate
in after years a life of mischance by a death of misery among those
ruder tribes of the north who are but now vanishing from the borders of
the mississippi and to add his melancholy tale to the gloomy histories
of de leon and de soto

what will my noble and thrice-honoured friend don amador de leste
cried cortes as he perceived the neophyte approaching him we should
be good friends señor for i owe thee much and we have been in peril
together

twice i thank your excellency said amador you have done me the
office of a true cavalier for which i will not now trifle the time to
thank you inasmuch as my arm is henceforth unshackled and i can write
my gratitude better with it than with my tongue what i have now to
require is that your excellency will judge between me and this fellow
the master of a ship in the matter of a moor called abdalla otherwise
esclavo de la cruz and his son jacinto both of whom being christian
moors though captured in a barbary vessel this man doth claim to be
his slaves i on the other hand as their vowed protector and champion
upholding them to be free and in the condition of wards to his majesty
the king

they are my slaves said the master but a frown from the general
instantly closed his lips

it is well for the moor said cortes as at his command abdalla
approached followed by jacinto it is well for the moor that he has so
powerful a protector as don amador for otherwise having discovered it
was his accursed hand shot off the falcon which destroyed me four brave
men and maimed as many more i had resolved to hang him like a hound
this very morning

there is no better cannonier in all your excellency's train said the
master who however likely to be robbed of his property could not
check the impulse to praise it

i fired the cannon with the fear of death in my eyes if i refused
said abdalla humbly and my lord should as well be wroth with the
linstock as with myself

say not a word sirrah moor said cortes for the favour of don
amador having saved thy life i have nothing further to do but to judge
thy claims to liberty the which if thou establish i will not scruple
to employ thee in mine own service

the freedom of these twain said amador was recognised by his
excellency the admiral cavallero and i thought he had satisfied this
ship-master

his excellency the admiral protested he would represent the matter to
the governor velasquez said the surly captain and i was content to
abide his decision but my sailors hearing there was more gold to be
gathered among these hills than on the sea deserted me and not having
the means to carry my ship to cuba i was fain to follow after them
hoping the excellent cavaliers would do me justice and pay me for my
captives

sirrah said the general wert thou with narvaez or with me in this
battle

with neither said the sailor i arrived at night-fall and not being
able to make my way to narvaez i slept off my fatigue in a hut below
till roused by the din of this siege coming forth to behold which i
discovered my slaves and straightway claimed them and my sailors
yonder will witness i won them in fair fight

the moriscos are christians and therefore not thy property said the
commander and if they were being taken out of the camp of an enemy
they should be reckoned spoils of war and for that reason my
possessions and not thine cease therefore thy demands follow thy
sailors if thou wilt for on the lakes of mexico i shall have
employment for thy best skill and if in time i discover thee
faithful and this moor as dexterous as thou representest i will
without allowing thee any right to the same give thee very good guerdon
for his services

the master concealing his dissatisfaction retired

i hoped said amador your excellency might be persuaded to send
abdalla and the boy to spain

i am loath to say to don amador that may not be replied cortes as
a good christian abdalla will doubtless rejoice to fight the infidel
and as for his boy if there be no other cavalier willing to advance him
to the honours of a page i will myself receive him i hear he is a good
musician and i want a playmate for my little orteguilla whom i left
dancing boleros before the emperor montezuma

the fame of jacinto as a lutist and singer had already spread among the
cavaliers and his appearance was at the same time so prepossessing
that many of them stepped forward and avowed themselves ready to
receive him into service don amador himself now for the first time
perusing his countenance at leisure and moved as much by its beauty as
by its air of grief and destitution added himself to the number and it
seemed as if the claims of the various applicants might lead to heat and
misunderstanding the cap of jacinto had fallen from his head and long
ringlets such as greatly stirred the envy of the younger cavaliers
fell over his fair brow and exceedingly beautiful countenance his
delicately chiseled lips parted in alarm and anxiety moved and played
with an ever-varying expressiveness while his large black eyes in
which brilliancy was mingled with a pensive gentleness rolled from
general to cavalier from amador to his father with a wild solicitude

the difficulty was terminated at last by don hernan

i vow by my conscience said he i like the boy's face well but i
will not oppose my wishes to those of worthier gentlemen here present
in my opinion no man hath so fair a claim to the boy as don amador de
leste who first befriended him and not doubting that herein the boy
will agree with me i propose the election of a master to be left to
himself or what is the same thing to his father as a measure equally
agreeable to all choose therefore abdalla between these cavaliers
and thy benefactor for it is not possible the stripling can remain with
thyself

abdalla bent his troubled eyes around the assembly and amador not
doubting his choice regarded him with a benignant encouragement long
did the almogavar survey him now with eagerness as if about to throw
himself at his feet and beseech his protection and now faltering with
hesitation and doubt amador mistaking the cause of his embarrassment
prepared to reassure him when the eyes of the moor wandering away from
himself fell upon the figure of don gabriel standing hard by the same
hesitation that disturbed him before again beset him but it lasted not
long amid the clouds of dejection and distraction that characterised
the countenance of the knight of rhodes there shone a ray of
benevolence as if the emanation of a fixed and constant principle and
abdoul al sidi as he remarked it forgot that calavar was the slayer of
his people

if my lord my very noble lord he said bending to the earth will
hear the prayer of his servant and waste his charity on so great a
wretch as abdoul there is no one of all this noble assembly to whose
benevolent protection abdoul would sooner confide his helpless and
sinless child

the cavaliers stared yet abdalla had not erred when he reckoned on the
humanity of calavar

the knight received the hand of jacinto from his father and regarding
him with a paternal kindness said 

for the sake of him who did not scorn to protect little children i
will receive this boy into my arms and protect him with my best
strength both from sorrow and the sin that is the parent of sorrow

and i may see him sometimes said the moor lingering though the
general had motioned him away

surely i keep him from harm not from the love of his father

i commend thee to heaven my child said the almogavar embracing him
confide in thy master remember thy father and pray often farewell

but the boy with a cry that drew the commiseration of all present
threw himself into abdalla's arms and clasping him as if forever wept
on his bosom

thy master waits thee my child said abdalla disengaging his hands
and again leading him to calavar be wise and faithful and remember
if not always in thy presence i shall not often be far from thy side

the stripling once more kissed the lips of the morisco and then
checking his lamentations as his father left him wrapped his cloak
round his head as if to hide his tears and stood by the knight in
silence

while this incident was passing the attention of cortes was attracted
by two indians differing much in equipment from the warriors of
chinantla but still of a soldier-like bearing who in company with two
or three of his chief cavaliers hastily approached him and conferred
with him through the medium of an interpreter a cloud came over his
countenance he arose and smote his hands together with fury

what ho cavaliers he cried we must think of other matters than
crying babes and jingling pages i thank god for this victory for never
came one more opportunely and ye true friends who have this moment
protested your allegiance prepare now to make it more manifest sharpen
your swords saddle your horses for to-day we must march to
tenochtitlan

a murmur of surprise ran through the multitude that thronged the
pyramid and amador forgot both the boy and the touch of indignation
with which he had seen him transferred to another though his kinsman
as he pressed towards the excited general

know ye friends and brothers continued cortes that the devil has
at last waked up in the infidel city blood has been shed the blood
of spaniards as well as of pagan mexicans and at this moment
alvarado is besieged in the palace by the whole hordes of the valley
and he swears to me by these tlascalan messengers that unless i render
him speedy assistance he must die of starvation or perish under the
sword of the barbarians so god speed us to the venice of the new world
the babylon of the mountains the gold shall not be snatched out of our
hands nor the fame blotted from our histories we have this good day
numbers enow to chase the imps from the islands and to tumble the gods
from their temples and so will we in the name of god and st peter
amen god speed us to tenochtitlan

the shout that answered this pious and valiant rhapsody from the pyramid
and the square gave note of the zeal with which his followers both old
and new were prepared to second the resolution of their leader




chapter xxi


a history of moral epidemics drawn up by a philosophic pen would add
much to our knowledge of the mysteries of human character and human
power as well as of the probable contingencies of human destiny in the
prosecution of such a subject besides tracing the development of those
little causes which in former days have spread their effects from man
to man until whole communities have laboured under a disease resulting
in revolutions of the most stupendous nature we should doubtless
perceive many of those points of susceptibility and chains of impulsion
which render men the creatures of change and which being definitely
understood and wisely influenced might at once put it in the power of
philanthropists to govern the operations of reform in such manner as to
avoid the evils of ill-considered innovation religion and liberty have
both come to us as diseases and the propagation of them throughout the
lands of the heathen and the slave is yet a measure of pain and peril
because we have not considered or not yet learned how to address
ourselves to infirmity what man will not say that the enthusiasm which
cumbered the sands of syria with the blood of the crusaders might not
if properly directed have brought light and happiness to all europe or
that the fever which has left the revolution of france a horror on the
page of history might not under the guidance of a less speculative
philosophy have covered her valleys and filled her cities with security
and peace enthusiasm comes and goes and because we know not enough of
its weak and governable qualities to direct it in the paths of justice
and virtue it is allowed yet to fill the world with wrong and misery
and misapplied to the purposes of glory avarice and fanaticism the
engine which god has given us to advance our civilization is still the
preserver of barbarism

in the facility with which the aboriginal empires of america were
subverted by a handful of hotheaded spaniards mankind has been willing
to find a proof of the savage imperfection of their institutions in the
case of mexico at least this testimony is deceptive if we remember
that the tribes of anahuac like the other races of america were
struggling against obstacles which did not impede the advancement of
other nations we shall be surprised at the point of civilization they
had reached heaven had denied all the useful domestic animals to
america the bison which is perhaps not altogether untameable roamed
only over the prairies and the forest lands of the north among tribes
that were yet in the bottom class of humanity the horse and the ass
added not their strength to the labours of man and the little llama
bearing the burden of its master over the icy cordilleras of the south
was but a poor substitute for the camel of the desert to which it has
been compared accident or the knowledge of a thousand years can alone
teach men the use of that metal which will bring him civilization when
gold will not buy it but the discovery even of the properties of iron
will soon follow the invention of an alphabet however rude or
hieroglyphic the mexicans could already record and perpetuate their
discoveries without the aid of iron and domestic animals they were
advancing in refinement civilization had dawned and was shedding a
light constantly augmenting over their valleys and apart from these
deficiencies saving only perhaps additionally in the article of
religion which was not yet purged of its abominations and which
perhaps flung more annual victims on the altars than did in after
days even the superstition of their conquerors in spain the mexican
empire was not far behind some of the monarchies of europe in that
method purpose and stability of institutions both political and
domestic which are esteemed the evidences of civilization

a moral epidemic nerved the arm of the invaders another paralyzed the
strength of the invaded superstition covered the spaniard with armour
stronger than his iron mail and left the mexican naked and defenceless
and in addition the disease of disaffection creeping from the
extremities to the centre of the empire added its weight to the
lethargy of religious fear when hernan cortes set out on his march the
second time against tenochtitlan believing that god had chosen him to
be a scourge to the misbeliever he knew well that thousands and tens of
thousands of malecontents were burning to join his standard mexico was
the rome of the new world a compound of hostile elements an union of
tribes and states subdued and conjoined by the ambition of a single
city but not yet so closely cemented as to defy the shocks of a gothic
irruption what might have been the condition of the empire of
montezuma if the divine ray which conducted the genoese pilot over the
atlantic had been reserved for an adventurer of the present day it is
impossible to determine but it is quite clear its condition was such
at the time of the invasion that had not the indecision of its
monarch founded on such a conjuncture of coincidences as might have
confounded a more enlightened prince entirely repressed its powers of
resistance no armies raised by the spanish colonists or even by their
european master could have penetrated beyond the shores and the
destiny of cortes would have been written in letters as few and as
obscure as those which have recorded the fate of valdivia among the less
refined but better united araucanians of chili

the heart of the leader was bold the spirits of his confederates full
of resolution and hope and notwithstanding the evil intelligence that
their victims were wakening to a knowledge of their strength and
confirming their audacity in the blood they had already shed the united
followers of narvaez and hernan cortes began their march over the
mountains with alacrity and joy

the novelties and wonders that were each day disclosed were remarked by
no one with more satisfaction than by don amador de leste he rejoiced
when ascending among the mountains the fens and sand-hills of the
coast were exchanged for picturesque lakes and romantic crags when the
oak woods and pine forests began to stretch their verdant carpets over
the hill-sides when standing among the colossal ruins of some shivered
peak he cast his eye over glen and valley glittering with verdure and
fertility far away to the majestic ridges over whose hazy sides tumbled
the foamy fall or crept the lazy cloud while among their gorges
glistened the distant cones of snow now he admired the ferns lifting
their arborescent heads like palms among other strange trees now as
he exchanged the luxuriant slopes for those volcanic deserts which strew
the base of perote with lava and cinders he beheld the broad nopal and
the gigantic maguey rearing their massive leaves over the fissures
while a scorched forest withered and rotted above sometimes while
pursuing his weary way over these mountain paramos or deserts he
advanced bewildered as what seemed a fair and spacious lake withdrew
its vapoury waters from before him and revealed a parched and barren
expanse of sand the journey was an alternation of mountain and valley
forest and plain with sometimes a pleasant little indian village and
twice or thrice a town of no mean magnitude and splendour rising in
pleasant nooks among the horrors of the waste

over this rugged region it was not possible to drag the ordnance and
heavy stores with which cortes was now abundantly provided without
much labour and delay and it was not until about the time of the summer
solstice more than a month after the fall of zempoala that at the
close of a pleasant day the new invaders laid their eyes for the first
time on tlascala the capital of that warlike republic which for the
singular object as certain historians have conjectured of preserving
an enemy to exercise their armies as well as to furnish victims for
their gods the mexican monarchs permitted to subsist in the heart of
their empire

the slowness of their march was productive of many advantages to those
particular individuals whose adventures it is the object of this
history to record it gave to don amador an opportunity to make the
acquaintance of many of his new companions among whom were some not
unworthy his friendship the services of the señor duero were remembered
not without gratitude and although he reflected at times with some
unreasonable disgust that these denoted as much treachery to a friend
as humanity to a stranger the attentions of that cavalier were so
sedulously continued that he could not well refuse him his regard the
taciturn but ever-resolute sandoval the lofty and savage but not the
less courteous de leon the fiery de olid the daring de ordaz who
thirsting to accomplish exploits not dreamed of by his confederates had
clambered among the snowy pinnacles and burning caverns of the great
volcan and had thereby won the right confirmed to him afterwards by
the spanish king to carry a fire-mountain for his arms these as well
as divers others of no mean renown so recommended themselves to the
esteem of the neophyte that he dismissed much of his preconceived
contempt and began to consider himself among honourable and estimable
cavaliers but to none of them did his spirit turn with so much
confidence and affection as to don francisco de morla a young hidalgo
of his own native town greatly beloved throughout the army as a man of
honour and tried courage in this cavalier a modest carriage was united
to great gayety of disposition and a warm heart governed by gentleness
of temper a milder enthusiasm than that which beset his comrades
softened him to the barbarians in whose land he was more desirous to
consider himself a guest than an enemy and without lacking any
sincerity of devotion to his own faith he seemed to regard the
ferocious superstitions of the natives with less abhorrence than pity
he had followed at the side of cortes from tobasco to zempoala and
being as observant as brave was not only able to acquaint don amador
with the marvellous events of the invasion its perils sufferings and
triumphs but could also instruct him in many of the remarkable
characteristics of the land and the people

the effects of this delay on the knight of rhodes were equally
beneficial though differently wrought the paroxysms of lethargy as
well as the fits of distraction which as don amador learned from the
faithful marco had been many and ungovernable whenever the excitement
of battle was over began to vanish under the interest of the society
and the influence of the careful government of the neophyte who from
long acquaintance with his kinsman's eccentricities had acquired a
power to soothe them but if such was the influence of don amador the
power of the little moorish page over his moody moments was still more
remarkable the sorrows of jacinto vanished with the capriciousness of
childhood and perceiving that in the long and toilsome march he was
never so far separated from his father that he might not look to see him
at night-fall he quickly recovered his spirits then as if to express
his gratitude to the good knight who protected him he studied with
wonderful diligence and address how best to please and divert him with
a thousand pretty stories chosen with such discretion and prattled with
such eloquence as often surprised the neophyte with countless songs
which no one could sing with more sweetness or accompany with more
skill on the lute he would seduce the knight from his gloom and cheat
him out of his melancholy no dagger shone so brightly as that polished
by the hand of jacinto no plume of feathers waved with more grace than
that set by the young moor on the casque of don gabriel if a
tiger-flower glittered on the path if a chirimoya put forth its fruit
by the wayside before the knight could turn his eyes upon them they
were in his hand and jacinto smiled with delight as he received the
thanks of his patron the benevolence of don gabriel soon changed to
affection he almost smiled not so much with joy as with love when
sometimes the boy sat at his feet at evening and sang with fervour a
hymn to the virgin he was troubled if by chance jacinto strayed from
his sight and don amador sometimes found himself beset by a sort of
jealousy when he perceived or thought he perceived this stripling
robbing him of the heart of his kinsman but to do don amador justice
it needed not many suggestions of his honour or pride to rid him of such
envious emotions the zeal of the boy in the service of calavar as he
confessed deserved much of his own gratitude to which should be added
many acknowledgements of the satisfaction with which he himself listened
to his instrument and voice if the boy sang with alacrity at the wish
of calavar he was not less ready to obey the command of the neophyte
nevertheless don amador fancied this obedience was rendered less from
love than duty he thought the stripling looked on him with fear
sometimes with dislike and he was persuaded that though on occasions
of difficulty when a thunderstorm met them on a hill or a torrent
roared over the path jacinto chose rather to fly to him for
protection than to remain by the side of the knight he was oftener
disposed to shrink from his kindness this troubled don amador for he
loved the boy well and often he said to himself i have saved this
urchin from a beating and as i may add from the imminent danger of
being speared like a frog i have given him gentle words as also
praises for his singing which is indeed very excellent i have helped
him over divers rivers and a thousand times offered him a seat on
fogoso's crupper which it was his own fault or his own cowardice he
did not accept in short i have helped him out of countless troubles
and was besides the first to befriend him in these lands without
reckoning what protection i have given to his father sidi abdalla and
yet the lad loves me not it is a pity he was not born of christian
parents ingratitude runs in moorish blood

so thought don amador a thousand times but a thousand times as his
displeasure waxed hot at the unthankfulness of the lad it was
dissipated by some little circumstance or another once when he was in
a talkative mood and desirous to have jacinto at his side he was so
displeased at his evident wish to escape as to vent his displeasure in
a reprimand the boy ran to his side kissed his hand and raised his
eyes suffused with tears to the countenance of his preserver the
cavalier never rebuked him again on two or three occasions also
greatly to his surprise he caught the stripling weeping which was the
more wonderful since he seemed not only reconciled but greatly pleased
with his state of easy servitude on all such occasions he excused
himself with such persuasive simplicity as not only to remove all
suspicions of discontent but greatly to increase the affection of the
neophyte he was a favourite as well with the men-at-arms as with their
masters and don amador often reflected with wonder how quickly he had
wound himself into the hearts of all if i could persuade myself into a
belief of magic he pondered i should think him a truer conjurer than
botello what botello prophesied concerning narvaez is very remarkable
yet when a man is prognosticating all his life it is hard if he do not
sometimes blunder upon the truth truly he blundered wrong about
lorenzo's arm which is not yet well healed and i vow to st john i
thought one time it would have gangrened but as to jacinto he has
enchanted my knight's heart i have ever thought he abhorred the
moors and surely he slew great numbers in the war of the alpujarras as
for myself i was born with a natural detestation of the moorish race
and i never before knew but one that i did not hate at first sight
here he sighed dolefully but this boy i love yet loves he not me i
have heard of philters and love-medicines and surely as many drugs
attack the stomach brain and other parts there is no reason some
should not be found to affect the heart

but while the neophyte thus marvelled and reasoned jacinto stole still
deeper into his favour and at the end of a day's march don amador was
oftener found sitting at the door of some indian cabin or under the

chapter xxii


to those invaders who had not yet witnessed with their own eyes the
peculiar wonders of the interior the approach to tlascala was full of
surprise and interest as the sun sank the four hills on which lay the
republican city and the pyramids and towers that crowned them sent
their long shadows over the plain to the feet of the cavaliers and in
the gloom they beheld a vast multitude the armies of the four tribes
which composed the nation under their several banners glittering with
feathers and marching in regular divisions to the sound of wild music
as well as a host of women and children waving knots of flowers and
uttering cries of welcome advancing to do them honour don amador
forgot the valiant appearance of the warriors of chinantla while gazing
on the superior splendour of the armed tlascalans these warlike people
in imitation of their christian confederates had learned to divide
their confused throngs into squadrons and companies ranked under
separate leaders and now approached in what seemed well-ordered
columns bunches of red and white feathers waved among their long
locks and ornamented their wickered shields the short tunic of
nequen a coarse white cloth of the maguey left their muscular and
well-sculptured limbs free for action and as they strode along
brandishing their swords of obsidian the maquahuitl a heavy
bludgeon armed on either side with blades of volcanic glass or
whirling in their slings those missiles of hardened copper armed with
sharp horns which were capable of piercing the toughest armour and
ever and anon mingling their fierce cries with the savage sound of drum
and flute they made a show not more remarkable than glorious at the
head of each division under his peculiar standard the image of some
bird of prey or wild beast very gorgeously decorated marched each
chieftain with the great plume of distinction or penacho as it was
called rising full two feet above his head and nodding with a more
than barbarous magnificence thus appareled and thus displayed they
advanced to the head of the christian army and dividing on either side
so as to surround the spanish host with a guard of honour each
individual from the naked slinger to the feather-crowned chief did
homage to the christian general by touching the earth with his hand
and then kissing the humbled member while at the same moment a number
of priests with black robes and hair trailing almost to the ground
waved certain pots of incense before him as if to a demigod a mark of
distinction which they afterwards extended to the cavaliers that
surrounded him the religious ire of don amador de leste was inflamed
when it became his turn to receive this fragrant compliment and looking
down fiercely upon the innocent censer-bearer and somewhat forgetting
that castilian was not the language of the realm he cried 

what dost thou mean thou pagan dog to smoke me in this idolatrous
manner who am neither a god nor a saint

señor said de morla who sat at his side be not offended at this
mark of reverence which the customs of the country cause to be rendered
to every man of dignity and which is a harmless compliment and no
idolatrous homage as was first thought among us thou wilt presently
see them smoke their own generals and senatorial lawgivers the last of
whom thou mayest see yonder approaching us in a group those old men
with the feather fans in their hands

as de morla predicted the priests were no sooner done smoking their
christian visiters than they turned to do similar reverence to their
own dignitaries and don amador's concern was soon changed to admiration
to behold with what lofty state these noble savages received the tribute
due to their rank

this fellow with the red plume and the sword that seems heavy enough
for a giant's battle-axe he cried the knave over whom they hold a
great white bird like an ostrich he must needs be a king he bends to
cortes like an emperor doing courtesy to some brother monarch

that said de morla is xicotencal of the tribe of the white-bird
the most famous general of the tlascalans and in fact the
captain-in-chief of all their armies he is not less valiant than
famous and not less arrogant than valiant and at this moment beshrew
me i think he would rather be knocking his bludgeon over our heads out
of pure love of war than kissing his fingers in friendship this is the
man who commanded the armies which fought us on our first approach and
truly i may say he fought us so well that had he not been commanded by
the senators who are the civil rulers of tlascala to make peace with
us there is much suspicion we should have seen heaven sooner than the
vale of mexico for señor after having supplied us with food as
scorning to be assisted in his victory by famine which was somewhat
pressing with us he fell upon us to win it in person and i must
confess as will be recorded in history he quite broke and confounded
and would have utterly destroyed us had it not been for a providential
mutiny in his camp in the very midst of his triumph whereby we had time
to rally and take advantage of his distresses the same good fortune
might have been his another time without so inconvenient an
interruption but it seems the senators of tlascala only made war on us
to prove whether or not we were valiant men and worthy to be received
as their allies according to our wish which being now proved to their
satisfaction they ordered the war to be ended and welcomed us as
friends there never were more valiant men than these soldiers of
tlascala

of a surety said don amador i begin to think the captain gomez of
the caravel was somewhat mistaken as to the courage of these
barbarians

thou seest the second chief he of the green penacho with whom cortes
confers so very courteously that is talmeccahua chief of the tribe
tizatlan a very young warrior but second in fame only to xicotencal
and being more docile and friendly he is much a favourite with our
general and doubtless will be selected to accompany us to the great
city of those reverend old senators i could also give you an account
but we who are soldiers care not for lawgivers it is enough to assure
you that they are the rulers of tlascala and that though these proud
people the commoners call themselves free republicans they are to all
intents and purposes the servants of many masters a sort of freedom
somewhat more questionable than that of a nation governed by one king
thou seest they kiss their hands to us as we enter their city for my
part i think them rogues to love us their truest enemies better than
their domestic rivals the people of tenochtitlan wo betide them who
help us to conquer their foes when their foes are conquered

as de morla spoke don amador found himself entering the city of
tlascala twilight had darkened over the hills and in the obscurity
for the moon had not yet risen he perceived long masses of houses
not very lofty but strong on the terraced roofs of which stood many
human beings chiefly women and children who waved a multitude of
torches and as they sung what de morla told him were songs of welcome
threw flowers down upon their guests

flambeaux were also carried before them in the streets and with this
sort of pomp they were ushered to a great building with extensive
courts sufficient to lodge the whole army which was assigned them for
their quarters

while the cannoniers were arranging the artillery the officers of the
guard choosing their watchmen and preparations were made to hold a
conference with the chiefs of the republic the neophyte was invited by
de morla to accompany him to a pyramid on one of the four hills whence
as he assured him was a noble prospect of those huge mountains which
separated them from the valley of tenochtitlan don amador looked about
him for his kinsman he had retired with the chaplain of the army in
some sudden disorder of spirit for prayer or confession and don amador
sighed as he bethought him that yearly about the time of midsummer
the knight's disease seemed to reach its intensest point

if thou couldst but sing to him that holy song of the virgin written
many years back by the priest of hita

 quiero seguir á ti flor de las flores

said don amador to the moorish page for it was jacinto who gave him
this information i have no doubt thou wouldst do him more good than
the reverend father olmedo for though i know not why it should be so
he ever seems to me more troubled than relieved by confession

it was a song chanted the evening before that had thrown the knight's
spirit into disorder and baltasar had commanded him never to sing
again so said jacinto

baltasar is an ass though very zealous for his master said the
neophyte in a heat and thinks there is nothing comforts my kinsman's
heart save the clanging of swords and bucklers whereas i know very
well thy ditties are true medicine to him and with heaven's blessing
thou shall sing him very many more

let the boy follow with us said de morla i like his piping well
and methinks if he have not forgotten that tender love-song about the
christian knight who adored a pagan morisca i can listen to it again
with much good will as i look towards the mountains of montezuma

i am loath to have him away for perhaps my good knight may call for
him when the confession is over and there is something raw in this
night air that may be prejudicial to the youth

yo seguiré á mi señor i will follow my master said jacinto with
simplicity my lord the knight bade me this night to remain by the side
of my lord lest some evil should happen to me among the infidels

take up thine instrument then said the neophyte for thou seemest
to-night to remain by me in good will and i am ever glad to have thy
foolish company when such is the case if thou wilt carry a torch also
tis very well twill be some half hour yet ere moonrise

the two cavaliers followed by the page bearing a torch as well as his
lute strode through the streets which were still thronged with their
savage allies as in a gala-day singing and shouting many of whom
from affection or curiosity seemed disposed to add themselves to the
little party nevertheless such inquisitive individuals were easily
repelled by de morla pointing in the direction he was pursuing and
pronouncing a few words in their language the effect of which as don
amador observed was always to check their ardour and cover their
visages when these could be seen with sadness and awe

i tell them said de morla in answer to the inquiries of the
neophyte that we are going to the hill to look upon the
fire-mountain popocatepetl and why they are so stricken with
superstition at the name i will explain to thee when we reach the
temple

the temple was soon reached the city a congregation of cabins and
rude stone dwellings of vast size lying on the prolonged base of a
great mountain reared its principal sanctuaries on the spurs of this
elevation on the highest of which stood that consecrated to the god of
the air this was an earthen pyramid huge and lofty surmounted by
towers such as don amador had seen at zempoala as the friends
approached this the deep silence that surrounded it was broken by the
voices of men speaking vehemently in a strange tongue and as they
advanced they beheld two or three figures glide behind the pyramid as
if to escape observation this would not perhaps have attracted the
notice of the neophyte had not his companion exclaimed 

sidi the cannonier again plotting his knaveries with the two moorish
slaves of cortes there is some villany in the wind i have twice or
thrice seen abdalla in close conference with these two varlets and he
is often seen talking with his other countrymen that we have in the
army i will represent this matter to the general for there can no good
come of such secret proceedings i have all along distrusted that
infidel cannonier to have some mischief in him

please my lord my father is no infidel said jacinto trembling
perhaps as much at his presumption in contradicting a noble hidalgo as
at the presumed danger of his parent no infidel but a christian
moor as the good padre olmedo will witness to my lord

young page said de morla pleasantly i should not have said so
grievous a thing of thy father but that i forgot thou wert in hearing
i will grant thee abdalla to be a good christian if the padre say so
but if thou art as much of a wit as a singer tell me how is it thy
father is found so often skulking about by night in company with the
moorish slaves who are yet unbelievers instead of resting with
christian soldiers

though the moors be slaves and mahometans said the page with much of
the submissiveness of his father though recovering from his
trepidation they were born in the same land with my father and are
his countrymen as for the christian soldiers they will not forget
that though a christian he was born of the poor moriscos and my lord
knows it is hard to rest with those who hate us

i should give thee a ducat for thy argument said de morla
good-humouredly but that i know thou art so unsophisticated as to
prefer sweet praise to gold and i intend soon to bestow some of that
upon thee thy oration has utterly persuaded me i have wronged abdalla
in token of my penitence for which i will relieve thee of the burthen
of the torch whilst thou art climbing up these steps which are none of
the smoothest nor shortest

take thou my hand jacinto said the novice benevolently for as my
friend says these steps are indeed very rugged and i am willing to
show thee that though thou art of moorish blood i myself do by no
means either hate or despise thee

the page humbly and hesitatingly placed his hand in the grasp of don
amador and ascending at his side soon stood on the summit of the
pyramid

here besides two towers of stone that reared their lofty bulk over
head the novice perceived in advance of them two great urns of rude
workmanship each apparently carved out of a solid block of stone and
each glowing with the remains of a fire not yet extinguished though no
priests stood by to guard and replenish them they had forsaken their
altars to join in the festivities of the evening

let us break these idolatrous censers said don amador for my blood
boils to look upon them

nay said the moderate de morla let us wait for heaven's own time
as is strenuously advised by our wise and holy chaplain who must know
better than ourselves how to attack the impieties of the land we have
ever found these heathens more easily converted by gentle persuasions
than by violent assaults on their prejudices and father olmedo has
shown us how persecution strengthens instead of overturning an abused
superstition he has also proved to the satisfaction of most of us that
it is our bounden duty to subdue the arms of the pagans and leave their
faith to be conquered by the good priests who will follow in our
path turn señor from these pigmy vases to the great censers which
god has himself raised to his majesty

as de morla spoke he turned from the altars and don amador following
with his eyes the direction in which he pointed beheld a spectacle
which instantly drove from his mind the thought of the idolatrous urns
far away in the south-west at the distance of eight or ten leagues
among a mass of hills that upheld their brows in gloomy obscurity a
colossal cone elevated its majestic bulk to heaven while the snows
which invested its resplendent sides glittered in the fires that
crowned its summit a pillar of smoke of awful hue and volume rose to
an enormous altitude above its head and then parting and spreading on
either side through the serene heaven lay still and solemn like a
funeral canopy over its radiant pedestal from the crater out of which
issued this portentous column arose also time by time great flames
with a sort of lambent playfulness in strange and obvious contrast with
their measureless mass and power while ever and anon globes of fire
rushing up through the pillar of vapour as through a transparent
cylinder burst at the top and spangled the grim canopy with stars no
shock creeping through the earth no heavy roar stealing along the
atmosphere attested the vigour of this sublime furnace but all in
silence and solemn tranquillity the spectacle went on now darkling
now waxing temporarily into an oppressive splendour as if for the
amusement of those shadowy phantoms who seemed to sit in watch upon the
neighbouring peaks

this is indeed said don amador reverently if god should require an
altar of fire such a high place as might be meeter for his worship than
any shrine raised by the hands of man god is very great and powerful
the sight of such a spectacle doth humble me in mine own thoughts for
what is man though full of vanity and arrogance in the sight of him
who builds the fire-mountains

padre olmedo said his companion will ask you what is this
fire-mountain though to the eye so majestic and to appearance so
eternal to the creeping thing whose spark of immortality will burn on
when the flames of yonder volcano are quenched forever

it is very true said the neophyte the mountains burn away the sea
wastes itself into air but the soul that god has given us consumes not
the life of the body passes away like these flames the vitality that is
in the spirit is a gift that heaven has not extended to the stars

my friend said de morla willing to pass to more interesting
discussions will now perceive for what reason it was that the
tlascalans were dismayed and sorrowful when i pronounced the name of
popocatepetl the name signifies the mountain of smoke for this great
chimney though ever pouring forth dark vapours has not often been
known to kindle into flames the present eruption beginning about the
time of our descent upon the coast has ever since continued and was
considered to have heralded our appearance the tlascalans though as
securely fettered under the sway of their senators as are the people of
anahuac under their kings are as i told thee very intolerant of such
chiefs as carry the open names of masters nay so bitterly do they
detest all tyrants that they have constructed a fable which they now
believe as a truth namely that the souls of such persons are
concocted and elaborated among the flames of yonder awful crater
whence at the times of eruptions they are sent forth in the shape of
meteors and fire-balls to afflict and desolate the world the globes
that fall back into the cavity they think are despots recalled by
their relenting gods whereas those that fall beyond the brim and roll
down the sides of the mountain are tyrants let loose upon them without
restraint this being their belief it may seem strange to you they
have conceived so preposterous an affection for ourselves who are much
liker to prove their tyrants than any of the lords of anahuac but yet
so savage is their detestation of these native kings that though
nightly terrified with the spectacle of so many fiery tyrants flying
through the air they seem quite to have lost sight of the danger of
entrusting their liberties to our care

i hope said don amador we have come to rid them of the bondage of
idolatry not to reduce them to a new slavery

we will see that by-and-by said de morla we broke the chains of
superstition in the islands but we followed them with more galling
fetters and what better fate awaits the good montezuma is more than i
can tell

dost thou call that savage emperor the good montezuma demanded the
novice

i cannot do otherwise said de morla mildly a thousand times might
he have swept us from the face of the earth for his armies are
numberless a grain of sand from the hand of each of his warriors would
have covered us with a mountain but age has come to him with a disgust
of blood and all his actions have proved him rather a humane host than
a barbarous destroyer i must confess we have repaid his gentleness and
beneficence both with perfidy and cruelty yet notwithstanding all
this and notwithstanding that he is sorely afflicted by our harshness
such is the goodness of his heart that he will not permit his people to
do us any injury nor by any violence rescue him out of our hands

i have heard another story from don hernan said amador and truly
i thought these ferocious assaults upon the garrison left with the señor
alvarado in the city were proof enough of his deceitful malice

i will not take upon me to contradict what is averred by don hernan
said de morla but señor we have had other representations of these
tumults by envoys from montezuma himself which if cortes had not
refused to hear them would have entirely changed the nature of our
belief i have myself spoken with these ambassadors continued the
young cavalier earnestly some of whom were sent to us at zempoala and
others have met us at divers places since though without being
hearkened to and having no inducements to remain in a rage like
cortes himself i was very easily persuaded to my shame that the fault
lay all on the side of the garrison señor for the sake of lucre we
have done many unjust things we were received with all hospitality by
montezuma the great lord of tenochtitlan he gave us a palace to live
in supplied us with food and raiment and enriched us with many costly
presents we repaid all this kindness by seizing him in a moment of
confidence and conveying him to our dwelling where we have kept him
ever since a prisoner forcing him by the fear of death to submit to
many indignities unworthy his high rank and benevolent character and
once even forcing him to sit in chains and witness the cruel execution
of some of his own officers for a certain crime in which he could have
had no part he forgave us this as well as other insults and while we
were absent against zempoala preserved his promise sacred to remain in
ward of alvarado until our return now señor you shall hear the truth
of the assault of which so much is said by cortes as fully proving the
iniquitous duplicity of the captive emperor while we were gone there
occurred the anniversary of the great festival of mexitli the war-god
in which it is customary for all the nobles arrayed in their richest
attire to dance on the terrace of the great pyramid before the
emperor alvarado dreading lest such an assemblage of chiefs heated
as we well knew them to be on account of the imprisonment of their
king might encourage them to rescue him from his thrall refused to let
the mitotes for so they call this ceremony be danced on the
temple and at his invitation the tlatoani assembled in the court-yard
of the palace which montezuma gave us for our quarters and here the
rite began now señor continued de morla speaking indignantly you
will blush to hear that our christian garrison were so inflamed with
cupidity at the sight of the rich and precious jewels with which their
guests were decorated that they resolved to possess them though at the
cost of blood-guiltiness and falling upon these poor unsuspicious and
unarmed revellers when wearied with the dance and calling out
treason as if to justify themselves though there was no treason
except that in their own hearts they butchered all that could not leap
the high walls and rifled the corses even in the sight of the emperor
this as you may well believe excited the people to fury and drove
them to vengeance they assaulted the palace killed many of the
perfidious garrison and would have destroyed all but that montezuma
whom they call the traitor and murderer moved by the intreaties and
excuses of alvarado commanded them to retire and such are their love
and subjection to this monarch that they instantly obeyed him and have
remained in peace ever since waiting the return and the judgment of don
hernan and don hernan will doubtless command us to give them justice
by slaying as many as shall dare to demand it

by heaven said don amador if this be the truth there are more
barbarians than those who worship pagan idols and i vow to god if i
find thy narrative well confirmed i will draw no sword not even at the
bidding of my knight calavar on the people of tenochtitlan were i even
sworn like a vowed knight of rhodes to keep no peace with the
infidel i could not fight in an unjust cause

i am glad to hear you say so said de morla frankly for i have
often ever since i have been assured of the friendly and docile
character of the mexicans been persuaded it would be wiser as well as
juster to teach them than to destroy your favour will find the nobles
very civilized and surely their daughters if converted to the true
faith would make more honourable wives for spanish hidalgos than the
moorish ladies of our own land

a sigh came from the lips of jacinto as he heard this narrative to
which he had listened with boyish interest terminated with a slur so
degrading to his people but his mortification was appeased by don
amador exclaiming with great emphasis 

that these mexican princesses may make very good wives when true
christians i can well believe but i have my doubts whether they have
any such superiority over the moorish ladies of granada who possess the
religion of christ i have once or twice known very noble moriscas
honoured among the wives of granada as much as those who boasted the
pure blood of castile and for myself without pretending to say i shall
ever condescend to such a marriage i may aver that i have seen at
least one fair maiden and she of no very royal descent whom that is
if i had loved her i should not have scorned to wed but these things
go by fate a christian moor is perhaps as much regarded by heaven as a
christian spaniard and surely there are some of them very lovely to
look on and with most angelical eyes

the gentle cavalier smiled in his own conceits as he listened to the
argument of his friend but without answering it he said 

while we have the authority of the cid ramon of leon before our eyes i
am much disposed to agree with don amador for the cid adored an
infidel and why should not we love proselytes come now my pretty
page of all thy ballads i like best that which treats of the loves of
cid ramon and if thou hast not forgotten it i shall rejoice to hear
thee chant it once more while we sit under the tower and gaze on the
fire-mountain that looks down on mexico

the boy agreed with unusual alacrity and sitting down at the feet of
the cavaliers on the flags that surrounded the sanctuary with the
torch stuck in the earth near him he tuned his instrument with a
willing hand




chapter xxiii


lighted not more by the torch at his feet than by the flames that
crested the distant mountain the moorish boy struck the lute with a
skilful touch whispered rather than wailed the little burthen that
kept alive the memory of the alhambra and then sang the following
romance a ballad that evidently relates to the fate of mohammed
almosstadir king of seville dethroned by the famous yussef ben taxfin
emir of morocco in the wars of the moorish kings of spain with alfonso
vi of leon about the year the christian monarch prevailing his
infidel enemies invited yussef to their assistance the emir obeyed the
call but having fought one or two battles with alfonso contented
himself with turning his arms on his confederates and dethroning
them mohammed almosstadir among the number it is recorded that his
chivalrous enemy the king alfonso moved by the distresses of mohammed
sent an army of twenty thousand men to assist him against yussef but in
the obscurity of the historic legends of that day nothing can be
discovered in relation to the devout condition of kissing the cross
nor indeed of the name or fate of the leader of the spanish army we
should know nothing of the good cid but for the ballad which was
doubtless of very antique origin though the simple burthen me acuerdo
de ti granada commemorative of the fall of the moorish city must
have been added four hundred years after perhaps by the singer from
whom jacinto had learned it

 romance of cid ramon

 i remember thee granada
 cid ramon spurr'd his good steed fast
 his thousand score were near
 and from sevilla's walls aghast
 the watchmen fled with fear
 for afric's emir lay around
 the town was leaguer'd sore
 and king mohammed wept with shame
 to be a king no more
 i remember thee granada

 the emir's powers were round and nigh
 like locusts on the sward
 and when cid ramon spurr'd his steed
 they struck him fast and hard
 but quoth the cid a knight am i
 with crucifix and spear
 and for mohammed ride i on
 and for his daughter dear 
 i remember thee granada

 cheer up dark king and wail no more
 let tears no longer flow
 of christian men a thousand score
 have i to smite thy foe
 the king alfonso greets thee well
 kiss thou the cross and pray
 and ere thou say'st the ave o'er
 the emir i will slay
 i remember thee granada

 or let the african be slain
 or let the emir slay
 i will not kiss the cross of christ
 nor to his mother pray
 a camel-driver will i live
 with yussef for my lord
 or ere i kiss the christian's cross
 to win the christian's sword
 i remember thee granada

 mohammed now thou griev'st me much 
 alfonso is my king
 but let suleya kiss the cross
 and let her wear the ring
 the crucifix the bride shall bear
 her lord shall couch the spear
 and still i'll smite thy foe for thee
 and for thy daughter dear
 i remember thee granada

 then up suleya rose and spoke 
 i love cid ramon well
 but not to win his heart or sword
 will i my faith compel
 with yussef cruel though he be
 a bond-maid will i rove
 or ere i kiss the christian's cross
 to win the christian's love
 i remember thee granada

 suleya now thou griev'st me much 
 a thousand score have i
 but saving for a christian's life
 they dare not strike or die
 alfonso is my king and thus
 commands my king to me
 but for that christian all shall strike
 if my true love she be
 i remember thee granada

 ill loves the love who ere he loves
 demands a sacrifice
 who serves myself must serve my sire
 and serve without a price
 let yussef come with sword and spear
 to fetter and to rend
 i choose me yet a moorish foe
 before a christian friend 
 i remember thee granada

 ill loves the love who pins his love
 upon a point of creed
 and balances in selfish doubt
 at such a time of need
 his heart is loosed his hands untied
 and he shall yet be free
 to wear the cross and break the ring
 who will not die for me
 i remember thee granada

 the emir's cry went up to heaven
 cid ramon rode away 
 ye may not fight my thousand score
 for christian friend to-day

 but tell the king i bide his hest
 albeit my heart be sore
 of all his troops i give but one
 to perish for the moor
 i remember thee granada

 the emir's cry went up to heaven
 his howling hosts came on
 down fell sevilla's tottering walls 
 the thousand score were gone
 and at the palace-gate in blood
 the arab emir raves
 he sat upon mohammed's throne
 and look'd upon his slaves
 i remember thee granada

 the lives of all that faithful be
 this good day will i spare
 but wo betide or kings or boors
 that currish christians are 
 up rode cid ramon bleeding fast
 the princess wept to see 
 no cross was kiss'd no prayer was said
 but still i die for thee
 i remember thee granada

 the moorish maid she kiss'd the cross
 she knelt upon her knee 
 i kiss the cross i say the prayer
 because thou diest for me
 to buy thy thousand score of swords
 i would not give my faith
 but now i take the good cross up
 to follow thee in death
 i remember thee granada

 holy maria come to us
 and take us to the blest
 in the true blood of love and faith
 receive us to thy rest 
 the emir struck in bitter wrath
 sharp fell the arab blade
 and mary took the cid to heaven
 and bless'd the christian maid
 i remember thee granada

i like that ballad well said de morla with a pensive sigh when the
singer had finished and to my thought no handsome maiden though
such always makes the best ballad-singer could have trolled it with a
more tender and loving accent than jacinto the moorish maid he
continued humming the words in a sentimental manner 

 the moorish maid she kiss'd the cross
 she knelt upon her knee 

to my mind it would read better if we could say the mexican maid 

 the mexican maid she kiss'd the cross 

but pho upon it that spoils the metre is it not thy opinion señor
the princess suleya would have shown more true love as well as wisdom
to have kissed the cross before the cid came to his death-gasp

by my faith i cannot doubt it said don amador yet considering
that she avowed herself a proselyte when the sword of that accursed
emir was suspended over her head and so provoked and endured the death
of a martyr for don ramon's sake it must be acknowledged she acted as
became a loving and truly devout lady but what i chiefly esteem in
this ditty is the magnanimous art with which the cid ramon both
preserved his faith to his king and devoted himself to death for his
mistress a reconciliation of duties which some might have considered
impracticable or at least highly objectionable

amigo querido mio cried de morla grasping the neophyte's hand and
speaking with a voice half comical half serious if thou livest a
hundred years longer than myself thou wilt hear some such mournful
madrigal as this sung in memory of my foolish self only that in place
of a moorish infanta thou wilt hear the name of a mexican princess and
minnapotzin will doubtless be immortalized along with de morla

minnapotzin exclaimed don amador with a stare rendered visible
enough by the distant flashings of the volcano i swear to thee my
brother i understand not a word thou art saying

to make the matter clear to thee then said de morla with forced
gayety conceive me for a moment to be the cid of whom we have been
singing and imagine my suleya to be wandering by the lake side in the
figure of a certain minnapotzin received to our holy faith under the
name of doña benita a princess among these poor barbarians

dost thou indeed love one of these strange maidens then and is she
baptized in our holy faith demanded don amador with much interest
if she be worthy of thee francisco i pray heaven to make thee happy
with her

now may i die cried de morla grasping don amador's hand warmly if
i did not fear thou wouldst either censure or laugh at me or perhaps
turn thy ridicule upon benita a wrong i never could have forgiven
thee for i protest to thee there is no such gentle and divine being in
all the world beside i make thee my confidant hermano mio because i
shall have much need of thy friendship and counsel for though i come
not like cid ramon with a thousand score to rescue her pagan
father sure am i i cannot love the princess and yet be blind to the
miseries of the king

assuredly said don amador i will aid thee and for thy sake both
the fair princess and her unconverted sire wherever in so doing i may
not oppose my allegiance and religion

i will not claim any sacrifice said de morla unless so much as will
rob thee of thy prejudices against this deluded people in fact i
desire thee more as a confidant than as an abettor for there is
nothing to oppose my happiness saving the present uncertainty of the
relations betwixt ourselves and the mexicans minnapotzin is a
christian i dare be sworn the cid was not better beloved than
myself and cortes hath himself promised to ask the consent of our
christian king to the marriage as soon as montezuma has properly
confirmed his vassalage no there is nothing to oppose me continued
de morla with a sudden sadness saving only this uncertainty i have
spoken of and the darkness that hangs over my own destiny

i vow to thee i am as much in the dark as before said don amador

in good faith my friend said the young cavalier with a faint smile
it is promised me i shall die very much like don ramon did i never
tell thee what botello hath prophesied

not a jot said the neophyte but i trust thou puttest no faith in
that worthy madman

how can i help it said de morla seriously he has foretold nothing
that has not been accomplished from the quarrel of cortes with the
adelantado velasquez even to the fall of zempoala

i have reflected on this prediction with regard to zempoala as well as
all others whereof i have heard said the neophyte with a sagacious
nod and i have settled in mine own mind that there is nothing in them
beyond the operation of a certain cunning mingled with a boldness which
will hazard any thing in prognostic much credit is given to botello
for having as i am informed predicted even before the embarkation of
cortes the rupture between him and his governor that afterwards ensued
now any man acquainted with the unreasonable rashness and hot jealousy
of the governor might have foretold a quarrel and i see not how it
could have been otherwise so also as i may say i did myself in a
manner foretell the disaster of narvaez as soon as i perceived his
foolish negligence in choosing rather to divert his soldiers with
legerdemain dances than to set them about his city as sentinels the
victory comes not to the indiscreet general

all this might have been conjectured but not with so many surprising
particulars said the cavalier how could botello have predicted
that though narvaez should sally out against us no blow should be
struck by daylight

marry i know not unless upon a conviction that cortes was too wise to
meet his enemy on the plain and from a personal assurance that the
rocks wherein the general had pitched his camp were utterly
unassailable

how could he have guessed that flames should drive the biscayan from
the tower

did he guess that indeed said the neophyte staring he could not
have known that for the brand was thrown by mine own rogue lazaro who
i know was not his confederate

how could he have averred that narvaez should lose his eye and come
blindfold to his conqueror

is it very certain botello foretold that demanded don amador his
incredulity shaking

the señor duero was present as well as several other honourable
cavaliers and all confirm the story said de morla nay i could give
thee a thousand instances of the marvellous truths he has spoken and so
well is cortes convinced of his singular faculty that he will do no
deed of importance without first consulting the magician

when my head is very cool said amador musingly i find no
difficulty to persuade myself that the existence of the faculty of
soothsaying is incredible because subversive of many of the wise
provisions of nature yet i will not take upon me to contradict what i
do not know and surely also i may confess i have heard of certain
wonderful predictions made by astrologers which are very difficult to
be explained unless by admission of their powers

what botello has said to me said de morla with a hurried voice has
been in part fulfilled though spoken in obscure figures he told me
long since that i should be reduced to bondage at such time as i
should behold a christian cross hanging under a pagan crown this i
esteemed a matter for mirth for how said i shall i find a pagan
wearing a crucifix and how shall i submit to be a captive among strange
and cruel idolaters when i have the power to die fighting but i have
seen the cross on the bosom of one who wears the gold coronet of a
king's daughter and now i know that my heart is in slavery

don amador pondered over this annunciation but while he deliberated
his friend continued 

when botello told me this he added other things not many but
dark to wit as i understood it that i should perish miserably with
my enslaver and what is still more remarkable with an infidel priest
to say the mass over my body señor these things are uncomfortable to
think on but i vow to heaven if i am to die in the arms of
minnapotzin i shall perish full as happily as did cid ramon in the
embraces of suleya

de morla concluded his singular story with a degree of excitement and
wildness that greatly confounded don amador and before the neophyte
could summon up arguments enough to reply a voice from the bottom of
the pyramid was heard pronouncing certain words in a tongue entirely
unknown to him but among which he thought he recognised the name of
minnapotzin he was not mistaken de morla started saying hastily 

i am called señor this is the voice of one of the envoys of
montezuma with whom i have certain things to say concerning doña
benita i will return to thee in an instant and so saying he
descended the stairs of the mound and was straightway out of sight




chapter xxiv


the moon had now risen and was mingling her lustre with the blaze of
the volcano the shouts of revelry came less frequently from the city
and one by one the torches vanished from the house-tops and the
streets a pleasant quiet surrounded the deserted temple a few embers
only glowed in the sacred urns but the combined light of the luminary
and the mountain covered the terrace with radiance and fully revealed
the few objects which gave it the interest of life in this light as
don amador turned to his youthful companion he beheld the eyes of the
page suffused with tears

how is it jacinto what ails thee he cried i vow to heaven i am
as much concerned at thy silly griefs as though thou wert mine own
little brother rosario who is now saying his prayers at cuenza art
thou weary i will immediately conduct thee to our quarters is there
any thing that troubles thee thou shouldst make me thy confidant for
surely i love thee well

señor mio i am not weary and i am not grieved said the stripling
with simplicity as the good-natured cavalier took him by the hand to
give him comfort i wept for pity of the good don francisco and the
poor minnapotzin for surely it is a pity if they must die

thou art a silly youth to lament for evils that have not yet happened
said amador

but besides señor said the page when don francisco made me sad i
looked at the moon and i thought how it was rising on my country

it is now in the very noon of night both in thy land and mine said
the neophyte touched by the simple expression and leading the boy
where the planet could be seen without obstruction it is now midnight
over fez as well as castile and perhaps some of our friends in both
lands are regarding this luminary at this moment and thinking of
us

the page sighed deeply and painfully

i have no friends no neither in fez nor in spain he said and
save my father my master and my good lord none here there is none of
my people left but my father and we are alone together

say not alone said amador with still more kindness for as jacinto
made this confession of his destitute condition the tears fell fast and
bitterly from his eyes say not alone for i repeat to thee i have
come i know not by what fascination to love thee as well as if thou
wert my own little brother and there shall no wrong come to thee or
thy father while i live to be thy friend

jacinto kissed the hand of the cavalier and said 

i did not cry for sorrow but only for thinking of my country

thou shouldst think no more of fez for its people are infidels and
thou a christian

i thought of granada for that is the land of christians and i longed
to be among the mountains where my mother was born

thou shalt live there yet if god be merciful to us said the
cavalier for when there is peace in this barbarous clime i will take
thee thither for a playmate to rosario but now that we are here alone
let us sit by the tower and while i grow melancholy bethinking me of
that same land of granada which i very much love i will have thee sing
me some other pretty ballad of the love of a christian knight for a
moorish lady or i care not if thou repeat the romance of the cid i
like it well me acuerdo de ti me acuerdo de ti  and the
neophyte seemed while he murmured over the burthen as if about to
imitate the pensiveness of de morla

if my lord choose said the page i would rather tell him a story of
granada which is about a christian cavalier very noble and brave and
a christian morisca that loved him

a christian morisca said amador and she loved the cavalier i will
hear that story and it happened in granada too

in one of the moorish towns but not in the royal city it was in the
town almeria

in the town almeria echoed amador eagerly thou canst tell me
nothing of almeria that will not give me both pain and pleasure for
therein but pho a word doth fill the brain with memories is it an
ancient story

not very ancient please my lord it happened since the fall of
granada

it is strange that i never heard it then for i dwelt full two months
in this same town and tis not yet forty years since the siege

perhaps it is not true said the stripling innocently and at the
best tis not remarkable enough to have many repeaters tis a very
foolish story

nevertheless i am impatient to hear it

there lived in that town said jacinto a moorish orphan 

a girl demanded the neophyte

a moorish maiden of so obscure a birth that she knew not even the
name that had been borne by her parents but nevertheless señor her
parents as was afterwards found out were of the noblest blood of
granada she was protected and reared in the family of a benevolent
lady who being descended of a moorish parent looked with pity on the
poor orphan of the race of her mother when this maiden was yet in her
very early youth there came a noble cavalier of castile 

a castilian demanded don amador with extraordinary vivacity art
thou a conjurer what was his name

i know not said jacinto

thou learnest thy stories then only by the half said the neophyte
with a degree of displeasure that amazed the youth and doubtless
thou wert forgetful also to acquire the name of the moorish orphan

señor said the page discomposed at the heated manner of his patron
the moorish maiden was called leila

leila cried the neophyte starting to his feet and seizing jacinto
by the arm canst thou tell me aught of leila

señor murmured jacinto in affright

leila the morisca in the house of the señora doña maria de
montefuerte exclaimed don amador wildly dost thou know of her fate
did she sleep under the surges of the bay was she ravished away by
those exile dogs of the mountains now by heaven if thou canst tell
me any thing of that moorish maid i will make thee richer than the
richest moor of granada

at this moment while jacinto speechless with terror gazed on his
patron as doubting if his senses had not deserted him a step rung on
the earth of the terrace and de morla stood at his side

the voice of his friend recalled the bewildered wits of the neophyte he
stared at jacinto and at de morla a deep hue of shame and confusion
flushed over his brow and perceiving that his violence had again thrown
the page into tears he kissed him benevolently on the forehead and
said as tranquilly as he could 

a word will make fools of the wisest i think i was dreaming while
thou wert at thy story be not affrighted jacinto i meant not to scold
thee i was disturbed next next he added with a grievous shudder
i shall be as mad as my kinsman

my brother i am surprised to see thee in this emotion said de
morla

it is nothing responded amador hastily and gloomily i fear there
is a natural infirmity in the brains of all my family i was moved by
an idle story of jacinto into the recollection of a certain sorrowful
event which one day perhaps i will relate to thee but let us
return to our quarters the air comes down chilly from the
mountains it is time we were sleeping

the friends retired from the temple leaving the torch sticking in the
platform for the moon was now so high as to afford a better
illumination they parted at the quarters but don amador after
satisfying himself that the knight of rhodes was slumbering on his
pallet drew jacinto aside to question him further of the orphan of
almeria his solicitude was however doomed to a disappointment the
page was evidently impressed with the fear that don amador was not
without some of the weakness of calavar and adroitly though with great
embarrassment avoided exciting him further

it is a foolish story and i am sorry it displeased my lord said he
when commanded to continue the narrative

it displeased me not i knew a moorish maid of that name in almeria
who was also protected by a christian lady and what was most
remarkable this christian lady was of moorish descent like her of whom
thou wert speaking and like the leila of thy story the leila of my
own memory vanished away from the town before  

señor cried jacinto i did not say she vanished away from almeria
that did not belong to the story

ay indeed is it so heaven guard my wits what made me think it and
thy leila lived in almeria very recently

perhaps ten or fifteen years ago  

pho into what folly may not an ungoverned fancy lead us ten or
fifteen years ago and thou never heardst of the leila that dwelt in
that town within a twelve-month

i señor cried jacinto with surprise

true how is it possible thou couldst thou hast this night stirred
me as by magic i know not by what sorcery thou couldst hit upon that
name

it was the name of the lady said jacinto innocently

ay to be sure there is one mary in heaven and a thousand on
earth why should there not be many leilas did i speak harshly to
thee jacinto thou shouldst not kiss my hand if i did for no
impatience or grief could excuse wrath to one so gentle and unoffending
good night get thee to thy bed and forget not to say thy prayers

so saying and in such disorder of spirits as the page had never before
witnessed in him don amador retired

jacinto was left standing in a narrow passage or corridor on which
opened a long row of chambers with curtained doors wherein slept the
soldiers crowded thickly together in the gallery also at a distance
lay several dusky lumps which by the gleaming of armour about them
were seen to be the bodies of soldiers stretched fast asleep as the boy
turned to retire in the direction of the open portal it was darkened by
the figure of a man entering with a cautious and most stealthy step he
approached and by his voice for there was not light enough yielded by
the few flambeaux stuck against the wall to distinguish features
jacinto recognised his father

i sought thee my child he whispered and saw thee returning with
the hidalgos the watchmen sleep as well as the cannoniers it is as i
told thee art thou ready

dear father stammered the page

speak not above thy breath the curs that are hungering after the
blood of the betrayed mexicans would not scorn to blunt their appetites
on the flesh of the moor have thyself in readiness at a moment's
warning our destinies are written god will not always frown upon us

dear father muttered jacinto we are of the spaniards faith and we
will go back to our country

it cannot be never can it be said abdalla in tones that were not
the less impressive for being uttered in a whisper the hills of thy
childhood the rivers of thy love they are passed away from
thee think of them no more never more shalt thou see them in the
land of barbarians heaven has willed that we should live and die and
be thou reconciled to thy fate for it shall be glorious we live not
for ourselves god brings us hither and for great ends to night did
i hah one of the sleepers stirred in the passage seek some
occasion to speak with me to-morrow on the march whispered abdalla
in the page's ear and then with a gesture for silence he immediately
retired

fuego quien pasea alli grumbled the voice of lazaro as he raised
his head from the floor fu el muchacho i am ever dreaming of that
cursed turk that was at my weasand when baltasar brained him with the
boll of his cross-bow laus tibi christe i have a throat left for
snoring and comforting himself with this assurance before jacinto had
yet vanished from the passage the man-at-arms again slumbered on his
mat




chapter xxv


in the prosecution of his purpose our historian the worthy don
cristobal ixtlilxochitl though ever adhering to his neglected
cavaliers with a generous constancy is sometimes seduced into the
description of events and scenes of a more general character not very
necessarily connected with his main object and which those very authors
whom he censures have made the themes of much prolix writing the
difficulties that beset an historian are ever very great nor is the
least of them found in the necessity of determinating how much or how
little he is called upon to record for though it seems but reasonable
he should take it for granted that his readers are entirely unacquainted
with the matters he is narrating and therefore that he should say all
that can be said this is a point in which all readers will not entirely
agree with him those who have acquired a smattering of his subject
will be offended if he presume to reinstruct them for our own part
not recognizing the right of the ignorant to be gratified at the expense
of the more learned we have studied as much as is possible so to
curtail the exuberances of our original as to present his readers
chiefly with what they cannot know for which reason it will be found
we have eschewed many of the memorable incidents of this famous
campaign in which none of the neglected conquerors bore a considerable
part as well as all those minute descriptions which retard the progress
of the history we therefore despatch in a word the glories of the
morning that dawned over tlascala the gathering together of the
spaniards who upon review were found to muster full thirteen hundred
men and their savage allies two thousand in number commanded as had
been anticipated by talmeccahua of the tribe tizatlan

amid the roar of trumpets and drums and the shouts of a vast people
the glittering and feathered army departed from tlascala and pursuing
its way through those rich savannas covered with the smiling corn and
the juicy aloe which had gained for this valley its name of the land of
bread proceeded onwards towards the holy city cholula

what rocky plains were crossed and what rough sierras surmounted it
needs not to detail before night-fall the whole army moved over the
meadows that environ cholula and there where now the traveller sees
naught but a few wretched natives squatting among their earthen cabins
the adventurers beheld a city of great size with more than four hundred
lofty white towers shining over its spacious dwellings the magnificent
mountains that surrounded it the sublime popocatepetl still breathing
forth its lurid vapours the forbidding iztaccihuatl or the white
woman looking like the shattered ruins of some fallen planet vainly
concealing their deformities under a vestment of snow the sharp and
serrated malinche and last and seen with not the less interest that
it intercepted the view towards home the kingly orizaba looking
peaceful and grand in the east made up such a wall of beauty and
splendour as does not often confine the valleys of men but there is one
mountain in that singular scene which human beings will regard with
even more interest than those peaks which soar so many weary fathoms
above it the stupendous teocalli the monte hecho á manos for it
was piled up by the hands of human beings reared its huge bulk over
the plain and while looking on the stately cypresses that shadowed its
gloomy summit men dreamed as they dream yet of the nations who raised
so astonishing an evidence of their power without leaving any
revealment of their fate whence came they whither went they from the
shadows back to the shadows the farce of ambition the tragedy of
war so many thousand times repeated in the three great theatres that
divided the old world were performed with the same ceremonies of guilt
and misery with the same glory and the same shame in a fourth of
which knowledge had not dreamed the same superstitions which heaped up
the pyramids and the parthenon were at work on the teocallis of
america and the same pride which built a babylon to defy the assaults
of time gave to his mouldering grasp the tombs and the palaces of
palenque the people of tenochtitlan and cholula worshipped their
ancient gods among the ruined altars of an older superstition

great crowds issued from this city the mecca of anahuac to witness
the approach of the spaniards but although they bore the same features
and the same decorations though perhaps of a better material with the
tlascalans it was observed by don amador that they displayed none of
the joy and triumph with which his countrymen had been ushered into
tlascala in place of these their countenances expressed a dull
curiosity and though they kissed the earth and flung the incense as
usual in their manner of salutation they seemed impelled to these
ceremonies more by fear than affection he remarked also with some
surprise that when they came to extend their compliments to the
allies the tlascalans from their chief down to the meanest warrior
requited them only with frowns all these peculiarities were explained
to him by de morla

in ancient days said the cavalier the cholulans were a nation of
republicans like the tlascalans and united with them in a fraternal
league against their common enemies the mexicans in course of time
however the people of the holy city were gained over by the bribes or
promises of the foe and entering into a secret treaty they obeyed its
provisions so well as to throw off the mask on the occasion of a great
battle wherein they perfidiously turned against their friends and
aided by the mexicans defeated them with great slaughter from that
day they have remained the true vassals of mexico and from that day
the tlascalans have not ceased to regard them with the most deadly and
unrelenting hatred

the hatred is just and i marvel they do not fall upon these base
knaves forthwith said amador

it is the command of don hernan that tlascala shall now preserve her
wrath for tenochtitlan and such is his influence that though he
cannot allay the heart-burnings yet can he with a word restrain the
hands of his allies concerning the gloomy indifference of these
people continued de morla as now manifested it needs only to inform
you how we discovered or rather for i will not afflict you with the
details how we punished a similar treachery wherein they meditated
our own destruction more than half a year ago when we entered their
town on our march to mexico having discovered their plot to destroy
us we met them with a perfidious craft which might have been rendered
excusable by their own had we like them been demi-barbarians but
which as we are really civilized and christian men i cannot help
esteeming both dishonest and atrocious we assembled their nobles and
priests in the court of the building we occupied and having closed the
gates and charged them once or twice with their guilt we fell upon
them and some of them having escaped and roused the citizens we
carried the war into the streets and up to the temples and so well did
we prosper that day and the day that followed for we fought them
during two entire days that with the assistance of our tlascalans of
whom we had an army with us we slaughtered full six thousand of them
and that without losing the life of a single spaniard

dios mio cried don amador we had not so many killed in all the
siege of rhodes six thousand men i am not certain that even treachery
could excuse the destruction of so many lives

it was a bloody and most awful spectacle said de morla with feeling
we drove the naked wretches i say naked señor for we gave them no
time to arm to the pyramids especially to that which holds the altar
of their chief god the god of the air and here señor it was
melancholy to see the miserable desperation with which they died for
having at first refused them quarter they declined to receive it
when pity moved us afterwards to grant it about the court of this
pyramid there were many wooden buildings as well as tabernacles of the
like material among the towers on the top these we fired and thus
attacked them with arms and flames what ruin the fire failed to inflict
on the temple they accomplished with their own hands for señor
having a superstitious belief that the moment a sacrilegious hand
should tear away the foundations of their great temple floods should
burst out from the earth to whelm the impious violator they began to
raze it with their own hands willing in their madness to perish by
the wrath of their god so that their enemies should perish with them i
cannot express to you the horrible howls with which they beheld the
fragments fall from the walls of the pyramid without calling up the
watery earthquake then indeed with these howls they ran to the
summit and crazily pitched themselves into the burning towers or flung
themselves from the dizzy top as if in their despair thinking that
even their gods had deserted them

it was an awful chastisement and i fear me more awful than just
said amador after this it is not wonderful the men of cholula should
not receive us with joy

many evidences of the horrors of that dreadful day were yet revealed as
don amador entered into the city the marks of fire were left on various
houses of stone and here and there were vacuities covered with
blackened wrecks where doubtless had stood more humble and
combustible fabrics

the countenance of cortes was observed to be darkened by a frown as he
rode through this well-remembered scene of his cruelty but perhaps he
thought less of remorse and penitence than of the spirit of hatred and
desperation evinced by his victims as if in truth the late
occurrences at mexico had persuaded him that a similar spirit was
waking and awaiting him there it was in his angry moment and just as
he halted at the portals of a large court-yard wherein stood the palace
he had chosen for his quarters that two indians of an appearance
superior to any don amador had yet seen and followed by a train of
attendants bearing heavy burthens suddenly passed from the crowd of
cholulans and approached the general

señor said de morla in a low voice to his friend observe these
new ambassadors they are of the noblest blood of the city the
elder he that hath the gold grains hanging to his nostrils in token
that he belongs to the order of teuctli or princes by merit is one
of the lords of the four quarters of mexico the quarter tlatelolco
wherein is our garrison his name itzquauhtzin will be to you
unpronounceable the youth that bears himself so loftily is no less
than a nephew of the king himself and the scarlet fillet around his
hair denotes that he has arrived at the dignity of what we should call
a chief commander a military rank that not even the king can claim
without having performed great actions in the field tis a sore day for
montezuma when he sends us such princely ambassadors i will press
forward and do the office of interpreter for destiny love and my
mother wit together have given me more of the mexican jargon than any
of my companions

as the ambassadors approached don amador had leisure to observe them
both were of good stature and countenance their loins were girt with
tunics of white cotton cloth studded and bordered with bunches of
feathers and hanging as low as the knee and over the shoulders of both
were hung large mantles of many brilliant colours curiously interwoven
their ends so knotted together in front as to fall down in graceful
folds half concealing the swarthy chest their sandals were secured
with scarlet thongs crossed and gartered to the calf their raven
locks which were of great length were knotted together in a most
fantastic manner with ribands from the points of which on the head of
the elder depended many little ornaments that seemed jewels of gold
and precious stones while from the fillets that braided the hair of
the younger besides an abundance of the same ornaments there were many
tufts of crimson cotton-down swinging to and fro in the wind in
addition to these badges of military distinction for every tuft thus
worn was the reward and evidence of some valiant exploit this young
prince he seemed not above twenty-five years old wore as had been
noticed by de morla the red fillet of the house of darts an order
not so much of nobility as of knighthood entitling its possessor to the
command of an army his bearing was indeed lofty but not disdainful
and though when making his obeisance he neither stooped so low nor
kissed his hand with so much humility as his companion this seemed to
proceed more from a consciousness of his own rank than from any
disrespect to the christian leader

what will these dogs with me now cried cortes at whose feet for he
had dismounted the attendants had thrown their burthens and were
proceeding to display their contents doth montezuma think to appease
me for the blood of my brothers and pay for spanish lives with robes of
cotton and trinkets of gold what say the hounds

they say responded de morla to his angry general that the king
welcomes you back again to his dominions to give him reparation for the
slaughter of his people

hah exclaimed the leader fiercely doth he beard me with complaint
when i look for penitence and supplication

in token of his love and of his assured persuasion that you now return
to punish the murderers of his subjects and then to withdraw your
followers from his city for ever said de morla giving his attention
less to cortes than to the lord of tlatelolco he sends you these
garments to protect the bodies of your new friends from the snows of
ithualco as well as  

the slave cried don hernan spurning the pack that lay at his foot
and scattering its gaudy textures over the earth if he give me no mail
to protect my friends from the knives of his assassins i will trample
even upon his false heart as i do upon his worthless tribute

shall i translate your excellency's answer word for word said de
morla tranquilly if it be left to myself i should much prefer
veiling it in such palatable language as my limited knowledge will
afford

but the scowling general had already turned away as if to humble the
ambassadors with the strongest evidence of contempt and to prove the
extremity of his displeasure and it needed no interpretation of words
to convince the noble savages of the futileness of their ministry the
lord of tlatelolco bowed again to the earth and again kissed his hand
as if in humble resignation while the retreating figure of don hernan
vanished under the low door of his dwelling but the younger envoy
instead of imitating him drew himself proudly up and looked after the
general with a composure that changed as don amador thought to a
smile but if such a mark of satisfaction for it bore more the
character of elation than contempt did illuminate the bronzed visage
of the prince it remained not there for an instant he cast a quiet and
grave eye upon the curious cavaliers who surrounded him and then
beckoning his attendants from their packs he strode with his
companion composedly away

in my mind said the neophyte following him with his eye and rather
soliloquizing than addressing himself to any of the neighbouring
cavaliers there was more of dignity and contempt in the smile of that
heathen prince than in all the rage of my friend don hernan

truly he is a very proper-looking and well-demeanoured knave said
the voice of duero but the general has some deep policy at the bottom
of all this anger

by my faith i think so now for the first time exclaimed the
neophyte for although unable to see the drift of such a stratagem i
cannot believe that the señor cortes would adopt a course that seems to
savour so much of injustice without a very discreet and politic
object

here the discourse of the cavaliers was cut short by the sudden
appearance of fabueno the secretary

what wilt thou lorenzo said his patron has lazaro again refused to
tilt with thee i very much commend the zeal with which thou pursuest
thine exercises but thou shouldst remember that lazaro may sometimes
be weary after a day's march

señor tis not that said the secretary but just now as baltasar
told me he saw the page jacinto very rudely haled away by one of
cortes's grooms and i thought your favour might be glad to know for
the boy seemed frighted

i will straightway see that no wrong be done him even by the general
said amador quickly moving toward the door into which he had seen
cortes enter i marvel very much that my good knight did not protect
him

señor said fabueno the knight is in greater disorder to-day than
yesterday he took no note of anybody when we came to this palace but
instantly concealed himself in some distant chamber where a soldier
told me he was scourging himself

thou shouldst not talk with the soldiers of calavar said amador
with a sigh get thee to marco if my kinsman need me i will presently
be with him

thus saying he discharged the secretary at the door and those servants
who guarded it not presuming to deny admittance to a man of such rank
he was immediately ushered into the presence of cortes




chapter xxvi


in a low but spacious apartment the walls and floor of which were both
covered with mats the neophyte found don hernan attended by sandoval
and one or two other cavaliers busy to all appearance in the
examination of the page and a moorish slave of cortes's own household
whom he seemed to confront with the other it needed no more than the
tears which amador discovered on the cheeks of the youth to rouse him
to a feeling very like anger

señor said he stepping forward to the side of jacinto and looking
gravely on his judge i have exercised the privilege of a master or
rather as i should say of a servant for this boy is in the ward of
don gabriel whom i myself follow to enter into your presence without
the ceremony of a previous request for which liberty if it offend you
i ask your pardon but i was told the boy jacinto was dragged away by
one of your excellency's menials and i claim as asking in the stead of
his master to know for what offence

by my conscience for none at all said cortes courteously at
least for none of his own commission and had he truly been guilty
both of treason and desertion i should have pardoned him for the
precocious shrewdness of his answers señor continued the general it
was my intention to beseech your presence at this examination and
nothing but the suddenness of it as well as the present defection among
my servants could have caused me to defer the invitation for a moment
by my conscience you have a treasure of wisdom in this boy

this was an assurance don amador did by no means deny for in addition
to the singular address with which he adapted himself to the humours of
the knight he had seen in jacinto many other evidences of a discretion
so much in advance of his years as to cause him no little wonder added
to which the incident of the past night in which the page had stumbled
upon a name and indeed for the after explanations had not removed the
first impression a story which he did not remember to have breathed
to any living creature had attached to the youth a sort of respect that
bordered almost on superstition but don hernan gave the cavalier no
time for reflections

señor don amador said he the fault if there be any which we are
now striving to investigate lies not in the page but in his father
sidi abdalla the cannonier who is charged by my varlet here this
unconverted heathen to be meditating if not now engaged in the
accomplishment of a very heinous and yet let me add for your
satisfaction a very improbable conspiracy this is charged to be
nothing less than desertion from our standard with a design to throw
himself into the arms of the enemy and what makes the matter worse
allowing it for a moment to be credible is that he plots to carry away
with him all his countrymen who are slaves with us in number i think
somewhat above half a score

this is assuredly said don amador a very vile offence for which
if guilty i must needs allow the sidi deserves to suffer yet i agree
with your excellency the design seems quite as incredible as its
accomplishment must be impossible

no one said cortes could have shown this with better argument than
this same weeping boy for first said he tis wrong to receive the
accusation of an unconverted man against a christian and such an
infidel hound is yacub whom i will at some future day give over to
be burned for his idolatry but at present i cannot spare so precious
a servant for he is an excellent cook and a good maker of arrow-heads
for the crossbowmen in addition to this argument señor continued
the general the boy advances me another of still more force for
how says he shrewdly would my father leave his christian masters
and protectors to go over to savages whose language he cannot
understand and who would sacrifice him as a victim to their detestable
gods which gods may heaven sink into the pit whence they came and i
say amen now though one part of this argument is answered by the
subtle art of yacub for whether he have yacub or any other moor who
hath picked up something of the tongue to interpret for him or
whether he have no interpreter at all it is not the less certain that
the moment he entrusts himself into the power of the barbarians that
moment will he be clapped into a great cage like a wild beast and
devoured what time he is fat enough for the maws of their diabolical
divinities i say nevertheless for that very reason it is not
probable abdalla should be so besotted a fool

please your highness said yacub with the obstinacy of one who
presumed on his master's indulgence or on the strength of his cause
he urged me last night at the pyramid of tlascala and this noble
gentleman as well as this boy saw me in his company

don amador started as he perceived the eyes of yacub fastened on him
as well as those of every other individual in the chamber the look that
jacinto gave him was one of terror and beseeching earnestness

señor said he hesitating a little though what i have to say may
in part confirm the charge of this fellow i cannot scruple to speak
it and though i may not aver on mine own knowledge that i beheld
last night either this man yacub or his countryman abdalla yet must
i admit that i saw stealing by the basis of that heathen temple three
men whom my friend de morla who accompanied me pronounced to be the
cannonier and two of your excellency's servants jacinto wrung his
hands but what passed between them the cavalier went on whether
they were hatching a plot or discoursing together of their hard fate
as would seem reasonable for men like them that have neither friends
nor country i cannot take upon me to pronounce though from what i
know of abdalla as a courageous and honest man i am fain to think
their communication could not have been of an evil nature

he said muttered the treacherous moor that provided he had but some
one to interpret for him he had no fear of the mexicans but could
promise us much favour and wealth from their kings by virtue of
certain arts possessed by his son and thereby he hinted the boy was an
enchanter

all started at this sudden announcement and none more than don amador
de leste for though as he had said himself he was in his cooler
moments very sceptical in affairs of magic this incredulity was no
consequence either of nature or education and besides the shock that
had been given to his doubts by the disclosures of de morla the story
of jacinto so unaccountably begun and so abruptly terminated had made
a deeper impression on his mind than such a trifle should its
importance had been imputed by his own feelings but either he did not
remember or he knew not that he stared at jacinto who stood pale as
death and trembling now rolling his eyes wildly on don hernan and now
on his patron before the latter could summon composure to answer he
was relieved by the general saying humorously 

i cannot doubt that this little caitiff is an enchanter because he
has the faculty of exciting both admiration and pity in an eminent
degree and though i doubt the power of such a charm over the ears of
barbarians that delight in the thunder of wooden drums and the yelling
uproar of sea-shell trumpets yet i can believe for it has been told me
by good judges that the art with which he touches his lute is as
magical as it is marvellous

the boy clasped his hands in delight and seemed as if he would have
thrown himself at the feet of his judge

wherefore my most worthy and honoured friend continued cortes have
no fear that i will rob thee of so serviceable a henchman i could not
burn so pretty a log in the fire that was kindled for one who had sold
his soul and i cannot by allowing the claims of a rival to lawful
magic kill my astrologer botello with envy

he has a talisman round his neck wherein is a devil that i have
overheard him talking to said the resolute yacub

thou art an ass said cortes laughing at the trepidation of jacinto
for he again turned pale and lifted his hands to his neck as if both
to confess and guard his treasure tis some gewgaw given him by his
mother or perhaps by some sweetheart wench for these moorish boys
are in love when a christian urchin is yet in his grammar señor he
addressed himself to the neophyte you may perceive that the very
grossness of yacub's credulity has destroyed the force of his testimony
for he who can believe such a junior as this to be a conjurer will give
credit to any other ridiculous imagination i will now confess to you
that beside these charges which are already answered there is only
one more circumstance against abdalla and that is that at the very
moment of our halt and while engaged in the audience with those
ambassadors whom i treated somewhat harshly but for a cunning
purpose which you will soon understand he vanished away in company
with another dog of my household called ayub and hath not been since
seen nevertheless i attach no more importance to this matter than to
the others but i swear to heaven if he be caught stealing turkeys or
any such trumpery things from these villains of cholula i will give him
to the bastinado

señor said amador earnestly the sidi is of too magnanimous a
nature to steal turkeys

i will take don amador's word for it then but i see the page is still
in some mortal fright as dreading if he remain longer in our presence
lest some new accusation should be brought against him

if jacinto be absolved from censure and is no longer desired by your
excellency i will withdraw him from your presence and thanking you
señor for the mildness with which you have questioned him i will beg
your permission to take my own leave

don hernan bowed low as the neophyte withdrew with jacinto he waved
his hand to yacub and the moor immediately retired

what think ye now my masters he cried as soon as these were out of
hearing is it possible this stupid cannonier hath either the wit or
the spirit to hatch me a brood of treason to help the kites of mexico

if he have said sandoval he should hang

very true son gonzalo said the general for in our condition to be
suspected should be a crime worthy death especially in so contemptible
a creature as a moor didst thou observe what mortal consternation
beset our worthy and very precise friend don amador when yacub called
his boy a conjurer

i think that should be examined into said sandoval for if he be
twill be well to give him to botello as a pupil lest botello should
be some day knocked on the head as is not improbable from his ever
thrusting it into jeopardy and we be left without a diviner

by my conscience tis well thought on said cortes laughing for
this boy if he had but as good a reputation is much superior in
docility as well as shrewder in apprehension whereas botello hath such
a thick-head enthusiasm for his art as to be somewhat unmanageable
and every now and then he prophesies me all wrong as was the case
when he anointed the wound of de leste's secretary and stupidly told
him twould be well in a few hours and yet all the camp knew the lad
was near losing his arm

botello excuses himself there said sandoval by protesting that his
injunctions were disobeyed especially that wherein he charged the youth
not to touch his weapon for twenty-four hours whereas he killed a man
that very night on the pyramid very courageously as i
witnessed though the man was hurt before for i had charged him with
my own partisan

amigo mio said cortes abruptly in the matter of these moors i
must have thine aidance i know not how it may have entered into the
brain of such a boor to suppose he could make himself useful to the
frowning infidels in tenochtitlan but i would sooner give them a dead
lion than a living dog if thou hast any very cunning and discreet
rogues among thy fighting men send them in numbers of two and three
secretly about the city and especially charge some that they watch at
the gate that opens to mexico

i will do so said sandoval and i will myself hunt about the town
till i find the rascal shall i kill him

if it appear to thee he is deserting let him be slain in the act as
for ayub if he be found in the cannonier's company bring me him alive
i will hang him for an example for in his death shall no intercessor be
offended i have no doubt that for the boy's sake both don amador and
calavar would beg for abdalla if he were brought a prisoner and it
would grieve me to deny them kill him then my son if thou findest
him and art persuaded he is a deserter

with this charge very emphatically pronounced and very composedly
received the friends separated




chapter xxvii


during the whole time of the march from tlascala to cholula an unusual
gloom lay upon the spirits of calavar and so great was his abstraction
that though pursuing his way with a sort of instinct he remained as
insensible to the presence of his kinsman as to the attentions of his
followers he rode at a distance from the rear of the army and such was
the immobility of his limbs and features saving when stung by some
secret thought he raised his ghastly eyes to heaven that a stranger
passing him on the path might have deemed that his grave charger moved
along under the weight of a stiffened corse not yet disrobed of its
arms rather than that of a living cavalier when the army halted at
noon to take food he retired with his attendants to the shadow of a
tree where without dismounting or receiving the fruits which jacinto
had gathered to tempt him to eat he sat in the same heavy stupor
until the march was resumed neither food nor water crossed his lips
during the entire day nor did the neophyte suffer any to be proffered
him when he came to reflect that this day was an anniversary which the
knight was ever accustomed to observe with the most ascetic abstinence
and humiliation for this reason also though lamenting the necessity
of such an observance he neither presumed himself to vex his kinsman
with attentions nor suffered any others to intrude upon his privacy
excepting indeed the moorish page whose gentle arts were so wont to
dispel the gathering clouds but this day even jacinto failed to
attract his notice and despairing of the power of any thing but time
to terminate the paroxysm he ceased his efforts and contented himself
with keeping a distant watch on all don gabriel's movements lest some
disaster might happen to him on the journey no sooner as had been
hinted by fabueno had the army arrived at its quarters in the sacred
city than the knight betook him to the solitude of a chamber in the
very spacious building where after a time he so far shook off his
lethargy as to desire the presence of the chaplain with whom he had
remained ever since engaged in his devotions hither guided by marco
came now don amador conducting jacinto the interview with cortes had
swallowed up more than an hour and when the neophyte stood before the
curtained door of his kinsman a light flashing through the irregular
folds dispelled the darkness of the chamber as he paused for an
instant he heard the low voice of the priest saying

sin no more with doubt spera in deo grace is in heaven and mercy
knoweth no bounds misereatur tui omnipotens deus

a few other murmurs came to his ear and then the chaplain pushing
aside the curtain issued from the apartment

heaven be with thee my son he said to amador thy kinsman is
greatly disordered but not so much now as before

is it fitting i should enter father

thy presence may be grateful to him but surely he continued in an
under voice it were better for the unhappy knight if he were among
the priests and physicians of his own land a sore madness afflicts him
he thinks himself beset with spectres i would thou hadst him in
spain

if heaven grant us that grace said amador sorrowfully but he
believes that god will call him to his rest among the heathen tarry
thou at the door jacinto he went on when the father had departed
have thyself in readiness with thy lute for perhaps he may be
prevailed upon to hear thee sing in which case i have much hope the
evil spirit will depart from him

he passed into the chamber the knight was on his knees before a little
crucifix which he had placed on a massive indian chair but though he
beat his bosom with a heavy hand no sound of prayer came from his lips
don amador placed himself at his side and stood in reverential silence
until his kinsman heaving a deep sigh rose up and turning his haggard
countenance towards him said 

neither penance nor prayer neither the remorse of the heart nor the
benediction of the priest can wipe away the sorrow that comes from sin
god alone is the forgiver but god will not always forgive

say not so my father cried amador earnestly for it is a deep
crime to think that heaven is not ever merciful

keep thyself free from the stain of blood-guiltiness said don
gabriel with a manner so mild that the neophyte had good hope the fit
had indeed left him and mercy will not be denied thee have i not
afflicted thee my friend he continued faintly thou wilt have much
to forgive me but not long i will remember in my death hour that
thou hast not forsaken me

never will i again leave thee said amador fervently i forgot thee
once and besides the pang of contrition for that act heaven punished
me with a grief that i should not have known had i remained by thy
side but now my father wilt thou not eat and drink and suffer
jacinto to sing to thee

i may neither eat nor drink this night said calavar but methinks i
can hear the innocent orphan chant the praises of the virgin for to
such she will listen

amador strode to the door but jacinto had vanished he had stolen away
the moment that his patron entered

perhaps he has gone to fetch his instrument run thou in search of him
marco and bid him hasten

before the novice could again address himself to his kinsman marco
returned the page was not to be found the sentinel at the door had
seen him pass into the court-yard but whether he had re-entered or not
he knew not he had not noted

is it possible thought don amador that the boy could so wilfully
disobey me perhaps the general hath sent for him again for
notwithstanding all his protestations of satisfaction it seemed to me
that while he spoke there was still a something lurking in his eye
which boded no good to abdalla i will look for the boy myself

he charged marco to remain by his lord sought an audience with the
general whom he found engaged in earnest debate with duero de leon
and other high officers don hernan satisfied him that he had not sent
for jacinto that he had not thought of abdalla and with an apology
for his intrusion the novice instantly withdrew

the story is true said cortes with a frown and that pestilent young
cub of heathenism has fled to give the traitor warning but he that
passes unquestioned at the gate where sandoval stands the watchman
must have the devil for his leader or at least his companion i hope
he will not murder the boy for he is a favourite with calavar a subtle
knave a good twangler and it is natural he should play me even a
knave's trick for his father

in the meanwhile after hunting in vain about the different quarters of
the building as well as the court-yard for the vanished jacinto the
novice returned to the chamber of his kinsman but calavar also had
disappeared not indeed in disorder but in great apparent
tranquillity and he had commanded marco not to follow him

he has gone to the fields muttered amador such is his practice at
this season but there is no good can come of solitude i know not what
to think of that boy but assuredly this time it will be but my duty
to censure him and so saying don amador also passed into the open
air




chapter xxviii


it was late in the night a horizontal moon flung the long shadows of
the houses over the wide streets of cholula when the knight calavar
wrapped in his black mantle strode along through the deserted city
with no definite object before him unless to fly or perhaps to give
way in solitude to the bitter thoughts that oppressed him he suffered
himself to be guided as much by accident as by his wayward impulses and
as he passed on at every step some mutation of his fancies or some
trivial incident on the way conspired to recall his disorder now as a
bat flitted by or an owl flew hooting from its perch among some of
those ruins which yet raised their broken and blackened walls in
memory of the cruelty of his countrymen the knight started aghast and
a mortal fear came over him for in these sounds and sights his
disturbed senses discovered the signs of the furies that persecuted him
and even the night-breeze wailing round some lonely corner or
whispering among the shrubbery of a devastated garden seemed to him the
cries of haunting spirits

miserere mei deus muttered don gabriel as a tree bowing away from
the wind let down a moonbeam through a fissure on his path the white
visage will not leave me heavy was the sin heavy is the punishment
for even mine own fancies are become my chastisers

thus at times conscious in part of his infirmity and yet yielding
ever with the feebleness of a child to the influence of unreal
horrors he wandered about sometimes driven from his path by what
seemed a gaunt spectre flitting before him sometimes impelled onwards
by a terror that followed behind thus he roved about he knew not
whither until he found himself by chance in the neighbourhood of the
great temple the scene of the chief atrocities enacted on that day
which has been called by a just metonymy the massacre of cholula here
it was as had been mentioned by de morla that the miserable natives
huddled together in despair had made their last cry to their gods and
perished under the steel and flames of the christians and the memorials
of their fate were as plainly written as if the tragedy had been the
work of the previous day no carcasses indeed lay crowded among the
ruins no embers smouldered on the square weeds had grown upon the
place of murder as if fattening on the blood that had besprinkled their
roots life had utterly vanished from the spot and it presented the
appearance of a desert in the bosom of a populous city

a great wall running round the temple had enclosed it in a large
court once covered with the houses of priests and devotees the wall
was shattered and fallen the dwellings burned and demolished and the
pyramid itself crumbling into ruins lay like the body of some huge
monster among its severed and decaying members the flags of stone
tumbled by the victims in their fury from its sides and terraces
though they had not called up the subterraneous rivers had exposed the
perishable earth that composed the body of the mound to the
vicissitudes of the weather and under the heavy tropical rains it was
washing rapidly away the sanctuaries yet stood on the summit but with
their walls mutilated and their roofs burnt and they served only to
make the horror picturesque a wooden cross of colossal dimensions
raised by the conquerors in impious attestation that god had aided them
in the labour of slaughter flung high its rugged arms towering above
the broken turrets and gave the finish of superstition to the monument
of wrath it was a place of ruins dark lugubrious and forbidding and
as don gabriel strode among the massive fragments he found himself in a
theatre congenial with his gloomy and wrecking spirit

it was not without many feelings of dismay that he plunged among the
ruins for his imagination converted each shattered block into a living
phantasm but still he moved on as if urged by some irresistible
impulse entangling himself in the labyrinth of decay until he scarcely
knew whither to direct his steps whether it was reality or some
coinage of his brain that presented the spectacle he knew not but he
was arrested in his toilsome progress by the apparition of several
figures rising suddenly among the ruins and as suddenly vanishing

heaven pity me he cried they come feathered like the fiends of the
infidel but i care not so they bring no more the white face that is
so ghastly and yet this is her day this is her day

perhaps it was his imagination that decked out the spectres with such
ornaments but a less heated spectator might have discovered in them
only the figures of strolling savages with his spirits strongly
agitated his brain excited for the reception of any chimera he
followed the direction in which these figures seemed to have vanished
and this bringing him round a corner of the pyramid into the moonshine
he instantly found himself confronted with a spectacle that froze his
blood with horror in a spot where the ruins had given space for the
growth of weeds and grass and where the vision could not be so easily
confounded illuminated by the moonbeams as if by the lustre of the
day he beheld a figure seemingly of a woman clad in robes of white
of an oriental habit full before him and turning upon him a
countenance as wan as death

miserere mei deus cried the knight dropping on his knees and
bowing his forehead to the earth if thou comest to persecute me yet i
am here and i have not forgot thee

the murmur as of a voice fell on his ear but it brought with it no
intelligence he raised his eye dark shadows flitted before him yet
he saw nothing save the apparition in white it stood yet in his view
and still the pallid visage dazzled him with its unnatural radiance and
beauty

miserere mei miserere mei he cried rising to his feet and
tottering forwards i live but to lament thee and i breathe but to
repent speak to me daughter of the alpujarras speak to me and let me
die

as he spoke the vision moved gently and slowly away he rushed
forwards but with knees smiting together and as the white visage
turned upon him again with its melancholy loveliness and with a
gesture as of warning or terror his brain spun round his sight failed
him and he fell to the earth in a deep swoon




chapter xxix


motion is the life of the sea the surge dashes along in its course
while the watery particles that gave it bulk and form remain in their
place to renew and continue the coming billows heaving to each
successive oscillation but not departing with it thus the mind an
ocean more vast and unfathomable than that which washes our
planet fluctuates under the impulses of its stormy nature and passes
not away until the last agitation like that which shall swallow up the
sea or convert its elements into a new matter lifts it from its
continent and introduces it to a new existence emotion is its life
each surge of which seems to bear it leagues from its resting-place and
yet it remains passively to abide and figure forth the influence of new
commotions thus passed the billow through the spirit of calavar and
when it had vanished the spirit ceased from its tumult subsided and
lay in tranquillity to await other shocks for others were
coming when he awoke from his lethargy his head was supported on the
knee of a human being who chafed his temple and hands and bowed his
body as well as his feeble strength allowed to recall the knight to
life don gabriel raised his eyes to this benignant and ministering
creature and in the disturbed visage that hung over his own
thought for his mind was yet wandering he beheld the pallid features
of the vision

i know thee and i am ready cried don gabriel pity me and forgive
me for i die at thy feet as thou didst at mine

señor mio i am jacinto exclaimed the page for it was he
frightened at the distraction of the knight thy page thy poor page
jacinto

is it so indeed said calavar surveying him wildly and the spectre
that did but now smite me to the earth hath she left me

dear master there is no spectre with us said the moorish boy we
are alone among the ruins

god be thanked said the knight vehemently for if i should look on
it more i should die yet would that i could would that i could for
in death there is peace in the grave there is forgetfulness this
time was it no delusion either of the senses or the brain mine
eye-sight was clear my head sane and i saw it as i see mine own
despair pray for me boy he continued falling on his knees and
dragging the page down beside him pray for me he cried gazing
piteously at the youth pray for me god will listen to thy prayers
for thou art innocent and i am miserable pray that god may forgive me
and suffer me to die for this is the day of my sin

dear master said the page trembling let us return to our friends

thou wilt not pray thou wilt not beseech god for me said calavar
mournfully thou wilt be merciful when thou knowest my misery heaven
sends thee for mine intercessor i confess to thee as to heaven for
thou art without sin manhood brings guile and impurity evil deeds and
malign thoughts but a child is pure in the eyes of god and the prayers
of his lips will be as incense when wrath turns from the beseeching of
men hear thou my sin and then if heaven bid thee not to curse then
pray for me boy then pray for me

in great perturbation for he knew not how to check the knight's
distraction and feared its increasing violence jacinto knelt staring
at him his hands fettered in the grasp of his master who returning
his gaze with such looks of wo and contrition as a penitent may give to
heaven said wildly yet not incoherently 

deeply dyed with sin am i and sharply scourged with retribution age
comes upon me before its time but brings me nothing but memory nothing
but memory gray hairs and wrinkles disease and feebleness are the
portions of my manhood for my youth was sinful and guilt has made me
old oh that i might see the days when i was like to thee when i was
like to thee jacinto when i knew innocence and offended not god but
the virtues of childhood weigh not in the balance against the crimes of
after years as the child dieth heaven opens to him as the man
sinneth so doth he perish miserere mei deus and forgive me my day
in the alpujarras

as don gabriel pronounced the name of those mountains wherein jacinto
knew his father had drawn the first breath of life and around which
was shed for every moor such interest as belongs to those places where
our fathers have fought and bled the page began to listen with
curiosity although his alarm had not altogether subsided

long years have passed many days of peril and disaster have come and
gone and yet i have not forgotten the alpujarras cried calavar
shivering as he uttered the word for there did joy smile and hope
sicken and fury give me to clouds and darkness forever those hills
were the haunts of thy forefathers jacinto and there after the royal
city had fallen and granada was ruled by the monarchs of spain they
fled for refuge all those noble moriscos who were resolute to die in
their own mistaken faith as well in after years as many others who
had truly embraced the religion of christ but were suspected by the
bigoted of our people and persecuted with rigour how many wars were
declared against those unhappy fugitives now to break down the last
strong hold of the infidel and now to punish the suspected
christian thou must know if thy sire be a true moor of granada in
mine early youth and in one of the later crusades that were proclaimed
against those misguided mountaineers went i to win the name and the
laurels of a cavalier would that i had never won them or that they had
come to me dead on the battle-field know then jacinto that my
nineteenth summer had not yet fled from me when i first drew my sword
in conflict with men but if i won me reputation at that green age it
was because heaven was minded to show me that shame and sorrow could
come as early in those days the royal and noble blood of granada had
not been drawn from every vein many of the princely descendants of the
abencerrages the aliatars the ganzuls and the zegris still dwelt
among the mountains and forgetting their hereditary feuds united
together in common resistance against the spaniards with such men for
enemies respected alike for their birth and their valour the war was
not always a history of rapine and barbarity and sometimes there
happened such passages of courtesy and magnanimity between the christian
and moorish cavaliers as recalled the memory of the days of chivalry
and honour among others who made experience of the heroic greatness of
mind of the infidel princes was i myself for in a battle wherein the
moors prevailed against us i was left wounded and unhorsed on the
field to perish or to remain a prisoner in their hands in that
melancholy condition while i commended my soul to god as not thinking
i could escape from death a moorish warrior of majestic appearance and
a soul still more lofty approached and had pity on my helplessness
instead of slaying me outright as i truly expected thou art noble
said he for i have seen thy deeds and though this day thou hast
shed the blood of a zegri thou shalt not perish like a dog mount my
horse and fly lest the approaching squadrons destroy thee and in
memory of this deed be thou sometimes merciful to the people of
alharef then knew i that this was alharef ben-ismail the most noble
of the zegris a youth famous even among the spaniards for his
courage and humanity and in gratitude and love for he was a christian
proselyte i pledged him my faith and swore with him the vows of a true
friendship how i have kept mine oath alharef he cried lifting his
eyes to the spangled heaven thou knowest for sometimes thou art
with my punisher

the knight paused an instant in sorrowful emotion while jacinto borne
by curiosity beyond the bounds of fear bent his head to listen then
making the sign of the cross and repeating his brief prayer the
cavalier resumed his narrative

as my ingratitude was greater than that of other men so is my sin for
another act of benevolence shall weigh against me for ever why did i
not die with my people when the smiles of perfidy conducted us to the
hills and the sword was drawn upon us sleeping that night there was
but one escaped the cruel and bloody stratagem and i again owed my
life to the virtues of a moor pity me heaven for thou didst send me
an angel and i repaid thy mercy with the thankfulness of a
fiend know then jacinto that in the village wherein was devised
and accomplished the murder of my unsuspecting companions dwelt one
that now liveth in heaven miserere mei miserere mei for she was noble
and fair and wept at the baseness of her kindred she covered the
bleeding cavalier with her mantle concealed him from the fury that was
unrelenting and when she had healed his wounds guided him in secret
from the den of devils and dismissed him in safety near to the camp of
his countrymen know thou now boy that this maiden was zayda the
flower of all those hills and the star that made them dearer to me than
the heaven that was above them and more thought i of those green peaks
and shady valleys that encompassed my love than the castle of my sire
or the church wherein rested the bones of my mother miserere mei
miserere mei for the faith that was pledged was broken my lady slept
in the arms of alharef and my heart was turned to blackness now thou
shalt hear me and pray for me continued don gabriel with a look of
the wildest and intensest despair for my sin is greater than i can
bear now shalt thou hear how i cursed those whom i had sworn to love
how i sharpened my sword and with vengeance and fury went against the
village of my betrayers oh god how thou didst harden our hearts when
we gave their houses to the flames and their old men and children to
swords and spears when we looked not at misery and listened not to
supplication but slew slew slew as though we struck at beasts and
not at human creatures thou sworest an oath cried alharef i
laughed for i knew i should drink his blood be merciful to my
people he cried and i struck him with my sabre oho continued the
knight springing to his feet wringing the page's hands and glaring at
him with the countenance of a demon when he fled from me bleeding my
heart was full of joy and i followed him with yells of
transport this is the day i tell thee this is the day and the
hour for night could not hide him and zayda ay zayda zayda when
she shielded him with her bosom when she threw herself before
him miserere mei deus miserere mei deus

and zayda cried the page meeting his gaze with looks scarcely less
expressive of wildness

curse me or pray for me said the knight for i slew her

the boy recoiled don gabriel fell on his knees and with a voice husky
and feeble as a child's cried

i know now that thou cursest me for thou lookest on me with horror
the innocent will not pray for the guilty the pure and holy have no
pity for devils curse me then for her kindred vanished from the earth
and she with them curse me for i left not a drop of her blood flowing
in human veins and none in her's curse me for i am her murderer and
i have not forgot it curse me for god has forsaken me and nightly
her pale face glitters on me with reproach curse me for i am
miserable

while don gabriel still grovelled on the earth and while the page stood
yet regarding him with terror suddenly there came to the ears of both
the shouts of soldiers mingled with the roar of firelocks and as
three or four cross-bow shafts rattled against the sides of the pyramid
there were visible in the moonlight as many figures of men running among
the ruins new leaping over now darting around the fragments as if
flying for their lives from a party of armed men who were seen rushing
after them on the square the knight rose bewildered and as if in the
instinct of protection again grasped the hand of the page but now the
emotions which had agitated the master seemed transferred to his
follower and jacinto trembling and struggling cried 

señor mio let me loose for the sake of heaven for the sake of the
zayda whom you slew let me go for they are murdering my father

but don gabriel in the confusion of his mind still retained his grasp
and very providentially as it appeared for at that very moment a
voice was heard exclaiming 

hold shoot not there tis the penitent knight aim at the fliers
follow and shoot follow and shoot

immediately the party of pursuers rushed up to the pair one of whom
paused while the others in obedience to his command continued the
chase ever and anon sending a bolt after the fugitives

on and spare not ye knaves cried sandoval for it was this cavalier
who now stood at the side of the knight of rhodes on and shoot on
and shoot and see that ye bring me the head of the moor oho my merry
little page he cried regarding jacinto you have been playing sir
quimichin sir rat and sir spy a cunning little brat faith but
we'll catch thy villain father notwithstanding

the page bowed his head and sobbed but was silent and don gabriel
rallying his confused spirits a little said 

i know not what you mean señor we are no spies but very miserable
penitents

oh sir knight i crave your pardon said sandoval without noticing
the eccentric portion of his confession i meant not to intrude upon
your secrecy but to catch abdalla the deserter of whom and of whose
rogueries not doubting that this boy has full knowledge i must beg
your permission to conduct him to the general

surely said calavar mildly if jacinto have offended i will not
strive to screen him from examination but only from punishment i
consent you shall lead him to cortes and i will myself accompany you

it is enough noble knight if thou wilt thyself condescend to conduct
him said the cavalier whereby i shall be left in freedom to follow a
more urgent duty god save you sir knight i leave the boy in your
charge so saying sandoval pursued hastily after his companions and
calavar leading the page now no longer unwilling for the almogavar
with his companions was long since out of sight pursued his
melancholy way to the quarters




chapter xxx


while these occurrences were transpiring don amador de leste in search
of the knight had rambled through the streets and following very
naturally the only path with which he was acquainted soon found
himself issuing from that gate by which he had entered from tlascala
the domination of the spaniards had interrupted many of the civil as
well as the religious regulations of the cholulans and with their
freedom departed that necessity and habit of vigilance which had
formerly thronged their portals with watchmen no indian guards
therefore were found at the gate and the precautions of the general
had not carried his sentinels to this neglected and seemingly secure
quarter the neophyte passed into the fields and though hopeless in
their solitudes of discovering the retreat of the penitent was seduced
to prolong his walk by the beauty of the night and by the many pensive
thoughts to which it gave birth how many times his reflections carried
him back to the land of his nativity to the surges that washed the holy
land to the trenches of rhodes to the shores of granada need not be
here related nor if he gave many sighs to the strange sorrow and
stranger destiny of his kinsman is it fitting such emotions should be
recorded he wandered about lost in his musings until made sensible
by the elevation of the moon that he had trespassed upon the hour of
midnight roused by this discovery from his reveries he returned upon
his path and had arrived within view of the gate when he was arrested
by the sudden appearance of four men running towards him at a rapid
gait and presenting to his vision the figures of indian warriors no
sooner had these fugitives approached near enough to perceive an armed
cavalier intercepting the road than they paused uttering many quick
and to him incomprehensible exclamations but though he understood
not their language he was admonished by their actions of the
necessity of drawing his sword and defending himself from attack for
the foremost hesitating no longer than to give instructions to his
followers instantly advanced upon him flourishing a heavy axe of
obsidian somewhat surprised at the audacity of this naked barbarian
but in no wise daunted at the number of his supporters the cavalier
lifted his trusty bilboa fully resolved to teach him such a lesson as
would cause him to remember his temerity for ever but almost at the
same moment his wrath vanished for he perceived in this assailant
the young ambassador of the preceding evening and remembering the
words of de morla he felt reluctant to injure one of the princes of the
unhappy house of montezuma

prince said he elevating his voice but forgetting his want of an
interpreter drop thy sword and pass by in peace for i have not yet
declared war against thy people and i am loath to strike thee

but the valiant youth misconceiving or disregarding both words and
gestures only approached with the more determination and swung his
bulky weapon over his head as if in the act of smiting when one of his
followers exclaiming eagerly ho quauhtimotzin forbear sprang
before him and revealed to don amador the countenance of the moor
abdalla

thou art safe señor cried the almogavar and heaven be thanked for
this chance that shows thee i have not forgotten thy benefits

the assurance of abdalla was presently confirmed for the young prince
seeing the action of the moor lowered his weapon and merely surveying
the cavalier with an earnest look passed by him on his course and was
followed by the two others meanwhile don amador regarding the
almogavar said 

i know not good sidi notwithstanding this present service for which
i thank thee not so much because thou hast stepped between me and
danger for it must be apparent to thee i could with great ease
have defended myself from such feeble assailants but because thou hast
freed me from the necessity of hurting this poor prince i say
notwithstanding all this abdalla i know not whether i should not now
be bound to detain thee and compel thee to return to the general for
it is not unknown to me that thou art at this moment a deserter and
traitor

señor said the moor withdrawing a step as if fearing lest the
cavalier would be as good as his word my treason is against my
misfortunes and i desert only from injustice and if my noble lord
knows thus much he knows also that to detain me would be to give me
to the gallows

i am not certain said don amador that my intercession would not
save thy life unless thou hast been guilty of more crimes than i have
heard

guilty of nothing but misfortune said the moor earnestly guilty of
nothing but the crimes of others and of griefs which are reckoned
against me for sins 

guilty said the cavalier gravely of treating in secret with these
barbarians who are esteemed the enemies of thy christian friends and
guilty of seducing into the same crime thy countrymen the moriscos one
of whom i am persuaded did but now pass me with the indians and one
of whom also hath charged thee with tempting him

señor said abdalla hurriedly i cannot now defend myself from these
charges for i hear my enemies in pursuit

and guilty added don amador with severity as i think of deserting
thine own flesh and blood thy poor and friendless boy abdalla

the almogavar flung himself at the feet of the cavalier saying
wildly 

my flesh and blood and friendless indeed unless thou wilt continue to
protect him señor for the love of heaven for the sake of the mother
who bore you be kind and true to my boy swear thou wilt protect him
from malice and wrong for it was his humanity to thy kinsman the
knight that has robbed him of his father

dost thou confess thou wert about to steal him from his protector
now by heavens moor this is but an infidel's ingratitude

señor said abdalla you reproached me for forsaking him and now you
censure me for striving not to forsake him but the sin is mine not
jacinto's i commanded him to follow me señor and he would have obeyed
me had he not found thy knight calavar swooning among the ruins he
tarried to give him succour and thus was lost for the soldiers came
upon him

is this so indeed my kinsman left swooning thou wert but a knave
not to tell me this before

the knight is safe he has robbed me of my child said abdalla
throwing himself before the neophyte go not señor till thou hast
promised to requite his humanity with the truest protection

surely he shall have that without claiming it

ay but promise me swear it to me cried the moor eagerly don
hernan will be awroth with him the cavaliers will call him mine
accomplice

they will do the boy no wrong said amador and i know not why thou
shouldst ask me the superfluity of an oath

señor i am a father and my child is in a danger of which thou knowest
not for the love of god give me thy vows thou wilt not suffer my child
to be wronged

i promise thee this but acquaint me with this new and unknown peril
if it be the danger of an accusation of witchcraft i can resolve thee
that that is not regarded by the general

señor my pursuers are nigh at hand cried abdalla and i must fly a
great danger besets jacinto and thou canst preserve him swear to me
thou wilt not wrong him and suffer me to depart

wrong him said the cavalier thou art beside thyself yet as it
does appear to me that the soldiers are approaching us i will give
thee this very unreasonable solace i swear to thee very devoutly
that while heaven leaves me my sword and arm and the power to protect
no one shall in any way or by any injustice harm or wrong the boy
jacinto

i will remember thy promise and thee cried the almogavar seizing
his hand and kissing it

tarry abdalla reflect thou rushest on many dangers return and i
will intercede for thy pardon

but the moor running with great speed after his companions was almost
already out of sight and don amador musing again turned his face
towards cholula

if i meet these soldiers he soliloquized i must in honour
acquaint them with the path of the moor whereby abdalla may be
captured and put to death on the spot i am resolute i cannot by
utterly concealing my knowledge of this event maintain the character of
a just and honest gentleman yet it appears to me my duty only compels
me to carry my information to the general this will i do and by
avoiding the pursuers preserve the obligations of humanity to the
fugitive without any forfeit of mine honour

thus pondering and walking a little from the path until the pursuers
had passed him he returned to the quarters




chapter xxxi


the day that followed after the flight of abdoul-al-sidi beheld the
army of cortes crossing that ridge which extends like a mighty curtain
between the great volcano and the rugged iztaccihuatl and many a hardy
veteran shivered with cold and discontent as sharp gusts whirling rain
and snow from the inhospitable summits prepared him for the contrast of
peace and beauty which is unfolded to the traveller when he looks down
from the mountains to the verdant valley of mexico even at the present
day when the axe has destroyed the forest when the gardens of
flowers the cultivation of which with a degree of passionate affection
that distinguished the mexicans from other races seemed to impart a
tinge of poetry to their character and mellow their rougher traits with
the hues of romance when these flower gardens have vanished from the
earth when the lakes have receded and diminished and with them the
fair cities that once rose from their waters leaving behind them
stagnant pools and saline deserts even now under all these
disadvantages the prospect of this valley is of such peculiar and
astonishing beauty as perhaps can be nowhere else equalled among the
haunts of men the providence of the spanish viceroys in constructing a
road more direct and more easy of passage to the north of the great
mountains has robbed travellers of the more spirit-stirring impressions
which introduced them to the spectacle when pursuing the ancient
highway of the mexicans it ascends among gloomy defiles at the
entrance of which stand on either hand like stupendous towers guarding
the gate of some titan strong-hold the two grandest pinnacles of the
interior it conducts you among crags and ravines among clouds and
tempests now sheltering you under a forest of oaks and pines now
exposing you to the furious blasts that howl along the ridges a few
dilapidated hamlets of indians if they occasionally break the solitude
destroy neither the grandeur nor solemnity of the path you remember on
this deserted highway that you are treading in the steps of cortes

as the army proceeded don amador alive to every novelty took notice
that regularly at short distances from each other not excepting even
in the wildest and loneliest places there were certain low and rude but
strong cabins of stone built by the wayside but without inhabitants
these he was told were the houses that were always constructed by the
mexican kings on such friendless routes to shelter the exposed
traveller he thought such benignant provision betokened some of the
humaner characteristics of civilization and longed eagerly to make
acquaintance with those nobler institutions which might be presented
below this desire was not the less urgent that the frozen winds
penetrating his mailed armour made him shiver like a coward on the back
of his war-horse he felt also much concern for his kinsman who rode at
his side with a visage even wanner and more wo-begone than ordinary but
in the deep and death-like abstraction that invested his spirits don
gabriel was as insensible to the assaults of the blast as to the
solicitude of his friend the page jacinto moreover caused him no
little thought for the flight of his father though this had exposed
him neither to the anger nor inquiries of don hernan who affected to
treat the desertion of the moors as an affair of little consequence
save to themselves had left the boy so dejected and spiritless that
as he trudged along between the two cavaliers he seemed to follow more
with the instinct of a jaded house-dog than with the alacrity of a
faithful servant to the pity of his young master he returned but a
forced gratitude and to his benevolent counsel that he should ride
behind lazaro he rendered the oft-repeated excuse señor mio i am
afraid of horses and tis better to walk than ride over these cold
hills

there is much wisdom in what thou sayest as i begin now to perceive
said amador dismounting and giving his steed to lazaro tis better to
be over-warm with marching on foot than turned into an icicle on
horseback my father he said gently and affectionately to calavar
wilt thou not descend and warm thyself a little with exercise but
the knight only replied with a melancholy and bewildered stare which
convinced the novice that entreaty and argument upon this subject as
at present upon all others would be alike unavailing sighing
therefore and with a gesture directing baltasar to assume his station
at the side of don gabriel he took the page by the hand and removing
to a little distance from the group as well as from all other persons
he walked on entering into discourse with jacinto

i do not marvel at thee jacinto he said nor can i altogether
censure thee for grieving thus at the flight of thy father nor will i
as was last night my resolve reprimand thee for leaving me contrary
to my bidding at the chamber of my good knight for besides finding
thee in grief enough at present i perceive thou wert instigated to this
disobedience by anxiety for thy parent which would have excused in thee
a greater fault but let me ask thee not so much as a master as a
friend two or three questions first jacinto he continued art
thou dissatisfied with thy service or with thy master who loves thee
as well as myself

service master señor said the boy confused

i demand of thee art thou discontented with thy duties or grieved by
any unkindness which has been manifested to thee by thy master or by
any of us who are his followers

i cannot be discontented with my duties said the boy a little
cheerfully for it was not possible long to withstand the benevolence of
his patron i cannot be discontented with my duties for in truth it
seems to me there are none imposed upon me except such as are prompted
by my own fancies i am very skilless in the customs of service never
having been in service before yet señor i like it so well that with
such masters methinks i could remain a contented servant to the end of
my days that is that is but here the page interrupted himself
abruptly as for any unkindness i own with gratitude i have never
received from my lord from my master nor from his people any thing
but great favour as well as forgiveness for all my faults

thou answerest well said the novice gravely i did not apprehend
anybody could treat thee rudely except lazaro who is a rough fellow in
his ways and being in some sort a wit is oft betrayed into saying
sharp things in order that people may laugh at them nevertheless
lazaro has a good heart for which reason i pardon many of his freedoms
but i vow to thee though he is a brave soldier and albeit it is
opposed to all my feelings and principles to degrade a serving-man by
blows nevertheless had i found him venting his wit upon thee i should
have been tempted to strike him even with the hardest end of my lance

i never had a better friend than lazaro said the page with a faint
smile and i love him well for he affects my singing and praises me
more than anybody else then as for marco and baltasar though they
delight more in cleaning armour than listening to a lute and as for
the secretary señor lorenzo who cares for nothing but tilting with any
one who will take the trouble to unhorse him they are all good-natured
to me and they never scold me

this then being the case said amador and allowing thy first and
most natural obedience to be to thy father rather than to a master how
dost thou excuse to thyself the intention of deserting the service of
thy friends without demanding permission or at least acquainting us
with thy desires

señor exclaimed jacinto surprised and embarrassed

it is known to me that such was thy resolution said the cavalier
with gravity for it was so confessed to me last night by thy father
but indeed though i cannot avoid expressing my displeasure at such
intention which seems to me both treacherous and ungrateful i led thee
aside less to scold thee than to give thee intelligence of abdalla i
myself being as i think the last christian that beheld him

oh señor and he escaped unharmed cried the boy

verily without either bruise or wound save that which was made on his
soul when i reproached him for deserting thee

i am deserted by all exclaimed jacinto clasping his hands

for the thousandth time i tell thee no said his patron and thy
father made it apparent to me he abandoned thee unwillingly nor would
he leave me though the pursuers were approaching fast until he had
exacted of me the very superfluous vow that i would give thee a double
protection from all wrong and injustice dry thy tears i have already
obtained of cortes a promise of full pardon for abdalla when he returns
to us as doubtless he will at tenochtitlan

i hope so i pray he may said jacinto hurriedly or what oh what
shall become of us

i will have him sought out and by-and-by take thee and him along to
cuenza tis hard by to granada

the boy remained silent and amador continued 

thy father also showed me that it was thy faithful love in remaining
by my kinsman during a swoon which prevented thee from escaping with
him this though it does not remove the fault of thy design entirely
forces me to pardon it and indeed abdalla did as much as acknowledge
thou wert averse to the plan

señor i was for though our degradation was great i knew not how much
greater it might be among the pagans

degradation dost thou talk of degradation in good faith thou
surprisest me

señor said the boy proudly though you will deride such vanity in
poor barbarians of the desert yet did we ever think ourselves who had
always been free and unenslaved debased by servitude at least my
father thought so and i myself though speedily solaced by the kindness
which was shown me could not but sometimes think it had been better to
have perished with my father in the sea along with our unhappy people
than to remain as i was and as i am a servant in the house of my
master

a silly boy art thou jacinto said amador surveying him with
surprise for first thy office as the page of a most noble and
renowned knight is such a one as would be coveted by any grandee's son
however noble who aspired to the glory of arms and knighthood and i
admonish thee that had not his infirmity driven don gabriel from spain
entirely without the knowledge of his servants thou shouldst have seen
the son of a very proud and lofty nobleman attending him in the very
quality which thou thinkest so degrading i did myself though very
nearly related to him and though sprung of such blood as acknowledges
none superior not even in the king that sits on the throne enter first
into his service in the same quality of page and trust me i esteemed
it great honour in the second place i marvel at thee having already
confessed that thy service is both light and pleasant

it is even so señor said the boy meekly and i am not often so
foolish as to repent me it was not because i thought so yesternight
but because my father bade me that i strove to escape from it for he
was in danger or feared he was and it was my duty to follow him
without repining

i come now to ask thee another question said the neophyte by what
good fortune was it that thou stumbledst upon my kinsman among the
ruins of that profane pyramid

it was there señor that the princes met us

hah oh then thou wert plotting with my bold prince hah faith a
very valiant pagan and in no wise resembling the varlets of cuba if
thou knowest aught of these men that may concern our leader to know it
will be thy duty to report the same to him jacinto and that without
delay

nothing señor said the page hastily i discovered that my father
was to fly with the ambassadors that he was to seek them at the
pyramid and it was there we found my master swooning

didst thou see aught there that was remarkable or in any way
inexplicable

i saw my lord fainting my father and the princes flying and the
soldiers pursuing and shooting both with cross-bow and musket

tis already said the cavalier turning his eye askaunt to don
gabriel yet i know not by what revealment whispered through the army
that my kinsman saw a spectre some devilish fiend that in the moment
of his doubt struck him to the earth

ay said jacinto turning towards the knight and eyeing him with a
look of horror he thought twas zayda whom he slew so barbarously
among the alpujarras

the cavalier laid his hand upon jacinto's shoulder sternly 

what art thou saying what art thou thinking hast thou caught some of
the silly fabrications of the soldiers i warn thee to be guarded when
thou speakest of thy master

he confessed it to me said the page trembling but not at the anger
of his patron he killed her with his own hands when she screened
from his cruel rage her husband alharef his vowed and true friend

peace thou art mad twas the raving of his delirium there is no
such being as zayda

there is not but there was said jacinto mournfully

and how knowest thou that demanded amador quickly thou speakest as
if she had been thy kinswoman art thou indeed a conjuror there is no
dark and hidden story with which thou dost not seem acquainted

she was of my tribe said jacinto mildly though tremulously
returning the steadfast gaze of his patron i have heard my father
speak of her for she was famous among the mountains often has he
repeated to me her sorrowful story how she drew upon herself the anger
of her tribe by preserving their foe and how their foe repaid her
by oh heaven by murdering her often have i heard of zayda but i knew
not twas calavar who killed her

can this be true said amador looking blankly towards his unconscious
kinsman is it possible my father can have stained his soul with so
foul so deadly so fearful a crime and he confessed it to thee to
thee a boy so foolish and indiscreet that thou hast already babbled it
to another

i could not help speaking it this time said jacinto humbled at the
reproach but if my lord will forgive me i will never speak it more

i do forgive thee jacinto as i hope heaven will my father this then
is the sin unabsolved the action of wrath the memory of sorrow that
has slain the peace of my kinsman may heaven have pity on him for it
has punished him with a life of misery i forgive thee jacinto speak
of this no more think of it no more let it be forgotten now and for
ever amen i have but one more question to ask thee and this i am
in part driven to by thy admission of the most wondrous fact that don
gabriel confessed to thee his secret many of thine actions have
filled me with wonder thy knowledge is for thy years inexplicable
and thou minglest with thy boyish simplicity the shrewdness of years
dost thou truly obtain thy knowledge by the practice of those arts
which so many allow to be possessed by botello

señor exclaimed the boy startled by the abruptness of the question

art thou indeed an enchanter as yacub charged thee to be give me
to understand for it is fitting i should know

the exceeding and earnest gravity with which the cavalier repeated the
question dispelled as well the grief as the fears of the page he cast
his eyes to the earth but this action did not conceal the humour that
sparkled in them while he replied 

if i were older and had as much acquaintance with the people as
botello i think i could prophesy as well as he especially if my lord
don hernan would now and then give me a hint or two concerning his
designs and expectations such as it has been whispered he sometimes
vouchsafes to botello i have no crystal-imp like him indeed but i
possess one consecrated gem that can call me up at any time a thousand
visions it seems to me too that i can recall the dead for once or
twice i have done it though very much to my own marvelling

thou art an enigma said don amador what thou sayest of botello
assures me the more of thy subtle and penetrating observation what thou
sayest of thyself seems to me a jest and yet it hath a singular
accordance as well with my own foolish fancies and the charges of that
moorish menial as with the events of the two last nights either there
is indeed something very supernatural in thy knowledge or the
delirium of my kinsman is a disease of the blood which is beginning to
assail my own brain god preserve me from madness hearken in thine ear
and fear not to answer me hadst thou any thing to do with the
raising of the phantom thou callest zayda or is it the confusion of my
senses that causes me to suspect thee of the agency

señor said the boy in alarm you cannot think i was serious

what didst thou mean then by acknowledging the possession of that
consecrated and vision-raising jewel

i meant responded the youth sadly that being a gift associated
with all the joys of my happiest days i never look at it or pray over
it without being beset by recollections which may well be called
visions for they are representations of things that have passed away

and the story of leila pho tis an absurdity i have heard that the
cold which freezes men to death begins by setting them to sleep sleep
brings dreams and dreams are often most vivid and fantastical before
we have yet been wholly lost in slumber perhaps tis this most biting
and benumbing blast that brings me such phantoms art thou not very
cold

not very señor methinks we are descending and now the winds are not
so frigid as before

i would to heaven for the sake of us all that we were descended yet
lower for night approaches and still we are stumbling among these
clouds that seem to separate us from earth without yet advancing us
nearer to heaven

while the cavalier was yet speaking there came from the van of the
army very far in the distance a shout of joy that was caught up by
those who toiled in his neighbourhood and continued by the squadrons
that brought up the rear until finally lost among the echoes of remote
cliffs he pressed forward with the animation shared by his companions
and still leading jacinto arrived at last at a place where the
mountain dipped downwards with so sudden and so precipitous a declivity
as to interpose no obstacle to the vision the mists were rolling away
from his feet in huge wreaths which gradually as they became thinner
received and transmitted the rays of an evening sun and were lighted up
with a golden and crimson radiance glorious to behold and increasing
every moment in splendour as this superb curtain was parted from before
him as if by cords that went up to heaven and surged voluminously
aside he looked over the heads of those that thronged the side of the
mountain beneath and saw stretching away like a picture touched by the
hands of angels the fair valley imbosomed among those romantic hills
whose shadows were stealing visibly over its western slopes but leaving
all the eastern portion dyed with the tints of sunset the green plains
studded with yet greener woodlands the little mountains raising their
fairy-like crests the lovely lakes now gleaming like floods of molten
silver where they stretched into the sunshine and now vanishing away
in a shadowy expanse under the gloom of the growing twilight the
structures that rose vaguely and obscurely here from their verdant
margins and there from their very bosom as if floating on their placid
waters seeming at one time to present the image of a city crowned with
towers and pinnacles and then again broken by some agitation of the
element or confused by some vapour swimming through the atmosphere
into the mere fragments and phantasms of edifices these seen in that
uncertain and fading light and at that misty and enchanting distance
unfolded such a spectacle of beauty and peace as plunged the neophyte
into a revery of rapture the trembling of the page's hand a deep sigh
that breathed from his lips recalled him to consciousness without
however dispelling his delight

by the cross which i worship he cried it fills me with amazement
to think that this cursed and malefactious earth doth contain a spot
that is so much like to paradise now do i remember me of the words of
the señor gomez that no man could conceive of heaven till he had
looked upon the valley of mexico an expression which at that time i
considered very absurd and somewhat profane yet if i am not now
mistaken i shall henceforth doubtless when figuring to my imagination
the seats of bliss begin by thinking of this very prospect

it is truly a fairer sight than any we saw in florida most noble
señor said a voice hard by

the cavalier turned and with not less satisfaction than surprise for
the delight of the moment had greatly warmed his heart beheld in the
person of the speaker the master of the caravel

oho señor capitan cried don amador stretching out his hand to the
bowing commander i vow i am as much rejoiced to see thee as if we
had been companions together in war what brings thee hither to look on
these inimitable landscapes art thou come to disprove thy accounts of
the people of tenochtitlan i promise thee i have heard certain
stories and seen certain sights which greatly shake my faith in thy
representations what news dost thou bring me of my kinsman the
admiral

señor said the master the stars have a greater influence over our
destinies than have our desires it seems to me that that very
astonishing victory of the most noble and right valiant señor don
hernan at zempoala did utterly turn the brains of all the sailors in
the fleet and his excellency the admiral having declared himself a
friend to the conqueror they were all straightway seized with such an
ambition to exchange the handspike for the halbert and mine own
thirteen vagabonds among them that in an hour's time after the news
my good caravel was as well freed of men as ever i have known her
cleared of rats after a smoking of brimstone so perceiving the folly
of remaining in her alone and receiving the assurance from my knaves
that if i went with them i should be their captain and his excellency
consenting to the same i forthwith armed myself with these rusty
plates wherein you may see some of the dints battered by the red
devils of florida and was converted into a soldier the captain of
the smallest company in this goodly army and perhaps the most cowardly
for never did i before hear men grumble with such profane discontent as
did these same knaves this very day at the cold airs of the mountain
if they will fight well if they will not and anybody else will may i
die the death of a mule if i will not make them for one hath a better
and stronger command in an army than in a ship last night i came to
that great town they call cholula and was confirmed in my command by
the general his excellency the admiral bade me commend his love to
your worship and hearing that you have enlisted his secretary into your
service sends by me a better suit of armour for the youth and prays
your favour will have him in such keeping that he shall be cured of his
fit of valour without the absolute loss of life or his right hand
which last would entirely unfit him for returning to his ancient
duties as by my faith so would the former but by'r lady my
thoughts run somewhat a wool-gathering at this prospect for i see very
clearly tis a rich land here that hath such admirable cities and i
am told we shall have blows enow by and by with the varlets in the
valley nevertheless i am ready to wager my soul against a cotton
neck-piece that if these infidels have half the spirit of the savages
of florida we shall be beaten and sent to heaven amen that is for
the matter of heaven and not the beating

i applaud thy resolution mine ancient friend said the cavalier and
methinks thou art more vigorous both of body and mind on land than
thou wert at sea i will by and by send the secretary to receive the
armour and will not forget his excellency's bidding as far as is
possible but let us not by conversation distract our thoughts from
this most lovely spectacle for i perceive it will be soon enveloped in
darkness and how know we we shall ever look upon it again

thus terminating the interview the neophyte as he descended watched
the unchanging yet ever beautiful picture till the sun buried himself
among the mountains and the shadows of night curtained it in obscurity




chapter xxxii


passing the night in a little hamlet on the mountain side the army was
prepared at the dawn of the following day to resume its march but the
events of this march being varied by nothing but the change of prospect
and the wonder of those by whom the valley was seen for the first time
we will not imitate the prolixity of our authority the worthy don
cristobal but despatch in a word the increasing delight and
astonishment with which don amador de leste after having satiated his
appetite with views of lake and garden surveyed the countless villages
and towns of hewn stone that rose almost at every moment among them a
neck of land now separates the lakes of chalco and xochimilco and the
retreat of the waters has left their banks deformed with fens and
morasses wherein the wild-duck screams among waving reeds and
bulrushes originally these basins were united in one long and lovely
sheet of water divided indeed yet only by a causey built by the hands
of man which is now lost in the before-mentioned neck together with
its sluices and bridges as well as a beautiful little city that lay
midway between the two shores called by the spaniards venezuela
because rising like its aristocratic godmother from among the
waters until they discovered that this was a peculiarity presented by
dozens of other cities in the valley here was enjoyed the spectacle of
innumerable canoes paddled with corn and merchandise from distant
towns or parting with a freight of flowers from the chinampas or
floating gardens but this was a spectacle disclosed by other cities of
greater magnitude and beauty and when from the streets of the royal
city iztapalapan the army issued at once upon the broad and straight
dike that stretched for more than two leagues in length a noble
highway through the salt floods of tezcuco when the neophyte beheld
islands rocking like anchored ships in the water the face of the lake
thronged with little piraguas and the air alive with snowy gulls when
he perceived the banks of this great sheet as far as they could be
seen lined with villages and towns and especially when he traced far
away in the distance in the line of the causeway such a multitude of
high towers and shadowy pyramids looming over the waters as denoted the
presence of a vast city he was seized with a species of awe at the
thought of the marvellous ways of god who had raised up that mighty
empire all unknown to the men of his own hemisphere and now revealed
it for the accomplishment of a destiny which he trembled to imagine he
rode at the head of the army in a post of distinction by the side of
cortes and fell moved to express some of the strange ideas which
haunted him but looking on the general attentively he perceived about
his whole countenance and figure an expression of singular gloom
mingled with such unusual haughtiness as quickly indisposed him to
conversation

the feelings that struggled in the bosom of the conqueror were at this
instant akin to those of the destroyer as he sat upon the assyrian
mount overlooking the walls of paradise almost lamenting and yet
excusing to himself the ruin he was about to bring upon that heavenly
scene perhaps horror and doubt for a moment distracted his thoughts
for no one knew better than he the uncertain chances and tremendous
perils of the enterprise or mused with more fear upon the probable and
most sanguinary resistance of his victims as foreboded by the tumults
that followed after the late massacre but when he cast his eye backward
on the causey and beheld the long train of foot and horse following at
his beck the many cannons which as they were dragged along opened
their brazen throats towards the city the rows of spears and arquebuses
bristling and the banners flapping over the heads of his people and
behind them the feathered tufts of his tlascalans and heard the music
of his trumpets swell from the dike to the lake from the lake to the
shores and die away with pleasant echoes among the hills when he
surveyed and listened to these things and contrasted with them the
imperfect weapons and naked bodies of his adversaries the weakness of
their institutions the feebleness of their princes the general
disorganization of the people and counted the guerdon of wealth and
immortal renown that should wait upon success he stifled at once his
apprehensions and his remorse ceased to remember that those whose
destruction he meditated were to him harmless innocence and
satisfied himself almost with the arguments of the fiend that 

 public reason just
 honour and empire with revenge enlarged
 by conquering this new world compels me now
 to do what else though damn'd i should abhor

triumph and regret were at once dividing his bosom he knew he was a
destroyer but felt he should be a conqueror

there were many things in don hernan which notwithstanding the
gratitude and the desires of the neophyte prevented the latter from
bestowing upon him so much affection as he gave to one or two of his
followers the spirit of the leader was wholly and for his station
necessarily crafty and this very quality raised up a wall between him
and one who was of so honourable a nature that he knew no concealment
the whole schemes and aims of the general were based upon such a
foundation of fraud and injustice that he well knew he could not
without expecting constant and vexatious opposition give his full
confidence to any truly noble spirit and the same wisdom that estranged
him from the lofty taught him to keep aloof from the base while artful
enough to make use of the good qualities of the one and the bad
principles of the other class he was satisfied with their respect he
cared not for their friendship it was enough to him that he had
zealous and obedient followers his situation allowed him no friends
and he had none of all the valiant cavaliers who shared with him the
perils and the rewards of the invasion there was not one who after
peace had severed the bonds of companionship did not at the first
frown of fortune or the first invitation of self-interest array
himself in arms against his leader

while the general gave himself up to his proud and gloomy imaginings
the novice of rhodes again cast his eyes over the lake it seemed to
him that notwithstanding the triumphant blasts of the trumpet the
neighing of horses and the multitudinous tread of the foot-soldiers as
well as the presence of so many canoes on the water there was an air of
sadness and solitude pervading the whole spectacle the new soldiers
were perhaps impressed with an awe like his own at the strange
prospect the veterans were doubtless revolving in their minds some of
the darker contingencies over which their commander was brooding their
steps rung heavily on the stone mole and as the breeze curled up the
surface of the lake into light billows and tossed them against the
causeway don amador fancied they approached and dashed at his feet
with a certain sullen and hostile voice of warning he thought it
remarkable also that among the throngs of canoes there rose no
shouts of welcome the little vessels forming a fleet on either side of
the dike were paddled along at the distance of two or three hundred
yards so as to keep pace with the army and the motion of the rowers
and the gleaming of their white garments might have given animation as
well as picturesqueness to the scene but for the death-like silence
that was preserved among them the novelty of everything about the
cavalier gave vigour to his imagination he thought these paddling
hordes resembled the flight of ravens that track the steps of a wounded
beast in the desert or a shoal of those ravenous monsters that scent a
pestilence on the deep and swim by the side of the floating hospital
waiting for their prey

what they mean i know not mused the cavalier after what de morla
has told me i shall be loath to slay any of them but if they desire to
make a dinner of me i swear to st john i will carve their brown
bodies into all sorts of dishes before i submit my limbs to the
imprisonment of their most damnable maws and yet poor infidels
methinks they have some cause after that affair of the festival to
look upon us with fear if not with wrath for if a garrison of an
hundred men could be prompted to do them such a foul and murderous
wrong there is much reason to apprehend this well-appointed thousand
might be with as little provocation and warning incited to work them a
still more deadly injury i would however that they might shout a
little were it only to make me feel more like a man awake for at
present it seems to me that i am dreaming all these things which i am
looking at

the wish of the cavalier was not obeyed and many a suspicious glance
was cast both by soldier and officer to the dumb myriads paddling on
their flanks for it could not be denied though no one dared to give
utterance to such a suggestion that were these countless barbarians
provided with arms as was perhaps the case and could they but conceive
the simple expedient of landing both in front and rear and thus cut off
their invaders from the city and the shore and attack them at the same
time with good heart in this insulated and very disadvantageous
position there was no knowing how obscure a conjecture the historian
might hazard for the story of their fate but this suspicion was also
proved to be groundless no sort of annoyance was practised none indeed
was meditated the thousands that burthened the canoes had issued from
their canals to indulge a stupid curiosity or perhaps under an
impulse which they did not understand to display to their enemies the
long banquet of slaughter which fate was preparing for them

the army reached at last a point where another causeway of equal
breadth and seemingly of equal length coming from the south-west from
the city cojohuacan ruled by a king the brother and feudatory of
montezuma terminated in the dike of iztapalapan at the point of
junction was a sort of military work consisting of a bastion a strong
wall and two towers guarding the approach to the imperial city it was
known by the name of xoloc or as it should be written in our tongue
holoc and was in after times made famous by becoming the head-quarters
of cortes during the time of the siege it stood at the distance of
only half a league from the city and from hence could be plainly seen
not only the huge pyramids with their remarkable towers rising aloft
but the low stone fabrics whereon among the flowers for every roof was
a terrace and every terrace a garden stood the gloomy citizens
watching the approach of the christian army

at this point of xoloc at a signal of the general every drum was
struck with a lusty hand every trumpet filled with a furious blast and
the christians and tlascalans shouting together while two or three
falconets were at the same time discharged there rose such a sudden and
mighty din as startled the infidels in their canoes and conveyed to the
remotest quarters of tenochtitlan the intelligence of the advance of
its masters

scarcely had the echoes of this uproar died away on the lake when
there came faintly indeed but full of joyous animation the response
of the christian garrison and as the army resumed its march they
repeated their shouts loudly and blithely for they now perceived by
the waving of banners and the glittering of spears that their friends
rescued as they all understood by their presence from the fear of a
miserable death were coming forth to meet them two or three mounted
cavaliers were seen to separate themselves from this little and distant
band and gallop forwards while the causeway rung to the sound of their
hoofs don amador being in advance was able as they rushed forwards
with loud and merry halloos to observe their persons as well as the
reception they obtained from don hernan his eye was attracted to him
who seemed to be their leader and who he already knew was don pedro
de alvarado a cavalier that had no rival the gallant sandoval
excepted in fame and in the favour of his general he was in the prime
of life of a most noble stature and of a countenance so engaging and
animated that this in addition to the constant splendour of his
apparel whether the gilded mail of a warrior or the costly vestments
of a courtier had won him from the mexicans themselves the flattering
title of tonatiuh or the sun a compliment which his friends did not
scruple to perpetuate nor he to encourage he rode immediately up to
cortes and stretching out his hand said gayly and indeed
affectionately 

long life to thee cortes i welcome thee as my saint god be praised
for thy coming amen thou hast snatched me from a most ignoble and
hound-like death for sir copilli the emperor has been starving me

don hernan took the hand of the cavalier and eyeing him steadfastly and
sternly while his old companions gathered around said with a most
pointed asperity 

my friend alvarado thou hast done me as well as these noble
cavaliers thy friends and also thy lord the king a most grievous
wrong for by the indulgence of thy hot wrath and indiscretion thou
hast as i may say dashed the possession of this empire out of our
hands and much blood shall be shed and many christian lives sacrificed
in a war that might have been spared us before we can remedy the
consequences of thy rashness

a deep gloom that darkened to a scowl instantly gathered over the
handsome visage of don pedro and snatching his hand roughly away he
drew himself up and prepared to reply to his general with wrath and
perhaps with defiance but it was no part of the policy of cortes to
carry his anger further than might operate warningly on the officer and
on those around for which reason offering his hand again as if not
noticing the discontent of his lieutenant he said with an artful
appearance of sincerity

i have often thought how thou mightest have been spared the necessity
of slaying these perfidious and plotting hounds and it seems to me
even now if thou couldst by shutting thyself in thy quarters and
avoiding a contest have submitted to the foolish imputations some might
have cast on thee of acting from fear rather than from prudence this
killing of the nobles might have been avoided i say some indeed
might have accused thee of being in fear hadst thou not killed the
knaves that were scheming thine own destruction but this is an
aspersion which thou couldst have borne with as little injury as any
other brave cavalier in this army being second to none in a high and
well-deserved reputation and so well am i persuaded that none could
have better than thyself withstood the uncommon dangers of thy command
in this treasonable city that i should have excused any precaution of
peace that might have seemed cowardly to others nevertheless i must
own thou wert forced to do as thou hast done for no brave man can
submit to be thought capable of fear and i know twas this thought
alone that drove thee out to kill the nobles

no cloud in those tropical skies could have vanished more suddenly in
the sunbeam than did the frown of alvarado at these complimentary words
of his general he caught the hand that was still proffered shook it
heartily kissed it and said his whole countenance beaming with
delight and pride 

i thank your excellency for this just consideration of my actions and
this expression of a true excuse for what seems and what perhaps may
have been a great indiscretion your excellency and these noble
señores my friends would have esteemed me a coward had i sat securely
and quietly in the palace watching without attempting to forestall
the conspiracy of the lords of mexico and i have great hopes when i
have permission to explain all these things to your excellency though i
do not much plume myself on wisdom but rather on fighting which is
the only thing i have ever studied with diligence that you will say i
acted as wisely as in such case was possible

i have no doubt of it said cortes smiling as he rode
onwards but nevertheless there is more wisdom in thy knocks than in
thy noddle he muttered to himself the shame of the reproof though
dispelled by the flattery of the rebuker did not wholly disappear from
the bosom of alvarado a word of sarcasm will live longer than the
memory of a benefit alvarado was in after days a traitor to his
general

but without now giving himself leisure for consideration the cavalier
addressed himself to his old companions and even for his joy at being
so rescued out of peril warmed his heart to all made up with much
satisfaction to the knight calavar but since the confession at cholula
the distemper of don gabriel had visibly increased and his fits of
abstraction were becoming every hour so frequent and so profound as
to cause the greatest alarm and anxiety to his kinsman he neither heard
nor saw the salutations of don pedro nor indeed did he seem at all
sensible to any part of the strange scene that surrounded him foiled in
this attempt the courteous and vivacious soldier turned himself to don
amador as presenting the appearance of a noble and gallant hidalgo and
would speedily have been on a footing of the most perfect friendship
with him had it not been that the neophyte still freshly remembered the
story of the massacre and met his advances with a frigid haughtiness

by'r lady said the offended cavalier it seems to me that the devil
or the cold mountain has got into the bosoms of all for here am i
with my heart at this moment as warm as a pepper-pod or a black cloak
in the sunshine and ready to love everybody old and young vile and
virtuous base and gentle and yet everybody notwithstanding meets me
with a most frosty unconcern i swear to thee valiant cavalier
whosoever thou art my breast is open to thee and i crave thy
affection for besides perceiving that thou art assuredly an hidalgo i
see thou hast a moorish page at thy side with a lute at his back and
if his pipe be half so good as his face i cannot live without being thy
friend for i love music

jacinto shrunk away from his admirer alarmed as much at the suddenness
of his praise as at the many evolutions of the lance which by way of
gesticulation he flourished about him in a very vigorous manner but
don amador greatly amused at the freedom and in spite of himself
gained by the frankness of don pedro replied with good-humour

señor said he i am amador de leste of the castle del alcornoque
near to cuenza and having heard certain charges against you in the
matter of the mexican nobles i replied to you perhaps with prejudice
nevertheless what the general has said does in some sort seem to
lessen the force of the charge and if you will at your leisure
condescend to satisfy my doubts as i begin to be assured you can i
will not hesitate to receive your friendship and to tender you my own
in return only previous to which i must beg of you to turn your
lance-point another way so that the boy jacinto who is somewhat afraid
of its antics may be enabled to walk again at my side

señor don amador de leste said the soldier taking this speech in
good part i avow myself satisfied with your explanation and so
determined to pursue your friendship inasmuch as i have not heard any
good singing since the little orteguilla the page of the indian
emperor or what is the same thing of cortes lost his voice in a
quinsy that i will give you the whole history of the nobles their
atrocious conspiracy and their just punishment as soon as we have
leisure in our quarters and now if you will have the goodness to ride
with me a little in advance i will have much satisfaction as i
perceive you are a stranger to introduce you to this great and
wonderful city tenochtitlan of which i have been as i may say in
some sort the king for two long and tumultuous months and i swear to
you no king ever clutched upon a crown with more good will and joy than
do i this moment abdicate my authority

thus invited by his courteous and jocund friend the neophyte rode
onwards so as to reach the heels of cortes just as the garrison
inspired by the sight of their leader broke their ranks and rushed
forwards to salute him




chapter xxxiii


the soldiers of alvarado differed in no wise from those veterans whom
don amador had found standing to their arms on the banks of the river of
canoes only that they presented notwithstanding their loudly vented
delight a care-worn and somewhat emaciated appearance the consequence
of long watches perpetual fears and in part of famine they broke
their ranks as has been said as soon as they beheld their general and
surrounded him with every expression of affection and while stretching
forth their hands with cries of gratitude and joy invoked many
execrations on their imperial prisoner the helpless montezuma as the
cause of all their sufferings among them don amador took notice of one
man who though armed and habited as a spaniard seemed in most other
respects an indian and of a more savage race than any he had yet seen
for his face hands and neck were tattooed with the most fantastic
figures and his motions were those of a barbarian this was geronimo de
aguilar a companion of balboa who being wrecked on the coast of
yucatan had been preserved as a slave and finally adopted as a
warrior among the hordes of that distant land from which he was
rescued by don hernan happily to serve as the means of communication
through the medium of another and more remarkable interpreter with the
races of mexico this other interpreter who approached the general with
the dignified gravity of an indian princess and was received with
suitable respect was no less a person than that maid of painalla sold
by an unfeeling parent a slave to one of the chieftains of tobasco
presented by him to cortes and baptized in the faith under the
distinguished title of the señora doña marina who by interpreting to
aguilar in the language of yucatan the communications that were made
in her native tongue thus gave to cortes the means of conferring with
her countrymen until her speedy acquisition of the castilian language
removed the necessity of such tedious intervention but at this period
many spaniards had acquired a smattering of her tongue and could play
the part of interpreters and for this reason doña marina will make no
great figure in this history other annalists have sufficiently
immortalized her beauty her wisdom and her fidelity and it has been
her good fortune continued even to this day to be distinguished with
such honours as have fallen to the lot of none of her masters her
christian denomination marina converted by her countrymen into
malintzin a title that was afterwards scornfully applied by them to
cortes himself and this again in modern days corrupted by the
creoles into malinche has had the singular fate to give name both to
a mountain and a divinity the sierra of tlascala is now called the
mountain of malinche and the descendants of montezuma pay their
adorations to the virgin under the title of malintzin

don amador de leste attended by de morla as well as his new
acquaintance alvarado was able to understand as well as admire many
of the wonders of the city as he now for the first time planted his
foot on its imperial streets

the retreat of the salt waters of tezcuco has left the present
republican city of mexico a full league west of the lake in the days of
montezuma it stood upon an island two miles removed from the western
shore with which it communicated by the dike or calzada of
tlacopan now called tacuba the causeway of iztapalapan coming from
the south seven miles in length passed over the island and through the
city and was continued in a line three miles further to the northern
shore and to the city tepejacac where now stand the church and the
miraculous picture of our lady of guadalupe besides these three great
causeways constructed with inconceivable labour there were two
others that of cojohuacan which as we have mentioned terminated in
the greater one of iztapalapan at the military point xoloc a half
league from the city and that a little south-ward of the dike of
tacuba which conveyed in aqueducts of earthenware the pure waters of
chapoltepec to the temples and squares of the imperial city the island
was circular saving that a broad angle or peninsula ran out from the
north-west and a similar one from the opposite point of the compass it
was a league in diameter but the necessities of the people after
covering this ample space with their dwellings extended them far into
the lake and perhaps as many edifices stood on piles in the water as
on the land the causeways of iztapalapan and tacuba intersecting each
other in the heart of the island divided the city into four convenient
quarters to which a fifth was added some few generations before when
the little kingdom of tlatelolco occupying the north-western peninsula
was added to tenochtitlan on this peninsula and in this quarter of
tlatelolco stood the palace of an ancient king which the munificence
of montezuma had presented to cortes for a dwelling and which the
invader six days after the gift by an act of as much treachery as
daring converted into the prison of his benefactor

the appearance of this vast and remarkable city so occupied the mind of
the neophyte that as he rode staring along he gave but few thoughts
and fewer words either to his kinsman or the page it was sunset and
in the increasing obscurity he gazed as if on a scene of magic on
streets often having canals in the midst covered alike with bridges and
empty canoes on stone houses low indeed but of a strong and imposing
structure over the terraces of which waved shrubs and flowers and on
high turrets which at every vista disclosed their distant pinnacles
but he remarked also and it was mentioned by the cavaliers at his side
as a bad omen that neither the streets the canals nor the house-tops
presented the appearance of citizens coming forth to gaze upon them a
few indians were now and then seen skulking at a distance in the
streets raising their heads from a half-concealed canoe or peering
from a terrace among the shrubs he would have thought the city
uninhabited but that he knew it contained as many living creatures
hidden among its retreats as some of the proudest capitals of
christendom even the great square the centre of life and of devotion
was deserted and the principal pyramid a huge and mountainous mass
consecrated to the most sanguinary of deities though its sanctuaries
were lighted by the ever-blazing urns and though the town of temples
circumscribed by the great coatepantli or wall of serpents which
surrounded this mexican olympus sent up the glare of many a devotional
torch yet did it seem nevertheless to be inhabited by beings as
inanimate as those monstrous reptiles which writhed in stone along the
infernal wall in this light and in that which still played in the
west don amador marvelled at the structure of the pyramid and cursed
it as he marvelled it consisted of five enormous platforms faced with
hewn stone and mounted by steps so singularly planned that upon
climbing the first story it was necessary to walk entirely round the
mass before arriving at the staircase which conducted to the second
the reader may conceive of the vast size of this pagan temple by being
apprised that to ascend it the votaries were compelled in their
perambulations to walk a distance of full ten furlongs as well as to
climb a hundred and fourteen different steps he may also comprehend the
manner in which the stairways were contrived by knowing that the first
ascending laterally from the corner was just as broad as the first
platform was wider than the second leaving thus a sheer and continuous
wall from the ground to the top of the second terrace from the bottom
of the second to the top of the third and so on in like manner to the
top

but the pyramid crowned with altars and censers the innumerable
temples erected in honour of nameless deities at its foot and the
strange and most hideous coatepantli were not the only objects which
excited the abhorrence of the cavalier without the wall and a few
paces in advance of the great gate which it covered as a curtain rose a
rampart of earth or stone oblong and pyramidal but truncated
twenty-five fathoms in length at the base and perhaps thirty feet in
height at either end of this tumulus was a tower of goodly altitude
built as it seemed at a distance and in the dim light of some
singularly rude and uncouth material and between them occupying the
whole remaining space of the terrace was a sort of frame-work or cage
of slender poles on all of which were strung thickly together certain
little globes the character of which don amador could not penetrate
until fully abreast of them then indeed he perceived with horror
that these globes were the skulls of human beings the trophies of ages
of superstition and beheld in like manner that the towers which
crowned the golgotha or huitzompan as it was called in the mexican
tongue were constructed of the same dreadful materials cemented
together with lime the malediction which he invoked upon the builders
of the ghastly temple was unheard for the spectacle froze his blood
and paralyzed his tongue

it was not yet dark when having left these haunts of idolatry don
amador found himself entering into the court-yard of a vast and yet not
a very lofty building the palace of axajacatl wherein with drums
beating and trumpets answering joyously to the salute of their friends
stood those individuals of the garrison who had remained to watch over
their prisoners and treasures the weary and the curious thronging
together impatiently at the gate mingling with the garrison and some
two thousand faithful tlascalans who had been left by cortes as their
allies and who now rushed forward to salute the viceroy of their gods
as some had denominated don hernan made such a scene of confusion
that for a moment the neophyte was unable to ride into the yard in
that moment and while struggling both to appease the unquiet of fogoso
and to drive away the feathered herd that obstructed him his arm was
touched and looking down he beheld jacinto at his side greatly
agitated and seemingly striving to disengage himself from the throng

give me thy hand cried don amador and i will pull thee out of this
rabble to the back of fogoso

but the page though he seized upon the hand of his patron and covered
it with kisses held back greatly to the surprise of don amador who
was made sensible that hot tears were falling with the kisses

i swear to thee my boy that i will discover thy father for thee if
it be possible for man to find him said the cavalier diving at once
as he thought to the cause of this emotion

but before he had well done speaking the press thickening around him
drew the boy from his side and when he had a moment after disengaged
himself jacinto was no longer to be seen not doubting however that
he was entangled in the mass and would immediately appear he called
out to him to follow and riding slowly up to cortes he had his whole
attention immediately absorbed by the spectacle of the indian emperor

issuing from the door of the palace surrounded as well by spanish
cavaliers as by the nobles both male and female of his own household
who stood by him the latter at least with countenances of the
deepest veneration he advanced a step to do honour to the dismounting
general

in the light of many torches held by the people about him don amador
as he flung himself from his horse could plainly perceive the person
and habiliments of the pagan king he was of good stature clad in white
robes over which was a huge mantle of crimson studded with emeralds
and drops of gold knotted on his breast or rather on his shoulder so
as to fall when he raised his arm in careless but very graceful folds
his legs were buskined with gilded leather his head covered with the
copilli or crown a sort of mitre of plate-gold graved and chased
with certain idolatrous devices from beneath which fell to his
shoulders long and thick locks of the blackest hair he did not yet seem
to have passed beyond the autumn of life his countenance though of the
darkest hue known among his people was good somewhat long and hollow
but the features well sculptured and a gentle melancholy a
characteristic expression of his race deepened perhaps in gloom by a
sense of his degradation gave it a something that interested the
beholder

in the abruptness with which he was introduced to the regal barbarian
don amador had no leisure to take notice of his attendants all princely
in rank and two or three of them the kings of neighbouring cities he
only observed that their decorations were far from being costly and
ostentatious a circumstance which he did not then know marked the
greatness of their respect in the absurd grandeur which attached to the
person of their monarch no distinction of inferior ranks was allowed to
be traced during the time of an audience and in his majestic presence
a vassal king wore the coarse garments of a slave so important was
esteemed the observance of this courtly etiquette that at the first
visit made him in his palace by the spaniards the renowned cortes and
his proud officers did not refuse to throw off their shoes and cover
their armour with such humble apparel as was offered them but those
days were passed the king of kings was himself the vassal of a king's
vassal yet notwithstanding this it had been up to this time the
policy of don hernan to soften the captivity and engage the affections
of the monarch by such marks of reverence as might still allow him to
dream he possessed the grandeur along with the state of a king before
this day cortes had never been known to pass his prisoner without
removing his cap or helmet and indeed such had been so long the habit
of his cavaliers that all as they now dismounted fell to doffing
their casques without delay until the action of their leader taught
them a new and unexpected mode of salutation

the weak spirit of montezuma had yielded to the arts of the spaniard
and forgetting the insults of past days the loss of his empire and the
shame of his imprisonment he had already conceived a species of
affection for his wronger cortes had no sooner therefore leaped from
his horse than the emperor with outstretched arms and with his
sadness yielding to a smile advanced to meet him

dog of a king said the invader with a ferocious frown dost thou
starve and murder my people and then offer me the hand of friendship
away with thee i defy thee and thou shalt see that i can punish thus
saying and thrusting the king rudely aside he stepped into the palace

a wild cry of lamentation at this insult it needed no interpretation
to their king burst from the lips of all the mexicans and the
spaniards themselves were not less panic-struck the gentle manners of
montezuma and his munificence for he was in the daily habit of
enriching them with costly presents had endeared him to most of his
enemies and even the soldiers of the garrison who had so lately
accused him of endeavouring to famish them had no belief in the justice
of their charges many of them therefore both soldiers and hidalgos
indignant and grieved at the wanton insult had their sympathies
strongly excited when they beheld the monarch roll his eyes upon them
with a haggard smile in which pride was struggling vainly with a bitter
sense of humiliation de morla and several others rushed forwards to
atone by caresses for the crime of their general but it was too late
the king threw his mantle over his head and without the utterance of
any complaint passed with his attendants into his apartments his
countenance was never more from that day seen to wear a smile

don amador de leste was greatly amazed and shocked by this rudeness and
it was one of many other circumstances which by lessening his respect
for the general contributed to weaken his friendship and undermine his
gratitude but he had no time to indulge his indignation he was
startled by a loud cry or rather a shriek from the lips of the knight
calavar and running to the gate beheld in the midst of a confused
mass of men rushing to and fro and calling out as if to secure an
assassin his kinsman lying to all appearance dead in the arms of his
attendants




chapter xxxiv


the first thought of the young cavalier was that don gabriel had been
basely and murderously struck by some felon hand an apprehension of
which he was in part immediately relieved by the protestations of
baltasar but which was not entirely removed until he had assisted to
carry the knight into a chamber of the palace and beheld him open his
eyes and roll them wildly round him like one awaking from a dream of
night-mare

i say muttered baltasar as he raised the head of the distracted man
and beckoned to clear the room of many idle personages who had thrust
themselves in he was hurt by no mortal man for i stood close at his
side and there is not a drop of blood on his body twas one of the
accursed ghosts whom may st john sink down to hell for they are ever
persecuting us

mortal man or immortal fiend whispered lazaro knitting his brows
but looking greatly frighted i saw him running away the moment the
knight screeched and i will take my oath he had such a damnable
appearance as belongs to nothing but the devil or one of these pagan
gods who are all devils had he been a man i should have slain him
for i struck at him with my spear

miserere mei groaned the knight rising to his feet they are all
unearthed zayda at the temple and he in the palace

don amador trembled when he heard his kinsman pronounce the name of
zayda for he remembered the words of jacinto nevertheless he said be
not disturbed my father for we are none here but thy servants

ay said the knight looking gloomily but sanely to his friend i
afflict thee with my folly but i know now that it will end let the
boy jacinto sing to me the song of the virgin i will pray and sleep

don amador looked round and jacinto not being present began to
remember that the page had been separated from him in the crowd and
that he had not seen him since the moment of separation none of the
attendants had noticed him enter the court-yard and a superstitious
fear was mingled with his anxiety when don gabriel casting his eyes to
heaven said with a deep groan 

the time beginneth the flower is broken and now i see how each branch
shall fall and the trunk that is blasted shall be left naked to
perish seek no more for the boy he went on to amador with a grave
placidity which coupled with the extravagance of his words gave the
youth reason to fear that his mind wavering under a thousand shocks
had at last settled down for ever in the calm of insanity seek for
the good child no more for he is now in heaven and lament not thou my
son amador that thou shalt speedily follow him for thy heart is yet
pure thy soul unstained and grace shall not be denied thee

jacinto is not dead my father said the neophyte earnestly and if
thou wilt suffer baltasar to remove thy corslet and make thee a couch
under yonder canopy i will fetch him to thee presently and he shall
sing thee to sleep

remove the armour indeed muttered don gabriel submitting passively
for now there is no more need of aught but the crucifix prayers and
the grave poor children that shall die before the day of canker what
matters it i lament ye not ye shall sleep in peace

thus murmuring out his distractions in which his servants perceived
nothing but the influence of some supernatural warning that boded them
calamity the knight allowed himself to be disarmed and laid upon a
couch on a raised platform at the side of the chamber over which the
voluminous arras that covered the walls were festooned into a sort of
not inelegant tester

meanwhile the neophyte beckoning lazaro with him and charging him to
make good search throughout the palace for the page began to address
himself to the same duty and first attracted by the lights and by the
sounds of many voices coming from a neighbouring apartment he advanced
to the door where he was suddenly arrested by the appearance of a
mexican of very majestic stature though clad in the same humble robes
which had covered the attendants of montezuma issuing from the chamber
followed by a throng of cavaliers among whom was the general himself
at the side of cortes stood a boy in stature resembling jacinto and in
whom for a moment don amador thought he had discovered the object of
his desires but this agreeable delusion was instantly put to flight
when he heard don hernan address him by the name of orteguilla and saw
that he exercised the functions of an interpreter

tell me this knave my merry muchacho said the general tell me
this knave that is to say this royal prince cuitlahuatzin that i
discharge him from captivity under the assurance that he shall very
faithfully and without delay command his runagate people to bring me
corn to the market of which it is not fitting we should be kept in want
longer than to-morrow and give him to understand that i hold as the
hostage of his good faith and compliance the dog montezuma translate
that the king his brother who shall be made to suffer the penalty
of any neglect on his part to furnish me with the afore-mentioned
necessary provision

the little orteguilla in part acquainted with the mexican tongue did
as he was directed and the prince cuitlahuatzin or as it should be
pronounced in english speech quitlawátzin receiving and understanding
the direction bowed his head to cortes with stately humility and
immediately withdrew

not discovering or hearing aught of jacinto in this throng don amador
continued his search in other parts of the palace the court-yard and
even the neighbouring street but with such indifferent success that
when stumbling upon lazaro and made acquainted that he had been equally
unfortunate he began to entertain the most serious fears for the fate
of the boy

perhaps he was carried off by the spectre muttered lazaro
superstitiously as his worship don gabriel as much as hinted

or perhaps said the neophyte with a thrill of horror by some of
those bloody cannibals to be devoured and i remember now that there
were many savages about me at the time though i thought them
tlascalans i would to heaven i had speared the knaves that came
between us but i swear to st john of the desert if they have truly
robbed me of the boy and for that diabolical purpose i will pursue
their whole race with a most unrelenting vengeance

at this moment the cavalier was startled by a sudden hark from
lazaro and heard at a distance in the street though objects were lost
in the darkness a great tumult as of men in affray and plainly
distinguished a voice crying aloud arma arma and christian men for
the love of god to the rescue of christians beset by infidels

draw thy sword lazaro and follow cried the cavalier for these are
other victims and with god's favour we will rescue them

thus exclaiming and without a moment thinking of the unknown perils
among which he was rushing he ran rapidly in the direction of the
cries and straightway beheld a little in advance of a great crowd of
people a group consisting of four or five persons several of them
women in strange attire who stood shrieking with terror while at their
feet rolled three or four on the ground in close and murderous combat
the cries of one of these prostrate figures bespoke him a spaniard and
while one sinewy pagan seemed to hold him upon the earth another stood
with his uplifted weapon in the very act of despatching him at this
moment don amador rushed forwards and shouting his war-cry dios y
buena esperanza that is god and good cheer struck the menacing
savage a blow that sent him yelling away and seized upon the other by
the shoulder to stab him when suddenly the spaniard rose to his feet
with a leap that tumbled the infidel to the earth and showed him to be
already dead cried aloud in the well-remembered voice of the
magician 

tetragrammaton thou wert a good shield though a bloody one sir
carcass save the princesses and fly or we are all dead men arma
arma to the rescue

thus shouting and seizing upon one of the women while don amador
snatched the arm of the other for he perceived they were like to be
cut off by the approaching crowd the sorcerer with his rescuers ran
towards the palace his cries had reached the quarters and presently
they were surrounded by a hundred soldiers and cavaliers bearing lights
in the glare of which don amador had scarce time to note the countenance
of his new ward before she was locked in the arms of de morla

minnapotzin benita cried the joyous cavalier amigo mio thou hast
saved my princess

stop not to prate and be happy for the storm comes exclaimed
botello to the palace all of ye and to the cannon for were you five
hundred men there are wolves enow at your heels to devour you

thus admonished and perceiving in fact that a vast though silent
multitude was approaching all were fain to fly and in an instant they
were crowding into the gates of the court-yard

this comes of insulting the king cried a voice from the melée as
cortes shouting out to clear the gates was seen himself assisting to
draw a piece of artillery to the opening

i see naught i hear nothing cried the general affecting not to
remark this reproach which was indeed just for it was this
over-refinement of policy spread with wonderful celerity throughout the
city which dashed the last scale from the eyes of the mexicans
convinced them that their monarch was indeed a slave and let loose the
long-imprisoned current of fury i see nought i hear nought and my
brave rolands have been flying from shadows

say not so the town is alive cried the magician the hounds set on
me as i was bringing at your excellency's command these princesses
from tacuba and it was only through the mercy of god my good star an
indian that i killed for a buckler and the help of this true cavalier
whose fate out of gratitude i will reveal to him to-morrow that we
were not all killed by the way for small reverence did the false
traitors show to the maidens

clear the way then discharge me the piece catalan true cannonier
said cortes and we will see what our foes look like so near to
midnight

the match was applied the palace shook to the roar and the blaze
illumining the street to a great distance disclosed it to the surprise
of all entirely deserted

i will aver upon mine oath said don amador that the street was but
now full of people but where they have hidden or whither they have
fled wholly passes my comprehension

hidden surely in their beds cried the general loudly and
cheerfully for he perceived the crowds about him were panic-struck
they set on botello doubtless because they thought he was haling away
the princesses with violence and convinced of their error they have
now gone to their rest a mark of wisdom in which i would advise all
here to follow their example

thus cheered by their leader the soldiers began to disperse and
amador musing painfully on the mysterious fate of the page was
accosted by cortes who drawing him aside said 

it has been told me señor that your moorish boy has made his escape

his escape echoed the novice in surprise he did indeed vanish away
from me and i know not how though much do i fear in a manner that it
shocks me to think on i was about to ask of your excellency as the boy
is a true christian as well as a most faithful servant for such
counsel and assistance as might enable me this night to rescue him out
of the hands of the cannibals for it would be a sin on the souls of us
all should we suffer him to come to harm

and are you so well persuaded of his faith as to believe him incapable
of treachery demanded don hernan earnestly thou forgettest he has
a father concealed among these infidels

ay by my faith cried amador joyously i thought not of that
before and yet and yet   here his countenance fell how should he
be so mad as to leave us in this strange and huge city with any hope
of discovering abdalla

i can resolve thee that said cortes for it is avouched to me by
yacub that he saw this wretch whom may heaven return to me for
punishment for he is a most subtle daring and dangerous traitor
this very knave abdalla at thy horse's heels but he could not believe
twas he until made acquainted with the flight of the page

ay now i see it said amador and i remember that he wept as he
held my hand as if grieving to desert me but methinks twill be well
to seek him out and reclaim him will your excellency allow me the
services of any score or two of men who for love or gold may be
induced to follow me in the search

i will answer thee in thine own words said cortes where wouldst
thou look in this strange and huge city with any hope of discovering
him be content señor the boy is with the fox his father that
should convince thee he is in present safety and señor i will tell
thee what i conceal from my people for thou art a soldier and
therefore as discreet as fearless that i would not this night
despatch an hundred men a mile from the palace without looking to have
half of them slain outright by the rebels that are around us

and dost thou think said amador that these besotted naked madmen
would dare to assail so many

you will see by my conscience cried the general with a grim and
anxious smile sleep with thine armour at thy side and forget not thy
buckler for i have known a tlascalan arrow pierce through a good
biscayan gorget and they say the mexicans can shoot as well let not
any noise arouse thee unless it be that of a trumpet i would have thee
sleep well my friend for i know not how soon i may need thy strong
arm and encouraging countenance

thus darkly and imperfectly apprising the novice of his fears for now
indeed a demon had roused a thousand apprehensions in his breast the
general departed and don amador disconsolately pursued his way to the
chamber of the knight of rhodes




chapter xxxv


when don amador returned to the chamber he was rejoiced to find his
kinsman asleep and not offended that the faithful marco and baltasar
were both nodding as they sat at his side he threw himself softly on a
cot of mats covered with robes of fine cotton over which was a little
canopy such being the beds of the better orders of mexico the crowded
state of the palace for it is recorded that the number of totonac and
tlascalan allies who remained in the garrison with alvarado now
swelled the army of cortes to nearly nine thousand men left him no
other choice and he felt that his presence was perhaps necessary in
the unhappy condition of his knight he was mindful to obey the counsels
of don hernan and lie with his weapons ready to be grasped at the first
alarm and he remembered also the hint that had been given him not to
be surprised at such tumults when he heard a sound continued
throughout the greater part of the night as of heavy instruments
knocking against the court-yard wall convincing him as well of the
military vigilance and preparations as of the fears of his general in
addition to this disturbance he was often startled by moans and wild
expressions coming from the lips of the sleeping knight showing him
that even slumber brought no repose to his distempered spirit but
above all and this made manifest the hold that the moorish boy had got
upon his affections he was troubled with thoughts of jacinto and
often as the angel of sleep began to flutter over his eyelids she was
driven away by some sudden and painfully intense conception of the
great peril which must surround the friendless lad now that the events
of the evening proved him to be in the midst and doubtless in the
power of an enraged multitude to whom every stranger was an enemy
often too as he was sinking into slumber the first voice of dreams
would cry to him in the tones of jacinto or the silent enchanter would
bring before his eyes the spectacle of the boy confined in the cage of
victims or dragged away by the hands of ferocious priests to the
place of sacrifice these distractions kept him tossing about in great
restlessness for a long time and it was not until the sounds of the
workmen in the yard were no longer heard and until a deep silence
pervaded the palace that he was able to drown his torments in sleep

he was roused from slumber by a painful dream and fancying it must be
now approaching the time of dawn he stole softly to the bed-side of
calavar without disturbing the attendants a taper of myrtle-wax
burning on a little pedestal hard by disclosed to him the countenance
of the knight contracted with pain and flushed as if with fever but
still chained in repose he stepped noiselessly away and gathering his
sword and a few pieces of armour in his hands left the apartment

from the door of the palace he could see dimly for it was not yet
morning that vast numbers of tlascalans were lying asleep in the
court-yard among the horses while many sentinels were stalking about in
silent watchfulness he was now able likewise to understand the cause
of the heavy knocking which had annoyed him the gates were closed but
in three rude embrasures which had been broken in the wall by the
workmen frowned as many pieces of ordnance commanding the street by
which he had approached the palace

entering this again and attracted by the distant murmur of voices he
discovered a staircase at the end of a passage ascending which he
immediately found himself on the terraced roof of the building and now
he could perceive the exposed condition of the royal citadel as well as
the preparations made to sustain it in the event of a siege

the palace itself extended over a great piece of ground in the form
of a square the walled sides of which were continuous but the centre
divided by rows of structures that crossed each other into many little
courts the buildings were all low consisting indeed of but one
floor except that in the centre were several chambers on the roofs of
others that might be called turrets or observatories the terraces were
so covered with flowers and shrubs that they seemed a garden this mass
of houses was surrounded on all sides by a spacious court confined by a
wall six or eight feet high running entirely round the whole the
palace with its outer court did not yet occupy all of the great square
upon which it stood it was a short bow-shot from the battlements to
the houses which lined the four sides of the square opposite to each
side or front of the fabric was a great street along which the eye in
full daylight could traverse till arrested by the surrounding lake
directly opposite likewise to each of these streets as don amador
soon discovered the careful general had caused to be broken as many
embrasures as he had seen on the quarter of the principal entrance and
now there were no less than twelve pieces of artillery with those who
served them sleeping in cloaks hard by looking with formidable
preparation down the yawning and silent approaches

the neophyte had not yet given a moment to these observations when he
perceived on the top of one of the turrets a group of cavaliers who
being relieved against the only streak of dawn that tinged the eastern
skies were plainly seen gesticulating with great earnestness as if
engaged in important debate he approached this turret and mounting the
ladder that ascended it was assisted to the roof by the hand of cortes

i give you good cheer and much praise for your early rising don
amador cried the general with an easy courtesy and pleasant voice
which did not however conceal from the novice that he was really
affected by anxiety and even alarm for this besides convincing me
that no one is more ready than thyself for a valiant bout with an enemy
will give thee an opportunity to note in what way these pagan mexicans
advance to assault a matter of which i am myself ignorant though
assured by my friend alvarado that nothing can be more warlike to look
upon

i vow to god and to saint peter who cut off a knave's ear said don
pedro that there are no such besotted mad dare-devils in all the
world beside as you shall quickly see and i swear to you in addition
my friends i did sometimes think of a morning the very devils that
dwell in the pit were let loose upon me but fear not with my poor
five-score and the seven thousand indians who should not be counted
against more than one hundred christians i felt no prick of dismay
except when i thought of starvation and with the force that now aids
us twill be but a boy's pastime to kill ten thousand of the bold
lunatics each day before breakfast

to this valiant speech which was characteristic of alvarado as
notorious for boasting as for bravery don amador replied
complacently 

to my mind nothing could be stronger than this citadel against such
enemies as we may have especially since the placing of those cannon
opposite to the great streets a precaution which should be commended
nevertheless noble cavaliers it does not appear to me that we are in
any immediate peril of assault the infidels are not yet arisen

cast thine eye down yonder street said cortes with a low voice keep
it fixed intently for two or three moments on the shadows and tell me
what thou seest among them and while thou art so doing do not shame
to hold thy buckler a little over thy face for now and then methinks
i have seen on yonder house-tops something unlike to rose-buds glancing
among the bushes

by my faith said don amador hastily it does seem to me that there
are men stirring afar in the street nay a great body of them and
doubtless clad in white ay i perceive them now but i thought twas a
dim mist creeping up from the lake

if thou wilt look to the other three streets said cortes knitting
his brows and scowling around him thou wilt see other such vapours
gathering about us thus do they surround stags in the sierras of
salamanca but sometimes the hunters have found more wolves than deer
among their quarry and by my conscience so will the dogs of mexico
find their prey this day when they come a-hunting against
castilians hah did i not warn thee well cried the general as an
arrow shot from a distant terrace and by some unseen hand struck
against the guarding shield with such violence as to shiver its stone
head into a thousand fragments ware such cupids for when they miss
the heart they are content to rankle among the ribs what say ye now
my masters the knaves are coming nearer such big rain-drops do not
long fall one by one but show how soon the flood will follow cover
yourselves for by my conscience that was another though it fell
short i see the house it comes from and i will reward the messenger
shortly with such a cannon-shot as shall leave him houseless how now
mi trompetero art thou nodding wake me thy bugle and let the
sleepers look on the white clouds

a trumpeter who stood ready at the base of the turret instantly wound
a loud blast on his instrument it was answered immediately by others
from every part of the court and the building and as if by magic the
dead silence of the palace was straightway exchanged for the loud din
and confusion of thousands rising and springing to their arms during
this tumult cortes descended from the turret

don amador fascinated by the spectacle for now the light of dawn
increasing every moment fully convinced the most sceptical that
countless barbarians were thronging in the streets and advancing
against the palace remained for a time on the terrace in company with
others surveying their approach and kindling into ardour the four
streets were blocked up with their dusky bodies for they seemed nearly
naked and answering the drums and bugles of the spaniards with the
hollow sound of their huge tabours and the roaring yells of great
conches and adding to these the uproar of their voices and what
greatly amazed the neophyte the shrill and piercing din of loud
whistling they pressed onwards not fast indeed but fearlessly until
they began to pour like a flood upon the open square nevertheless and
notwithstanding their very menacing appearance not a bow was yet bent
nor a stone or dart discharged against the christians and they were
arraying or rather grouping themselves for they seemed to preserve no
peculiar order about the square as if rather to support some
peaceable demand with a show of strength than to make an absolute
attack when the neophyte beheld don hernan clad in complete armour
spring upon a cannon and thence to the top of the wall and wave his
hand towards them with an air of imposing dignity the vast herds
stilled their cries and immediately malintzin guarded by two soldiers
who held shields before her was seen to ascend and stand by the side of
her master

ask me these hounds cried the general with a voice that seemed meant
by its loudness to strike the infidels with awe wherefore they leave
their beds and come like howling wolves to disturb me in my dwelling
what is their desire and wherefore have they not come with baskets of
corn rather than with slings and arrows

the clear voice of doña marina was instantly heard addressing the
multitude and was followed by a shout such as may come from thrice a
thousand score men wherein and among other inexplicable sounds don
amador heard the word tlatoani tlatoani repeated with accents in
which intreaty seemed mingled with fury he could not discover the
meaning of these cries from the imperfect castilian and the low voice
with which malintzin interpreted them but he could conjecture their
signification by the reply of cortes

tell the traitorous dogs he exclaimed sternly that their princes
have avowed themselves the vassals of my master the great monarch of
spain that their lord and king montezuma is my friend and contented
guest and will therefore remain in my dwelling tell them also he
charges them to disperse throw by their arms and return laden with
corn and meat and add moreover that if they do not immediately obey
this command the thunders which god has given me to punish them shall
be let loose upon them and scatter their corses and their city into the
air tell we them this and plainly and hark'ee cannoniers stand
fast to your linstocks

no sooner was this haughty and threatening answer made known to the
barbarians than they uttered a yell so loud and universal that the
palace and the earth under it seemed to shake with the din and
immediately every quarter of the edifice was covered with arrows
stones and other missiles shot off with extraordinary violence and
fury

don amador prepared to descend but paused an instant to observe the
effect of the artillery for he heard the strong tones of the general
shouting now cannoniers to your duty and show yourselves men

the very island trembled when twelve cannon discharged nearly at the
same moment opened their fiery throats and aimed full among the
multitude poured innumerable death into their ranks the island
trembled but not so the naked barbarians of tenochtitlan if the
screams of a thousand wretches mangled by that explosion rose on the
morning air they were speedily drowned by the war-cries of survivors
and before the smoke had cleared away the bloody gaps were filled and
the infuriated multitudes were rushing with savage intrepidity full upon
the mouths of the artillery

don amador hesitated no longer he ran down the staircase paused a
moment at the side of calavar whom he found raving in a low delirium
for he was burned by fever paused only long enough to charge marco not
to leave him no not even for a moment and snatching up and rapidly
donning the remaining pieces of his armour immediately found himself in
the court-yard among the combatants




chapter xxxvi


the neophyte had been informed by his friend de morla as a proof of the
degree of civilization reached by the mexicans that their armies were
formed with method and as regularly divided and commanded as those of
christendom each tribe displaying under a peculiar banner
representing the arms or as we should say of our northern bands the
totem of the race and each tribe separated into squadrons and
companies led by subalterns of precisely ascertained rank and power he
perceived none of these marks of discipline among the assailants and
while properly appreciating their devoted courage was obliged to
consider them no better than a furious and confused mob he was right
the warriors of mexico had not yet appeared and these wild creatures
who came ungeneralled and unadvised to the attack were no more than the
common citizens fired by the distresses of their king and rushing to
his aid without any bond of connexion or government save the unanimity
of their fury the violence with which they leaped to the attack
carried them to the gates of the court and to the mouths of the
artillery where they fell under the spears of the spaniards or were
scattered like chaff at each murderous discharge of the cannon added to
this the tlascalans animated by their ancient hatred and the presence
of him whom they esteemed almost a god clambered upon the wall and
with their clubs and lances did bloody execution on the multitudes
below the tlascalans were indeed almost the only persons of the
garrison who suffered much loss for the spaniards cased in iron and
escaupil and fenced behind the wall or the battlements of the terrace
discharged their cross-bows and muskets and handled their long spears
in comparative safety

the din of yells and screams mingled with the crash of arquebuses and
the sharp clang of steel cross-bows was in itself infernal while the
peals of artillery served with such skill and constancy that every
half-minute there was one or other discharged from some quarter of the
palace leaving at each discharge a long avenue of death among the
crowds converted what might have seemed a scene of elysium into a
spectacle of hell no man could reckon no man could imagine the
slaughter made by the besieged army among their foes in the short
space of half an hour but the sun rose and still found the infatuated
barbarians rushing now with shouts of defiance and now with mournful
cries as if calling upon their imprisoned king to add yet another and
another layer to the bloody ridges growing in the paths of the
cannon-shot

all this time the captive monarch unseen by his people though quickly
detected by the sharp eye of cortes sat in one of the turrets
witnessing the devoted love of his people and feeling with sharp
pangs that he had not deserved it and now too for the suddenness of
the punishment had convinced him of the impolicy of the fault did don
hernan himself feel a touch of compunction for the wanton injury he had
done his prisoner and fearing lest the work of this day should be but
the prelude of a storm it might not be in his power to allay he sent to
him de morla a cavalier whom more than others he seemed to favour to
persuade him if indeed he might be persuaded to exercise his
authority and by commanding his people to disperse preserve them from
that destruction which the general avowed he was loath to bring upon
them

no smile lit the countenance of montezuma at the appearance of his
favourite and to the demand of don hernan he replied with dignity
yet with a bitter sorrow 

the teuctli so they called don hernan not because they esteemed
him a divinity but a great prince this being the title of one of the
classes of nobility has made me a slave my subjects are his let
the king govern his people

so saying and immediately descending from the roof he shut himself in
his apartments and resolutely refused to admit another messenger to his
presence

and the dog denies me then cried cortes when this answer was
repeated to him he says the truth he is my slave his people are
mine and i will straightway convince them of their subjection to
horse to horse brave cavaliers he shouted aloud let it not be
said we wasted powder on miserable naked indians when we have swords
to strike them on the neck and horses hoofs to tread them to the
earth

no one was more ready to obey this call than don amador de leste he
had stood upon the wall occasionally striking down some furious
assailant with his spear but oftener cheering others with his voice
and yet remaining more as a spectator than a combatant disdaining to
strike except when personally attacked until his blood was heated by
the spectacle

mount now my knave lazaro and perhaps we shall find my poor jacinto
among these outrageous infidels get thee to horse fabueno for to-day
thou shalt see what it is to be a soldier

fogoso stood in his mail like the steed of a true knight champing the
bit and whinnying for he longed to be in the midst of the combat and
loud was the sound of his neighing when he felt the weight of his
master and turned his fierce eyes towards the gate

before the cavaliers forming three abreast as many as could at once
pass through the gates loosing their sabres in the scabbards and
couching their spears had yet received the signal to dash upon the
opposing herds there came from the great pyramid which was seen
rearing its mountainous mass above the houses of the square the sound
as of a horn sad and solemn but of so mighty a tone that it swelled
distinctly over all the din of the battle and sent a boding fear to the
heart of the christians they knew or they thought it the sacred bugle
of mexitli sounded only during the festivals of that ferocious deity
or on the occasion of a great battle when it was supposed that
mexitli himself spoke to his children and bade them die bravely there
was not a spaniard present who had not heard that the effect of this
consecrated trumpet so sparingly used was to nerve even the vanquished
with new spirit and those fighting with additional rage and that the
meanest mexican however overpowered thought not of retreat when thus
cheered by his god the surprise of all was therefore great when at
the first blast the mexicans ceased their cries and stood as if turned
into statues and they were still more amazed when as the brazen
instrument again poured its lugubrious roar over the city the
barbarians responding with a mournful shriek turned their backs upon
the besieged and instantly began to fly a third blast was sounded and
nothing was seen upon the great square or the four streets save heaps
of carcasses and piles of human beings writhing in the death-agony

here is diabolical magic cried cortes joyfully there are more
signals made by that accursed horn than we have heard of and it seems
to me huitzilopochtli may be sometimes a coward nevertheless we will
look a little into the mystery for i perceive shining cloaks as well
as priestly gowns on the temple which we will make claim to for
doubtless the traitor cuitlahuatzin is under one of them take thou thy
party sandoval and scour me the streets that lie eastward we meet at
the temple for ourselves my masters we are fifty horse and three
hundred foot all good christian men for in this work we shall need no
tlascalans let us go in the name of god and god will be with
us only tis my counsel and command that we keep together with our
eyes wide open lest we should have company not so much to our liking

the cavaliers cheered as they rode from the gates and with a savage
delight urged their horses over the piles of dead or smote some dying
struggler with the spear an amusement in which they were occasionally
imitated by the foot-soldiers who followed at their heels




chapter xxxvii


the same solitude which had covered the city the preceding evening now
seemed again to invest it corses were here and there strown in the
street as of fugitives dying in their flight and once a wounded man
was seen staggering blindly along as if wholly insensible to the
approach of his foes the sight of this solitary wretch did more to
disarm the fury of don amador than did the spectacle of thousands lying
dead on the square and certain grievous reflections such as sometimes
assailed him after a battle were beginning to intrude upon his mind
when a cavalier darting forward with a loud cry and couching his
lance as if at a worthier enemy thrust the wounded barbarian through
the body and killed him on the spot a few hidalgos and most of the
footmen rewarded this feat of dexterity with a loud cheer but there
were many who like the neophyte met the triumphant looks of the
champion alvarado with glances of infinite disgust and frowning
disdain

as the party approached the neighbourhood of the great temple they
began to perceive in the streets groups of men who being altogether
unarmed commonly fled at the first sight of the christians though
sometimes they stood aside with submissive and dejected countenances
as if awaiting any punishment the teuctli might choose to inflict upon
them but cortes reading in this humility the proofs of penitence or
willing to suppose that these men had not shared in the hostilities of
the day commanded his followers not to attack them and thus
restrained they rode slowly and cautiously onwards their fury
gradually abating and the fears which had been excited by the late
assault giving place to the hope that it indicated no general spirit
and no deep-laid plan of insurrection

the groups of mexicans increased both in numbers and frequency as the
christians proceeded but still they betrayed no disposition to make use
of the arms which were sometimes seen in their hands and the
spaniards regulating their own conduct by that of the barbarians rode
onwards with so pacific an air that a stranger arriving that moment in
the city might have deemed them associated together on the most
friendly terms and proceeding in company to take part in some general
festivity nevertheless the same stranger would have quickly observed
that these friends besides keeping as far separated as the streets
would allow and even where that was possible removing from each
other's presence entirely eyed each other at times with looks of
jealousy which became more marked as the mexicans grew more numerous
in truth the feelings which had so quickly passed from rage to
tranquillity were now in danger of another revulsion and many an eye
was riveted on the countenance of the general as if to read a
confirmation of the common anxiety as ever and anon it turned from
the prospect of multitudes in front to the spectacle of crowds
gathering at a distance on the rear

all that is needful whispered rather than spoke don hernan though
his words were caught by every ear is to trust in god and our sharp
spears there is doubtless some idolatrous rite about to be enacted in
the temple which draws these varlets thitherward and the gratitude
with which they remember our exploits of this morning will account for
their present hang-dog looks if they mean any treachery such as a
decoy and ambuscado why by my conscience we must e'en allow them
their humour and punish them when tis made manifest i counsel my
friends to be of good heart for i think the dogs have had fighting
enough to-day nevertheless i will not quarrel with any man who keeps
his hands in readiness and puts his eyes and ears to their proper
uses

as if to set them an example don hernan now began to look about him
with redoubled vigilance and it was remarked that he passed no house
without eyeing its terrace keenly and steadfastly as if dreading more
to discover an enemy in such places than in the street this was in
fact a situation from which an enemy might annoy the spaniards with the
greatest advantage and at the least risk

the houses of this quarter were evidently inhabited by the rich perhaps
by the nobles of mexico they were of solid stone spacious and
frequently of two floors lofty and their terraces crowned with
battlements and turrets each stood separated from its neighbour by a
little garden or alley and sometimes by a narrow canal which crossed
the great street and was furnished with a strong wooden bridge of such
width that five horsemen could pass it at a time often too the
dwelling of some man of power stood so far back as to allow the canal
to be carried quite round it without infringing upon the street but
more frequently it was fronted only with a little bed of flowers the
stones of which such structures were composed were often sculptured
into rude reliefs representing huge serpents which twined in a
fantastic and frightful manner about the windows and doors as if to
protect them from the invasion of robbers indeed these were almost the
only defences for the green bulrush lying across the threshold could
deter none but a mexican from entering and perhaps none but a
barbarian would have seen in the string of cacao berries or of little
vessels of earthenware hanging at the door the bell to announce his
visitation a curtain commonly hung flapping at the entrance but
neither plank nor bar gave security to the sanctity of the interior

notwithstanding the fears of the general he beheld no mexicans lurking
among the terraces or peering from the windows but his anxiety was not
the less goading for that reason for having now drawn nigh to the great
square it seemed to him that he had at last thrust himself into that
part of the city where all the multitudes of tenochtitlan were
assembled to meet him and whether for purposes of pacification or
vengeance he dared not inquire

the appearance of things as the party issued upon the square and faced
the house of skulls was indeed menacing that enormous pyramid which
don amador had surveyed with awe in the gloom of evening was now
concealed under a more impressive veil it was invested and darkened by
a cloud of human beings which surged over its vast summit and rolled
along its huge sides like a living storm the great court that
surrounded it was also filled with barbarians for though the
coatepantli or wall of serpents with its monstrous battlements and
gloomy towers concealed them from the eye there came such a hum of
voices from behind as could not have been produced alone even by the
myriads that covered the temple in addition to these the great square
itself was alive with mexicans and the sudden sight of them brought a
thrill of alarm into the heart of the bravest cavalier

the people of tenochtitlan thus as it were hunted by their invaders
even to their sanctuaries turned upon them with frowns yet parted away
from before them in deep silence nevertheless at this spectacle the
christians came to an immediate stand in doubt whether to entangle
themselves further or to take counsel of their fears and retreat
without delay to their quarters while they stood yet hesitating and
in some confusion suddenly and with a tone that pierced to their
inmost souls there came a horrid shriek from the top of the pyramid
and fifty castilian voices exclaimed a sacrifice a human
sacrifice and under the cross of christ that we raised on the
temple

the place of god is defiled by the rites of hell cried cortes
furiously his apprehensions vanishing at once before his fanaticism
set on and avenge couch your lances draw your swords and if any
resist call on god and slay so saying he drew his sword spurred
his dun steed and rushed towards the temple

the half-naked herds fled yelling away from the infuriated christian
opening him a free path to the walls and had that fearful cry been
repeated there is no doubt he would have led his followers even within
the coatepantli though at the risk of irretrievable and universal
destruction before however he had yet reached the wall he had time
for reflection and though greatly excited he could no longer conceal
from himself the consequences of provoking the pagans at their very
temple and during the worship of their god he was at this moment
well befriended and numerously indeed but at a distance from the
garrison without cannon and almost without musketry surrounded by
enemies whom the eye could not number and who had not feared to assail
him even when fortified in a situation almost impregnable and assisted
by three times his present force as well as several thousand bold
tlascalans and in addition to all these disadvantages there came
neither such sound of trumpet nor such distant commotion among the
indians as might admonish him of the approach of sandoval

he checked his horse and waving to his followers to halt again cast
his eyes around on the multitude as if to determine in what manner to
begin his retreat for he felt that this measure could be no longer
delayed the mexicans gazed upon him with angry visages but still in
silence not an arm was yet raised and they seemed prepared to give him
passage whichever way he might choose to direct his course

while hesitating an instant don hernan perceived a stir among the
crowds close under the wall of serpents accompanied by a low but
general murmur of voices and immediately the eyes of the pagans were
turned from him towards the coatepantli as if to catch a view of some
sight still more attractive and important his first thought was that
these movements indicated the sudden presence of sandoval and his party
a conceit that was however immediately put to flight by the events
which ensued

the murmurs of the multitude were soon stilled and the pagans that
covered the pyramid were seen to cast their eyes earnestly down to the
square as the sound of many flutes and other soft wind-instruments
rose on the air and crept not unmusically along the wall of serpents
and thence to the ears of the spaniards before these had yet time to
express their wonder at the presence of such peaceful music amidst a
scene of war and sacrifice the crowds slowly parted asunder and they
plainly beheld for the mexicans had opened a wide vista to the
principal gate a procession seemingly of little children clad in
white garments waving pots of incense conducted by priests in gowns
of black and flame colour and headed by musicians and men bearing
little flags issue from the throng and bend their steps towards the
savage portal in the centre of the train on a sort of litter very
rich and gorgeous borne on men's shoulders and sheltered by a royal
canopy of green and crimson feathers stood a figure which might have
been some maiden princess arrayed for the festival or as she seemed
to one or two of the more superstitious castilians some fiendish
goddess conjured up by the diabolical arts of the priests to add the
inspiration of her presence to the wild fury of her adorers she stood
erect her body concealed in long flowing vestments of white on which
were embroidered serpents of some green material in her hand she held
a rod imitative of the same reptile and on her forehead was a coronet
of feathers surrounding what seemed a knot of little snakes writhing
round a star or sun of burnished gold

as this fair apparition was carried through their ranks between the
great wall and the house of skulls the mexicans were seen to throw
themselves reverently on the earth as if to a divinity and those that
stood most remote no sooner beheld her than they bowed their heads
with the deepest humility

meanwhile the spaniards gazed on with both admiration and wonder until
the train had reached the open portal at which place and just as she
was about to be concealed from them for ever the divinity priestess
or princess whichever she was turned her body slowly round and
revealed to them a face of a paler hue than any they had yet seen in the
new world and as they afterwards affirmed of the most incomparable
and ravishing beauty at this sight all uttered exclamations of
surprise which were carried to the ears of the vision but don amador
de leste fetching a cry that thrilled through the hearts of all broke
from the ranks as if beset by some sudden demon and dashed madly
towards the apparition

before the spaniards could recover from their astonishment the members
of the procession deity priests censer-bearers and musicians with
loud screams vanished under the portals and the infidels starting up
in a rage that could be suppressed no longer rushed upon the novice to
avenge in his blood the insult he had offered to their deity

quick a-god's name and rescue cried cortes for the young man is
mad

there seemed grounds for this imputation for besides the inexplicable
folly of his first act don amador appeared now for a moment to be
lost in such a maze that blows of the heavy maquahuitl were rained upon
his stout armour and several furious hands had clutched not only upon
his spear but upon himself to drag him from the saddle before he
bethought him to draw his sword and defend his life but his sword was
at last drawn his fit dispelled and before his countrymen had yet
reached him he was dealing such blows around him and so urging his
courageous steed upon the assailants as quickly to put himself out of
the danger of immediate death

the passions of the multitude restrained for a moment by their
superstition or their rulers were now fully and unappeasably roused
and with yells that came at once from the pyramid from the temple yard
from the great square and the neighbouring streets they rushed upon
the christians surrounding them and displaying such ferocious
determination as left them but small hopes of escape

god and spain honour and fame cried alvarado spearing a barbarian
at each word what do you think of my mexicans now true friends

his cheer was lost in the roar of screams and nothing but the voice of
don hernan well known to be as clear and powerful in battle as the
trumpet which he invoked was heard pealing above the din

now show yourselves spaniards and soldiers and strike for the blood of
christ ho trumpeter thy flourish and find me where lags my lazy
gonzalo

as he spoke he fought for so violent had been the attack of the
infidels that they were mingled among and fighting hand to hand with
the christians a confused and sanguinary chaos scarcely indeed had
the trumpeter time to wind his instrument before it was struck out of
his hand by a brawny savage and the same blow which robbed him of it
left the arm that held it a shattered and useless member the blast
however had sounded and almost instantaneously it was answered by a
bugle afar indeed and blown hurriedly as if the musician were in as
much jeopardy as his fellow but still full of joy and good cheer to the
christian combatants

close and turn footmen to your square cried cortes and valiant
cavaliers charge me now as though ye fought against devils with angels
for your lookers-on

to the temple to the temple cried amador with a voice rivalling the
general's in loudness and turning in a frenzy towards the pyramid down
whose sides the infidels were seen rushing with frantic speed

but the head of fogoso was seized by two friendly followers and while
don amador glared fiercely at the pale but not affrighted secretary he
heard on the other side the tranquil voice of lazaro

master said the faithful servant if we separate from our friends
we are dead men and don gabriel is left without a kinsman in this land
of demoniacs

close and turn i bid ye cried cortes furiously heed not the
wolves that are fast to your sides charge on the herds charge on the
herds and over-throw with the weight of your hoofs charge i bid ye
and care not though ye should find your lances striking against the
breast of sandoval charge on the herds charge on the herds

so saying don hernan set an example followed by the cavaliers and as
the fifty horsemen spurred violently upon the mob shouting and
cheering the naked multitudes quailed from before them though only to
gather again on their flanks with renewed desperation

will ye desert us that are afoot cried voices from behind with
dolorous cries

ho sandoval art thou sleeping

santiago and god be thanked tis the voice of the general cried
sandoval in the distance his voice came from the surge of battle like
the cheer of a sailor who recks not for the tempest it filled the
cavaliers with joy

good heart now brave hearts shouted cortes for my son sandoval
answers me rein me round and charge me back to the infantry

backwards galloped the fifty cavaliers strewing the earth with trampled
pagans and the footmen shouted with delight as they again beheld their
leader but the relief and the joy were only momentary

fight ye my dogs and slay your own sheep be firm wall yourselves
with spears and presently ye shall be lookers-on sweep the square
again brave cavaliers goad flanks couch spears and this time let
me see the red face of my lieutenant

turning and shouting with a louder cheer for the experience of the
two first charges had warned the mexicans of their destructive efficacy
and they now recoiled with a more visible alarm the cavaliers again
rushed through their foes like a whirlwind and brushing them aside as
the meteor brushes the fogs of evening they dashed onwards until their
shouts were loudly re-echoed and they found themselves confronted with
don gonzalo and his party

the greetings of the friends were brief and few for the same myriads
attacking with the same frenzied desperation invested them with a
danger that did not seem to diminish

bring thy foot in front cried cortes and while they follow me
charge thou behind them be quick and be brave march fast ye idle
spearmen and stare not for these are not devils but men god and
spain santiago and at them again peerless cavaliers we fight for
christ and immortal honour

the valiant band of cavaliers again turned at the voice of their leader
and again they swept the corse-encumbered square rushing to the relief
of their own infantry following the counsel he had given to sandoval
the wary general passed by his foot-soldiers and bidding them march
boldly forwards and join themselves with the infantry of don gonzalo
he charged the infidels from their rear with a fury they could not
resist and then rushing backwards with equal resolution discovered the
foot-soldiers in the position in which it had been his aim to place
them the united infantry full seven hundred men in number were now
protected both in front and rear by a band of cavalry their flanks
looking on one side to the temple and on the other to a great
street that opened opposite arranging them at a word in two lines
standing back to back and seconding himself the manoeuvre which he
dictated to sandoval the general swept instantly to that flank which
bordered on the wall of serpents while gonzalo rode to the other thus
arranged the little army presented the figure of a hollow square or
rather of a narrow parallelogram the chief sides of which were made by
double rows of spearmen and the smaller by bands of horsemen thus
arranged too the christians fought with greater resolution and
success for parting at once from a common centre the infantry drove
the assailants from before them on two sides while the cavalry carried
death and horror to the others until at a given signal all again fell
back to their position and presented a wall altogether inexpugnable to
the weak though untiring savages

it was the persuasion of don hernan that in this advantageous
position he could in a short time so punish his enemies as to teach
them the folly of contending with christian men and perhaps end the war
in a day but for a full hour he repeated his charges now pinning his
foes against the wall or the steps of the house of skulls now falling
back to breathe and at each charge adding to the number of the dead
until their corses literally obstructed his path and left it nearly
impassable at every charge too his cavaliers waxed more weary and
struck more faintly while the horses obeyed the spur and voice with
diminishing vigour and it seemed that they must soon be left unable
from sheer fatigue to continue the work of slaughter the pagans
perished in crowds at each charge and at each volley of bow-shots but
neither their spirit nor their numbers seemed to decrease their yells
were as loud their countenances as bold their assaults as violent as
at first and the spaniards beheld the sun rising high in the heavens
without any termination to their labours or their sufferings twenty
christians already lay dead on the square or had been dragged perhaps
while yet breathing to be sacrificed on the pyramid this was a
suspicion that shocked the souls of many for twice or thrice they
heard among the crowds who still stood on the lofty terrace shooting
arrows down on the square such shouts of triumphant delight as they
thought could be caused by nothing but the immolation of a victim

grief and rage lay heavily on the heart of cortes but though the
apprehension that if much longer over-worn by combat his followers
might be left unable even to fly added its sting to the others shame
deterred him for a time from giving the mortifying order harassed
and even wounded for a defective link in his mail had yielded to an
arrow-head and the stone was buried in his shoulder he nevertheless
preserved a good countenance cheered his people with the assurance of
victory fought on exposing himself like the meanest of his soldiers
and several times at the imminent risk of his life rescued certain
foot-soldiers from the consequences of their foolhardiness

there was among the infantry a man of great courage and strength by
the name of lezcano whose only weapon was a huge two-handed sword the
valiant use of which had gained him among his companions the title of
dos manos or two-hands no spearman of his company advanced to the
charge with more readiness than did this fellow with his gigantic
weapon and none retreated with more constant reluctance indeed he
commonly fell back so leisurely as to draw three or four foes upon him
at once and it seemed to be his pleasure to meet these in such a way
as should call for the praises of his companions his daring that day
would have left him with the additional name of the bravest of the
brave had it been tempered with a little discretion but inflamed by
the encomiums of his comrades and not less by the complimentary rebukes
of his captain his rashness knew no bounds and twice or thrice he
thrust himself into situations of peril from which he was rescued with
great difficulty he had been saved once by don hernan it was his fate
a second time to draw the notice of the general who falling back on
the infantry beheld him beset by a dozen foes surrounded and using
his great scimitar furiously yet as it seemed in vain for he was
unhelmed

what ho don amador cried cortes to the cavalier who was at his
side let us rescue dos manos the mad

in an instant of time the two hidalgos had reached the group and
raised their voices in encouragement while each struck down a savage
at that moment and while lezcano elevated his scimitar to ward off the
blow of a maquahuitl the massive blade shivered as if by a
thunderbolt fell to the earth but before it reached it the sharp
glass of the indian sword had entered his brain the cavaliers struck
fast and hard on either hand the barbarians fled but lezcano the
two-handed lay rolling his eyes to heaven his head cloven to the
mouth

if we slay a thousand foes for every christian man that dies yet shall
we be vanquished said cortes turning an eye of despair on his
companion and speaking the feelings he had concealed from all others
indeed he seemed to rejoice that destiny had given him one follower to
whom he might unbosom himself without the apprehension of creating
alarm he hesitated not to relieve himself of his grief to don amador
for he knew him to be inaccessible to fear be of good heart my
friend i have drawn thee into a den of devils we must retreat or
die

i will advance or retreat as thou wilt said amador with a visage
in which don hernan now for the first time beheld an expression so wild
and ghastly that he was reminded of calavar it matters nothing here
or at the palace but it is my duty to assure thee of mine own
persuasion retreat may bring us relief there is no victory for us
to-day

god help thee art thou wounded cried cortes

a little hurt by the skilless hand of fabueno said the novice
tranquilly who not yet being perfected in the use of the spear
thrust his weapon into my back while aiming at the throat of a
cacique but that is not it i have this day seen a sight which
convinces me we are among magicians and devils and persuades me along
with certain other recent occurrences that the time of some of us is
reckoned therefore i say to thee i will advance with thee or retreat
as thou thinkest best to me it matters not but my counsel is to fly
we may save others

it is needful replied don hernan mournfully he gave his orders to
certain officers and the retreat was commenced in the order in which
they had fought that is to say the infantry drawing their lines
closer together and facing to the flank began to march down the
street preceded by sandoval charging the opponents from the front
while cortes and his band at intervals rushing back upon the pursuers
kept the triumphant barbarians from the rear




chapter xxxviii


the distance between the great temple and the palace of axajacatl was by
no means great though cortes for the purpose of prying into many
streets had led his followers against it by a long and circuitous
course a plan which had been followed by don gonzalo though in
another direction indeed they were not so far separated but that a
strong bowman or a good slinger might from the top of the pyramid
drive his missile upon the roof of the garrison to the great injury of
the besieged as was afterwards fully made manifest the distance
therefore to be won by the retreating spaniards was small but it took
them hours to accomplish it it seemed as if the infidels fearing lest
their foes might escape out of their hands if they slackened their
efforts for a moment were resolved to effect their destruction at any
cost while they were still at a distance from succour they pressed
ferociously and rapidly on the fugitives they gained their front and
thus encompassed them with a compact mass of human beings against which
the cavaliers charged as against a stone wall slaying and trampling
indeed but without penetrating it for more than a few yards each step
gained by the van was literally carved by the cavalry as out of a
rock while the utmost exertions of don hernan could do nothing more
than preserve his rear band in the attitude of a dike slowly moving
before the shocks of a flood which it could not repel

in addition to these alarming circumstances there were others now
developed of a not less serious aspect the canals that in two or
three places intersected the street were swarming with canoes from
which the savages discharged their arrows with fatal aim or sprang at
once upon the footmen striking with spear and maquahuitl and were
driven back only after the most strenuous efforts they had destroyed
the bridges and the canals could only be passed by renewing them with
such planks as the infantry could tear from the adjoining houses and
hastily throw over the water a work of no less suffering than time and
labour besides all this the annoyance which don hernan had first
dreaded was now practised by the crafty barbarians the terraces were
covered with armed men who besides discharging their darts and arrows
down upon the exposed soldiers tore away with levers the stones from
the battlements and hurled them full upon the heads of their enemies

the sound of drums and conches the fierce yells the whistling the
dying screams the loud and hurried prayers the neighing of horses and
now and then the shriek of some beast mangled by a rough spear the
rattling of arrow-heads the clang of clubs upon iron bucklers the
heavy fall of a huge stone crushing a footman to the earth the plunging
of some wounded wretch strangling in a ditch and the roar of cannon at
the palace showing that the battle was universal these together now
made up such a chorus of hellish sounds as don amador confessed to
himself he had never heard before not even among the horrors of rhodes
when sacked by other infidels then esteemed the most valiant in the
world but to these dismal tumults others were speedily added when
cortes raging with a fury that increased with his despair commanded
the footmen to fire every house whose top afforded footing to the
ferocious foe a command that was obeyed with good will and with
dreadful effect for though from the nature of its materials and the
isolated condition of each structure it was not possible to produce a
general conflagration yet the great quantity of cotton robes of dry
mats and of resinous woods about each house left it so combustible
that the application of a torch to the door-curtains or the casting of
a fire-brand into the interior instantly enveloped it in flames among
these when they burst through the roofs of light rafters and the
thatching of dried reeds the pagan warriors perished miserably or
flinging themselves desperately down were either dashed to pieces or
transfixed by the lances of the spaniards

but the same agent which so dreadfully paralyzed the efforts of the
mexican brought suffering scarcely less disastrous to the christian
ranks they were stifled with the smoke they were scorched by the
flames of the burning houses and ever and anon some frantic
barbarian perishing among the fires of his dwelling and seeking to
inflict a horrid vengeance grasped even in his death-gasp a flaming
rafter in his arms and sprang down with it upon his foes maiming and
scorching where he did not kill

thus fighting and thus resisted weary and despairing their bodies
covered with blood their garments sometimes burning the spaniards at
last gained the square that surrounded the palace and fighting their
way through the herds that invested it for almost at the same moment
that they had been attacked at the temple the quarters were again
assailed and shouting to the cannoniers lest they should fire on
them they placed their feet in the court-yard and thanked god for this
respite to their sufferings

it was a respite from death for behind the stone wall they were
comparatively secure but not a respite from labour the mexicans abated
not a jot of their ardour the same herds that covered the square at
dawn were again yelling at the gates and with the same unconquerable
fury and the soldiers already fainting with fatigue with famine and
thirst for they had taken no refreshment since the preceding evening
were fain to purchase painfully a temporary safety by standing to the
walls and keeping the savages at bay as they could

the artillery thundered the cross-bows twanged the arquebuses added
their destructive volleys to the other warlike noises but the mexicans
disregarding these sounds as well as the havoc made among their ranks
rushed in repeated assaults against the walls and sometimes with
such violence that they drove the besieged from the gate and entered
pell-mell with them into the court-yard then indeed ensued a scene of
murder for the christians flying again to the portal cut off the
retreat of such desperadoes and slew them within the walls without
loss and almost at their leisure

on such occasions no one showed more spirit in attacking or more fury
in slaying than the young secretary the suit of goodly armour sent him
by the admiral and his rapid proficiency in the practice of arms had
inflamed his vanity and he burned to approve himself worthy the
companionship of cavaliers the native conscientiousness which filled
him with horror at the sight of the first blood shed the first life
destroyed by his hand had vanished as a dream for it is the
excellence of war that while developing our true nature and
remaining itself as the link which binds man to his original state of
barbarism it preserves him the delights of a savage without entirely
depriving him of the pleasures of civilization the right of shedding
blood mankind enjoy in common with brutes and doubtless a
conformable philosophy will not frown on the privilege so long as the
loss of it would contract our circle of enjoyments there is something
poetical in the diabolism of a fiend and as much that is splendid in
the ferocity of a tiger and though these two qualities be the chief
elements of heroism they bring with them such accompaniments of
splendour and sentiment that he would rob the world of half its glory
as well as much of its poetry who should destroy the race of the great
and leave mankind to the dull innocence of peace there are more
millions of human beings the victims of war rotting under the earth
than now move on its surface

the pain of wounds had also produced a new effect in the bosom of
lorenzo for instead of cooling his courage it now inflamed his rage
and helped to make him valiant the mild and feeling boy was quite
transformed into a heartless ruffian and so great had become his love
of slaughter and so unscrupulous his manner of gratifying it that
once or twice don amador noticed him and would have censured him
sharply but that his attention was immediately absorbed by the
necessity of self-defence the cavaliers had dismounted and the
neophyte fought at the gates on foot in the midst of an assault in
which the defenders had been driven back but which disgrace they were
now repairing he beheld his ward struggling with a wounded savage who
grasped his knees and hand but in intreaty not hostility and greatly
was don amador shocked when he beheld the secretary disengage his arm
and with a shout of triumph plunge his steel into the throat of the
supplicating barbarian

art thou a devil lorenzo cried the cavalier indignantly that was
a knave's and a coward's blow thou shalt follow me no longer

while he spoke and left himself unguarded a gigantic pagan taking
advantage of his indiscretion leaped suddenly upon him and struck him
such a blow with a maquahuitl as but for the strength of his casque
would have killed him outright as it was the shock so stunned him as
to leave him for a moment incapable of defence in that moment the
savage uttering a loud yell sprang forward to repeat the blow or to
drag him off a prisoner when fabueno perceiving the extremity of his
patron and fired with the opportunity of proving his valour rushed
between them and with a lucky blow on the naked neck of the mexican
instantly despatched him

a valiant stroke lorenzo said the neophyte losing somewhat of his
heat as he recovered his wits but it does not entirely wipe out the
shame of the other moderate thy wrath curb thy fury and remember that
cruelty is the mark of a dastard strike me no more foes that cry for
mercy

as his anger had been changed into approbation so now were his censures
abruptly ended by exclamations of surprise for at that instant
fabueno grasping his arm with one hand and with the other pointing a
little to one side turned upon him a countenance full of alarm he
looked around and beheld with amazement his kinsman don gabriel
entirely unarmed except with sword and buckler mingled with the
combatants shouting a feeble war-cry striking faintly and indeed
preserved less by his courage than his appearance from the bludgeons of
the infidels his grizzly locks for he was entirely bare-headed fell
over his hollow and bloodless cheeks whereon glittered black and
hideous a single gout of gore his face was like the face of the dead
and the savages recoiled from before him as if from a spirit rousing
from mictlan the world of gloom to call them down to his dark
dwelling

in a moment the neophyte followed by fabueno and lazaro who answered
to his call and marco who seemed to have been separated by the melée
from his master was at the side of calavar the mind of the knight was
wholly gone and he seemed as if at the point of death raised from his
couch by the clamours of the contest and urged into it by the instinct
of long habit or by the goadings of madness

he submitted patiently and without words to the gentle violence of his
kinsman and was straightway carried to his apartment




chapter xxxix


after much search and persuasion a surgeon was found and induced to
visit the knight he despatched his questions almost in a word for he
was a fighting bachelor and burned with impatience to return to the
contest he mingled hastily a draught which he affirmed to be of
wondrous efficacy in composing disordered minds to sleep gave a few
simple directions and excusing his haste in the urgency of his other
occupations both military and chirurgical he immediately departed

marco said the neophyte when the draught was administered and don
gabriel laid on the couch thou deservest the heaviest punishment for
leaving thy master an instant though as thou sayest while fast
asleep remain by him now and be more faithful as for thee lorenzo
he continued to the secretary who stood panting at his side there
is good reason thou shouldst share the task of marco were it only to
repose thee a little but more need is it that thou suffer thy blood to
cool and reflect with shame that thou hast this day cancelled all
thy good deeds by killing a prostrate and beseeching foe remain
therefore to assist marco and by-and-by i will come to thee and
declare whether or not thou shalt draw thy sword again to-day

and thus leaving his kinsman to the care of the two followers and
beckoning lazaro along don amador returned to the court-yard and the
conflict

the history of the remainder of the day it was now noon is a weary
tale of blood wounds could not check nor slaughter subdue the
animosity of the besiegers and the spaniards tired even of killing
hoped no longer for victory over men who seemed to fight with no object
but to die and who rushed up as readily to the mouth of a cannon whose
vent was already blazing under the linstock as to the spears that
bristled with fatal opposition at the gates

but night came at last and with it a hope to end the sufferings that
were already intolerable the hope was vain the barbarians apparently
incapable of fatigue or perhaps yielding their places to fresh
combatants continued the assault even with increasing vigour and
boldness they rushed against the court-wall with heavy beams rude
battering-rams with which they thought to shake it to its foundations
and thus deprive the christians of their greatest safeguard in certain
spots they succeeded and the soldiers cursed the day of their birth as
the ruins fell crashing to the ground and they saw themselves reduced
to the alternative of filling the breaches with their bodies or
remaining to perish where they stood it is true that in this kind of
defence as well as under other urgent difficulties they received good
and manly aid from their numerous allies the tlascalans who fought
during the whole day with a spirit and cheerfulness that put many a
repining castilian to shame but these though battling equally for
their lives were incapable of withstanding long the unexampled violence
of the assaults and it was soon found that the naked bodies of the
tlascalans offered but slight impediment to the frenzied mexicans

the spaniards in the expedient used to drive the citizens from their
house-tops had taught them a mode of warfare which they were not slow
to adopt the palace was of a solid structure and seemed to bid
defiance to flames but the same cedars that finished the interior of
meaner houses formed its floors and ceilings every chamber was covered
with mats and most of them were hung with the most inflammable kind of
tapestry in addition to this the five thousand tlascalans who had
been left with alvarado and who slept in the court-yard besides
strewing the earth with rushes their humble couches had constructed
along the walls of the palace itself many rude arbours or rather
kennels of reeds from the lake to shelter them from the vicissitudes
of the rainy season which had already in part set in and to crown
all the cavaliers whose horses as they well knew were each worth a
thousand tlascalans had caused stalls to be constructed for them
wherein they were better protected from the weather than their
fellow-animals the allies with these arrangements the mexicans were
well acquainted

no sooner therefore had they succeeded in beating down several
breaches in the wall and found that they could sometimes drive the
besieged from them than they made trial of the expedient they rushed
together against the walls in a general assault waving firebrands and
torches which those who forced their way through the breaches applied
to the stalls and arbours or scattered over the beds of the tlascalans
the dying incendiary pierced with a dozen spears ended his life with a
laugh of joy as he beheld the flames burst ruddily up to his brand

the misery of the spaniards was now complete they were parched with
thirst the sweet fountains of chapoltepec gushed only over the square
of the temple a well dug by alvarado in his extremity furnished a
meager supply of water and that so brackish that even the brutes
turned from it in disgust till forced to drink by pangs that would
allow them to be fastidious no longer the nearest canal conducting the
briny waters of tezcuco was shut out by ramparts of savages the
spaniards with one universal voice sent up a cry of despair as they
beheld the flames run over the court the stalls the kennels and up
the palace walls and knew not how to extinguish them the cry was
answered from without with such yells of exultation as froze their
blood and in the glare of the sudden conflagration they saw the
barbarians rushing again to the attack darting through the breaches
and leaping over the walls

in this strait beset at once by two foes equally irresistible equally
pitiless they struck about them blindly and despairingly cursing their
fate their folly and the leader who had seduced them from their island
homes to die a death so ignoble and so dreadful

for a moment the spirit of the general sunk and turning to don amador
whose fate it was again to be at his side he said with a ghastly
countenance rendered hideous by the infernal glare 

we die the death of foxes in a hole very noble friend commend thy
soul to god and choose thy death for we have no water to quench this
hell

god help my kinsman and father and all is one said amador with a
desperate calmness the flames are hot but the grave is cold

the grave is cold shouted cortes with the voice of a madman live
in my heart for ever cold grave moist earth and santiago who strikes
for a true christian speaks in thy words what ho mad spaniards he
continued shouting aloud and running as he spoke round the palace
earth quenches flames like water swords and hands to the task and he
works best who delves as at the grave of his foeman

if there was obscurity in the words of the general it was dispelled by
his actions for dashing the rushes aside he loosened the damp soil
with his sabre and flung the clods lustily on the nearest flames loud
and joyous were the shouts of his people as hope dawned upon them with
the happy idea and in a moment the hands of many thousand men were
tearing up the earth of the court and casting it on the flames while
the savages confidently expecting the result of their stratagem
intermitted their efforts for awhile leaving the gates and breaches
nearly unguarded

it is probable that even this poor resource in the hands of so great a
multitude of men toiling with the zeal of desperation might have
sufficed to quell the flames but as if heaven had at last taken pity
on their sufferings and vouchsafed a miracle for their relief there
came almost at the same moment the pattering of rain-drops which were
quickly followed by a heavenly deluge and as the flames vanished under
it the christians fell upon their knees and with devout ardour
offered up thanks to the providence that had so marvellously preserved
them

they sprang from their knees with bolder hearts as the mexicans again
advanced to the assault but this was the last attack as if satisfied
with the toils of the day or commanded by some unknown ruler the
barbarians uttering a mournful scream suddenly departed they were
heard during the night and in the morning when the waning moon shone
dimly through the rack were seen stirring about the square but in no
great numbers and as they did not attempt any annoyance but seemed
engaged in dragging away the dead don hernan forbade his sentinels to
molest them

the guards were set and the over-worn soldiers retired at last to
throw their wounded bodies on their pallets but throughout the whole
night the noises of men repairing the breaches and constructing
certain military engines assured those who were too sore or too fearful
to sleep that the leader they had cursed was sacrificing a second night
to the duties of his station




chapter xl


don amador sought out the apartment of his kinsman with a troubled
heart a deep dejection in part the effect of extreme fatigue but
caused more by the strange and melancholy events of the last twenty-four
hours weighed upon his spirits and had increased ever since the
spectacle of the divinity notwithstanding the bustle and excitement of
the conflicts which ensued

in the passage before he had yet reached the chamber he stumbled upon
fabueno the secretary looked confused and abashed as if caught in a
dereliction of duty but before the cavalier could upbraid him he
commenced his excuses

the opiate was strong the knight was in a deep slumber he said
and as marco was sitting at his side he thought he might leave him
for a moment to discover wherefore the soldiers had ceased fighting he
hoped his noble patron would pardon him he would presently return

seek thy pleasure now lorenzo said the novice with a heavy sigh
return when thou wilt or not at all if thou preferrest to rest with
thy companions of last night i will now myself watch by don gabriel

his head sunk upon his breast as he went on for his heart was full of
painful reflections near the door of the chamber he was roused by a
step and looking up he beheld the padre olmedo approaching

holy father it rejoices me to see thee he said i had indeed
thoughts to seek thee out and claim thy benevolent counsels and
aidance but that i deemed me there were many among the wounded and
perchance the dying who had stronger claims on thy good offices

thou art not hurt my son

i have a scratch made by the unlucky spear of a friend but no harm
from the enemy said the cavalier i had indeed a blow also on the
head that made my brain ring but both i had quite forgotten i am
well enough in body reverend father and perhaps may be relieved in
mind if thou wilt vouchsafe me thy ghostly counsels

the good bartolomé making a gesture of assent followed the youth into
the chamber

the knight was as fabueno had declared lost in a deep and his kinsman
was pleased to see a placid slumber but marco instead of watching
lay sleeping full as soundly hard by this circumstance seemed to
embarrass the cavalier

father said he i thought no less than to find the serving-man
awake and it was my intent to discharge him a moment from the chamber
not fearing that what i might say to thee would disturb my afflicted
friend but i have not the heart to break the rest of this old man a
very faithful servant who closes not his eyes except when to keep
them open would no longer be of service to don gabriel

he sleeps as soundly as his master murmured the priest a good
conscience lies under his rough breast or it would not heave so
gently

my father breathes gently too said amador mournfully

may heaven restore him said the padre his guilt lies deeper in his
imagination than in his soul

dost thou think so indeed father said amador warmly though in a low
voice

the father started the history of thy kinsman is not unknown to
thee

what i know is but little save that my friend is the unhappiest of
men said the novice but heaven forbid i should seek to fathom the
secrets of the confessional i was rejoiced to hear thee say my kinsman
was not so miserable as he deems himself for indeed i have begun to
think there is something in the blood that courses in both our veins so
inclined to distemperature that a small sin may bring us the pains of
deep guilt and a light sorrow pave the way to madness

the knight and the man-at-arms lay in a slumber not to be broken by the
whispers of confession the father retired to the remotest corner of the
apartment and don amador knelt humbly and penitentially at his feet a
little taper shed a flickering ray over his blanched and troubled
forehead as he bent forward to kiss the crucifix extended by the
confessor

buen padre said he the sins i have to confess i know thou wilt
absolve for they are sins of a hot blood and not a malicious heart i
have been awroth with those who wronged me and thirsted to shed their
blood for this i repent me but the sins of pride and vanity are deep
in my heart i look about me for those acts of darkness which should
have caused the grief wherewith i am afflicted but in my self-conceit
i cannot find them and yet they must exist for i am beset with devils
or bewitched

the father gazed uneasily from the penitent to the sleeping knight but
the look of suspicion was unnoticed

we are all as i may say my son beset by devils in this infidel land
they are worshipped on the altars of the false gods and they live in
the hearts of the idolaters but if thou hast no heavy sin on thy soul
these are such devils as thou canst better exorcise with the sword than
i perhaps with prayers i think indeed thou hast no such guilt and
therefore no cause for persecution

holy father i thought so myself till late but cast thine eyes on
don gabriel thou seest him once the noblest of his species yet now
the shadow and vapour of a man a wreck of reason a living
death for his mind hath left him this i say to thee with much
anguish i could strike another who said it but it is true he is a
lunatic it is i that have robbed him of reason this is my sin and i
feel that it is heavy

thou ravest good youth thy love and devotion are well known and he
hath out of his own mouth assured me that thy affection surpasses the
love of man rest thee content a deeper cause than this and one
wherein thou hast no part has afflicted him an accident of war
tortured by a moody imagination into wilful guilt hath turned him
into this ruin

it was an accident then and no murder said the cavalier
joyously though still in a whisper i thank god that my father is
unstained with the blood of a woman

i may not repeat to thee secrets revealed only to god said the
confessor but this much may i say to allay thy fears that the blow
which destroyed a friend was meant for a foe for rage veiled his eyes
and the steel was in the hands of a madman this will assure thee that
thou hast had no agency in his affliction but hast ever proved his
truest comfort

this indeed is the truth murmured the novice and this convinces me
that by robbing him of his comfort i gave him up to the persecution of
those thoughts and memories which have destroyed him when i fought by
his side at rhodes when i followed at his back through spain his
malady was gentle it brought him often fits of gloom sometimes moments
of delirium he was unhappy father but not mad i had acquired the art
to keep the evil spirit from him and while i remained by him he was
well i left him at his command indeed but he did not command me to
forget him the servant slept and the sick man perished while i was
gone his infirmity returned and the madness that brought him to this
infidel world though i follow him i am not able to remove i found him
changed and by my neglect he is left incurable

i think indeed as thou sayest replied the confessor mildly there
is something in thy blood as well as in calavar's which inclines to
convert what is a light fault into a weighty sin thou wrongest
thyself this present misery is but the natural course of disease and
thou hast no reason to upbraid thyself with producing it

father so thought i myself till lately said the cavalier
solemnly for we have ever in our hearts some lying spirit that
glosses over our faults with excuses and deludes us from remorse but
it has been made manifest to me by strange revealments and
coincidences by griefs of my own as well as of others that my neglect
was a grievous sin not yet forgiven and verily now do i believe that
had i remained true to my knight much sorrow would have been spared to
both him and me

i cannot believe that thy unfaithfulness was a wrong of design said
the father if it be make me acquainted with it and despair not of
pardon thou wert parted from the knight at his own command

to gather him followers for the crusade meditated against the infidels
of barbary said the novice a brave and pious enterprise from which
the emperor was quickly diverted by other projects this change being
proclaimed there remained nothing for me to do but like a faithful
friend and servant to return to my kinsman had i done so what present
affliction and disturbing memories might not have been prevented know
father for i tell thee the truth that it was my fortune or rather my
unhappiness to discover at the sea-port in which i sojourned a
moorish maiden of so obscure and doubtless so base a birth that
even the noble lady who gave her protection knew not the condition of
her parents yet notwithstanding this baseness of origin and the great
pride of my own heart for truly i am come of the noblest blood in the
land i was so gained upon by the beauty and excellent worth of this
maiden for i swear to thee her superior lives not in the world that
i forgot even that she was the daughter of an idolater and loved her

a moorish infidel said the confessor it is not possible thou
couldst pledge thy faith to an unbeliever

holy father said don amador this sin was at least spared me the
maiden was a christian tenderly nurtured in all the doctrines of our
faith and almost ignorant that the race from which she drew her blood
knew any other and father i thought until this day that the soul of
leila dwelt among the seraphs moreover if the plighting of troth be
sinful i am again innocent for before i had spoken of love she was
snatched away from me

she is dead then demanded the padre

surely i think so said the cavalier mournfully yet i know not the
living creature that wots of her fate father the sin of deserting my
kinsman was first visited to me through her and because i was a sinner
leila perished how father i cannot tell thee she vanished away by
night carried off as some averred by certain moorish exiles who
that night set sail for barbary or as others dreamed murdered by
some villain and cast into the sea for the veil she wore was found
the day after dashed ashore by the surf but whether she be dead or
yet living again i say i know not though i affirm on the cross which
i hold in my hand i beheld her this day or some fiend in her likeness
under the similitude of a priestess or a divinity i know not which
carried on the shoulders of the infidels and by them worshipped

the confessor started back in alarm surveying the excited features of
the penitent and again cast his eyes towards don gabriel then laying
his hand on the head of the cavalier he said gently but warningly 

cast such thoughts from thee lest thou become like to thy kinsman

ay cried the cavalier clasping his hands and turning an eye of
horror on the father thou speakest confirmation of mine own fears
for i have said to myself this is a frenzy and therefore i have come
at last to be like my kinsman the thing that i have seen is not
and the reason that made me a man has fled from me

nay i meant not that said the padre endeavouring to soothe the
agitation he had in part caused i desired only to have thee guard
thyself against the effects of thy fancy which is at present greatly
over-excited i believe that thou didst indeed see some pagan maiden
strongly resembling the moorish leila a circumstance greatly aided by
the similarity of hue between the two races

and dost thou think said the cavalier his indignation rising in
spite of his grief that the adored and most angelic leila could in
any wise resemble the coarse maids of this copper-tinted barbarous
people i swear to thee she was fairer than the spanish girls of
almeria and a thousand times more beautiful

in this i will not contend with thee said the father benignantly
well satisfied that anger should take the place of a more perilous
passion but i may assure thee that among the princesses of the royal
household whom i think thou hast not yet seen there are many
wondrous lovely to look upon and to show thee that even a barbarian
may resemble a christian it is only needful to mention that when at
our first coming to these shores the portrait of cortes done by an
indian painter was carried to montezuma he sent to us by the next
messengers with rich presents a noble of his court so strongly
resembling don hernan both in figure and visage that we were all
filled with amazement

well indeed thou speakest to me words of comfort said don amador
more composedly though still very sadly but i would to heaven i might
look again on this woman or this fiend for i know not if she may not
be a devil in truth i thought i beheld a spectre when she turned her
eyes upon me and oh father you may judge my grief when thus
thinking and beholding her a spirit worshipped by idolaters i knew she
must be of the accursed

i have heard of this woman from others who beheld her said the
father and i doubt not she is a mortal woman esteemed holy because
a priestess and therefore received by the people with those marks of
respect which thou didst mistake for adoration it was reported to me
that she was of marvellous great beauty

marvellous indeed said the youth but father here is another
circumstance that greatly troubled me and in good sooth it troubles
me yet it is known to thee that my kinsman had until yesternight a
little page a moorish boy greatly beloved by us both as for myself
i loved him because he was of the race of leila and i protest to thee
unnatural as it may seem i bore not for my young brother a greater
affection than for this most unlucky urchin a foolish fellow charged
him to be an enchanter and sometimes i bethink me of the accusation
and suppose he has given me magical love-potions last night he was
snatched away i cannot say how but what is very wonderful my kinsman
and two of his people saw almost at the same moment a terrific
phantom father you smile if it were not for my sorrow i could smile
too and at myself for greatly am i changed since i set foot on this
heathen land a month since i held a belief in ghosts and witchcraft to
be absurd and even irreligious at this moment there is no menial in
this palace more given over to doubts and fears and more superstitious
is not this the first breathing of that horrible malady

it is the first perplexity of a scene of novelty and excitement
fatigue doth itself produce a temporary distraction as is very evident
when we come to fling our over-worn bodies on our couches to sleep
this is the land of devils because of idolaters and i may not deny
that the fiends have here greater power to haunt us with supernatural
apparitions than in the lands of our true religion yet it is not well
to yield too ready a belief to such revelations for heaven will not
permit them without a purpose rather think that the infirmity of thy
kinsman and the ignorance of his people were deluded by an accidental
deception which a cooler observer might have penetrated than by any
real vision but what wert thou saying of the moorish page

father said amador earnestly at the moment when the train that
surrounded that wonderful priestess alarmed to see me rush towards
them for that supernatural resemblance did greatly move me fled into
the temple i heard the voice of jacinto screaming aloud among the
infidels as if that moment offered by them a victim to their accursed
divinities

god be with his soul if it be so said the confessor for barbarous
and bloody in their fanaticism are the reprobates of tenochtitlan yet i
would have thee even in this matter to be of good heart for it is
believed among us that abdalla his father has been received into the
service of the mexican nobles to teach them how to resist our arts and
how to compass our destruction and it must be evident that for that
traitor's sake they will spare his boy stolen away from us as it
appears to me to be proven by the knave abdalla himself but think thou
no more of the boy he was born to inherit the perfidy of his race
deception and ingratitude have rendered him unworthy of thy care and
if some day the nobles should yield him to the priests for a victim
it will be but a just punishment for his baseness give thy mind to
other thoughts and refresh thy body with sleep for much need have we
of all the assistance thou canst now render us sleep and prepare for
other combats for this day is but the prologue of a tragedy whose end
may be more bloody and dreadful than we have yet imagined thy soul is
without stain and heaven absolves thee of sin brood over no more
gloomy thoughts believe that providence overshadows thee sleep in
tranquillity and be prepared for the morning

the good father concluded the rite of absolution with a blessing
parental and holy and stole away from the chamber don amador sighed
heavily but with a relieved mind as he rose from his knees he gazed
upon the marble features of the sleeping knight smoothed the covering
softly and tenderly about his emaciated frame and then crept to his own
couch his thoughts were many and wild but exhaustion brought slumber
to his eyelids and starting ever and anon at some elfin
representation of the captive page or the lost maid of almeria bending
over him with eyes of wo he fell at last into a sleep so profound
that it was no longer disturbed by visions




chapter xli


at the earliest dawn don amador arose from his couch refreshed but
not reanimated by slumber an oppressive gloom lay at his heart with
the feeling of physical weight and without yet yielding to any definite
apprehension he was conscious of some presentiment or vague foreboding
of sorrow the taper had expired on the pedestal but an obscure light
the first beam of morning guided him to the bed-side of his kinsman
the form of baltasar was added to that of marco on the floor and the
serving-men slept as soundly as their master he bent a moment over don
gabriel and though unable to perceive his countenance in the gloom he
judged by the calmness of his breathing that the fever had abated
heaven grant that the delirium may have departed with it he muttered
to himself and that my poor friend may look upon me rationally once
more if we are to perish under the knives of these unwearying
barbarians as now seems to me somewhat more than possible better will
it be for my kinsman's soul that he die with the name of god on his
lips instead of those of the spirits which torment him

while the cavalier gave way to such thoughts he heard very distinctly
though at a great distance such sounds as convinced him that the
unwearying barbarians were indeed rousing again for another day of
battle he armed himself with the more haste that he heard also in the
passage the sound of feet as if the garrison had been already
summoned and were hurrying to the walls

as he passed from the apartment he found himself suddenly in the midst
of a group of cavaliers one of whom grasped his hand and pressing it
warmly whispered in his ear i will not forget that i owe thee the
life of benita come with me my friend and thou shalt see how pride
is punished with shame and injustice with humiliation

i thought said don amador that we were about to be attacked and
that my friends were running to the defence

such is the case said de morla the millions are again advancing
against the palace and we go to oppose them though not to the walls
we have raised devils and we run to him we have most wronged and most
despised to lay them in an instant you will hear the shrieks of the
combatants if we find no other way to conquer them than with our arms
wo betide us all for we are worn and feeble and we know our fate

several of the cavaliers had lights in their hands but the chamber
into which don amador followed them was lit with a multitude of
torches chiefly of the knots of resinous wood burning with a smoky
glare and scattering around a rich odour the scene disclosed to the
neophyte was imposing and singular the apartment was very spacious
and indeed lofty and filled with human beings most of them mexican
nobles of the highest rank and of both sexes who stood around their
monarch as in a solemn audience leaving a space in front which was
occupied by the most distinguished of the spaniards among whom was don
hernan himself a little platform entirely concealed under cushions of
the richest feathers supported the chair it might have been called
the throne on which sat the royal captive closely invested by those
members of his family who shared his imprisonment a king of cojohuacan
his brother stood at his back and at either side were two of his
children two sons and two daughters all young and one of them a
princess scarce budding into womanhood their attire in obedience to
the law's of the court was plain and yet richer than the garments of
the nobles but it was their position near the king the general
resemblance of their features and the anxious eyes which they kept ever
bent on the royal countenance which pointed them out as the offspring
of montezuma

as for montezuma himself though he sat on his chair like an emperor it
was more like a monarch of statuary than of flesh and blood the
christian general stood before him dictating to the interpreter marina
the expressions which he desired to enter the ear of his prisoner but
though speaking with as much respect as earnestness the indian ruler
seemed neither to hear nor to see him his eye was indeed fixed on don
hernan but yet fixed as on vacancy and the lip fallen in a ghastly
contortion the rigid features the abstracted stare the right hand
pressed upon his knee while the left lay powerless and dead over the
cushions of his chair as he bent a little forward as if wholly
unconscious of the presence of his people and his foes made it manifest
to all that his thoughts were absorbed in the contemplation of his own
abasement

the neophyte heard the words of don hernan

tell his royal majesty the king said the general with an accent no
longer resembling that which had fixed the barb in the bosom of his
prey that it mislikes me to destroy his people like so many dumb
beasts and yet to this end am i enforced by their madness and his
supineness bid him direct his subjects to lay down their arms and
assail me no further otherwise shall i be constrained to employ those
weapons which god has given me until this beauteous island is converted
into a charnel-house and hell and the broad lake of tezcuco into the
grave of his whole race

the mild and musical voice of marina repeated the wish in the language
of anahuac and all eyes were bent on the monarch as she spoke but not
a muscle moved in the frame or the visage of montezuma

is the knave turned to stone that he hears not muttered the chief
speak thou my little orteguilla repeat what thou hast heard and see
if thine antics will not arouse the sleeper

the youthful page stepped up to the king seized his hand which he
strove to raise to his lips and looking up in his face with an
innocent air endeavoured to engage his attention this boy had from
the first days of imprisonment been a favourite with montezuma and
being very arch and cunning don hernan did not scruple to place him as
a spy about the king under colour of presenting him as a servant in
common montezuma was greatly diverted with his boyish tricks and
especially with his blundering efforts to catch the tongue of mexico
but there was no longer left in the bosom of the degraded prince a
chord to vibrate to merriment habit however had not yet lost its
hold and as the boyish voice stammered out the accustomed tones he
gradually turned his eyes from the person of the general and fixed
them on the visage of orteguilla but as he gazed his brows contracted
into a gloomier frown he laid his hand on the prattler's shoulder and
no sooner had the urchin ceased speaking than he thrust him sternly
though not violently away then drawing himself erect he folded his
arms on his bosom and without uttering a word fixed his eyes on the
face of cortes and there calmly and sorrowfully maintained them

this is doubtless a lethargy said the general but it suits not
our present occasions to indulge it where is my friend de morla he
was wont to have much influence with this humorous man

i am here said de morla stepping forward and if you demand it i
will speak to the king though with no hopes of persuading him to show
us any kindness

as de morla spoke don amador who had followed him to the side of
cortes observed one of the princesses turn from her sire and look
eagerly towards his friend in this maiden he doubted not he perceived
the fair minnapotzin and he ceased to wonder at the passion of his
countryman when he discovered with his own eyes how little her beauty
had been overrated though of but small stature her figure as far as
it could be perceived through the folds of peculiar vestments was
exceedingly graceful the cymar was knotted round her bosom with a
modest girdle and left bare two arms prettily moulded on which shone
bracelets of gold fantastically wrought her hair was long and fell
braided with strings of the same metal on her shoulders on which also
was a necklace of little emeralds alternating with crystals and
suspending a silver crucifix of spanish workmanship these were her only
decorations her skin was rather dark than tawny and the tinge of
beautifying blood was as visible on her cheeks as on those of the maids
of andalusia her features were very regular and two large eyes in
which a native timidity struggled with affection at the sight of her
christian lover rendered her countenance as engaging as it was lovely
she hung upon de morla's accents with an air of the deepest interest as
he expressed in imperfect language the desires of his general

as he spoke the infidel king surveyed him with a frown a notice that
he now extended to all the christians present but without deigning to
reply it was evident that he understood the desires of his jailor and
equally plain that he had resolved to disregard them the angry spot
darkened on the brow of cortes and he was about to degrade the captive
with still more violent marks of his displeasure when at this moment
the roar of his artillery mingled with the shouts of the besiegers
suddenly shook the palace to its foundations and drowned his voice in
the shrieks of the women

montezuma started to his feet and cast a look upon cortes in which
horror did not wholly conceal a touch of ferocious satisfaction his
people were indeed falling under those terrific explosions like
leaves before the mountain gust but well he read in the dismayed
visages of the spaniards that fate was at last avenging his injuries
on the oppressors

speak thou to thy father my benita cried de morla in her own
language to the terrified princess and let him stay the work of
blood for none but he has the power tell him we desire peace repent
the wrongs we have done him and will redress them if he will regain
his liberty and his empire if he will save his people his children
and himself from one common and fearful destruction let him forget
that we have done him wrong and pronounce the words of peace

the indian maiden threw herself at the feet of the king and bathing his
hands with tears repeated the charge of the cavalier

montezuma gazed upon her with sorrow and upon his other children then
looking coldly to don hernan he said with a tranquil voice while
doña marina rapidly interpreted his expressions 

what will the teuctli have he commands a captive to shield him from
the darts of free warriors montezuma is a prisoner he calls upon me to
quiet a raging people montezuma has no people he commands me to regain
my liberty the mexican that hath been once a slave can be a freeman no
more he bids me save my children i have none they are servants in the
house of a stranger he that is in bonds hath no offspring

while he spoke the din increased as if the yelling assailants were
pressing up to the very walls of the palace and many cavaliers
incapable of remaining longer inactive and despairing of his
assistance rushed from the apartment to join in the combat

why does he waste time in words cried cortes at every moment there
are slain a thousand of his subjects

if there were twenty thousand said the captive assuming at last
the dignity that became his name and speaking with a stately anger
and if but one christian lay dead among them montezuma should not
mourn the loss happier would he be left with the few and mangled
remnants with his throne on the grave of the strangers than this
moment were he restored to his millions with the children of the east
abiding by him in friendship thou callest upon me to appease my
people thou knowest that they are thine why should they not listen to
thee

ay why should they not said don hernan speaking rather to himself
than to montezuma and flinging sarcasms on his own head by my
conscience i know not for though i was somewhat conceited to grasp at
the sceptre so early i think i may hold it with as much dignity as any
infidel were he a turkish sultan hearken montezuma thou art
deceived thy people are not mine but thine and through thee as his
sworn vassal the subjects of my master the king of spain confirm thy
vassalage to him by tribute be true to thy allegiance and remain on
thy throne for ever and if such be thy desire i will straightway
withdraw my army from the empire so that thou mayest reign according to
thine own barbarous fancies

i trust thee not said the king for already hast thou deceived me i
revoke my vows of vassalage for he that has no kingdom cannot be a
king's deputy do thy worst continued the monarch with increasing
boldness no longer regarding the furious looks of don hernan and
learning at last to deserve the respect of his foes do thy worst
thou hast degraded me with chains and with words of insult nothing
more canst thou do but kill kill me then if thou wilt and in
mictlan will i rejoice for i know that my betrayers shall follow me
yes he added with wild energy i know that at this moment your
heart is frozen with fear and your blood turned to water seeing that
revenge has reached you and that your doom is death the wronger of the
lords of tenochtitlan has learned to tremble before its basest herds
and let him tremble for the basest of them shall trample upon his
body

am i menaced by this traitor to his allegiance cried cortes

señor said de morla let us trifle the time with no more deception
there is no one of our people who does not perceive that we can
maintain our post in this city no longer and that we cannot even escape
from it without the permission of our foes this knows montezuma as
well as ourselves why incense him why strive to cajole him further
let us tell him the truth and buy safety by restoring at once what we
cannot keep and what otherwise we must yield up with our lives

ay faith it cannot be denied we are even caught in a net of our own
twisting tell the knave what thou wilt we will leave his accursed
island but how soon we may return to claim the possessions of our
master thou needst not acquaint him but by my conscience return we
will and that right briefly

a thousand different expressions agitated the visage of montezuma while
listening to the words of de morla now a flash of joy lit his dusky
features now doubt covered them with double gloom and now he frowned
with a dark resolution as if conceiving the fate of the christians if
left to themselves still caged in their bloody prison the memory of
all he had suffered mingled with the imagination of all the vengeance
he might enjoy covered his countenance with a mingled rage and
exultation while he hesitated his eye fell upon his children for all
had thrown themselves at his feet and he beheld them in fancy paying
the penalty of his ferocity the stern eye of cortes was upon him and
he thought he read in its meaning lustre the punishment which awaited
his refusal

will the teuctli depart from me he cried eagerly if i open a path
for him through my incensed people

i will depart from him replied don hernan if his people throw down
their arms and disperse

they will listen to me no more exclaimed montezuma suddenly clasping
his hands with a look and accent of despair for i am no longer their
monarch the gods of anahuac have rejected the king that has submitted
to bonds a great prophetess has risen from mictlan bearing the will of
the deities and by the bloody pool ezapan that washes the wounds of
the penitent the people have heard her words and sworn faith to a new
ruler beloved by heaven and reverenced by themselves they have seen
the degradation of montezuma and cuitlahuatzin is now the king of
mexico

he speaks of the strange priestess we saw at the temple said de
morla it is indeed said among all the mexicans but how they have
heard of her i know not that she has been sent by the gods to
dethrone our prisoner and destroy the christians

thou art deceived said cortes to the monarch without regarding this
explanation there is no king but thyself acknowledged by thy people
and at this moment they are fighting to rescue thee from what they
falsely consider bondage falsely i say for thou knowest thou art my
guest and not my prisoner free to depart whenever thou wilt that
is whenever thou wilt exert thy authority to appease the insurrection
it is their mad love for thee that reduces us to extremity

and thou swearest then cried montezuma catching eagerly at the
suggestion and the hope thou swearest that thou wilt depart from my
empire if i appease this bloody tumult

i swear that i will depart from thy city said the crafty spaniard
and i swear that i hope to depart from thy empire one day at least
when i am its master he muttered the last words to himself

give me my robes i will speak to my people

no sooner was this speech interpreted than the spaniards present
uttered exclamations of pleasure and some of them running out with the
news to their companions the court-yard soon rung with their shouts
despair at once gave place to joy and even to many of those who had
been most sick of battle the relief came with such revulsions of
feeling that they seemed loath to lose the opportunity of slaying

quick to your pieces charge and have at the yelling imps cried
divers voices for presently we shall have no more fighting




chapter xlii


the cannoniers moved by this new feeling discharged their last volley
with good will and at the same moment the crossbowmen and musketeers
shot off their pieces from the wall and the terraces the four sides of
the palace were thus at the same instant sheeted with flame and the
effect of the combined discharge was incalculably great and fatal among
the dense bodies of besiegers as they staggered and fell back a
little to recover from their confusion the mounted men who had placed
themselves in readiness for the final charge rushed at once spear in
hand on the disordered multitude dealing death at every thrust and
almost at every tramp of their chargers

it was precisely at this moment that the indian emperor arrayed in the
pompous and jewelled robes in which he was wont to preside at the
greater festivals of the gods with the copilli on his head and the
golden buskins on his feet preceded by a noble bearing the three rods
of authority and attended by half a dozen valiant cavaliers of whom
the neophyte was one holding their bucklers in readiness to protect
him from any ill-directed missile stepped upon the terrace and
advanced towards the battlements the spectacle that presented itself in
the dawning light was to him at least grievous and horrid the earth
of the square and the dwellings that surrounded it were torn by the
cannon-shots and many of the houses had tumbled into ruins from this
height also could be seen the blackened wrecks which marked the path
of the army returning the previous day from the temple but a more
sorrowful sight was presented to the unfortunate monarch in the
prospect of his people great numbers already lying dead on the furrowed
square while the survivors were falling fast under the lances of the
horsemen

don hernan enjoyed for a moment with malicious satisfaction the
exclamations of grief with which his prisoner beheld this sight for it
was his pleasure to believe that montezuma was himself the planner of
the insurrection then giving a sign to a trumpeter who was with the
party to wind a retreat the horsemen instantly reined round their
steeds and galloped back to the court-yard with a loud yell of
triumph the mexicans thinking their pursuers fled from fear prepared
to follow them and poised their weapons as a prelude to the assault at
that critical period the cavaliers moved aside from their prisoner and
he stood confronted with his people the great cry with which the
barbarians beheld their monarch had something in it that was touching
for it expressed a childish joy but there was something still more
affecting in the result to those whose hearts were not utterly steeled
when they beheld the universal multitude as with one accord fling
themselves upon their knees and dropping their weapons and pronouncing
the name of the king extend their hands towards him as to a father

is it possible then muttered or rather thought don amador de leste
smothering a sudden pang of remorse that these blood-thirsty
barbarians are only seeking our lives to liberate their king surely
we do a great sin to slay them for their love i would that my knight
my people and myself were fighting the turks again

the sudden change from the furious tumult of war to such stillness as
belongs to midnight was impressive and even awful and solemn looks
both from his subjects and his foes from those who fought in the
court-yard and those who manned the roof and the turrets were bent on
the royal captive as he stepped upon the battlement and addressed
himself to his people

my children said montezuma for so his words were rapidly interpreted
by de morla if ye are shedding your blood to convince me of your
affection know that i feel its constancy without approving its
rashness though i be a prisoner   he paused for the word stuck in
his throat and groans and lamentations showed how unpalatable it was to
his subjects though i be a prisoner with the teuctli yet have you to
know it is in a great measure with mine own consent and at this
moment i remain not by enforcement but by choice

the unhappy monarch by so expressing his address as to steer clear of
offence to the spaniards for well he knew they dreaded lest his
confessions should still more inflame the citizens committed the more
fatal error of displeasing his people a murmur of indignation ran
through the mass when montezuma with his own lips confirmed his
abasement several rose frowning to their feet and a young man
parting quickly from the crowd advanced so near to the palace that his
features could be plainly distinguished he was of noble stature
countenance and mien evidently of the highest order of nobility and
enjoyed the distinction of a principality in the house of darts as was
shown by the red fillet in his hair suspending the tufts of honour his
trunk and shoulders were invested in a coat of armour either of scales
of copper or of leather richly gilt bordered at the bottom with
lambrequins of green and red feathers his limbs were naked saving only
the bright sandals on his feet and the glittering bracelets on his
arms his left arm supported a light buckler doubtless of wicker-work
though painted with many bright and fantastic colours and from the
bottom of it waved a broad penacho as well as a bulky maquahuitl
which he held in his left hand while balancing a copper javelin in his
right a tall plume of the most splendid hues nodded majestically on his
head

as this bold and noble-looking youth stepped up to the very mouths of
the cannon and raised his fiery eyes to the king don amador de leste
thought that he recognized in him the princely ambassador of
cholula the young fugitive who had been so ready to dispute the path
with him under the walls of the holy city

dost thou say this thou that wert once their lord to the people of
mexitli said the young prince for as has been recorded by other
historians it was the valiant quauhtimotzin the nephew of the king
who now so sharply rebuked him dost thou indeed confess son of
axajacatl that thou art by thine own consent the friend of a
perfidious stranger by thine own choice o conqueror of many nations
the serf and slave of him who is the brother of tlascala then art thou
indeed what we have called thee the slayer of thy people for this
blood has flown at thy bidding a traitor to thy throne for thou hast
surrendered it to a master an apostate to thy gods for thou hast shut
thine ears when they called upon thee for vengeance miserable
king and yet a king no more when thy people wept to see thee
degraded thou gavest them up to slaughter and while they come to
restore thee to thy rights thou confessest that thou lovest these less
than the shame of captivity know then that for thy baseness the gods
have pronounced thee unworthy to be their viceroy and thy people have
confirmed the decree we break the rods of authority we trample upon
the robes of state and montezuma is no longer a king in tenochtitlan

the unhappy monarch trembled while he listened to this insulting
denunciation for he felt that he had deserved it but his people still
lay prostrate on the earth and hoping that they shared not the
indignation of his kinsman he elevated his voice again and spoke
sternly 

why doth quauhtimotzin forget that he is the son of my brother and my
slave is the young man that smiles in jewels wiser than he that hath
gray hairs and the people that delve in canals and build up the
temples have they more cunning than the king who councils with the
spirits at the altar know that what has been done has been done
wisely for it was according to the will of heaven and heaven which
has tried our fidelity is about to reward it with happiness and peace
the strangers have promised to depart from us throw down your arms and
let them be gone

and wilt thou said the prince elevating his voice to a still angrier
pitch who hast been so many times deluded counsel us to listen to
their lies o fallen montezuma thou leaguest with them against us wilt
thou suffer them to escape when we have them enclosed in nets as the
birds that sing in thy gardens o degraded chief thou hast not the
courage to desire the blood of them that have dethroned thee thou art
not he that was montezuma thy words are the words of a christian thou
speakest with the lips of a slave and the heart of a woman thou art a
spaniard and thy fate shall be the fate of a spaniard cuitlahuatzin is
our king and we strike thee as a foeman

as the prince concluded his indignant oration he swung round his head
the javelin which all this time he had balanced in his hand and
launched it with all his force full at the breast of montezuma the
shield of the novice quickly interposed before the body of the king
arrested the sharp weapon and it fell innocuous on the terrace at
the same moment the mexicans all sprang to their feet with loud cries
as if giving way to repressed fury and brandished their arms the
bucklers of the cavaliers were instantly extended before the monarch to
protect him from the dreaded missiles but as if desperation had robbed
him of his fears and restored to him for his last hour some share of
that native spirit which had elevated him to the throne he pushed them
immediately aside and raising himself to his full height and spreading
forth his arms gazed majestically though with a ghastly countenance
on his people the words of mingled intreaty and command were already on
his lips but they were lost even to the spaniards who stood by in the
thunder of shouts coming from twenty thousand voices and the warning
cry of cortes was equally unheard bidding the spaniards to save the
king the shields were interposed however without command and caught
many of the missiles stones arrows and darts which fell like a
shower on the group but not all an arrow pierced the right arm a
stone maimed the right leg and another striking upon the left temple
of the abandoned monarch crushed the bone in upon the brain and he
fell into the arms of the cavaliers like a dead man

the cannoniers at that moment seeing the returning rage of the
barbarians shot off their pieces but the battle was done no sooner
had the mexicans beheld their monarch fall under the blows of their own
weapons than they changed their cries of fury to lamentations and
throwing down their arms as if seized with a panic they fled from the
square leaving it to the christians and the dead




chapter xliii


in great grief and consternation of mind the cavaliers carried the king
to his apartments and added their own sharp regrets to the tears of his
children when the surgeon pronounced his wounds mortal even the señor
cortes did not disdain to heave a sigh over the mangled form of his
prisoner for in his death he perceived his innocence and remembered
his benefactions and in addition he felt that in the loss of
montezuma he was deprived of the strongest bulwark against the
animosity of his people

i have done this poor infidel king a great wrong he said with a
remorse that might have been real and yet perhaps was assumed to
effect a purpose on his followers for now indeed it is plain he
could not have been unfaithful to us or he would not thus have
perished i call god to witness that i had no hand in his death and i
aver to yourselves noble cavaliers that when i have seemed to treat
him with harshness and injustice i have done so for the good of my
companions and the advantage of our king for barbarians being in
some sort children are to be governed by that severity which is
wholesome to infancy nevertheless i do not wholly despair of his life
for there are some score or two lusty fellows in the garrison who have
had their skulls cracked and are none the worse for the affliction i
trust much in thy skill señor boticario he continued addressing
the surgeon and i promise thee if thou restore montezuma to his life
and wits i will on mine own part bestow upon thee this golden chain
and crucifix valued at ninety pesos besides recommending thee
likewise to the gratitude of my brother captains and the favourable
notice of his majesty our king whom god preserve ever from the wrath
and impiety of such traitorous subjects as have laid our montezuma low
i leave him in thy charge as for ourselves valiant and true friends
it being now apparent to you that we have none but ourselves to look to
for safety and even food the want of which latter would doubtless
create many loud murmurs were it not for the jeopardy of the former i
must recommend you to betake you to your horses and accompany me in a
sally which it is needful now to make both for the sake of
reconnoitring the dikes and gathering food what now botello he
cried observing the enchanter pressing through the throng what doest
thou here thou never madest me a prophecy of this great mishap

i never cast the horoscope nor called upon kalidon-sadabath to
discover the fate of any but a christian man said botello gravely
for what matters it what is the fate of a soul predoomed to flames
whether it part with violence or in peace i have sought out the
destiny of his people because i thought some day they should be
baptised in the faith but i never cast me a spell for the king

wilt thou adventure thine art in his behalf and tell me whether he
shall now live or die

it needs no conjuration to discover that said the magician pointing
significantly to the broken temple the king will die and that before
we are released from our thraldom but hearken señor he continued
solemnly i have sought out the fate that concerns us more nearly last
night while others buried their weariness in sleep and their sorrows
in the dreams of home i watched in solitude with prayers and fasting
working many secret and godly spells and conversing with the spirits
that came to the circle  

the wounded monarch was forgotten for an instant by the cavaliers in
their eagerness to gather the revelations of the conjurer for
scepticism like pride was yielding before the increasing difficulties
of their situation and they grasped at hope and encouragement coming
from what quarter soever

and what have the spirits told thee then demanded the general
meaningly doubtless that although there be a cloud about us now
there shall sunshine soon burst from it and that if we depart from
this city it will only be like the antique battering ram pulled back
from a wall that it may presently return against it with tenfold
violence

i have not questioned so far replied botello earnestly i know that
we must fly what is to come after is in the hands of god and has not
been revealed death lies in store for many but safety for some the
celestial aspects are unfavourable the conjunctions speak of suffering
and blood dreams are dark kalidon is moody and the fiends prattle in
riddles day after day the gloom shall be thicker the frowns of fate
more menacing retreat more hopeless never before found i so many black
days clustered over the earth in all this period there is but one
shining hour and if we seize not that heaven receive us for beyond
that there is nothing but death on the fifth day from this at
midnight a path will be opened to us on the causeway for then from
the house alpharg doth the moon break the walls of prisons and light
fugitives to the desert but after that i say to thee again very noble
señor all is hopelessness all is wo starvation in the palace and
shrieking sacrifices on the temple

on the fifth night then said cortes gravely if the fates so will
it we must take our departure provided we die not of famine on the
fourth i would the devils that thou hast in command had revealed thee
some earlier hour or some good means of coming at meat and drink get
thee to thy horoscopes again thy prayers and thy suffumigations and
see if thou hast not by any mischance overlooked some favourable
moment for to-morrow or the day after

it cannot be said botello my art has disclosed me no hope but
without art i can see that to-morrow the news of montezuma's death
for surely he is now dying will fill the causeways with mountaineers
and cover the lake with navigators all coming to avenge it

i like thy magic better than thy mother wit said don hernan with a
frown give me what diabolical comfort thou canst to the soldiers but
croak no common-sense alarms into their ears

i have nothing to do with the magic that is diabolic said the
offended enchanter god is my stay and the fiends i curse if i have
fears i speak them not save to those who may handle them for wise
purposes this which i have said will surely be the fate of to-morrow
and the besiegers will come in double numbers to the walls what i
have to speak of to-day may be of as much moment though revealed to me
neither by star nor spirit the mexicans are struck with horror having
slain their king they hide them in their houses or they run mourning
to the temples the soldiers are fresh and the streets are empty what
hinders that we do not gird on our packs and aiming for the near and
short dike of tacuba which i so lately traversed with the king's
daughters make good our retreat this moment

by santiago cried cortes quickly this is a soldier's thought and
honoured shalt thou be for conceiving it what ho sandoval my friend
get the troops in readiness prepare thy litters for the sick and
wounded have all ready at a moment's warning in the meanwhile i will
scour the western streets and if all promise well will return to
conduct the retreat in person

we can carry with us said botello the wounded king and his sons
and daughters and if it chance we should be followed we will do as the
tiger-hunter does with the cubs when the dam pursues him fling a
prisoner ever and anon on the path to check the fury of our
persecutors the king will be better than a purse of gold

ay now thou art my sage soldier again said the general get thee to
the men and comfort them apothecary look to the emperor see that he
have the best litter forget not thy drugs and potions and now
christian cavaliers and brothers be of good heart let us mount
horse and look at the dike of tacuba

the officers greatly encouraged at the prospect of so speedy a release
from their sufferings followed the general from the apartment their
elation was not shared by don amador de leste he rejoiced for his
kinsman's sake that he was about to bear him from the din and privation
of a besieged citadel but he remembered that the moorish boy must be
left behind to perish and it seemed to him in addition that certain
mystic ties the result of a day's adventure which began to bind his
thoughts to the pagan city were by the retreat to be severed at once
and for ever

but if his gloom was increased by such reflections it was in part
dispelled when he reached the chamber of his kinsman the delirium had
vanished and the knight sat on his couch feeble indeed and greatly
dejected but quite in his senses he turned an eye of affection on the
youth and with his trembling hand grasped don amador's

i have been as one that slept dreaming my dreams he said while
thou hast been fighting the infidel strange visions have beset me but
thanks be to heaven they have passed away and by-and-by i will be
able to mount and go forth with thee and we will fight side by side
as we have done before among the mussulmans

think not of that my father said the novice for thou art very
feeble i would indeed thou hadst but the strength this day to sit
on the saddle for we are about to retreat from tenochtitlan
nevertheless baltasar shall have thy couch placed on a litter which we
can secure between two horses

speakest thou of retreating exclaimed don gabriel

it is even so my friend the numbers the fury and the unabating
exertions of the mexicans are greater than we looked for we have lost
many men are reduced to great extremities for food altogether
dispirited and now left so helpless by the disaster of the king that
we have no hope but in flight

is the king hurt and by a spaniard

wounded by the stones and arrows of his own people and now dying and
it is thought we can depart to best advantage while the mexicans are
repenting the impiety that slew him

and we must retreat

if we can a matter which we who are mounted are about to determine
by riding to the nearest causeway this dear father will give marco
and baltasar time to prepare thee i will leave lazaro and the secretary
to assist them presently we will return and when we march be it
unopposed or yet through files of the enemy i swear to thee i will
ride ever at thy side

and my boy my loving little page jacinto exclaimed the knight
anxiously hath he returned to us i have a recollection that he was
stolen away twill be a new sin to me if he come to harm through my
neglect

let us think no more of jacinto said the novice with a sigh if he
be living he is now in the hands of abdalla his father who has
deserted from us and is supposed to be harboured by the mexicans god
is over all we can do him no good god will protect him

don gabriel eyed his kinsman sorrowfully saying

evil follows in my path and overtakes those who follow after me every
day open i mine eyes upon a new grief i loved this child very well
and for my punishment he is taken from me i love thee also amador
whom i may call my son for faithful and unwearying art thou and
belike the last blow will fall when thou art snatched away guard
well thy life for it is the last pillar of my own

a few moments of affection a few words of condolence were bestowed
upon don gabriel and then the novice left him to accompany the
cavaliers to the causeway

as he was stepping from the palace door into the court-yard his arm was
caught by the magician who looking into his face with exceeding great
solemnity said 

ride not thou with the cavaliers to-day noble gentleman thou art
unlucky

a faint smile lit the countenance of the youth it was soon followed by
a sigh

this is indeed a truth which no magic could make more manifest than
has the history of much of my life i am unfortunate yet not in affairs
of war being now as you see almost the only man in this garrison
who is not in part disabled by severe wounds yet why should i not
ride with my friends

because thou wilt bring them trouble and thyself misery i cannot
say señor added botello with grave earnestness that thou didst
absolutely save my life when thou broughtest me succour in the street
seeing that this is under the influence of a destiny well known to me
which man cannot alter it was not possible those savages could slay
me nevertheless my gratitude is as strong for thy good will was as
great i promised to read thee thy fortune but in the troubles which
beset me i could not perfect thy horoscope all i have learned is that
a heavy storm hangs over thee and that if thou art not discreet thy
last hour is nigh and will be miserable the very night of thy good and
noble service i dreamed that we were surrounded by all the assembled
mexicans making with them a contract of peace to which they were about
swearing when they laid their eyes upon thee and straightway were
incensed at the sight as at the call of a trumpet to attack us thou
knowest that it was thy rash attack on the accursed prophetess which
brought the knaves upon us thrice was this vision repeated to me twice
has it been confirmed once at the temple and but a moment since on
the roof hadst thou not stood before the king with thy shield the
rage of the mexicans would not have destroyed him therefore go not
out now for he that brings mischief twice to his friends will the
third time be involved in their ruin

the neophyte stared at botello who pronounced these fantastic
adjurations with the most solemn emphasis his heart was heavy or their
folly would have amused him

be not alarmed botello he said good-humouredly i will be very
discreet my conscience absolves me of all agency in the king's hurts
and if i did indeed draw on the attack at the pyramid as i am by no
means certain i only put match to the cannon which otherwise might
have been aimed at us more fatally i promise thee to be rash no
more no not even though i should again behold the marvellous
prophetess who as montezuma told us has risen from his pagan hell

the enchanter would have remonstrated further but at this moment the
trumpet gave signal that the cavaliers were departing and don amador
stayed neither to argue nor console he commanded the secretary whom
he found among the throng to return to don gabriel and lorenzo
reluctantly obeyed lazaro was already with the knight

thus without personal attendants don amador mounted this day among
the cavaliers prepared to disprove the enchanter's predictions or to
consummate his destiny




chapter xliv


the sufferings of the spaniards in the streets when returning from the
pyramid had admonished the general of the necessity of devising some
plan of protection against those citizens who fought from the
house-tops whenever constrained to attempt a second sortie
accordingly the artisans in obedience to his commands had spent the
preceding night in the construction of certain wooden turrets
sufficiently lofty to overlook the commoner houses and strong enough to
bid defiance to the darts of the enemy they were framed of timbers and
planks torn from different parts of the palace each was two stories in
height and in addition was furnished with a guard or battlement over
the roof breast-high behind which some half a score musketeers might
ensconce themselves to advantage while nearly as many crossbowmen could
be concealed in either chamber discharging their weapons from narrow
loop-holes a little falconet was also placed in the upper chamber they
were mounted on gun-carriages and meant to be drawn by the indian
allies they were called at first mantas or blankets but afterwards
were nicknamed burros either because they were such silly
protections as might have been devised by the most stupid of animals
which is one signification of the word or because the cannon-wheels
revolving under the mass reminded the soldiers of the great wheel of a
mill which is another meaning one of these machines had been
completed and was now ordered to be taken out not from any
apprehension that it might be needed but because it appeared to the
sagacious general that if fate should imprison him longer in
tenochtitlan the present was the best opportunity to instruct his
soldiers in the management of it

it was already lumbering slowly and clumsily over the broken square
drawn by some two hundred tlascalans and well manned with soldiers
when don amador passed from the gates as the cavaliers rode by its
little garrison vastly delighted with their safe and lazy quarters
greeted them with a merry cheer the gayest and most sonorous strain of
which was sounded by those who defended the roof as don amador looked
curiously up he was hailed by a voice not yet forgotten and beheld
perched among others whom he seemed to command on the very top of the
manta the master of the caravel

i give you a good day noble don amador said this commander with a
grin i am not now aboard of such a bark as the little sangre de
cristo but for navigating through a beleagured city especially among
such cut-throats as we have here in tenochtitlan perhaps a better ship
could not be invented

thou art then resolved said the cavalier with a smile that this
people is not far behind the race of florida

ay i cannot but believe it and i ask their pardon for having so
greatly belied them said the captain for more ferocious devils than
these never saw i they dwell not among the lagoons of the north

and dost thou remember thy wager said don amador losing the little
gayety that was on his visage at the recollection

concerning my soul which heaven have in keeping and the cotton
neck-piece cried the sailor with a grim look ay by my faith i
do if we fly this day the first part of the venture is accomplished
for true valour must acknowledge a defeat as well as boast a victory
and if we do not i am even ready to wager over again for the second
touching heaven three more such days as yesterday and god bless us
all but it is a good death to die fighting the heathen at the worst
i have cheated the devil for the padre olmedo absolved me this
morning

don amador rode forward relapsing into gloom

the streets were for a time deserted and silent as if the inhabitants
had fled from the island and when now and then the cavaliers halted
to deliberate on their course to list for the cries of human voices or
to watch the progress of the tottering manta already far behind the
sound of shrubs rustling together on the terraces came to their ears
with the melancholy cadences of a desert sometimes indeed in these
pauses they heard from the recesses of a dwelling which otherwise
seemed forsaken faint groans as of a wounded foeman dying without
succour and occasionally to these were added the low sobs of women
lamenting a sire or brother but they had approached the limits of the
island and almost within view of the causeway without yet beholding an
enemy when a warning gesture from the hands of don hernan at the
front brought them to a halt and as they stood in silence they
heard coming faintly on the breeze and as it seemed from a street
which crossed their path a little in advance such sounds of flutes and
tabours as had the day before conducted the mysterious priestess to
the pyramid

don amador's heart beat with a strange agitation as he listened and he
burned again to look on the countenance of this divine representative of
a pagan divinity whether it was the dejection of his spirits which gave
its own character to the music or whether indeed this was now breathed
from the lips of mourners he thought not to inquire but others were
struck with the wild sadness of the strain and gazed inquisitively
upon one another as if to gather its meaning while they thus exchanged
looks and awaited the issue of the event the sounds approached
growing louder but losing none of their melancholy and a train of
priests in long black robes and with downcast eyes followed by boys
with smoking censers at last stole on their view slowly crossing the
street on which they had halted at this moment and just as the
prophetess for it was she who stood as before under the feathered
canopy carried by the devotees came into sight the roar of a cannon
bellowing afar from the palace startled the cavaliers from their
tranquillity and in the assurance of new conflicts destroyed at
once their hope of peaceful escape this explosion as was afterwards
discovered was rather the cause than the consequence of hostilities
for the mexicans after the sortie of cortes approaching the citadel in
great numbers to beseech the body of their king not doubting that he
was slain the spaniards had mistaken their grief for renewing rage and
immediately fired upon them

a furious scowl darkened the visage of don hernan as this distant
discharge swept away his hopes and rising on his stirrups he cried to
his companions

let us seize the person of this accursed priestess demon or
woman who profanes the holiness of our lady and incenses the hearts
of the rabble on and be quick for tis an easy prize and may replace
the emperor

until this moment the train casting their eyes neither to the right
nor left and raising them not even at the roar of the cannon had been
ignorant of the presence of the spaniards but when the harsh voice of
the christian drowned the breathings of the flutes they paused looking
towards him in affright and again for an instant the lustrous eyes of
the prophetess fell upon the visage of don amador his heart heaved with
a sickening sensation and the impulse which had before driven to flight
his better judgment assailed him anew with violence his voice shouted
with the rest but it uttered the name of leila and as if indeed he
beheld the lost maid of almeria or her phantom he spurred towards the
prophetess full as madly as when she vanished before under the wall of
serpents but the train scattering at once fled in horror from the
spaniards escaping into the neighbouring houses the object of the
outrage nevertheless seemed in the power of the cavaliers for though
the bearers deserted her not they fled but slowly under their burden

but there were protectors nigh of whom the spaniards had not dreamed
and even cortes himself reined back his horse with dismay when
suddenly there sprang from the intersecting street a multitude of armed
nobles interposing their bodies between him and his victim and his
eye running an instant down the street beheld them followed by a
myriad of pagans without end

back to the manta cried the general hastily for these dogs are
armed and the men of the turret have no aid hark hear ye not the
howls rein round and back they are slaying my tlascalans

before the neophyte could recover from his confusion of mind he found
himself turned round and borne along with the mass of galloping
horsemen the mexicans uttered a cry as with one impulse and followed
furiously after

in the crowd of thought that distracted him don amador remembered the
words of botello and believed that he was indeed labouring under some
enchantment which made him a misfortune to his friends but not long
had he leisure for such meditations the loud yells of combatants and
the sounds of arquebuses in front increased at each step and quickly
turning an angle in the street he found himself in the midst of
conflict

an immense herd of men had surrounded the manta and were engaged hand
to hand with the tlascalans who drew it while the spaniards on its top
defended themselves at a disadvantage from many mexicans stationed on
the terrace of a lofty house the dwelling of some superb tlatoani so
near indeed was the turret to the walls of this edifice and so high
above it was the latter that the huge stones tumbled from the
battlements fell with great certainty on its roof crushing the men of
the caravel and beating down both the wooden parapet and the platform
at the same time certain savages with long poles struck at the
defenders and thrusting the points of their weapons into its breaches
endeavoured to topple it to the ground as it rocked thus to and fro
the violent motion entirely prevented the little garrison from making
use of their arms and with wild cries to their friends to seize the
ropes dropped by the tlascalans and drag the manta from the palace
they were seen holding by its sides as well as they could receiving
without returning the blows of their adversaries the necessity of
obeying their prayer was seen more plainly than the means for the crowd
of mingled tlascalans and mexicans that surrounded the crazy machine
was impenetrable and had it been so the appearance of the manta
threatening each moment to fall would have deterred the boldest from
approaching its dangerous vicinity

as it was the cavaliers gave what aid they could they thrust their
spears into the mass of indians shouting to the tlascalans to disengage
themselves from the enemy but these shouts if the allies did not
indeed receive them rather as encouragement to fight the more fiercely
dissolved not the bloody melée into its components of friend and foe
and many a tlascalan died that day pierced through the heart by
spears which their bearers thought were thrust through the breasts of
mexicans

in the meanwhile the heavy burro was shaken still more violently and
don amador looking up beheld the master of the caravel alone on the
top for his sailors were already slain grasping despairingly at a
fragment of the parapet while stones and darts were showered upon him
from the adjoining terrace and a heavy pole aimed by a lusty
barbarian struck him with merciless severity his countenance was pale
his eye haggard and his honourable scars now livid and almost black
were relieved like fresh wounds on his ghastly brow his helmet had
fallen to the ground and the sight of his gray hairs shaking over his
scarred front as he was tossed up and down like one bound hand and
foot on the back of a wild animal inflamed the neophyte with both rage
and pity

loose thy hold drop upon the indians and take thy chance among them
he cried at the top of his voice what ho friend gomez wilt thou lie
there and perish

it seemed as if the voice of the cavalier had not passed unheard for
the wretched man was seen to raise himself on his knees and look down
to the fighting men below as if meditating a leap when suddenly a
great stone fell on the platform with a crashing noise and at the same
moment the manta lurching like an ill-ballasted ship before a
hurricane staggered over its balance and fell with a tremendous shock
to the ground the neophyte thought not of the miserable combatants
crushed in its fall he beheld the voyager at the instant of its
destruction hurled from the ruin as if from some mighty balista of
ancient days clear over the heads of the indians and dashed a mangled
and hideous corse almost at his feet

god pity thee he cried with a shudder thy words are made good thy
wager is won and the saints that died for the faith take thee to
paradise

do ye hear ho to your lances and back upon the wolves that are
behind us cried the trumpet-voice of don hernan the neophyte turned
and clapping spurs to fogoso charged with the cavaliers upon those
squadrons which had pursued them but like his companions he checked
his horse with surprise and no little consternation when he beheld in
what manner the infidels were prepared to receive them the street was
packed with their bodies as far as the eye could see and darts and
swords of obsidian were seen flashing above the heads of the most
distant multitude but he perceived that those combatants who stood in
front stretching from wall to wall were armed with long spears
mostly indeed with wooden points sharpened and fire-hardened though
some few were seen with copper blades full a yard in length which they
handled with singular and menacing address thus no sooner did the
cavaliers approach them than those of the first rank dropping like
trained soldiers to their knees planted the buts of their weapons on
the ground while those held by others behind were thrust over the
shoulders of the kneelers and presented together such a wall of
bristling spines as caused the bravest to hesitate

have we ottomies of the hills here cried don hernan aghast or are
these weapons and this mode of using them the teaching of the traitor
moor

a loud shout mingled with laughs of fierce derision testified the
triumph of the barbarians and cortes stung with fury though
hesitating to attack called for his musketeers to break the line of
opponents

our musketeers are in heaven carried up in the fiend of a burro
cried alvarado waving his sword and eyeing the vaunting herd before
the days of saltpetre true men were wont to shoot their foes without
it all that is to be done is to conceive we are hunting foxes and
leaping over a farmer's wall soho saladin mouse and all that are
brave gentlemen follow me hah

as he concluded the madcap soldier spurred his steed saladin and
uttering a war-cry dashed fearlessly on the spearmen before he had yet
parted from his companions don amador de leste fired in spite of his
melancholy by the boldness of the exploit and unwilling to be outdone
by a cavalier of the islands brushed up to his side and spurring
fogoso at the same moment the two hidalgos straightway vaulted among
the barbarians

the show of resolution maintained by the exulting spearmen while the
christians stood yet at a distance vanished when they beheld those
animals which they always regarded with a superstitious awe rushing
upon them with eyes of fury and feet of thunder to this faltering
perhaps it was owing that the two dons were not instantly slain for
though the heavy armour that guarded the chests and loins of the steeds
could repel the thrust of a wooden spear as well as the corslets of
their riders no such protection sheathed their bellies and had they
been there pierced their masters must instantly have perished as it
was however the front rank recoiled and when it closed again the
cavaliers were seen wielding their swords for in such a melée their
spears were useless and striking valiantly about them but entirely
surrounded

shall we be thus shamed my masters cried don hernan
sharply methinks there are two more such cavaliers in this
company santiago and at them

thus saying and with a word inflaming their pride he leaped against
the foe followed by all the horsemen

the two leaders in this desperate assault had vanished swallowed up
as it were in the vortex of contention and it was not until his
friends heard the voice of alvarado exclaiming wildly as if in
extremity help me de leste true friend for i am unhorsed help me
or the hell-hounds will have me to the temple that they were
convinced the young men were living

be of good heart cried don amador for he was at his side drawing
his sabre with a dexterous sleight over the sinewy arms that clutched
his companion and releasing without doing him harm if thou art
disarmed draw my dagger from the sheath and use it and fear not that i
will leave thee till rescued by others

who gets my sword takes the arm along with it cried alvarado
grasping again his chained weapon and dealing fierce blows as he
spoke i will remember the act ho false friends forsworn soldiers
condemned christians why leave ye us unsupported

courage and strike well we are near answered don hernan press on
friends trample the curs to death join we our true cavaliers and then
sweep back for victory

where goest thou now mad amador they heard the voice of alvarado
exclaiming return thy horse is shoed with piraguas but mine sticks
fast in this bog of flesh return for by heaven i can follow thee no
further

come on as thou art a true man for i am sore beset and wounded
these words from the lips of the neophyte came yet through the din of
yells but it seemed to those who listened that there was feebleness in
the voice that uttered them

onward cried cortes with a voice of thunder and urging his dun
steed furiously over the trampled barbarians the young man shall not
perish

a wolf-hound weary and spent with the chase suddenly surrounded by a
whole pack of the destroyers he has been tracking and falling under the
fangs of his quarry may figure the condition of don amador de leste
surrounded and seized upon by the enemy nothing but the vigour of
powerful and fiery-spirited steeds could have carried the two cavaliers
so far into a crowd of warriors almost compacted while the neophyte
gave assistance to his friend a dozen blows of the maquahuitl were
rained upon his body and so closely was he invested immediately after
when as alvarado reined in his steed to await the rest the two
cavaliers were separated that he thought no longer of warding off
blows but giving himself up to smiting he trusted to the strength of
his mail for protection but the heavy bludgeons bruised where they
could not wound and his armour being at last broken by the fury of
the blows the sharp glass penetrated to his flesh and he began to
bleed he cast his eye over his shoulder for his strength was failing
but the plume of don pedro waved at a distance behind and the shouts of
cortes seemed to come from afar he turned his horse's head to retreat
but half a dozen savages emboldened by this symptom of defeat clutched
upon the bridle and the hand he raised to smite at them was seized by
as many others it was at this moment that he called out to his
companion in the words we have recorded but the answer if answer were
made was drowned in the savage yells of exultation with which his foes
beheld him in their power he collected all his energies struggled
violently and striking the rowels deep and animating fogoso with his
voice hoped by one bound to spring clear of his capturers the
gallant steed vaulted on high but fell again to the earth under the
weight of the many that clung to him and a dozen new hands were added
to those that already throttled the rider

rescue me if ye be men he cried with a voice that prevailed over
the uproar the cry was echoed by twenty christian voices hard by and
a gleam of hope entered into his heart another furious struggle
another plunge of fogoso and he thought that the hands of his enemies
were at last unclenching a bright weapon flashed before his eyes it
was steel and therefore the falchion of a friend it fell upon his
helmet with irresistible weight his brain spun his eyes darkened and
he fell or rather was dragged like a dead man from his horse but ere
his eyes had yet closed their last glance was fixed on the visage of
the striker and the sting of benefits forgotten was added to the
bitterness of death when in this he perceived the features of
abdalla the moor

in an instant more the barbarians parted in terror before the great
teuctli

where art thou de leste he cried we are here to rescue thee

as he spoke there sprang with a fierce bound from among the mexicans
the well-known bay fogoso his foamy sides streaked with gore the
stirrups rattling against his armed flanks the reins flying in the
air but no rider on the saddle

by heaven false friends craven gentlemen you have lost the bravest
of your supporters cried don hernan on for he may yet live on for
we will avenge him

the band resolute now in their wrath plunged fiercely through the mob
they struck down many enemies they trampled upon many corses but
among them they found not the body of de leste




chapter xlv


whether it was that this attack was caused by an ebullition of popular
fury which yielded to some mysterious and religious revulsion of
feeling or whether indeed the leaders of the barbarians persuaded of
the madness of fighting the christians hand to hand and resolved to
conquer them rather by famine than arms had called off their
forces was a secret the spaniards could never penetrate no sacred
horn was sounded on the pyramid but in the very midst of what seemed
their triumph when the cavaliers were nearly exhausted and despairing
it became manifest that the mexicans were giving way and vanishing not
one by one but in great clusters from the field

the christians had no longer the spirit to pursue they found the street
open and dashing through the few foemen that lingered on the field
they made their way good to the palace before they reached it they
were joined by a powerful detachment sent out to their assistance they
returned together at the gate of the court-yard stood baltasar
lazaro and the secretary looking eagerly for the appearance of don
amador his horse was led by a cavalier whose countenance was more
dejected than the rest it was de morla and as he flung the bridle to
lazaro he said 

hadst thou been with thy master this thing had not happened for
though a serving-man thou wouldst have remained behind him when a
cavalier deserted

dost thou accuse me of deserting the noble youth said alvarado
fiercely god forbid i should shed christian blood but with my
sword's point i will prove upon thy body that thou liest

and upon thine said de morla with calm indignation i will make
good the charge i have uttered that thou didst abandon in extremity
when he called upon thee for aid the man who had just preserved thine
own life

are there not deaths enow among the infidels cried cortes angrily
that ye must lust after one another's blood peace and be ye friends
lamenting our valiant companion together for de morla thou doest a
wrong to alvarado and don pedro thou art a fool to quarrel with the
peevishness of a mourning friend

the secretary listened to the cavaliers with a face of horror not a
word said lazaro but as he wiped the foam from the steed and with it
the blood of his master he eyed don pedro with a dark and vindictive
scowl as for baltasar his rugged features quivered and he did not
hesitate to stand in the way of the tonatiuh saying 

if any cavalier have indeed been false to my young lord i who am
but a serving-man will make bold to say he has played false to a
gentleman who would have perilled his life for any christian in need
and the act though it be answered to man god will not forgive who
will tell this to my master don gabriel

alvarado extremely enraged had raised his spear to strike the old
soldier but he dropped his arm at the last words and said with great
mildness 

thou art a fool to say this i lament thy lord i loved him and i did
not desert him  

for the remainder of that day the garrison were left in peace no foes
appeared on the square but twice or thrice when parties were sent out
to reconnoitre they were met at a distance from the palace by herds
of mexicans and driven back to their quarters

the desperate situation of the army was now evident to the dullest
comprehension the barbarians had removed from the reach of the
artillery and drawn with their bodies a line of circumvallation round
their victims patiently waiting for the moment when famine should
bring them a secure vengeance all day there were seen on the top of
the pyramid priests and nobles now engaged in some rite of devotion
and now looking down on the besieged like vultures on their prey but
without attempting any annoyance

the murmurs of the garrison exasperated by despair and want of food
were loud and stern but don hernan received them only with biting
sarcasms he bade those who were most mutinous to depart if they would
and laughed scornfully at their confessions of inability to those who
cried for food he answered by pointing grimly to the stone walls and
the carcasses that lay on the square or he counselled them to seek it
among their foes in truth the general knew their helplessness and in
the bitterness of his heart at being thus foiled and jeoparded he did
not scruple to punish their discontent by disclosing the full misery of
their situation they were dependent upon him for life and hope and he
suffered this dependence to be made apparent he revealed to them no
scheme of relief or escape for in fact he had framed none he was
himself as desperate as the rest seeing nothing before him but
destruction and not knowing how to avoid it and what measures he did
take during these sorrowful hours were rather expedients to divert his
thoughts than plans to diminish the general distress

notwithstanding the memorable fate of the burro and the disinclination
of the soldiers to die the death of its garrison he obstinately
commanded those which were unfinished to be completed with some
additional contrivances to increase their strength and mobility he sent
out parties to ransack the deserted houses in the vicinity for
provisions though hopeless of obtaining any and he set the idlers to
mending their armour of escaupil and the smiths to making arrow-heads
as if still determined rather to fight than fly he held no councils
with his officers for he knew they had no projects to advise and the
desperate resort over which he pondered of sallying out with his whole
force and cutting his way through the opposing foe was too full of
horror to be yet spoken moreover while montezuma yet lived he could
not think his situation entirely hopeless the surgeon upon a
re-examination of the king's wounds had formed a more favourable
prognostic and this was strengthened when montezuma at last awoke from
stupor and recovered the possession of his intellects it was told him
indeed that the royal indian as if resuming his wits only to cast them
away again had no sooner become sensible of his condition and
remembered that his wounds had been inflicted by his people than he
fell into a frenzy of grief and despair tearing away the bandages from
his body and calling upon his gods to receive him into tlacopan the
place of caverns and rivers where wandered those who died the death of
the miserable don hernan imagined that these transports would soon rave
themselves away and persuaded himself that his captive yielding at
last to the natural love of life would yet remain in his hands the
hostage of safety and perhaps the instrument of authority

sorrow dwelt in the palace of axajacatl but her presence was more
deeply acknowledged in the chamber of calavar from the lips of
baltasar and the rude veteran wept when he narrated the fall of the
young cavalier whom he had himself first taught the knowledge of
arms don gabriel learned the fate of his kinsman but he neither wept
like baltasar nor joined in the loud lamentations of marco his eyes
dilated with a wild expression his lip fell he drooped his head on his
breast and clasping his hands over his heart muttered an
unintelligible prayer perhaps the ejaculation which so often and so
piteously expressed his desolation then falling down upon his couch
and turning his face to the wall he remained for the whole day and
night without speaking a word




chapter xlvi


the fate of don amador de leste though so darkly written in the hearts
of his companions was not yet brought to a close some of his late
friends deemed only that he had been overpowered and slain but others
better acquainted with the customs of the foe shuddered over the
assurance of a death yet more awful they knew that the pride of the
mexican warrior was not to slay but to capture as if indeed these
demi-barbarians made war less for the glory of taking life than for the
honour of offering it in sacrifice to the gods such in truth was the
case and to this circumstance was it owing that the christians were not
utterly destroyed in any one encounter in the streets of tenochtitlan
the fury of their foes was such as may be imagined in a people goaded to
desperation by atrocious tyranny and insult and fighting with foreign
oppressors at their very firesides yet notwithstanding the deadly
feeling of vengeance at their hearts they never forgot their duties to
their faith and they forbore to kill in the effort to take prisoner
twice or thrice at least in the course of the war that followed after
these events the life of cortes himself was in their hands and the
thrust of a javelin or the stroke of a bludgeon would have freed them
from the destroyer but they neither struck nor thrust they strove to
bear him off alive as the most acceptable offering they could carry to
the temple thus always giving his followers an opportunity to rescue
him out of their grasp every captive thus seized and retained died a
death too terrible for description and high or low the base boor and
the noble hidalgo alike expiated on the stone of sacrifice the
wrongs done to the religion of mexitli

knowing so much of the customs of anahuac and not having discovered his
body the more experienced cavaliers were convinced that don amador de
leste had not yet enjoyed the happiness of death they persuaded
themselves that he had been taken alive and was preserved for
sacrifice many a castilian eye that afternoon was cast upon the
pyramid watching the steps and eagerly examining the persons of all
who ascended but no victim was seen borne upon their shoulders  

when the cavalier of cuenza opened his eyes after the stunning effects
of the blow were over it was in a confusion of mind which the objects
about him or perhaps the accession of a hot fever the result of
many severe wounds and contusions soon converted into delirium he
lay his armour removed on a couch in a spacious apartment but so
darkened that he could not distinguish the countenances of two or three
dusky figures which seemed to bend over him his thoughts were still in
the battle and in these persons he perceived nothing less than
mexican warriors still clutching at his body he started up and calling
out ho fogoso one leap more for thy master caught fiercely at the
nearest of the individuals but he had overrated his strength and
almost before a hand was laid upon him he fell back fainting on the
bed

dost thou strike me too false villain he again exclaimed as his
distempered eyes pictured in one silent visage the features of
abdalla be thou accursed for thy ingratitude and live in hell for
ever

a murmur of voices followed by the sound of retreating steps was
heard and in the silence which ensued his fancy became more
disordered presenting him phantasms still more peculiar

is this death he muttered and lie i now in the world of shadows
god be merciful to me a sinner pity and pardon me o christ for i have
fought for thy faith take me from this place of blackness and let me
look on the light of bliss

a gentle hand was laid upon his forehead a low sigh breathed on his
cheek and suddenly a light flashing up as from some expiring cresset
revealed to his wondering eyes the face and figure of the mysterious
prophetess

o god art thou indeed a fiend and dost thou lead me from the land of
infidels to the prison-house of devils he cried again starting up
clasping his hands and gazing wildly on the vision speak to me thou
that livest not for i know thou art leila

as he uttered these incoherent words the figure bending a little away
and fastening upon his own eyes of strange meaning in which pity
struggled with terror seemed gradually to fade into the air until
as suddenly as it had flashed into brightness the light vanished and
all was left in darkness

from this moment the thoughts of the cavalier wandered with tenfold
wildness and he fell into a delirium which presented as long as it
lasted a succession of exciting images now he struggled in the hall
of his own castle of alcornoque or the cork-tree with the false
abdalla the knee of the almogavar on his breast and the arab poniard
at his throat while all the time the perfidious jacinto stood by
exhorting his father to strike now he stood among burning sands
fighting with enraged fiends over the dead body of his knight calavar
to protect the beloved corse from their fiery fingers now the vanished
leila sat weeping by his side dropping upon his fevered lips the juice
of pleasant fruits or now she came to him in the likeness of the pagan
sibyl beckoning him away with melancholy smiles to a distant bay
while ever when he strove to rise and follow the page jacinto
converted into a giant and brandishing a huge dagger held him back
with a lion's strength and ferocity

with such chimeras and a thousand others equally extravagant
disturbing his brain he passed through many hours and then as a
torpor like that of death gradually stole over him benumbing his
deranged faculties the same gentle hand the same low suspiration
which had soothed him before but without the countenance which had
maddened returned to him and made pleasant the path to annihilation




chapter xlvii


from a deep slumber that seemed indeed death for it was dreamless
the cavalier at last awoke somewhat confused but no longer
delirious and though greatly enfeebled entirely free from fever a
yellow sunbeam the first or the last glimmering of day he knew not
which played through a narrow casement faintly illuminating the
apartment and falling especially upon a low table at his side whereon
among painted and gilded vessels of strange form he perceived his
helmet and other pieces of armour as well as a lute of not less
remembered workmanship he raised his eyes to the attendant who sat
musing hard by and with a thrill and exclamation of joy beheld the
moorish page jacinto

is it thou indeed my dear knave jacinto whom i thought in the maws
of infidels he cried starting up and how art thou and how is thy
lord don gabriel to-day tell me where hast thou been these two
troubled days and how didst thou return by my faith this last bout
was somewhat hard and i have slept long

leave not thy couch and speak not too loud noble master said the
page kneeling and kissing his hand for thou art sick and wounded
and here only art thou safe

ay now indeed said don amador with a sudden and painful
consciousness of his situation i remember me i was struck down and
made a prisoner what good angel brought me into thy company thanks be
to heaven for my hurts are not much and i will rescue thee from
captivity

i am not a captive señor said the boy gently

are we then in the palace where are our friends am i not a
prisoner

señor we are far from the palace of axajacatl but grieve not for
here thou art with thy servants

thou speakest to me in riddles said the novice with a disturbed and
bewildered countenance have i been dreaming am i enchanted am i
living and in my senses

the saints be praised thou art indeed said the page fervently
though both nights and all day till the blessed potion set thee
asleep i had no hopes thou wouldst ever recover

both nights echoed don amador fixing his eyes inquiringly on the
boy has a night have two nights passed over me and wert thou then
with me during it all ha was it thine acts of sorcery which brought
me those strange and melancholy visions didst thou conjure up to me
the image of leila that priestess that very supernatural
prophetess by heaven as i see thee so saw i her standing at my
bed-side in some magical light which straightway turned to darkness
didst thou not see her tell me boy art thou indeed an enchanter
prepare me thy spells again reveal me her fate and let me look on the
face of leila

as the cavalier spoke he strove in his eagerness to rise from the
couch

señor said the page a little pleasantly if thou wilt have me
satisfy thy questions thou must learn to acknowledge me as thy
physician and jailor and give me such obedience as thou wouldst
formerly have claimed of me rise not up speak not aloud and give not
way to the fancies of fever for here are no priestesses and no leilas
i will sing to thee if that will content thee with bondage but now
thou must remain in quiet and be healed of thy wounds

i tell thee my boy jacinto went on the cavalier wounds or no
wounds jailed or not jailed i am in a perplexity of mind which if
thou art able i must command or what is the same thing beseech thee
to remove first therefore what house is this and where is it
whether on the isle mexico the lake side the new world or the old
or indeed in any part of the earth at all secondly how got'st thou
into it thirdly how came i hither myself and especially what good
christian did snatch my body out of the paws of those roaring lions the
mexicans when i was hit that foul and assassin-like blow by by  

señor said the page not doubting but that his patron had paused for
want of breath to answer all these questions is more than i am
allowed all that i can say is that if prudent and obedient i say
obedient noble and dear master continued the boy archly for now you
are my prisoner you are safer in this dungeon than are your spanish
friends in their fortress reduced to captivity indeed but preserved
from destruction  

by the false traitorous and most ungrateful knave abdalla thy
father exclaimed the neophyte with a loud and stern voice for just
as he had hesitated to wound the ears of the boy he beheld slowly
stalking into the apartment and eyeing him over jacinto's shoulder the
almogavar himself and the epithets of indignation burst at once from
his lips jacinto started back alarmed but abdalla approached and
regarding the wounded cavalier with an unmoved countenance motioned the
boy to retire in an instant the moor of barbary and the spaniard of
castile were left alone together

shall i repeat my words thou base and cut-throat infidel cried don
amador rising so far as to place his feet on the floor though still
sitting on the platform which supported his mattress and speaking with
the most cutting anger was it not enough that thou wert a renegade to
the rest but thou must raise thy judas-hand against thy benefactor

my benefactor indeed said abdoul calmly and with the most musical
utterance of his voice though i wear the livery of the pagans he
had on an armed tunic somewhat similar to that of quauhtimotzin though
without a plume to his head and looked not unlike to a mexican warrior
of high degree and though i am by birth the natural enemy of thee
and thine yet have i not forgot that thou art my benefactor i
remember that when a brutal soldier struck at me with his lance thy
hand was raised to protect me from the shame i remember when a
thousand weapons were darting at my prostrate body on the pyramid of
zempoala that thou didst not disdain to preserve me i remember that
when i fled from the anger of don hernan thou offeredst me thine
intercession señor i have forgotten none of this nor have i
forgotten he went on with earnest gratitude that to these favours
thou didst add the greater ones of shielding my feeble child from
stripes from ruin and perhaps from death this have i not forgotten
this can i never forget the name of spaniard is a curse on my ears i
hate thy people and when god gives me help i will slay even to the
last man but i remember that thou art my benefactor and the
benefactor of my child

and dost thou think said the neophyte that these oily words will
blind me to thy baseness or that they can deceive me into belief when
thy actions have so foully belied them cursed art thou misbelieving
moor an ingrate and apostate and had i no cause in mine own person
to know thy perfidy it should be enough to blazon thy villany that
thou hast on thine own confession deserted the standard of christ and
the arms of spain to enlist in the ranks of their pagan foes

the standard of christ said the moor with emphasis waves not over
the heads of the spaniards but the banner of a fiend bloody unjust
and accursed whom they call by his holy name and who bids them to
defile and destroy while the redeemer proclaimeth only good-will and
peace to all men have thy good heart and thy strong mind been so
deluded canst thou in truth believe that these oppressors of a
harmless people these slayers who raise the cross of heaven on the
place of blood and call to god for approval when their hands are
smoking with the blood of his creatures are the followers of christ the
peaceful christ the just christ the holy these friends whom thou hast
followed are not christians and god whom they traduce and belie in
all their actions has given them over to the punishment of hypocrites
and blasphemers to sufferings miserable and unparalleled to deaths
dreadful and memorable may it be accomplished amen

dost thou speak this to me vile almogavar of my friends and
countrymen dost thou curse them thus in my presence most unworthy
apostate

sorrowful be their doom and quickly may it come upon them cried
abdalla with ferocious fervour for what are they that it should not
be just and what am i that i should not pray that it be accomplished
i remember the days of granada i remember the sack of the alhambra i
remember the slaughter of the alpujarras and i have not forgotten the
mourning exiles driven from those green hills to die among the sands
of africa the clime of their fathers but to them a land of strangers
i remember me how the lowly were given to the scourge and the princely
to the fires of inquisitors our children to spears our wives to
ravishers and murderers cursed be they that did these things even to
the last generation

the cavalier was amazed and confounded at the vehement and lofty
indignation of the morisco and as the form of abdoul-al-sidi swelled
with wrath and his countenance darkened under the gloomy recollection
he seemed to don amador rather like one of those mountain princes who
had defied the conquerors to the last among the alpujarras than a
poor herdsman of fez deriving his knowledge and his fury only from
the incitations of exiles his embarrassment was also increased by a
secret consciousness that the moor had cause for his hate and his
denunciations he answered him however with a severe voice 

in these ills and sufferings thou hadst no part unless thou hast
lied to me having been a child of the desert afar from the sufferers
of granada

i lied to thee then said abdalla elevating his figure and
regarding the cavalier with proud tranquillity from the beginning to
the end was i a chief among the mourners and rebels the first to
strike as i am now the last to curse the oppressor a child of the
desert only when i had no more to suffer among the alpujarras and thou
mayst know now that my fury is as deep as it is just for the poor
abdalla is no almogavar of barbary but a zegri of granada

a zegri of granada cried don amador with surprise

a zegri of granada and a prince among zegris said the moor with a
more stately look though with a voice of the deepest sorrow one whose
fathers have given kings to the alhambra but who hath lived to see his
child a menial in the house of his foe and both child and father
leagued with and lost among the infidels of a strange land in a world
unknown

i thought by heaven said the cavalier eyeing the apostate with a
look almost of respect that that courage of thine in the pirate rover
did argue thee to be somewhat above the stamp of a common boor and
therefore but more especially in regard of thy boy did i give thee
consideration myself and enforce it as well as i could to be yielded
by others but by the faith which thou professest sir zegri be thou
ignoble or regal in thy condition i have not forgotten that by the
blow which has made me as it seems to me i am thy prisoner thou
hast shown thyself unworthy of nobility and i tell thee again with
disgust and indignation that thou hast done the act of a base and most
villanous caitiff

dost thou still say so replied the zegri mildly i have
acknowledged that no gratitude can repay thy benefactions this do i
still confess and yet have i done all to requite thee thou lookest on
me with amazement what is my crime noble benefactor

what is thy crime art thou bewitched too slave of an ingrate
didst thou not when i was already overpowered smite me down with thine
own weapon

i did heaven be thanked said the moor devoutly

dost thou acknowledge it and thank heaven too said the incensed
cavalier

i acknowledge it and i thank heaven said abdalla firmly thou
saidst thou wert already overpowered wert thou not in the hands of the
mexicans beyond all hope of rescue

doubtless i was replied the neophyte for cortes was afar and
alvarado full three spears length behind nevertheless i did not
despair of maintaining the fight until my friends came up to my
relief

thou wert a captive cried the zegri impetuously a living captive
in the hands of mexicans dost thou know the fate of a prisoner in such
hands

by my faith said don amador i have heard they put their prisoners
to the torture

they sacrifice them to the gods cried the moor and the death he
continued his swarthy visage whitening with horror the death is of
such torment and terror as thou canst not conceive but i can for i
have seen it now hear me i saw my benefactor a captive and i knew his
life would end on the stone of sacrifice offered up like that of a
beast to false and fiendish gods i say i saw thee thus i knew this
should be thy doom and i did all that my gratitude taught me to save
thee i struck thee down knowing that if i slew thee the blow would
be that of a true friend and that thou shouldst die like a soldier not
like a fatted sheep heaven however gave me all that i had dared to
hope i harmed thee not and yet the mexicans believed that death had
robbed them of a victim i harmed thee not and the heathens suffered me
to drag away what seemed a corse but which lived and was my
benefactor the saviour of myself and the protector of my child

as abdalla concluded these words spoken with much emphasis and feeling
a tear glistened in his eye and the neophyte starting up and eagerly
grasping his hand exclaimed 

now by heaven i see all the wisdom and truth of thy friendship and i
beg thy pardon for whatever insulting words my folly has caused me to
speak and now that i know the blow was struck for such a purpose i
confess to thee as thou saidst thyself it would have been true
gratitude and love though it had killed me outright

i have done thee even more service than this said the zegri calmly
but before i speak it i must demand of thee as a christian and
honourable soldier to confess thyself my just and true captive

thy captive cried don amador dost thou hold me then as a prisoner
and not as a guest and friend dost thou check my thankfulness in the
bud and cancel thy services by making me thy thrall

i will not answer thy demands said abdalla i call upon thee as a
noble and knightly soldier fairly captured in open war by my hands
to acknowledge thyself my captive and as such in all things justly
at my disposition

if thou dost exact it of me said the cavalier regarding him with
much surprise and sorrow i must as a man of honour so acknowledge
myself but i began to think better of thee abdalla

and as a prisoner to whose honour is confided the charge of his own
keeping thou engagest to remain in captivity without abusing the
confidence which allows such license by any efforts to escape

dost thou demand this much of me said don amador with mortified and
dejected looks if thou art thyself resolved to remain in the
indulgence of thy treason thou surely wilt not think to keep me from my
friends in their difficulties and especially from my poor kinsman who
is now greatly disordered and chiefly i think because thou hast
robbed him of jacinto

this am i not called upon to answer said abdalla gravely i only
demand of thee what thou knowest thou canst not honourably refuse thy
knightly gage to observe the rules of captivity until such time as i
may think proper to absolve and free thee

sir almogavar or sir zegri or whatsoever thou art said the
cavalier folding his arms and surveying his jailor sternly use the
powers which thou hast thy chains and thy magical arts for i believe
thou dealest with the devil get me ready thy fetters and thy dungeon
thou hast the right so to use me and i consent to the same but i will
gage thee no word to keep in bonds inglorious and at ease while my
friends are in peril however great the service thou hast done to me i
perceive thou art a traitor i command thee therefore that thou have
me chained and immured forthwith for with god's will and help i will
escape from thee as soon as possible and especially whensoever my
friends come to assist me

i grant thee this privilege when thy friends come near to us said
abdalla coolly whether thou art chained or not it is not possible
thou canst escape otherwise at all thou art far from the palace
ignorant of the way and besides divided from it by a wall of
mexicans who cannot be numbered what i ask thee is for thy good and
for the good of myself and jacinto if thou leave this house thou wilt
be immediately seized and carried to the stone of sacrifice

don amador shuddered but said 

i trust in god and the thought of this fate shall not deter me

go then if thou wilt said the zegri haughtily the service i have
done thee has not yet released me from thy debt and thou canst yet
command me begone if thou art resolute the door is open i oppose
thee not preserve thy life if thou canst and when thou art safe at
the garrison remember that abdoul-al-sidi and the boy jacinto have
taken thy place on the altar of victims

what dost thou mean i understand thee not what meanest thou

even that thou canst not escape without the same being made known to
the mexicans and that it cannot be made known to this vindictive
people that i have robbed them of their prey without the penalty of my
own life and that of jacinto being immediately executed when thou
fliest the father and the son perish

dost thou speak me this in good faith said the cavalier greatly
troubled god forbid i should bring harm to thee and especially to the
boy if i give thee my gage thou wilt not hold me bound to refrain
from joining my friends should i be so fortunate as to see them pass
by and am persuaded the mexicans will not discover thou hast harboured
me

if they pass by i will myself open the doors said abdalla for i
protest to thee i keep thee here only to ensure thy security

hark'ee sir moor don hernan is about to retreat dost thou intend i
shall remain in captivity a single victim among the barbarians while
my countrymen are flying afar perhaps returning to christendom

i swear to thee señor said the zegri earnestly that when the
spaniards fly from this city thou shalt be free to fly with them i
repeat i make thee a prisoner to prevent thy becoming a victim

and what hinders that we do not fly together to the palace thy
knowledge may conduct us through the streets by night and with my
head i will engage thee a free pardon and friendly reception

god hath commissioned me to the work and it shall go on said the
moor with solemn emphasis i know that thou couldst not save me from
the fury of don hernan he would grant thee my life at midnight and on
the morrow thou wouldst find me dead in the court-yard fly if thou
wilt and leave me to perish by the hands of mexicans spaniards shall
drink my blood no more

i give thee my gage said the cavalier with this understanding
then that i am free to fly whenever i may do so without perilling thy
life and the life of jacinto

and thou wilt hold to this pledge like a true cavalier demanded
abdalla quickly

surely i cannot break my plighted word

god be thanked cried the zegri grasping the hand of the cavalier
for by this promise thou hast saved thy life remain here jacinto
shall be thy jailor thy companion thy servant be content with thy
lot and thank god for thou art the only brand plucked out of the
burning while all the rest shall perish god be praised i save my
benefactor

with these exclamations of satisfaction abdalla departed from the
chamber




chapter xlviii


the cavalier pondered in perplexity over the words of abdalla and
the longer he reflected the more he began to lament his captivity and
doubt the wisdom of his gage

it is apparent to me he soliloquized that my countrymen are in
greater jeopardy than i before apprehended and that it has been the
plot of this subtle moor whom i confess however to have something
elevated and noble in his way of thinking and much gratitude of heart
though of a mistaken character to keep me out of harm's way while the
mexicans are murdering my companions heaven forgive me my rash parole
if this be true for such safety becomes dishonour and ignominy i will
talk with him further on the subject and if i find he hath thus schemed
to preserve me at such a price of degradation i will straightway
revoke my engagement as being wrung from me by deceit and quite
impossible to be fulfilled i marvel where loiters the boy jacinto
methinks i could eat something now for i know not how long it is since
i have tasted food an orange or a bunch of grapes were not
amiss but heaven save me i have heard oranges do not grow in this
land and perhaps these poor moriscos are no better off than my friends
at the palace god help them for the mexicans fight like turks and
once or twice that evening of the conflagration i thought i had got me
again into the trenches of rhodes and as for those knaves that wounded
me never did i see more valiant devils i am glad i left my knight so
possessed of his wits that botello doth seem very clearly to have
apprehended my fate though the mishap be not so miserable as death
truly there did a third time war come out of peace and yet i assure
myself that this time it was brought about by don hernan rushing
against that supernatural creature that looks on me in the street and
eyes me even by my bed-side

the cavalier was startled from his revery by a light step and as the
curtain was drawn aside from the door he almost thought for an
instant that he beheld the visage of the priestess peering through its
folds a second glance however showed him the features of the moorish
page who came in bearing a little basket of fruits and indian
confections as if anticipating his wants these jacinto placed before
him and then sat down at his feet

for a few moments don amador in the satisfaction of the boy's presence
forgot many of his perplexities but observing at last that jacinto's
smiles were ever alternating with looks of distress and alarm and that
sometimes he surveyed his imprisoned master with eyes of great
wildness the cavalier began again to recur to his condition to the
mysteries which surrounded him and especially to the suspicions which
so often attributed to the page the possession of magical arts

thou saidst jacinto he abruptly exclaimed after thrusting aside the
almost untasted food and regarding the boy with a penetrating look
that thou wert for the two last nights at my bed-side god be good to
me for tis an evil thing to be benighted so long

señor i was

and during all that time i was entirely dispossessed of my wits

señor mio yes but now heaven be thanked your honour will recover

and thou art sure i did not labour more under enchantment than
fever

the page smiled but very faintly and without replying

to me it seems no longer possible to doubt said the cavalier that
i have been divers times of late entirely bewitched and that thou
hast had some agency in my delusions

jacinto smiled more pleasantly and seemed to forget the secret thoughts
which had agitated him

dost thou demanded the cavalier know aught of a certain
supernatural priestess that goes about the streets of this town in
pagan processions followed by countless herds of nobles and warriors

the page hesitated while replying 

i have indeed heard of such a creature and i may say i have seen
her

thou hast seen her is she mortal

surely i think so noble señor replied jacinto with increasing
embarrassment

for my part said the novice with a deep sigh and a troubled aspect
i am almost quite convinced that she is a spectre and an inhabitant
of hell sent forth upon the earth to punish me with much affliction
and perhaps with madness for i think she is the spirit of leila and
her appearance in the guise of a pagan goddess or pagan priestess the
one or the other shows me that she whom i loved dwells not with
angels but with devils this is a thought continued the cavalier
mournfully that burns my heart as with a coal and if god spare my
life and return me to mine own land i will devote my estates to buy
masses for her soul for surely she cannot have fallen from sin into
irreparable wo but only into a punishment for some heresy the fault of
bad instruction which may be expiated

jacinto regarded the distressed visage of his patron with concern and
with indecision as if impelled and yet afraid to speak what might
remove his anguish then at last moved by affection and looking up
with arch confidence to don amador he said 

señor i can relieve you of this unhappiness this is no spirit but a
woman as i know full well for i am in the secret i am not sure that
it will not offend my father to divulge such a secret to any spaniard
yet can its revealment prejudice none know señor and use not this
confession to my father's injury that all this interlude of the
prophetess devised by the mexican nobles and priests with my father's
counsel and aid is a scheme to inflame the people with fresh devotion
and fury against the spaniards your countrymen for being very
superstitious and credulous the common people are easily persuaded that
their gods have sent them a messenger to encourage and observe their
valour as it is fabled they have done in former days the prophetess
is but a puppet in their hands

the cavalier eyed the young speaker steadfastly until jacinto cast his
looks to the earth

set this woman before me let me look upon her he said gravely and
yet with earnestness

the page returned his gaze with one of confusion and even affright

thou wilt not think to deceive me continued his patron after
confiding to me so much know thou that it will rejoice me relieving
my mind of many pangs to find that thy words are true and to look upon
this most beauteous and to my eyes this most supernatural barbarian
if she be a living creature thou hast it in thy power to produce her
for she dwells in this house i say this jacinto on strong persuasion
of the fact for last night i beheld her and did almost touch her

señor said the boy briskly that was one of the fancies of thy
delirium it was my poor self thou wert looking on twenty times or
more didst thou call to me as being the prophetess and as often
didst thou see in me some other strange creature now i was my lord don
gabriel your worship's kinsman now some lady that your honour loved
now an angel bringing you succour in battle now my lord's little
brother now his enemy and twice or thrice i was my own poor self
only that i was killing my lord with a dagger as if i could do any
wrong to my master

is this the truth indeed said the cavalier dolorously i could
have sworn that i saw that woman and that i was very sane when i saw
her as for the after-visions i can well believe that they were the
phantasms of fever being very extravagant and but vaguely
remembered thou deniest then that thou hast the power of casting
spells

the page smiled merrily for he perceived his patron was relieved of one
irrational distress and banteringly replied 

i will not say that i can do many things my lord would not think
and i know many he would not dream

the cavalier was too sad and too simple-minded to jest

i believe thee he said seriously for in every thing thou art a
miracle and mystery why is it that thou hast obtained such a command
over my affections why is it that i have come to regard thee not as a
boy young and foolish but as one ripe in years and wisdom it must
needs be because thou derivest thy power and thy knowledge from those
astral and magical arts which i once esteemed so vain for i remember
me that at thy years i was myself not half so much advanced in
intelligence and art but was on the contrary quite a dull and foolish
boy

it all comes of my music said the page for that is a talent which
matures faster than any other and drags others along with it besides
giving one great skill in touching hearts your worship remembers how
soon young david gained the love of the jewish king and how he would
have cured him of his melancholy but that saul had a bad heart now my
lord seems to me to have like this king an evil spirit troubling
him and perhaps if he will let me i can sing it away with the ballad
of the knight and the page for my lord's heart is good

the knight and the page i have never heard thee sing that said don
amador somewhat indifferently what is it about

it is about a brave cavalier that loved a noble lady who loved him
but being made to believe her false to her vows he went to the wars to
die followed by a little page whom he thought the only true friend he
had left in the world

by my faith said don amador regarding the boy kindly in this
respect methinks i am at present somewhat like that knight for
thou that art likewise a little page seemest to be the only friend i
have left in the world that is in this city that is to say in this
part of it for i have much confidence in the love of several at the
palace notwithstanding that i think some others were a little backward
in supporting me when beset that evil day by the barbarians was he
a spanish knight and of what parts

of the sierra morena at some place where the jucar washes its foot

in good truth cried the cavalier that is the very river that rolls
by cuenza and herein again is there another parallel but i should
inform thee that when the mountain reaches so far as the jucar and
runs up along its course it is then called the sierra of cuenza and
not morena but this is a small matter i shall be as glad to hear of
the knight of jucar as of one of my ancestors

he resembled my lord still more said the page for he had fallen
fighting the infidel very grievously wounded and his little page
remained at his side to share his fate

that i have in a manner fallen and as i may say fighting the
infidel is true but by no means can it be said that i am grievously
wounded these cuts that i have on my body are but such scratches as
one might make with a thorn and were it not for my head which doth
ever and anon ring much like to a bell and ache somewhat immoderately
i should think myself well able to go out fighting again not at all
regarding my feebleness which is not much and my stiff joints which a
little exercise would greatly reduce into suppleness

it was the resemblance of my lord's situation to the knight of jucar's
that reminded me of the roundelay said jacinto taking up his lute
and stringing it into accord and now your worship shall represent the
wounded knight and i the young page that followed him but your
worship should suppose me instead of being a boy to be a woman in
disguise

a woman in disguise said the cavalier is the page then the false
mistress there should be very good cause to put a woman in disguise
for besides that it robs her to appearance if not absolutely of the
natural delicacy of her sex it forces her to be a hypocrite a
deceitful woman is still more odious than a double-faced man

but this lady had great cause said jacinto seeing that love and
sorrow together forced her into the henchman's habit as my lord will
presently see

so saying with a pleasant smile the minstrel struck the lute and sang
the following little

 romance of the knight and the page

 

 a christian knight in the paynim land
 lay bleeding on the plain
 the fight was done and the field was won
 but not by the christian train
 the cross had vail'd to the crescent
 the moorish shouts rose high 
 lelilee lelilee but the christian knight
 sent up a sadder cry
 my castle lies on morena's top
 jucar is far away  
 my lady will rue for her vows untrue
 but god be good for aye  
 young page thou followest well
 these dog-howls heed not thou 
 lelilee lelilee  
 get thee hence to my lady now
 tell her this blood that pours a flood
 my heart's true faith doth prove 
 my corse to earth my sighs to thee 
 my heart to my lady love

 

 the page he knelt at the christian's side
 and sorely sobb'd he then
 the faithless love can truer prove
 than hosts of faithful men
 the cross has vail'd to the crescent
 the moorish shouts are high  
 lelilee lelilee but the love untrue
 hath yet another cry
 thy castle lies on morena's top
 jucar is far away
 but dies the bride at her true lord's side 
 now god be good for aye
 the page that followeth well
 repeats the unbroken vow 
 lelilee lelilee 
 oh look on thy lady now
 for now this blood that pours a flood
 doth show her true love's plight  
 my soul to god my blood to thine  
 my life for my dying knight

is that all said the cavalier when jacinto had warbled out the
last line there should have been another stanza to explain what was
the cause of separation as well as how it happened that the lady came
to follow the knight as a servant neither of which circumstances is
very manifest

señor said jacinto if all the story had been told it would have
made a book it is clear that an evil destiny separated the pair and
that love sent the lady after her lord

be thou a conjuror or not said don amador musingly thou hast the
knack ever to hit upon subjects as well in thy songs as in thy stories
which both provoke my curiosity and revive my melancholy my castle
as i may say doth lie on morena's top that is to say on the ridge
of cuenza and jucar is indeed far away but heaven hath left me no
lady-love either to die with me among the infidels by whom i am made
to bleed or to lament me at home an evil destiny how evil i know
not and yet do i dread more dark than that which prevails with a
jealous heart hath separated me from one whom i loved and
doubtless hath separated me for ever the cavalier sighed deeply bent
his eyes for a moment on the ground and then raising them with a
solemn look to the page said abruptly i have come to be persuaded
altogether beyond the contradiction of my reason that thou hast
somehow and perhaps by magical arts obtained a knowledge of the
history of my past life if thou knowest aught of the fate of leila the
lamented maid of almeria i adjure thee to reveal thy knowledge and
without delay thou shakest thy head wherefore didst thou refuse to
finish the story of her who bore her name and who dwelt in the same
city

my lord will be angry with me said the page rising in some
perturbation i have deceived him

i am sorry to know thou couldst be in any way guilty of deceit
though i do readily forgive thee charging thee however at all times
to remember that any deceitfulness is but a form of mendacity and
therefore as mean and degrading as it is sinful in what hast thou
deceived me

when i told my lord the story of leila and perceived how it disturbed
him said jacinto with a faltering voice i repented me and told him
a thing that was not true to appease him the leila of whom i spoke
had dwelt in almeria within a year past and perhaps she was the maid
that my lord remembered

as the page made this confession don amador sprang eagerly to his feet
and as he seized the speaker's arm cried with much agitation 

dost thou tell me the truth and does she live god be praised for
ever doth the maiden live

she lived when my father brought me from barbary 

heaven be thanked i will ransom her from the infidels though i give
myself up to captivity as the price

señor said the page sorrowfully you forget that you are now a
prisoner in another world

the cavalier smote his breast crying it is true and the revealment
comes too late silly boy he continued reproachfully why didst
thou delay telling me this until this time when it can only add to my
griefs why didst thou not speak it at tlascala that i might have
departed forthwith from the land to her rescue

my lord would not have deserted his kinsman don gabriel

true again exclaimed don amador with a pang i could not have left
my knight even at the call of leila but now will i go to don gabriel
and confessing to him my sorrow will prevail upon him straightway to
depart with me for here it must be plain to him as it is to me that
god is not with us

alas señor said the page it is not possible that you should go to
don gabriel nor that you should ever more leave this heathen land

dost thou confess then demanded the novice that abdalla has
deceived me and that i am held to perpetual captivity

señor said the boy clasping his hands and weeping bitterly we
shall never more see spain nor any land but this the fate of don
hernan and of all his men is written they are in a net from which
they cannot escape and we who are spared obtain our lives only at the
price of expatriation my father remembered his protector my lord is
saved but he shares our exile

at this confirmation of his worst suspicions the countenance of don
amador darkened with despair and horror

and abdalla thy father has plotted this foul traitorous and most
bloody catastrophe and he thinks that for my life's sake i will
divide with him the dishonour and guilt of my preservation

my lord knows not the wrongs of my father said jacinto mournfully
or he would not speak of him so harshly

thy father is a most traitor-like and backsliding villain said don
amador and this baseness in him should entirely cancel in thee the
bonds of affection and duty for thou art not of his nature hark thee
then boy it is my purpose straightway to depart from this house and
this durance i desire to save thee from the fate of a pagan's slave
better will it be for thee if thou shouldst die with me in the attempt
to reach the palace and i swear to thee i will protect thee to the
last moment of my life than remain in tenochtitlan after thy
christian friends have left it or after they are slain it is my hope
and indeed my belief that when the valiant general don hernan
comes to be persuaded of his true condition he will immediately and
at any cost cut his way out of this most accursed city in this manner
will we escape and thou shall find in me a father who will love thee
not less truly and more in fashion of a christian than the apostate
zegri

if my lord could but protect my father from the anger of don hernan
and prevail upon him to return with my lord said jacinto eagerly

i have already proposed this to him and in his fury he denies me

heaven help us then cried jacinto for there is no other hope and
we must dwell with the barbarians

dost thou think that i will rest here when they are murdering don
gabriel hark thee what knave has stolen away my sword know that i
will straightway make my escape and carry thee along with me for god
would not forgive me did i leave thee abandoned to barbarians to the
eternal loss and perdition of thy soul i say to thee again thou shalt
accompany me

i will remain with my father said the boy stepping back and
assuming some of that dignity and decision which the neophyte had so
lately witnessed in abdalla and so will my lord likewise for my lord
has given him a pledge which he cannot forfeit

miserable wretch that i am said the cavalier in either case i am
overwhelmed with dishonour my gage was sinful and the infraction of it
will be shame bring me hither abdalla i will revoke my promise to him
in person and after that i can depart without disgrace

thou canst not escape without shedding blood at least said the boy
with a pale and yet determined countenance for first thou must slay
my father who saved thee from the death of sacrifice if thou goest in
his absence then must my lord strike down the son for with what
strength i have i will prevent him

the amazement with which the warlike cavalier heard these words and
beheld the stripling throw himself manfully before the door of the
apartment entirely disconcerted him for a moment before he could find
words to express his anger or perhaps derision the page with a sudden
revulsion of feeling ran from the door and flinging himself at his
patron's feet embraced his knees weeping and exclaiming with much
passion

o my dear master be not incensed with me for i am but weak and silly
and i have no friends but my father and thee if thou takest me from my
father then shall he be left childless to live and to die alone if
thou goest without us we shall be deserted to perish without a friend
for no one has smiled on us but my lord and if thou goest while my
father is absent he will curse me and i will curse myself for thou
must needs die in the streets

the novice was touched not so much by the last and undeniable
assurance as by the pathetic appeal of the morisco

be comforted jacinto he cried for now indeed it appears to me
that whether i had passed my gage or not i could not take advantage of
the weakness of such a jailor and fly without the greatest shame and
in addition it seems to me inhuman and unjust that i should think of
escaping without doing my best to snatch thee and thy father also
whose sinfulness does in this case at least spring from affection
out of thraldom be thou therefore content i will remain thy patient
prisoner until such time as abdalla returns hoping that i can then
advance such remonstrance and argument as shall convert him from his
purpose and cause him to repent what wrongs he has already done don
hernan and to accept his mercy which i do again avow myself ready to
secure with my life and even with my honour but i warn thee that i
can by no means remain a captive while my friends are given up to
destruction

señor said jacinto rising there is a hope they will be spared if
the king should recover for greatly have the mexicans mourned the rage
which wounded their monarch if he live and again command peace there
will be peace and all of us may yet be happy

god grant that this may be so said the cavalier catching at the
hope i will therefore remain with thee a little for if my friends be
not starved outright i have no fear but that they can easily maintain
themselves a week in the palace

and besides señor said the page returning to his playful manner
if you were to leave me how should you hear more of the maid of
almeria

of leila cried the cavalier forgetting at once his honour and his
friends now do i remember me that you have not yet told me how you
acquired your most blessed and blissful knowledge heaven forgive me i
did not think it possible but i believe i had entirely forgotten
her how comest thou to know aught of her answer me quickly and be
still more quick to tell me all you know

will not my lord be satisfied with my knowledge without seeking after
the means of acquiring it demanded the page hesitatingly

if indeed said don amador solemnly thou hast obtained it by the
practice of that land of magic which is forbidden though my curiosity
will not permit me to eschew its revelations yet must i caution thee
from this time henceforth to employ it no more for herein dost thou
peril thy soul but if it be by those arts which are not in themselves
sinful thou shouldst not be ashamed to confess them for the habit of
concealment is the first step in the path of deception and i have
already assured thee that a deceiver is as one may say a lie in the
face of his maker but of this i will instruct thee more fully
hereafter at present i burn with an unconquerable desire to hear thee
speak of leila

but how know i said the page again hesitating that she of whom i
speak is the leila after whom it pleases my lord to inquire and why
indeed now that i think of it should my lord inquire at all after one
of a persecuted and despised race

wilt thou still torment me have i not told thee that i forgot her
origin and loved her

and did she love my lord back again

thou askest me what i cannot with certainty answer replied the
cavalier for she was snatched away from me before i had yet overcome
the natural scruples of my pride to discourse of love to one who seemed
so much beneath the dignity of my birth and fortunes

and my lord gave her no cause to think she had obtained favour in his
eyes

in this thou dost not err for saving some gifts which were indeed
more the boons of a patron than the tribute of a lover i did nothing to
address me to her affections in all things as i may say i did rather
assume the character of one who would befriend and protect her from
wrong than of a man seeking after her love

but if she accepted my lord's gifts she must have loved him said
jacinto

they were very trifles rejoined the cavalier saving only one
indeed which as she must have perceived could not have been more
properly bestowed than upon one so innocent and friendless as herself
this was a very antique and blessed jewel a cross of rubies fetched
by mine ancestor don rodrigo of arragon more than three hundred years
ago from the holy land after having been consecrated upon the
sepulchre itself it was thought to be a talisman of such heavenly
efficacy in the hands of an unspotted virgin that no harm could ever
come to her who wore it upon her neck for mine own part though i
could tell thee divers stories of its virtue recorded in our house yet
was i ever inclined to think that a natural purity of heart was in all
cases a much better protection of innocence than even a holy talisman
nevertheless when i beheld this orphan moor i bethought me of the
imputed virtues of those rubies and i put them upon her neck as
thinking her friendless condition gave her the strongest claim to all
such blessed protection

a cross of rubies cried the page it is she

and thou canst tell me of her resting-place and of her present
condition cried the overjoyed cavalier i remember that at the
temple of tlascala thou didst aver that notwithstanding the apparent
baseness of her origin it had been discovered that she was descended of
very noble parentage

what i can tell thee and what i will said jacinto gravely
will depend upon thine own actions if thou leavest this place without
my father's consent hope not that thou shalt know any thing more than
has been spoken if thou art content to remain a little time in
captivity and to yield me the obedience which i demand thou shalt
find that a child of a contemned race may possess wisdom unknown to men
of happier degrees thou hast acknowledged thyself the captive of my
father wilt thou promise obedience to me

don amador surveyed the boy with a bewildered stare

it is possible said he that i am yet dreaming for it seemeth to me
very absurd that thou who art a boy and wert but yesterday a servant
shouldst make such a demand of subjection to a man and a cavalier and
as i may say also thy master

my lord will not think i would have him become a servant said
jacinto the subjection i require is for the purpose of securing him
that gratification of his curiosity which he has sought and thus only
can he obtain it in all other respects i remain myself the slave of my
lord

provided thou wilt demand me nothing dishonourable nor irreligious
and now that i know from thy father's confession that thou art of
noble descent i can scarcely apprehend in thee any meanness i will
make thee such a promise said don amador but i must beseech thee
not to torment me with delay

my lord shall not repent his goodness said the page with a happy
countenance for when he thinks not of it his wishes shall be
gratified but at present let him be at peace and sleep for the
time has not yet come i claim now the first proof of my lord's
obedience let him eat of this medicinal confection and by a little
rest dispel the heats of fever which are again returning to him

i declare to thee said don amador i am very well and this fever is
caused by suspense and not disease

thou must obey said the page while thou art sleeping i will
inquire for thee the fate of leila for it is yet wrapped in darkness
and it cannot be discovered but by great efforts

the cavalier obeyed the injunctions of his young jailer ate of the
confection and jacinto leaving the apartment he yielded to exhaustion
and drowsiness and notwithstanding his eager and tormenting curiosity
soon fell fast asleep




chapter xlix


gloom and fear still beset the garrison at the palace of axajacatl and
the mutiny of soldiers and fierce feuds among the cavaliers were added
to other circumstances of distress those ancient veterans who had
followed don hernan from the first day of invasion and who had shared
with him so many privations and perils were in general still true to
their oaths of obedience and preserved through all trials an apparent
if not a real composure of spirit as well as a firm reliance on the
wisdom of their leader but the followers of narvaez uninured to
combat and but lately acquainted with suffering their sanguine
expectations of conquest without danger and of wealth without labour
changed to a mere hope of disgraceful escape and that hope as they all
felt founded not in reason but imagination turned their murmurs
into the most bitter execrations and these again into menaces the
officers too rendered peevish by discontent and reckoning each the
discomfiture of his neighbour as the evidence of feebleness or fear
spoke to one another with sarcasms and even sometimes to don hernan
himself with disrespect the self-command of the general however never
deserted him he rebuked insult with tranquil indignation and so far
prevailed over his fiery subordinates as to compose most of their
quarrels without suffering them to be submitted to the ordeal of
honour one feud had arisen nevertheless which his skill could not
allay and all that he could effect by remonstrance and even
supplication was an agreement of the parties to postpone its final
arbitrement until such time as the providence of heaven should conduct
them afar from tenochtitlan the wrath engendered in the bosom of the
tonatiuh by the angry reproaches of de morla after their return from
the battle of the manta had been inflamed by a new circumstance which
though of a trivial nature the pride of alvarado and the resentment of
his opponent had converted into an affair of importance

there was among the many kinswomen of montezuma who shared his
captivity for the policy of the general had reduced nearly all the
royal blood to bonds a certain young maiden a daughter of the lord of
colhuacan and therefore a niece of the king who in the general
partition which the nobler of the cavaliers had in prospective made of
the indian princesses had fallen to the lot of alvarado in those days
of legitimacy there was some degree of divinity allowed to hedge the
person of even a barbaric monarch and happy was the hidalgo who by
obtaining a royal maid for his wife could rank himself in imaginary
dignity with the princes of christendom at the present moment the
companions of cortes had rather made their selections than endeavoured
to commend themselves to the favour of their mistresses dropping
thereby so much of their reverence for royalty as not to suppose the
existence of any will or opposition in the objects of their desire
the doña engracia her native title has entirely escaped the
historians was therefore beloved by don pedro but not having been
made acquainted with the hidalgo's flame she stooped at the first
promptings of affection to a destiny less brilliant and lofty her
heart melted at the handsome visage of the young fabueno and the
secretary flattered by the love of so noble a maiden and emboldened by
his success in arms did not scruple to become the rival of the
tonatiuh the rage of don pedro would have chastised in blood the
presumption of such a competitor but de morla remembering the novice
did not hesitate for his sake to befriend his servant and when he
avowed himself the champion of lorenzo he dreamed that he was about to
avenge the fall of his brother-in-arms

the result of this opposition to the humours of alvarado was a quarrel
so fierce and unappeasable that as has been said all which the
general could effect was a postponement of conflict and when don pedro
surrendered the princess to her plebeian lover it was with the
assurance that as soon as the army had left the city and lake he
should reckon her ransom out of the life-blood of his companion

the discovery of the unfaithfulness of his betrothed for in this
light did the cavaliers regard the captive princesses had been made
the preceding evening and the angry contest of the cavaliers and the
arrangements for combat occurred at the moment while don amador was
lamenting the backwardness of his friends to support him when he became
a captive

to allay the heart-burnings of his officers who had arrayed themselves
according to their friendships on either side the general caused his
trumpets to sound and bade all to prepare for an expedition of peril
he had all along eyed the great pyramid frowning over his fortress
with peculiar anxiety this was caused in part by his consciousness of
the advantage it would give his enemies as soon as they should dare to
profane its sanctity by making it the theatre of conflict this very
morning it was made apparent by the presence of many barbarians
thronging up its sides and by an occasional arrow or stone discharged
from its top that the mexicans were aware of its usefulness in
addition to this cause for attempting to gain possession of it the
leader was moved by a vague hope that once master of the holiest of
temples he might obtain the same advantages through the superstition
of his foes which he had lately possessed in the person of montezuma
through their reverence for the king he meditated an assault and
resolved to attempt it before the pyramid should be covered with
mexicans

the strength of the army both horse and foot was straightway displayed
upon the square and the war-worn christians once more marched against
the triumphing infidel

the knight of calavar sitting on his sable steed with an air of more
life than was ordinary appeared in this band and the three
serving-men with the secretary followed at his back




chapter l


in his sleep the wounded cavalier was no longer a captive memory and
imagination acting together bore him to the shores of the
mediterranean and as he trode the smooth beach his eye wandered with
transport to the blue alpujarras stretching dimly in the interior but
not long did he gaze on those mountains which intercepted the view of
his distant castle he stepped joyously along over the sands obeying
the voices and gestures of his conductors for it seemed to him that
his hands were grasped the one by the page jacinto the other by the
priestess of mexico both of whom urged him on with smiles while
pointing to a group of palm-trees under which reclined the long-lost
maid of almeria the cross of rubies shone upon her breast and her
downcast eyes regarded it with a gaze of sadness but ever and anon as
the cavalier vainly strove to approach and called to her with his
voice they were raised upon him in tears and the hand of leila was
uplifted with a melancholy gesture towards heaven with such a vision
repeated many times in his brain varied only by changes of place for
now the scene was transferred to the deserts of barbary now the fair
vales of rhodes and now the verdant borders of tezcuco he struggled
through many hours of torture and at last awoke as a peal of
thunder bursting on the scene drove terrified away as well his
guides as the maid of his memory

as he started from his couch confused and bewildered the thunder
seemed still to roll with distant murmurs over the city his practised
ear detected in these peals the explosions of artillery mingled with
volleys of musketry but for awhile in his disorder he was unable to
account for them and in a few moments they ceased night had succeeded
to day no taper burned on the table and scarcely enough light shone
through the narrow casement into the apartment to show him that he
occupied it alone

his lips were parched with thirst he strode to the table and finding
nothing thereon to allay the burnings of fever he called faintly on
jacinto no answer was made to the call he seemed to be the only tenant
of the house and yet he fancied that the deep silence which succeeded
his exclamation was broken by distant and feeble lamentations he
listened attentively the sounds were repeated but yet with so low a
tone that they would have escaped him entirely had not his senses been
sharpened by fever

obeying his instincts of benevolence rather than his reason for this
had not yet recovered from the disorder of slumber he stepped from the
chamber and following not so much the sounds which had become nearly
inaudible as a light that gleamed at a little distance he found
himself soon at the door of an apartment through the curtain of which
streamed the radiance

the image of leila surveying the cross of rubies had not yet departed
from his imagination when he pushed aside the flimsy arras and stood
in the room and his feelings of amazement and rapture of mingled joy
and terror may be imagined when he beheld at the first glance what
seemed the incarnation of his vision before a little stool which
supported a taper of some vegetable substance burning with odours and
smoke there knelt or seemed to kneel a maiden of exquisite beauty
whose moorish character might have been imagined in her face but not
detected in her garments for these were of spanish fashion the light
of the taper streamed full upon her visage from which it was not two
feet removed and showed it to be bathed in tears her eyes were fixed
upon some jewel held in her hands close to the light which was
attached by a chain of gold to her neck and the same look which
revealed to don amador the features of the maid of almeria showed him
in this jewel the well-known and never to be forgotten cross of rubies
the cavalier stood petrified a smothered ejaculation burst from his
lips and his gaze was fixed upon the vision as on a basilisk

at his sudden exclamation the maiden raised her eyes gazed at him an
instant as he stood trembling with awe and delight and the next
moment whether it was that she struck the light out with her hand or
whether the taper and the figure were alike spectral and snatched away
by the same enchantment which had brought them into existence the
chamber was left in darkness and the pageant of loveliness and sorrow
had vanished entirely away

no sooner had this unlooked for termination been presented than don
amador recovered his strength and with a cry of grief rushed towards
the spot so lately occupied by the vision the stool still stood on the
floor but no maiden knelt by it a faint gleam of dusky light shone
suddenly on the opposite wall and then as suddenly disappeared it had
not been lost to the cavalier he approached it his outstretched hands
struck upon a curtain hung before another door which admitted him into
a passage where a pleasant breeze burdened with many perfumes as from
a garden puffed on his cheeks the sound of steps echoing at the end
of the gallery and the gleaming of a light struck at once upon his
ears and eyes he rushed onwards with a loud cry gained the door
which he doubted not would again reveal to him the blessed vision and
the next moment found himself arrested by the zegri

behind abdalla stood the slave ayub bearing a torch whose light shone
equally on the indignant visage of the renegade moor and the troubled
aspect of his captive

hath the señor forgot that he made me a vow cried abdalla sternly
and that in this effort to escape he covers himself with dishonour

to this reproach don amador replied only by turning a bewildered and
stupified stare on his host and the zegri reading in this the evidence
of returning delirium relaxed the severity of his countenance and
spoke with a gentler voice

my lord does not well he said to leave his chamber while the fever
still burns him

he took the cavalier by the arm and don amador suffered himself to be
led to his apartment there seating himself on the couch he surveyed
the moor with a steadfast and yet disturbed look not at all regarding
the words of sympathy pronounced by his jailer at last rousing
himself and muttering a sort of prayer he said

are ye all enchanters or am i mad for either this thing is the
fabrication of lunacy or the illusion of unearthly art

of what does my lord speak said the moor mildly and soothingly he
should not think of dreams

dost thou say dreams cried the cavalier with a laugh surely mine
eyes are open and i see thee dost thou not profess thyself flesh and
blood

the moor regarded his captive with uneasiness thinking that his wits
had fled

my noble patron does not ask me of his countrymen and friends he
said willing to divert his prisoner's thoughts this day did i behold
his followers and in addition his kinsman the knight of calavar

at this name the neophyte became more composed he eyed the speaker
more attentively and now remarked that besides the leathern mail
which he wore in the manner of the mexicans his chest was defended by
an iron corslet which as well as the plumes of his tunic was spotted
with blood as the moor spoke don amador perceived him to lay upon the
table along with the torch which he had taken from ayub a sword dyed
with the same gory ornament and he started to his feet with a feeling
of fierce wrath which entirely dispelled his stupefaction when he
recognized in this his own vanished weapon

knave of a zegri he cried hast thou used my glave on spaniards my
friends and brothers

when i struck thee the blow which saved thy life said abdalla
calmly i was left without a weapon for the steel shivered upon thy
casque i borrowed the sword which to thee was useless and i return
it not dishonoured for it has drunk the blood of those who are in the
eyes of heaven idolaters and assassins i give it back to thee and
will not again use it even in a just and righteous combat for thanks
be to god it has been the means of providing me a store which i hope
to increase into an armoury

thou avowest this to me and with exultation said the cavalier
passing at once in the excitement of anger from the effects and even
the remembrance of the vision

if my lord will listen replied abdalla not unrejoiced at the change
and willing to confirm the sanity of the prisoner he shall hear what
good blows this rich and very excellent weapon hath this day struck a
better never smote infidel or christian

i will hear what thou hast to say said the novice with a stern
accent and wondering what direful calamity shall befall thee for
having thus profaned and befouled the sword of a christian soldier i
hope thou wilt tell me of such things as will prove to me that god has
punished the same if not upon thy head yet at least upon the heads
of divers of thy godless companions

there are many of the godless both heathen and christian who have
slept the sleep of death this day said abdalla knitting his brows
with the ardour of a soldier many shall die to-morrow some the next
day but few on the last for who shall remain to perish every day do i
look down from the pyramid and hearken to the groans of those who
destroyed granada and every day though the lamentings be wilder and
louder yet are they fewer heaven be thanked a few days more and not
a bone shall be left to whiten on the square that does not speak of
vengeance for the alpujarras

moor said the frowning spaniard have a care that thy ferocious and
very unnatural triumph do not cause me to forget that i am thy prisoner
it was perhaps proper that thou shouldst fly from don hernan seeing
that the slanders of very base caitiffs had prejudiced thee and left
thy life in jeopardy perhaps also the necessity to gain the favour of
mexicans for thyself and jacinto by fighting with them against their
foes may in part extenuate the sin of such impiety but i warn thee
thou leapest wantonly into superfluous crime when instead of mourning
thy cruel fate thou rejoicest over the blood thou art shedding

whose fault is it and who shall account for my crime said the zegri
with energy i came to these shores against my will when i landed upon
the sands of ulua my heart was in the peace of sorrow i besought those
who held me in unjust bondage to discharge me with my boy had they
done so then had i left them and no spaniard should have mourned for
his oppression the wrongs of granada had not been repaid in mexico my
prayers were met with mockery the zegri that hath sat in the seat of
kings was doomed to be the bearer of a match-stick and the boy whose
blood runs redder and purer than that in the veins of the proudest
cavalier of all was degraded into the service of a menial in the house
of the bitterest enemy of his people what was left for me to choose
between slavery and exile contempt and revenge the señor thinks that
the base yacub belied me yacub spoke the truth from the moment when i
perceived i could not escape from the land then did i know that god
had commissioned me to the work of revenge and i resolved it should be
mighty i meditated the flight i have accomplished the treason i have
committed the revenge i have obtained i saw that i should remain in
wo with benighted barbarians but i saw also that i should be afar
from spaniards god be thanked it was bitter to be parted for ever
from the land of my birth and the people of my love but it is goodly
and pleasant to see the castilian perish in misery and remember
granada

throughout the whole of this harangue don amador de leste preserved a
countenance of inflexible gravity

sir zegri said he with a sigh when it was concluded i perceive
that heaven hath erected a wall between us to keep us for ever asunder
whether thy bitter hatred of spaniards be just or not whether thy
appetite for revenge be allowable or accurst still is it apparent
that while thou indulgest the one and seekest to gratify the other it
is impossible i should remain with thee on any terms except those of
enmity and defiance for those whom thou hatest and dost so bloodily
destroy they are my countrymen i love thy boy but thee i detest and
now having discovered that thou art of very noble blood and being
impelled to punish on thee the very grievous and unpardonable wrongs
which thou art doing to my country i beg thou wilt release me from my
parole and fetch hither one of those swords which thou hast rifled from
spanish corses i arming myself with my own weapon here befouled with
spanish blood we will discharge upon each other the obligations we are
under thou to hate and slay spaniards and i to punish the haters and
slayers of the same for it is quite impossible i can live longer in
peace suffering thee to destroy my friends fetch hither therefore a
sword and let us end this quarrel with the life of one or the other
and to ease thee of any anxiety thou mayest have in regard to jacinto
i solemnly assure thee that if thou fall i will myself take thy
place and remain a father to him to the end of my days

as the cavalier made this extraordinary proposal abdalla surveyed him
first with surprise then with gloomy regret and when he had finished
with a glistening eye before don amador had yet done speaking the
zegri unbuckled his corslet and flinging it on the floor at the last
word said with mild and reproachful dignity 

behold thy sword is within reach and my breast is naked what hinders
that thou shouldst not strike me at once thou speakest of jacinto it
is enough that thy hand saved him from the blow of thy countryman at
that moment i said in my heart though i spoke it not thou hast
bought my life if thou wilt have it it is thine if thou hadst killed
my father i could not aim at thine

of a truth said the cavalier moodily i should not slay thee out of
mere anger but duty yet i would that thou mightest be prevailed upon
to assault me so as to enforce me into rage for i say to thee again
so long as thy hostile acts continue i must very violently abhor thee

they will not continue long said abdalla after a few days there
will remain in my bosom no feeling but gratitude and then my lord
shall see that the fury which has slain all others has been his own
security

of this said don amador i will have a word to speak with thee anon
at present i am desirous that thou shouldst relate to me the fate of
this day's battle which i am the more anxious to know since thou hast
spoken the name of calavar

i am loath to obey thee said the zegri struggling with the fierce
satisfaction that beset him at the thought for it may again excite
thee to anger

nevertheless i will listen to thy story with such composure as i can
as to a thing it may be needful for me to know after which i have
myself a matter of which it is quite essential i should acquaint thee

thus commanded the moor obeyed and his eyes sparkled as he conned
over in his mind the events of a day so dreadful to the spaniards




chapter li


yesterday when thou wert sleeping said the zegri or lay as one
that slept  

that day then muttered amador is a blank in my existence and
very grievous it is to think that so great a space of so short a
period as life should be lost in a stony lethargy it seems to me
that that blow thou gavest me was somewhat rounder than was
needful nevertheless i am not angry but grateful

yesterday was a day of comparative peace continued the zegri the
spaniards shut themselves in their citadel preparing for the greater
exploit of to-day it was evident to the dullest of the nobles that don
hernan had cast an evil eye on the temple

did he so cried the cavalier it was the thought of a good
christian and methinks my countrymen had not been judged with so many
of these present torments if they had sooner torn down that strong-hold
of the devil which is detestable in the eye of heaven

to-day they marched against it said abdalla with all their force
both of spaniards and tlascalans and i will say for them that they
marched well fought boldly and revenged their own heavy losses in the
blood of many barbarians as well on the pyramid as in the temple-yard
and the streets they came against us with four such turrets moving on
wheels  

is it possible cried amador that the general was not sufficiently
warned of the inefficacy of those engines by the doleful fate of the
manta that day when it was my mishap to be vanquished i shall
remember the death of the ship-master gomez to the end of my
life twice or thrice did i long to be with him among the
fire-worshippers who must be a very strange people but the mexicans
are very valiant

of a truth they are said the zegri i will not detain my lord with
the account of the battle in the streets wherein the mantas were again
in great part destroyed nor will i relate with what suffering the
castilians won their way to the wall of serpents and the temple-yard
it was here that i beheld my lord's kinsman the knight of calavar
unhorsed and in the hands of the infidel  

accursed assassin cried the neophyte springing to his feet and
hast thou kept me in bonds that my knight should perish thus without
succour

the foe of granada did not perish and he was not without succour
said the zegri loftily when his steed slipping on the polished
stones with which that yard is paved fell to the earth and many
savage hands were fastened on his body there was a friend hard by who
raised both the knight and charger and preserved them from
destruction

give me the name of that most noble friend cried don amador
ardently for i swear i will reckon this act to him in my
gratitude as the salvation of my own life tell me what true christian
was he

one said abdalla calmly who hated him as the slayer of his people
but remembered that he repented his evil acts with misery and
distraction one who abhorred him for these deeds of sin and yet
loved him because he was like his kinsman the protector of childhood
and feebleness

i doubt not that thou wert the man said the cavalier faltering
and therefore i return thee my thanks but i would have thee know
that whatever blood was improperly shed by my kinsman was shed by
accident and not design for no man is more incapable of cruelty than
the noble knight don gabriel but this shows me that thou art really
of lofty blood for none but a magnanimous soul can render justice to a
hated enemy

why should i dwell upon the conflict in the yard continued the moor
hastily through the flames of the many chapels that filled it with
shouts and the roar of muskets the christians ever victorious and
yet ever conquered even by victory rushed against the steps of the
pyramid disregarding the stones tumbled on them from the terraces the
darts flung down from the little barbicans or niches in the wall and
the flaming logs shot down endwise from the steps terrace after
terrace stair after stair were won and the christians stood at last
on the summit fighting hand to hand with the four thousand nobles who
defended it my lord cannot think that even these numbers of naked men
could long withstand a thousand christians robed in iron and
infuriated by desperation score after score were slain and tumbled
from the top the flames burst from the altar of mexitli the priest
died in the sanctuary the tlatoani at the downfallen urns and in an
hour's time the spaniards were masters of the pyramid

thanks be to heaven which fought with them cried amador devoutly
and thus may the infidel fall

does not my lord pity the wretches who die for their country said
the zegri reproachfully this is not a war of heaven against hell but
of tyranny against freedom i did see some sights this day upon the
pyramid which caused me to remember those noble roman generals who in
ancient times were wont to devote themselves to death for the good of
the state at the very moment when the condition of the mexicans was
most dreadful when despairing of the usefulness of longer resistance
they rushed frantically upon the spanish spears transfixing themselves
by their own act or flung themselves from the pyramid to be dashed to
pieces below at this moment i beheld with mine own eyes two very
young and noble tlatoani to whom i had myself just shown a means of
escape rush upon don hernan who fought very valiantly throughout the
day they cast away their arms flung themselves at his feet as if to
supplicate for mercy and having thus thrown the general off his guard
they seized him on a sudden in their arms and hurried him to the edge
of the terrace from that dizzy brink they strove to drag him willing
themselves to die dreadfully so that the great enemy of tenochtitlan
should fall with them but the strength of boys yielded to the iron
grasp of the christian and flinging them from him like drops of water
or gouts of blood from his wounded hand he beheld them fall miserably
to the earth dead but not yet avenged

thanks be to god again cried the cavalier warming with excitement
for though these youths met their death very bravely they were guilty
of a most vile treachery for which death was but a just punishment
and so my true and excellent friends did win this battle by heaven it
galls me to the marrow to think that i lie here idle while such things
are doing around me

they won the temple top said abdalla with a laugh of scorn that
they might look down from that height and behold themselves surrounded
by an hundred thousand men who were busy slaying their tlascalan
slaves and waiting for the masters very plainly did i hear their cries
of despair at that sight and these were goodly music for myself i
escaped as did some few others by dropping from terrace to terrace
upon the dead bodies which being tumbled in great numbers from the
top lay in some places in such heaps along the galleries as greatly
to lessen the dangers of a fall well were the mexicans revenged for
this slaughter continued the moor his eyes glittering with ferocious
transport when the spaniards descended to cut their way to the
quarters encumbered with captive priests and such provisions as they
had gathered in the chapels how many fell in the squares and streets
how many were suffocated in the canals how few were able to pierce
through the myriads that invested the palace for all this time had
there been thousands assailing the weak garrison and tearing down the
court-yard wall why should i speak of these it is enough that the
gain of the pyramid lost as soon as gained cost them irreparable wo
and that the wounded fugitives for the mexican glass drank of the blood
of all now lie in their desolate house their court-walls prostrate
the buttresses of their palace cracked by fire their steeds unfed and
starving their ammunition expended hopeless and helpless calling to
the leaders who cannot relieve the saints who will not hear and
waiting only for death death then for it cometh death for it is
inevitable death for it is just and death for it repays the wrongs
of granada

as the triumphing moor concluded his fiery oration the cavalier whose
excitement was raised to the last pitch and whose indignation and
remorse were alike kindled by a full knowledge of the condition of his
countrymen cried aloud 

hark thee sir moor with these friends thus reduced to extremity and
despairing it is needful i should straightway join myself to endure
what they endure to suffer as they suffer to die as they die i refuse
to save my life when the forfeit of it to an honourable purpose may
relieve them of their distresses i repent me of the gage which i gave
thee i revoke my promise of captivity and am therefore free to make
my escape which i hereby attempt peacefully if i can but warning
thee if thou oppose it shall be at the peril of thy life

so saying the cavalier snatched up the sword from the table and sprang
towards the door so quickly indeed did he act and so much did he
take his jailer by surprise that he had nearly arrived at the curtain
before abdalla had time to intercept him his brain was in a ferment of
passion and the various excitements of the evening had inflamed him
again into fever so that in the fury of the moment when the zegri
leaped before him endeavouring to catch him in his arms he forgot
every thing but his purpose and the necessity of escaping he caught
the moor by the throat and struggling violently raised the crimson
steel to strike the life of abdalla seemed not to have a moment's
purchase the weapon was already descending on his naked head
when at that very instant the curtain was drawn from the door and
dimly but yet beyond all shadow of doubt in the light of the torch
the cavalier beheld the pale visage of the maid of almeria shining over
the shoulders of the moor

the sword fell from his hand and his whole frame shook as with wild
eyes he returned the gaze of the vision the zegri amazed yet not
doubting that this sudden change was the mere revolution of delirium
took instant advantage of it snatched the leathern strap from the lute
of jacinto and when the curtain falling again had concealed the
spectral countenance the arms of the cavalier were bound tightly behind
him this was a superfluous caution his strength had been supplied by
fury and the instant that this had subsided the exhaustion of two
days illness returned and had not his spirits been otherwise unmanned
he would now have been as a boy in the hands of abdalla

the moor conducted him to the couch on which he suffered himself to be
placed without opposition and without speaking a word his whole
faculties seemed lost in a sudden and profound stupor and abdalla began
to fear that in his prisoner he had found in more respects than one
a true representative of his kinsman don gabriel




chapter lii


a certain degree of monotony prevails among all the vicissitudes of
life and even the most exciting events fail after a time to interest
a paucity of incidents will not much sooner disgust us with the pages of
history than the most abundant stores of plots and battles triumphs
and defeats if too liberally dispensed for these are composed of the
same elements and have on the whole the same wearisome identity of
character for this reason though the many battles fought in the
streets of mexico during the seven days which intervened betwixt the
second coming and the second departure of cortes have something in them
both of interest and novelty we have not dared to recount them in full
nor indeed to mention all of them being satisfied to touch only
such and in truth only such parts of such as in themselves have
each some peculiar variety of characteristic we pass by with a word
the increased sufferings of the christians their murmurs and
lamentations their despair and frenzy

the day that followed after the fatal victory of the pyramid brought
its battles like others that day it became apparent that the last fibre
which bound hope to the palace wall was about snapping it was known to
all that the indian monarch was expiring the prediction of botello had
made all acquainted with the day on which a retreat might be
accomplished that day was drawing nigh but the impatience of the
soldiers and the anxiety of the officers to prepare or at least to
reconnoitre the path of retreat again drove them from their quarters
a weak but well chosen and trusty garrison was left in charge of the
palace while don hernan with all the forces that could be spared of
his reduced army sallied from the court-yard and fought his way to the
dike of iztapalapan

in this exploit new difficulties were to be overcome and new proofs
were exhibited of the sagacity and determination of the barbarians
besides the obstacles offered by the ditches robbed of their bridges
the mexicans had heaped together across the streets the fragments of
their demolished houses thus forming barriers which were not passed
without the greatest labour and suffering nevertheless the spaniards
persevered and not only gained the causeway but approached nigh to
iztapalapan before a tlascalan messenger creeping in disguise through
the crowds of enemies recalled them to the palace which was furiously
assailed and in imminent danger of being carried by storm

it is not to be supposed that this attempt on the great dike and the
return were effected without the most bloody opposition the lake
suddenly swarmed with canoes full of fighting men and when don hernan
again turned his face towards tenochtitlan he beheld the causeway
covered with warriors who besides disputing his passage with
unappeasable rage broke as well as they could the bridges over the
sluices seven in number wherein were mingled the floods of chalco and
tezcuco his valour however or his good fortune prevailed and by
night-fall he reached the square of axajacatl and fell with renewed
fury upon the savages who still struggled with the garrison when he had
carved his way through them and had directed the exertions of his
united forces against the besiegers who still raved like wolves
around him he gave some thought to those companions whose fate it had
been to lay their bodies on the causeway or to take their rest with
such exequies as could be rendered in the lamentations of men expecting
each instant to share their fate under the salt bosom of tezcuco

it became known that among these unhappy victims was the knight of
calavar but how slain or where entombed no one could relate from
the day of the loss of his kinsman he had been reckoned by all
entirely insane he held communion with none not even his attendants
but casting aside his abstraction and resuming his armour he was
present in every conflict which ensued fighting with an ardour fury
and recklessness as astonishing as they were maniacal all that was
remembered of his fate this day was that when at the farthest part
of the causeway the trumpets were ordered to sound a retreat he was
seen without attendants for they were wedged fast in the melée
dashing onwards amid the dusky crowds that came rushing upon the front
from the suburbs of iztapalapan cortes had himself called to the
knight to return and not doubting that he would extricate himself
without aid had then given all his attention to the mexicans attacking
on the rear this was known it was known also that don gabriel had not
returned beyond this all was mystery and gloom




chapter liii


two hours after night-fall and while the spaniards were still engaged
in close battle with the besiegers who this night seemed as if their
rage was never to be appeased the cavalier don amador de leste rested
in his chamber the moorish boy sitting dejected at his feet now
starting up with cries of grief and impatience as the continued
explosions of artillery admonished him of the straits of his friends
and now as these seemed to die away and be followed by silence giving
his mind to other not less exciting thoughts and questioning the page
of the events of the past day

not now not now ask me not now replied the page with great
emotion to one of his demands for now can i think of naught but my
father it is not his custom to leave me so long by night even when the
battle continues heaven protect him for at any moment he may die and
what then am i in this land and among this people would to heaven we
had perished in spain nay in barbary in the sea along with our
friends for then might we have died together

give not way to this passion said the cavalier with an attempt at
consolation which drove not the gloom from his own countenance for
thou knowest that whatever evil may happen to abdalla i will myself
befriend thee

my father is slain cried jacinto wringing his hands or long since
would he have been with us

if this be the case said amador with grave benevolence and i will
not deny that abdalla doth keep his life in constant jeopardy it
plainly shows that i am bound to make a father's effort to protect
thee and thou to follow my counsels hark he exclaimed as a furious
cannonade seemingly of all the pieces shot off together brought its
roar and its tremor to his prison-house dost thou not hear how
ferocious is the combat at this moment know jacinto that every
explosion seems like a petard fastened to and bursting upon mine own
bosom so very great are the shock and pang of mind with which at such
time i bethink me of the condition of my countrymen much longer i
cannot endure my captivity i have resolved that it shall end even if
that be needful by the breach of my solemn vow for i am persuaded
the dishonour and compunction which must follow upon that will be but
light compared with the great ignominy of my present inactivity and
the unspeakable remorse which rends my vitals while submitting to it
but i can by no means escape while thou art left alone to be my jailer
if i escape by force of arms it shall be when thy father is here to
oppose me i counsel thee however as thinking with thee that abdalla
may be dead  

here jacinto burst into the most bitter lamentations

be not thus afflicted for i speak to thee only of a possibility which
may be feared and not of a certainty to be mourned what i mean is
that this possibility should be enough to release thee as well as
myself from this house for if abdalla be really deceased it must be
evident to thee nothing could be more foolish and even dangerous than
to remain in it alone seeing that if we be not found out and murdered
by the mexicans we must surely expect to be starved guided by the
sounds of battle we can easily find our way to the palace and perhaps
by wrapping ourselves in some of these cotton curtains we may make our
way through the herds of mexicans without notice as being mistaken for
some of their fellow-combatants once arrived within earshot of the
palace i have no fear but that we shall be very safe and i pledge my
vow to thee that i will so faithfully guard thee on the way that no
weapon shall strike thee that has not first pierced my own bosom

the page clasped his hands and regarded his master with looks in which
affection struggled with despair

but if my father should live oh if my father should live and
returning to this desolate house should find that his child has
deserted him

if he live said the cavalier then shall he know that thou hast
taken the only step to preserve him from destruction both temporal and
eternal i will not rest till i have procured for him a free pardon i
will hold thee as a hostage which in addition to the assurance of
forgiveness will speedily bring him into the garrison for knowing his
love to thee i know he cannot live without thee besides i will
obtain for i will demand it permission for him to return with thee to
spain and if my knight consent we will depart together for now i am
convinced that heaven doth fight against us even to upholding the
godless heathen let us therefore depart making our trust in god who
will cover us this night as with shields to protect our weakness

alas alas cried the boy faltering with grief and fear my lord is
sick and wounded feeble and helpless

that i have not all the vigour which a few days since was mine
said the cavalier snatching up his sword and brandishing it once or
twice in the air as if to make trial of his strength i cannot deny
nevertheless i am stronger than yesterday and besides while placing
great reliance on the protection of heaven i shall trust less to my
weapon than to such disguises as it may be in our power to adopt with
these figured curtains wrapped about us and if there be any feathers
about the house a bunch or two tied to our heads i have no doubt we
can delude the mexican fighting men and in the tumult of battle pass
through their ranks entirely unmolested

while the page hesitated and wept visibly struggling between his wishes
and his fears there occurred a sudden interruption in the cannonade
and in the dead silence that followed both heard the sound of rapid
footsteps approaching the door accompanied by smothered groans

the page started in an instant the steps were heard in the passage
followed by a heavy sound as of a man falling upon the floor

oh god my father my poor father cried jacinto springing to the
door

he was arrested by the arm of the neophyte who plainly distinguished
along with the groans that came from the passage a noise as if the
sufferer were struggling to his feet and in a moment after as he
pushed aside the curtain to go out himself the slave ayub covered
with blood rushed by him into the apartment and again fell prostrate

my father ayub my father cried the page kneeling at his side

allah il allah praised be god for now i am safe said the morisco
raising on his arm and though his whole frame shook as in the ague of
death regarding the pair with the greatest exultation i thought they
had shot me through the liver with a bullet but allah be praised twas
naught but an arrow help me up noble señor eh ay trim the taper a
little and give me a morsel of drink

thou sayest naught of my father ayub said jacinto eagerly and yet
with mortal fear for he knew by the gesture of don amador as he
ceased his unavailing attempt to lift the wounded man but more by the
countenance of ayub himself that he was a dying man

how can i speak without light cried the moor with a sort of chuckle
trim the torch trim the torch and let me see where these boltheads be
rankling praise be to allah for i thought myself a dead man

wilt thou not speak to me of my father exclaimed jacinto in agony

a brave night a brave night muttered ayub fumbling at his
garments valiant unbelievers praised be god the wali  

ay the wali the wali thy master cried jacinto his voice dwindling
to a hoarse and terrified whisper my father thy master ayub

the wali  hah exclaimed the unbeliever roused by the distant
explosions at it yet brave pagans roar cannon shout infidel
shout and whistle shout whistle and kill save me the wali save me
the wali

oh heaven ayub thou sayest nothing of him of my father

they took him a prisoner but we'll have him again lelilee
lelilee strike fast pagan a brave day for granada

at these words jacinto seemed not less like to die than the fugitive
but as he neither fell to the floor nor screamed don amador still held
fast to ayub who was now struggling in the most fearful convulsions
and yet strange to hear still uttering broken expressions of joy

a prisoner a prisoner a little drink for the sake of allah he
cried incoherently ha ha one runs not so far with a bullet in the
liver now they are at it now they are killing the great señores
now they murder em great joy a great sight for a moor
great great great revenge many days agone great great revenge
says the wali they killed my mother great revenge great great oho
great revenge for granada

with these accents on his lips mingled with sounds of laughter and
horrid contortions of countenance the infidel moor for such was
ayub sprang suddenly to his knees and flinging abroad his arms and
uttering a yell of agony fell back instantly upon the floor quivered a
moment and then lay a disfigured corse

dost thou see jacinto said don amador taking the shivering boy by
the arm ayub is dead and thy father a prisoner if thou wilt save the
life of abdalla the wali i never before knew that abdalla though
noble was of this dignity but this shall help me to plead for him
get thyself instantly in readiness and let us begone

the page turned a tearless countenance on his patron and replied with
a tranquillity that seemed to come from desperation 

i will go with my lord for i have no friend now but him i will go
with my lord to look upon my father's dead body for i know the
spaniards will not spare his life a moment i will go with my
lord and would that i had gone sooner for now it is too late

as jacinto pronounced these words he began to weep anew though
hearkening passively to the instructions of the cavalier

if thou canst find me any plumes said amador fetch them to me
straight and if thou hast about the house any mexican garment which
thou canst wear haste thou to don it as for myself i will first arm
and then robe me in the tunic of this poor dead misbeliever be of good
heart i charge thee god will protect us

there are robes enough both for my lord and me said the sobbing
boy and shrouds too it is too late but i can die with my lord

why that is spoken with more valour than i thought thou hadst said
the cavalier but bring me the robes without thinking of thy shrouds
and be very quick for i must have thee to buckle some of these straps
of my jambeux

the page took up a little taper that lay near the flambeau and
shuddering as he passed by the body instantly departed on his errand




chapter liv


when the boy returned bearing a bundle of garments and two or three
such crests as were worn by the nobler mexicans in time of war the
cavalier had more than half-armed himself he sighed as he flung the
habergeon over his shoulders to find the many rents made among the
flemish links by the mexican glass but he sighed more when he
discovered how greatly his bodily powers were enfeebled by feeling
almost for the first time in his life the oppressive weight of the
mail nevertheless the cannon still roared at the palace every moment
was expediting the doom of abdalla perhaps also that of his friends
and kinsman and he seized upon cuish and greave gauntlet and helm
with activity and eagerness

what is that huge mantle thou placest upon the table he demanded of
the page without relaxing in his efforts

a tilmatli or indian cloak large enough to hide my lord's armour
replied jacinto hurriedly if the mexicans should see the gleaming of
but a single link death on the spot or still more horrid on the
pyramid will be the fate of my lord

now that i know that such would be the consequence of captivity said
the cavalier fiercely i swear to god and st john i will die
fighting that is if it please heaven that i shall be struck no more
blows that overpower without killing

and this great penacho said the boy i will tie to my lord's crest
so that it shall entirely veil the helmet i have fastened some of the
red tufts among the feathers whereby the pagans may think my lord is a
war-chief and noble if they should see them

of all boys that i have ever yet seen thou art by far the shrewdest
and wisest said don amador with complacency but without ceasing a
moment to do on his armour what disguise hast thou provided for
thyself

a garment said jacinto which being flung about my body and hooded
over my head will cause the mexicans to think me a woman devoted to the
service of one of their gods

a most damnable delusion said the novice and i would thou hadst
fallen upon some other device but perhaps thou hadst no choice and
now that i think of it thy small stature and very smooth and handsome
visage will perhaps suit this disguise better than another if there
be any sin in assuming it heaven will allow the necessity and forgive
the commission quick and don it for i would have thee tighten these
greave-straps before i pull on my boots

it will but encumber me i will fling it over me in the passage said
jacinto kneeling and endeavouring with an unsteady hand to perform
the office required of him

be of good heart i charge thee and tremble not thou art unused to
this service but think not though thou beest the son of a moorish
wali of the noblest blood that this duty can dishonour thee i have
performed it myself times without number to my good knight don
gabriel i would thou wert somewhat stronger though fear not to pull
with all thy strength i have shrunk somewhat with the fever greatly
to the disparagement of my leg and the strap is of the stiffest

it is stiffened with my lord's blood said the page trembling more
but succeeding at last in securing it then rising and knotting a
broad and shadowy plume over his patron's helmet so as in a great
measure to conceal the gleaming iron he assisted to fasten it there
remained nothing then for the cavalier but to arrange the tilmatli
about his person a feat in which with the aid of the page he
succeeded so well as quite to hide his martial equipments without yet
depriving him of the power in case of necessity of using the sword
which he held naked in his hand

thy woman's weeds why dost thou hesitate jacinto he cried
prepared and now eager to make his departure thou thinkest of thy
lute by my faith i shall be loath thou shouldst lose it for much good
has it done and yet may do to don gabriel i will bear it under my
arm

think not of the lute said jacinto sorrowfully what need have we
now of music it will but overburden my lord whose hands should be
free and in mine it would only serve to expose the deception of my
apparel

cast it aside then and now in god's name let us depart

jacinto stepped faltering up to the body of ayub lying stiff and
cold the countenance illuminated by the slanting torch-light still
mingling a grin of exultation with the contortion of the death-agony a
tear dropped upon the swarthy cheek and a deep sob burst from the bosom
of jacinto when he gazed his last upon the dead morisco

why dost thou tarry to weep said amador impatiently ayub was an
infidel

my lord does not know how those who have not many friends can value
the few said the page this man was faithful to my father and
therefore do i lament him as one whose loss is a sore misfortune and
infidel though he were yet was he of the faith of my ancestors

remember however that while thou weepest over a dead friend of
abdalla thou deprivest him of the services of a living one

thus rebuked jacinto moved rapidly into the passage and flinging as
he went the garment he held about his person stepped with the cavalier
into the street

a thick scud threatening rain careered over the heaven and the smoke
of cannon mingling with the mists of the lake covered the city with a
gloom so deep that don amador could not easily distinguish the
peculiar habiliments of his companion nevertheless he could well
believe that his appearance was that of an indian maiden he bade
jacinto to take him by the hand adding an injunction under all
circumstances that might arise to maintain his grasp to this jacinto
answered 

let it not be so at least not until we are so environed as to be in
danger of separating my lord must now consent to be guided by me he
spoke with singular coolness as if restored by the urgency of the
occasion to all that self-command and discretion which had so often
excited the wonder of his patron i will walk a little before and if
the people should approach let my lord take no notice but follow
calmly in my steps as though he were a great noble disdaining to look
upon his inferiors be not amazed at what may happen and especially
do not speak a word until close by the spaniards

dost thou mean said the cavalier suddenly struck with the memory of
the vision not yet accounted for by the page dost thou mean to
practise any arts of magic for if so  

i beseech my lord not to speak said the boy with a hurried voice
for if a word be heard neither valour nor magic can save us from
destruction by-and-by my lord shall see the wisdom of this counsel
and all that is strange in its consequences shall be explained to him

thus speaking jacinto strode forwards and don amador wondering yet
yielding to his instructions followed in silence

the cannon still roared at the palace and the shouts of the infuriated
combatants were plainly heard in the intervals of the discharges so
that as the cavalier had hinted there could be no difficulty in
determining their path nevertheless it appeared to him that jacinto
walked forwards with the boldness and certainty of one familiar with the
streets he was treading

for a time their course lay through a street entirely deserted but
by-and-by passing into one of greater magnitude they beheld shadowy
masses now of single figures now of groups darting about many of
them with lights as if flying some from the scene of combat and
others like themselves approaching it it was apparent that this
street was one of the four great avenues leading to the square of
axajacatl for no sooner had the two christians stepped upon it than
the sounds of conflict came to them with tenfold loudness and they
could behold ever and anon as the deadly discharges burst from the
artillery the flames flashing luridly up through the mists like the
jets of a distant volcano

with the consciousness that he now trod a principal street don amador
became aware that he was of a certainty advancing full upon the mouth
of at least one piece of ordnance and as jacinto paused suddenly as
if dismayed at his peril for at that moment a ruddy flame shot out of
the mist and a falconet bellowed down the street he approached the
boy and said 

for thy sake jacinto it does not become me to say for my own
though i confess some repugnance to advance thus on the cannon of my
friends i should wish thou couldst find some other path not so much
exposed to be raked as this

speak not we have no choice muttered the boy but god be thanked
the bullet that strikes my lord will first pass through my own body

this little expression of devotion was pronounced with an earnestness
that touched the heart of the cavalier and he was about to utter his
satisfaction when a gesture of jacinto who immediately began to resume
his pace warned him into silence the usefulness of the caution was
soon made manifest for two or three mexicans suddenly brushed by
though without seeming to notice them an instant after there passed
several groups bearing wounded men in their arms and by-and-by while
every moment seemed to surround them yet more with isolated
individuals there came a party in some numbers uttering lamentations
as if over the body of a great noble several of these bore torches in
their hands wherewith they were enabled to descry the pair and don
amador's heart beat quick as he saw three or four detach themselves
from the group and run forwards as if to make sure of a prey he
grasped at his weapon invoked his saint and moved quickly up to
jacinto to give him what protection he could but at the very moment
when he feared the worst he was amazed to behold the barbarians come to
a dead halt and at the waving of jacinto's hand part from before him
with countenances of reverence and fear the same remarkable change was
observed in those who composed the party bearing the corse with the
addition of new marks of homage for leaving the body in the hands of a
few they seemed about to follow the page in a tumultuous procession
until he turned round waving his hand again at which gesture nearly
all immediately fell on their knees and so remained until he passed
all this time the wondering cavalier was conscious that he was himself
unregarded

little by little while the screams and cannon-shots grew louder at each
step don amador perceived that the groups began to grow into crowds
and then into dense masses every moment while every moment also it
became still more apparent that his guide exercised some powerful
though to him inscrutable influence over the mob for no sooner did
their torches reveal his figure than all were straightway seized with
admiration falling upon their knees or returning on their path and
following him towards the battle

the gestures of jacinto served no longer to repel them and in a few
moments there were hundreds of men their numbers increasing at each
step who pressed after him eagerly though reverentially uttering at
first low murmurs and then at last shouts of joy and triumph these
reaching the ears and drawing the attention of others in front they in
turn added their respect to the homage of the rest

however surprising and indeed confounding this notice and these
salutations to don amador they were far from agreeable for the train
followed so close upon his heels that he dreaded every moment lest
some derangement of his mantle or plumes might expose to their gaze the
hidden ensigns of a christian greatly was he rejoiced therefore when
the steady and persevering advance of the page had carried him so deeply
into the crowd that it was scarcely practicable for more than one or
two individuals at a time to look upon him and quite impossible that
the noisy train should follow he ceased therefore to lament his
proximity to the cannon-mouths which still at intervals flung death
among the besiegers for he thought that in that alone there was safety
his desire in this particular was soon gratified for he was at last
wedged with the page among a mass of men so dense and so disordered
that he no longer feared a scrutiny he was in sight of the palace his
foot planted upon the square and but a few paces separated from his
friends and his knight

in the flash of the arquebuses but more particularly in the fiendish
glare of the cannon when disemboguing their contents upon the
barbarians he beheld the terraces covered with his countrymen
resisting as they could and with every shot from the musket every bolt
from the arbalist adding a life to the reckoning of their revenge and
yet fainting with fatigue over a slaughter which had no end the square
was filled with men as with a sea and when the fiery flashes of the
ordnance lit it up as with a momentary conflagration the commotion
following upon each made him think of those surges of fire which roll
in the crater of a volcano and of the billows of blood that dash upon
the shores of hell a more infernal spectacle could not indeed have
been imagined and when the harsh yells of the pagan myriads were
added the tophet was complete and man appeared as he yet
appears the destroyer and the demoniac

this spectacle however horrible it might have been to one accustomed to
look upon man as the image of his maker and the blow struck at the life
of man as a stroke aimed at the face of god had the effect to stir the
blood of don amador de leste to such a degree that had he not been
checked by the cold hand and the deadly pale visage of his companion he
would have followed the impulse of his valour uncovered his weapon
and shouting a war-cry dashed at once upon the throat of the nearest
infidel the look of jacinto recalled him to his senses he made him a
signal to clutch upon his mantle and follow and then plunged again into
the gory crowd

the tempest both physical and mental which beset all that rout of
pagans reduced the intelligence of each to but two objects of
thought his enemy and himself not one turned to wonder or observe
when the strong shoulders strong from excitement of the cavalier
thrust him aside or the hard touch of an iron-cased elbow crushed into
his bosom nor perhaps was a look cast upon the effeminate figure
that seemed a girl at the back of this impetuous stranger thus then
unresisted and disregarded the cavalier made his way step by step
taking advantage of every moment when the barbarians gave way before an
explosion of artillery or a charge of the garrison hoping at each
effort to issue upon the open space betwixt the besiegers and the
besieged and at each arrested by a denser crowd speaking words of
encouragement to the horror-struck page for well he knew he might speak
without fear in such a din and feeling at each moment his strength
melting away like burning wax under the prolonged exertion he toiled
for his life for the life of the boy perhaps for the life of don
gabriel but human nature could not sustain the struggle much longer
despair came to his heart for he knew not how far he stood from the
palace wall and felt that he could labour no more his eye darkened as
he looked back to jacinto the boy was swooning where he stood

god be merciful to us both but at least thou shalt die in my arms
poor boy he muttered making one more effort and raising the page
from the earth god be merciful to us but especially to this child
for he is sinless and i fear me fatherless

at this moment a dreadful scream burst from the lips of all around the
novice and immediately he felt himself borne back by the barbarians as
they recoiled seemingly from a charge of cavalry the thought was
hope and hope again renewed his strength he planted his feet firmly on
the earth and with his elbow and shoulder dashed aside the fleeing
pagans pressed the senseless boy to his heart raised his voice in a
shout and the next moment stood free from the herd ten feet from the
muzzle of a cannon from which the mexicans had been recoiling his eye
travelled along the tube the magician botello stood on the broken wall
at its side and the linstock he held in his hand was descending to the
vent

for the love of god hold shouted the cavalier or you will kill
christian men

the match fell to the earth and the cavalier sprang forward but if his
voice had reached the ears of friends it had not escaped the organs of
foes a dozen savages forgetful of their fears sprang instantly
towards him endeavouring to lay hold upon him a back-handed blow of
his weapon loosed the grasp of the most daring and the hands of others
parted along with the flimsy disguise of jacinto he left this in their
grasp tottered forward and the next moment as the cannon belched
forth its death upon the pursuing herds stood in the court-yard of the
palace




chapter lv


as the cavalier sprang among his countrymen almost fainting with
exhaustion he loosened with as much discretion as dexterity the knot
of the tilmatli and dropped it to the earth so that he might not be
mistaken for a foe the sudden gleam of his armour and the sight of his
wan visage struck all those who had rushed against him with horror
among the foremost of all was the man-at-arms lazaro who no sooner
perceived that he had raised his trusty espada against what he doubted
not was the spectre of the novice than he fell upon his knees yelling
aloud

jesu maria my master my master's ghost with other such exclamations
of terror

at this moment the page revived in the arms of his patron but only to
add to the cry of lazaro a shriek so wild and heart-piercing that it
drove all other sounds from the ears of don amador the cavalier
observed the cause of this cry and again his eye lighted up with the
fires of passion a group of soldiers agitated by some tumult which
had no part in the conflict around stood against the palace wall under
a casement from which was projected a bundle of partisans round this
extempore gibbet was fixed a rope one end of which being pulled at by
those below the cavalier beheld shooting up above the heads of the
mass a human being to all appearance bound hand and foot and in the
blackened and horribly convulsed countenance of the sufferer he
perceived the features of abdalla the wali

with a bound that carried him at once into their midst and with a
rapidity that prevented opposition he rushed up to the wall and before
the morisco was elevated above his reach struck the halter with his
weapon the zegri fell to the earth the executioners looked upon the
visage of his bold preserver and being persuaded like lazaro that the
very ghastly apparition before them was nothing less than the ghost of
an hidalgo universally reckoned dead they recoiled in affright before
they had recovered from their confusion the culprit rose to his feet
glared a moment on the cavalier and then springing away was instantly
lost among the combatants a wild and exulting cry of moro moro
tlatoani moro rose among the barbarians and the spaniards knew that
their prey was beyond pursuit

santos santísimos holy mother of heaven grace upon all and amen if
thou beest a living creature speak or i will smite thee for a devil

these words came from the lips of alvarado who had himself commanded
the body of hangmen and who now though his teeth chattered with
terror advanced his rapier towards the bosom of his late companion as
he gazed and menaced don amador yielding at last to the consequences
of labours altogether above his enfeebled powers sunk swooning to the
earth and jacinto rushing from the crowd flung himself upon his body

viva praise god and let the cry go round for we have saved the noble
de leste shouted don pedro with a voice of joy raising the senseless
cavalier now shall ye hear from his own mouth ye caitiffs that have
belied me that i played not the foul companion viva i swear it
rejoices me to behold thee why thou little rascal traitor art thou
here too it was god's will thy vagabond father should purchase me my
brother for which reason i am not incensed he has escaped me one day
is as good as another for hanging how now my noble friend art thou
hurt beyond speaking god's lid but i would hug thee if thou didst not
look so dismal

all this time the neophyte surveyed the astounded visages around him
with a bewildered eye and doubtless his obtuse senses could not at
that moment of clamour detect the accents of don pedro

tetragrammaton did i not tell thee the truth cried the harsh voice
of botello

master dear master exclaimed lazaro as he embraced the knees of the
novice

thanks be to god the noble señor has escaped shouted the secretary

god be praised but would it had been yesterday for then might it have
been better for don gabriel

the name of his kinsman spoken by the well-known voice of baltasar
dispelled at once the dreamy trance of the cavalier

how fares my noble kinsman he cried

the head of baltasar fell on his breast and a loud groan came from his
fellow-servitor don amador looked to the tonatiuh and witnessed the
change from blithe joy to gloomy hesitation which instantly marked his
handsome aspect the face of fabueno darkened and the magician strode
away

clear for me if ye will not speak said the cavalier with sudden
sternness for there is no sight of wo i cannot now look upon

he grasped the arm of jacinto and pushing into the palace made his way
toward the chamber of the knight the hand of devastation had been upon
the walls of the passage beams and planks had been torn away to supply
the materials for the mantas and other martial engines and don amador
no longer knew the apartment of his kinsman a dim light and a low
sound of wailing came from a curtained door before the secretary and
the other attendants who followed could intercept him he stepped into
the room

the sight that awaited him instantly fastened his attention he was in
the chamber of montezuma and the captive monarch lay on the bed of
death around the low couch knelt his children and behind were the
princes of the empire gazing with looks of awe on the king in front
were several spanish cavaliers unhelmed and silent and cortes himself
bare-headed and kneeling gazed with a countenance of remorse on his
victim while the priest olmedo stood hard by vainly offering through
the medium of doña marina and the cavalier de morla the consolations
of religion

the king struggled in a kind of low delirium in the arms of a man of
singular and most barbarous appearance this was a mexican of gigantic
stature robed in a hooded mantle of black but the cowl had fallen from
his head and his hair many feet in length plaited and twisted with
thick cords fell like cables over his person and that of the dying
king this was the high-priest of mexico taken prisoner at the battle
of the temple

the countenance of montezuma was changed by suffering and the
death-throe and yet from their hollow depths his eyes shot forth
beams of extraordinary lustre as he struggled he muttered and his
broken exclamations being interpreted were found to be the lamentations
of a crushed spirit and a broken heart

bid the teuctli depart were some of the words which don amador
caught as rendered by the lips of marina before he came i was a king
in mexico but the son of the gods he went on with a hoarse and
rattling laugh shall find that there are gods in mexico who shall
devour the betrayer they roar in the heavens they thunder among the
mountains the continued peals of artillery shaking the fabric of
the palace mingled with his dreams and gave a colour to them they
speak under the earth and it trembles at their shouting ometeuctli
that dwelleth in the city of heaven tlaloc that swimmeth on the great
dark waters tonatricli and meztli the kings of day and night and
mictlanteuctli the ruler of hell all of them speak to their people
they look upon the strangers that destroy in their lands and they say
to me thou art the king and they shall perish wo wo wo he
continued with an abrupt transition to abasement and grief they look
upon me and laugh for i have no people in the face of all i was made
a slave and when they had spit upon me they struck me as they strike
the slave so struck my people come then thou that dwellest among
the rivers of night for among the rivers with those who die the death
of shame shall i inhabit did not mexico strike me and shout for joy
wo wo for my people have deserted me and in their eyes the king is
a slave

put thy lips to this emblem of salvation said the spanish priest
extending his crucifix eagerly curse thy false gods which are
devils acknowledge christ to be thy master and part not to dwell
among the rivers of hell which are of fire but in the seats of bliss
the heaven of the just and happy

i spit upon thy accursed image said the monarch rousing with
indignation into temporary sanity and endeavouring to suit the action
to the word i spit upon thy cross for it is the god of liars and
deceivers of robbers and murderers of betrayers and enslavers i curse
thy god and i spit upon him

all the spaniards present recoiled with horror at the impiety which was
too manifest in the act to need interpretation and some in the moment
half drew their swords as if to punish it by despatching the dying man
at once but they looked again on the king and knew that this sin was
the sin of madness

as they started back the person of de leste whom in their fixed
attention to montezuma none of them had yet perceived was brought into
the view of the monarch his glittering eye fell upon the penacho which
the cavalier had not yet thought to remove from his helmet and which
yet drooped with its badges of rank over his forehead a laugh that
had in it much of the simple exultation of childhood burst from the
king's lips and raising himself on the couch he pointed at the ruddy
symbols of distinction the cavaliers following the gesture with their
eyes beheld with great agitation their liberated companion and even
cortes himself started to his feet with an invocation to his saint
when his eye fell upon the apparition

the words of amador fear me not for i live though not lost were
unanswered for notwithstanding that many of the cavaliers immediately
seized upon his hands to express their joy they instantly cast their
regards again upon montezuma as not having the power to withdraw them
for a moment from him

say what they will muttered the king still eyeing the penacho with
delight i also am of the house of darts and in tlascala and
michoacan and among the otomies of the hills have i won me the tassels
of renown before i was a king i was a soldier so will i gather on me
the armour of a general and drive the teuctli from my kingdom ho
then what ho cuitlahuatzin and thou son of my brother
quauhtimotzin that are greater in war than the sons of my body get ye
forth your armies and sound the horns of battle call upon the gods
and smite on mexitli the terrible on painalton the swift call them
that they may see ye strike and behold your valour call them for
montezuma will fight at your side and they shall know that he is
valiant

the struggles of the king as he poured forth these wild exclamations
were like convulsions but suddenly and while the spaniards thought he
was about to expire in his fury the contortions passed from his
countenance his lips fell his eyes grew dim and his voice was turned
to a whisper of lamentation

i sold my people for the smile of the teuctli i bartered my crown for
the favour of the christian i gave up my fame for the bonds of a
stranger and now what am i i betrayed my children and what are they
let it not be written in the books of history blot the name of
montezuma from the list of kings let it not be taught to them that are
to follow tlaloc i come let it be forgotten

suddenly as he concluded and as if the fiend of the world of waters he
had invoked had clutched upon him he was seized with a dreadful
convulsion and as his limbs writhed about in the agony his eyes
dilating with each struggle were fixed with a stony and basilisk glare
upon those of cortes and thus his gaze fixed to the last on his
destroyer he expired

when the neophyte beheld the last quiver cease in the body and knew by
the loud wail of the mexicans that montezuma was no more he looked
round for don hernan but the general had stolen from the
apartment the visage of cortes revealed not the workings of his mind
but his heart spoke to his conscience and his soul recorded the
confession i have wronged thee pagan king but thy vengeance
cometh

don amador's arm was touched by his friend de morla

in the chamber of death said the cavalier sadly thou mightest best
hear of death but i cannot discourse to thee while minnapotzin is
mourning let us depart brother

don amador motioned to the page and followed his friend out of the
apartment




chapter lvi


on the following morning it was known to all the garrison that they
were at night to depart from tenochtitlan the joy however that
might have followed the announcement was brief for at the same moment
that the exhausted christians were roused from slumber and bidden to
prepare the warders sent down word from the turrets that their enemies
were again approaching the shrewdest of all could perceive no other
mode of retreat than by cutting their way through the besiegers and it
required but little consideration in the dullest to disclose the
manifold dangers of such an expedient they manned the walls and the
court-yard therefore with but little alacrity and awaited the
mexicans in sullen despair

but don hernan quick to perceive and resolute to employ the subtle
devices of another had not forgotten the words of botello when that
worthy counselled him to make such use of montezuma and his children as
had been made of the golden apples by hippomenes when contending in
the race with the daughter of schoeneus

the mexicans advanced as usual with whistling and shouts filling the
square with uproar and as usual the cannoniers stood to their pieces
and the tlascalans to their spears but before a dart had been yet
discharged those who looked down from the battlements beheld a funeral
procession issue from the court-yard

a bier constructed rudely of the handles of partisans but its rudeness
in a measure concealed by the rich robes of state flung over it was
borne on the shoulders of six native nobles all of them of high degree
in tenochtitlan it supported the body of the emperor which was covered
only by the tilmatli leaving the countenance exposed to view the royal
sandals were on his feet and the copilli with the three sceptres lay
upon his breast the pagan priest in his sable garment his face covered
by the cowl and his head bending so low that his hideous locks swept
the earth stepped upon the square chanting a low and mournful requiem
and the bearers stalking slowly and sorrowfully under their burden
followed after

the murmurs were hushed in the palace and the square so lately filled
with the savage shouts of the enemy became suddenly as silent as the
grave the monotonous accents of the priest were alone heard conveying
to the mexicans in the hymn that ushered a spirit into the presence of
the deities the knowledge of the death of their king

for awhile the barbarians stood in stupid awe but at last as the
train approached them and they perceived with their own eyes the
swarthy features of their monarch fixed in death they uttered a cry of
grief low indeed and rather a moan than a lament but which being
caught and continued by the voices of many thousand men was heard in
the remotest parts of the city they parted before the corse of one to
whom before the days of his degradation they had been accustomed to
look as to an incarnate divinity they fell upon their knees and bowed
their faces to the earth as he was carried through them and again the
spaniards beheld the impressive spectacle of a great multitude
prostrate in the dust as if in the act of adoration

when the bearers and the body were alike concealed from their view the
mexicans rose and turning towards the palace brandished their weapons
with fierce gestures and many exclamations of hatred against the
destroyers of their king for a moment cortes doubted if his expedient
had not served rather to increase than to divert the fury of his
opponents and he beckoned from his stand on the terrace to the
cannoniers to prepare their matches but an instant after he revoked
the command the mexicans were retiring a great army was suddenly
converted into a funeral train and thus they departed from the square
after the body of their ruler without striking a blow at the invader

this circumstance reassured the garrison and the prospect of speedy
release from intolerable suffering and from destruction wrought such a
change over all that visages emaciated by famine and haggard from
despair were lit up with smiles and songs and laughter re-echoed
through chambers which but the night before had resounded with
prayers groans and curses nothing was now thought of but the bread
and fruits of tlascala the mines and fandangos of cuba and many a
sedate and sullen veteran clapped his hands with a sudden joy as he
bethought him of the urchins sporting in the limpid estero or climbing
the palm that grew at his cabin door escape from the miseries which
had environed them and the privilege to discourse for life of the
marvels of tenochtitlan of the beauty of its valleys the magnificence
of its cities the wealth of its rulers the ferocious valour of its
citizens to wondering listeners were the only offsets thought of to
the many labours sufferings and risks of the campaign the little
property amassed by each the share of montezuma's presents and the
spoils stripped from the dead were stored along with such trifles as
might add the interest of locality to legends of battle in the sacks of
the soldiers all made their preparations and all made them in hope

the only melancholy men in the palace that day were cortes and don
amador de leste the latter remembered his knight falling ingloriously
and alone on the causeway and the general pondered over the griefs of
defeated ambition

but whatever were the pangs of don hernan he forgot not the duties of a
general besides other precautions he caused his carpenters to
construct a portable bridge of sufficient strength to support the weight
of his heaviest artillery and yet not so ponderous but that it might
be carried on the shoulders of some half a hundred strong men this he
provided fearing lest the barbarians had destroyed the bridges not only
of the great dike of iztapalapan but of that of tacuba on which it was
his determination to attempt his flight and which running westward
from the island was as has been intimated but two miles in length

in accordance with the advice of the necromancer the hour of departing
was put off until midnight a period of time which had the double
advantage of being recommended by botello and of ensuring the least
molestation each individual therefore made his preparations and
looked forward to that hour

the melancholy that oppressed the spirits of the neophyte was so great
that he betrayed little curiosity either to acquaint himself with the
events which had occurred during his captivity or even to inquire
further into the mysterious knowledge and acts of the page but however
indisposed to conversation he could not resist the attentions of de
morla from him he learned the imputation he had cast on the valour and
gratitude of alvarado a charge which the novice removed by
magnanimously confessing that his own indiscretion had carried him
beyond the reach of don pedro who should be in no wise held accountable
for his misfortune he heard with more interest and even smiled with
good-natured approbation at the story of fabueno's fortune but a frown
darkened on his visage when de morla pictured the anger and domineering
fury of the tonatiuh and this was not diminished when his friend
confessed himself the champion of the secretary announced that cortes
had sanctioned the quarrel and claimed of him the offices of a friend

if blood must be shed in this quarrel he said it must be apparent
to you my very noble and generous friend for surely your kindness
to lorenzo merits this distinction it must be apparent i say that i
am he who is called upon to shed it the youth is my own follower for
which reason i am bound to give him protection and support him in all
his just rights whereof one i think is to love any woman who may
think fit to give him her affections whether she be a princess or
peasant i must therefore after repeating to thee my thanks for thy
very distinguished generosity require thee to yield up thy right to do
battle with don pedro if battle must indeed be done though i have
hopes that his good sense will enforce him to surrender the maid
without the necessity of bloodshed

i cannot yield to thee hermano mio said de morla quickly for
there is deadly feud betwixt the tonatiuh and myself and were he to
fight thee a dozen times over still should he of a necessity measure
weapons with me

it doth not appear to me how this difference can call for more than
one combat and as i have told thee i think it can be composed
provided thou allowest me to assume thy place entirely without
conflict

know thou my friend said de morla that i have already in the
matter of thy fall and capture at the fight of the manta charged
alvarado with many terms of opprobrium and insult for which reason a
duello has become very inevitable

having already heard from myself said don amador with gravity that
don pedro cannot justly incur reproach for my mishap thou canst do
nothing else as a true cavalier but instantly withdraw thy charges
and make him the reparation of apology after which there will remain
no need of enmity

thou speakest the truth said de morla impetuously and i am but a
knave to have said or even thought except at the moment when i was
grieved and imbittered by thy supposed death that don pedro could
demean himself in any battle like a craven i freely avow and will
justly bear witness that he is a most unexceptionable cavalier so far
i am impelled to pronounce by simple veracity but yet is there mortal
though concealed feud betwixt us

the neophyte looked on his friend with surprise seeing which de morla
took him by the arm and said with great heat 

i have come to hear by an accident that don pedro did once tis now
many months ago in the wantonness of his merriment fling certain
aspersions upon the innocence of benita a crime that i could not have
forgiven even in thee amigo querido hadst thou been capable of such
baseness i now confess to thee without having divulged the same to any
one else that this circumstance did greatly inflame my anger and that
from that moment i have sought out some means to quarrel with alvarado
and so slay him without involving the fame of minnapotzin for it is
clear to me as it must be to any lover who doth truly reverence his
mistress that to associate her name with a quarrel would be at once to
darken it with the shadow of suspicion if i should say to alvarado
thou hast maligned my mistress thou cur and therefore i will fight
thee then should he for the credit of his honour aver that he spoke
the truth and whether he lived or died the maiden should still be the
sufferer i have therefore resolved that my cause of vengeance shall
be concealed and thou wilt see that the present pretext is the
honourable cloak i have been so long seeking this i confess to thee
but i adjure thee to keep my counsel

there was a degree of lofty delicacy and disinterestedness in this
revealment which chimed so harmoniously with the refined honour of don
amador that he grasped de morla's hand and instead of opposing
further remonstrance assured him both of his approval and his
determination to aid him as a true brother in arms in the conflict

but how comes it my friend he demanded with a faint smile thou
darest look so far into futurity for such employment hast thou forgot
the prophecy of botello methinks to be fulfilled at all the
consummation should come shortly for with this night we finish the
war in mexico

for a time señor mio said de morla though the griefs of montezuma
be over heaven rest his soul for he was the father of minnapotzin
the pangs of his race are not yet all written i will abide with don
hernan and if botello do not lie thou shalt yet see me sleep on the
pyramid

heaven forbid cried amador i would rather thou wouldst follow mine
own resolutions and for once show botello that he hath cast a wrong
figure

dost thou mean to desert us

my kinsman sleeps in the lake said the novice sadly the tie that
bound me to this fair new world is therefore broken in mine own heart
i have no desires to fight longer with these infidels who cannot
injure the faith of christ nor invade the churches of christendom the
turks are a better enemy for a true believer and if i put not up my
sword altogether it shall be drawn hereafter on them the little
page whom i have by a miracle recovered i will convey with me to
cuenza after having in like manner recovered his father a very
noble morisco or been otherwise assured of his death i would greatly
persuade thee having made the princess thy wife to follow with me to
thy native land my castle lies on morena's top  continued the
cavalier insensibly falling upon the melody of the knight and the page
and beginning to muse on the singer and to mutter surely jacinto is
the most wonderful of boys

my patrimony is worn out said de morla without regarding the sudden
revery of his friend and i give it to my younger brothers by peace or
war somehow or other this land of mexico will be one day conquered
and then a principality in anahuac will count full as nobly as a
sheep-hill in castile i abide by don hernan but let us be gone to the
treasury i hear the ingots chinking and thou hast not yet looked upon
our spoils

the exchequer thus alluded to and to which de morla speedily conducted
his friend was the sleeping apartment of the general of the wealth
that was there displayed the stores of golden vessels and of precious
stones as well as of ingots melted from the tribute-dust long since
wrung from the unhappy montezuma it needs not to speak the whole
treasury of an avaricious king a predecessor of the late captive
walled up in former days and discovered by a happy chance was there
displayed among the meaner gleanings of conquest an hundred men as don
amador entered were grasping at the glittering heaps while the voice
of don hernan was heard gravely saying 

the king's fifth here partitioned and committed to the trust of his
true officers we must defend with our lives but while granting to all
christian men in this army free permission to help themselves here as
they like i solemnly warn them of the consequences should we as
mayhap my fear may prove true be attacked this night while making our
way through the city the richest man shall thereby purchase the
quickest death the wise soldier will leave these baubles till we come
back again to reclaim them this night i will insure the life of none
who carries too rich a freight in his pockets

he spoke with a serious emphasis and some of the older veterans
raising their heads and eyeing his countenance steadfastly for a
moment flung down the riches they had grasped and silently retired
from the apartment but many others bore about their persons a prince's
ransom




chapter lvii


at midnight the mexican spy looking over the broken wall beheld in
the court-yard which it environed a scene of singular devotion or
rather he caught with his ears for the grave was not blacker than that
midnight the smothered accents of supplication the christians were
upon their knees listening with a silence broken only by the fretful
champing of steeds and the suppressed moans of wounded men to a
prayer pronounced in a whispering voice wherein the father olmedo
implored of heaven to regard them in pity to stupify the senses of
their enemies and surround his servants with the shields of mercy so
that this night they might walk out of the city which was their
prison-house and from the island which had been their charnel
oppressed no more by the weight of his anger

the prostrate soldiers to that moment full of confident hope and not
anticipating the danger of any opposition hearkened with solicitude to
the humble and earnest supplication and when the padre besought the
deity to endow their arms with strength and their hearts with courage
to sustain the toils and perhaps the perils of retreat they were
struck with a vague but racking fear the petition which was meant to
embolden deprived them of hope and they rose from their vain
devotions in unexpected horror

the gloom that invested the ruinous palace prevailed equally over the
pagan city no torch shone from the casements or house-tops no taper
flickered in the streets and the urns of fire on the neighbouring
pyramid the only light visible save now and then a ghastly gleam of
lightning bursting up from the south burned with a dull and sickened
glare as if neglected by their watchers a silence in character with
the obscurity reigned over the slumbering city and when at last the
steps of those who bore the ponderous bridge and the creaking of
artillery wheels were-heard ringing and rolling over the square the
sounds smote on the hearts of all like the tolling of distant funeral
bells

the plan of retreat determined after anxious deliberation and
carefully made known to all was adopted with readiness as these
footsteps and this rolling sound of wheels the only signals
made were heard each man knew his place and without delay assumed
it in little more than half an hour the whole train of invaders
christian principals and tlascalan abettors was in motion creeping
with the slow and stealthy pace of malefactors over the street that led
to the dike of tacuba few glances were sent back to the palace as
those dim sheets of lightning flashing up over the path they were
pursuing revealed obscurely ever and anon its broken and deserted
turrets its gloomy pile associated nothing but the memory of disaster
and grief fearful looks however were cast upon the dusky fabrics on
either side of the street as if the fugitives apprehended that each
creak of a wheel each clattering of horses hoofs or the rattling of
armour might draw the infidel from his slumbers and many an ear was
directed anxiously towards the van in fear lest the trumpet should at
last be sounded with the signal of enemies already drawn up a
thousand deep on the path they were treading but no sounds were heard
save those which denoted the continued progress of their own bands no
wakeful barbarian was seen lurking in the streets and hope again slowly
returned to the bosoms of the tremblers

before they had yet reached the borders of the island the night became
still more dark than at their outset for the lightning grew fainter at
each flash and finally sank beneath the horizon to continue its lurid
gambols among the depths of the south sea this was witnessed with
secret satisfaction for with these treacherous scintillations
departed the dread that many felt lest they should betray the march of
the army

it has been mentioned that the people of tenochtitlan had not only
covered the surface of the island with their dwellings but had extended
them on foundations of piles into the lake wherever the shallowness
of the water permitted this was especially the case in the
neighbourhood of the great dikes in which places not only single
houses but entire blocks deserving the name of suburbs were
constructed such a suburb jutted out for some distance along the
causeway of tacuba

the van of the army had already passed beyond the furthest of these
black and silent structures and yet no just cause existed to suppose
the retreat had been discovered though many men of sharper ears or
fainter hearts than their fellows had averred that they could at
times distinguish on the rear a dull sound as of men moving behind
them in heavy masses the wiser however were satisfied that no such
sounds could prevail even over the subdued noise of their own
footsteps but some of these bent their ears anxiously towards the
front as if afraid of danger in that quarter the reason of this was
not concealed all day sounds of lamentation had been heard coming from
the dike upon which they were now marching or from its neighbourhood
it was rumoured that the cemetery of the mexican kings lay on the hill
of chapoltepec under the huge and melancholy cypresses which
overshadow that green promontory and that there this day montezuma
had been laid among his ancestors a whole people had gone forth to
lament him and how many of the mourners might be now returning by the
causeway was a question which disturbed the reflections of all

but this apprehension was dispelled when the front of the army had
reached the first of the three ditches which intersected the dike of
tacuba its bridge was removed and gone and the deep water lay
tranquilly in the chasm the foe relying on this simple precaution had
left the dike to its solitude and the expedient for continuing the
imprisonment of the spaniards was the warrant of their security

a little breeze dashing occasionally drops of rain began to puff along
the lake as the bridge-bearers deposited their burden over the abyss
this was not the labour of a moment the heavy artillery which still
preceded the train of discomfited slayers like a troop of jackals in
the path of other destroyers required that the ponderous frame should
be adjusted with the greatest care while the carriers assisted by a
body of tlascalans who slipped into the ditch and swam to the opposite
side were busy with their work the long train of fugitives behind
halted and remained silent with expectation the rumbling of the wood
over the flags of the causeway the suppressed murmurs of the labourers
and now and then the dropping of some stone loosened by their feet
into the ditch added to the sighs of the breeze whispering faintly
over casque and spear were the only sounds that broke the dismal quiet
of the scene and there was something in these as well as in the
occurrence itself which caused many to think of the characteristics of
a funeral the mute and solemn expectation of the lookers-on the
smothered expressions of the few and the occasional rattle of clods
dropping by accident upon the coffin

the bridge was at last fixed and the loud clang of hoofs was heard
as cortes himself made trial of its strength the breath of those
behind came more freely when these sounds reached their ears and they
waited impatiently till the advance of those who preceded them should
give motion to their own ranks

the post of don amador de leste had been assigned at his own demand in
the vanguard which was a force consisting of twenty horsemen two
hundred foot and ten times that number of tlascalan warriors commanded
by sandoval the valiant and up to this moment he had ridden at that
leader's side without much thought of unhealed wounds and feebleness
willing and fully prepared to divide the danger and the honour of any
difficulty which might be presented but being now convinced by the
sign we have mentioned that is to say the removal of the original
bridge that no enemies lay in wait on the causeway he descended from
the back of fogoso giving the rein to lazaro and commanding him to
proceed onward with the party in this he was perhaps not so much
governed by a desire to escape the tedium of riding in company with the
ever taciturn sandoval as to be nearer to the forlorn boy jacinto who
had until this moment trudged along at his side some little curiosity
to witness the passage of the rout of fugitives had also its influence
for taking the page by the hand he led him to the edge of the bridge
where he could observe every thing without inconvenience and without
obstructing the course of others

the dike of tacuba was like that of iztapalapan of stone and so
broad that ten horsemen could easily ride on it abreast its base was
broad shelving and rugged and the summit was perhaps six feet above
the surface of the water

the thunder of the twenty horsemen as they rode over the bridge
interrupted the consolation which the neophyte was about to give to
jacinto who hanging closely to his patron's arm yet looked back
towards the city with many sobs for his exiled father in the gloomy
obscurity of the hour the cavaliers of the van as they passed seemed
rather like spectres than men in an instant of time they were hidden
from sight among the thick shadows in front not less phantom-like
appeared the two hundred foot stealing over the chasm and vanishing
like those who had preceded them then came the two thousand tlascalans
their broken and drooping plumes rustling over their dusky backs as
they strode onwards with steps quickened but almost noiseless

after these came the cannon eighteen pieces of different sizes
dragged by rows of pagans commanded by the gunners the bridge groaned
under their weight and a murmur of joy crept over the compacted
multitude behind when they had counted them one by one rumbling over
the sonorous wood and knew that the last had crossed in safety

much time was necessarily occupied in the passage of these cumbrous
instruments and an interval of several minutes was allowed to intervene
betwixt the passage of each while the cannoniers were looking to the
condition of the bridge and the ropes

it was on these occasions that the greatest quiet prevailed for then
even breath was hushed in suspense and it was on these occasions also
that the ears of the neophyte were struck by a sound which had not
perhaps at that time attracted the attention of any other person the
breeze which occasionally whispered on his cheek was so light as
scarcely to disturb the serenity of the lake and yet it appeared to
him notwithstanding all this that in these moments of calm he could
plainly distinguish upon either hand and at a little distance the
rippling of water as if agitated by a moderate wind he strained his
eyes endeavouring to pierce the gloom and unravel the cause of this
singular commotion but wholly in vain the circle of vision was
circumscribed into the narrowest bounds and wo betide the infidel who
fishing in the lake that night should fall from his canoe in slumber
and be parted from it but twenty feet in his confusion the cavalier
looked up to the heavens but the few drops discharged from their stony
vault pattered with a sound almost inaudible upon the water while he
was yet wondering he heard the voice of one passing him say to a
comrade 

art thou not wroth iago man to give up yonder rich town to the
kites and this fair water to the ducks of mexico

this trivial question gave at once a new colour to his thoughts for
he remembered what millions of wild fowl brooded every night on the
lakes and almost ashamed that he should have yielded a moment to the
suggestions of fear he turned once more to watch the progress of the
army

the centre division consisted of but an hundred christian footmen and
half a score cavaliers but two thousand tlascalans were added to it
and it was commanded by cortes in person who having ridden across the
bridge as has been said to prove its strength now waited for the
coming of his party beyond the breach along with this division were
conducted the prisoners and the king's spoil the latter being carried
on the backs of wounded steeds unfit for other service as well as on
the shoulders of tlamémé the prisoners comprising all the family of
montezuma whom evil fortune had thrown into the hands of don hernan
were environed by the hereditary foes of their race but protected from
any secret stroke of malice by three or four cavaliers who rode with
them

among these few horsemen the neophyte perceived one across whose
saddle-bow there sat what seemed a female enveloped in thick mantles
in this cavalier he thought by the murmur of the voice with which he
addressed his muffled companion that he detected his friend the señor
de morla

is it thou francisco my brother he whispered inclining towards the
cavalier and hast thou benita thus under thy protection

i thank heaven yes replied de morla but what doest thou on foot
and so far removed from the van has fogoso cast thee again i prythee
walk thou by me a little dost thou remember thy promise

surely i do but speak not of it now for this moment my heart is
very heavy and i cannot think with pleasure of a contest with christian
man i will presently follow thee

speak me not what i have told thee to mortal man for the sake of her
whom i hold in my arms and who already owes thee a life to-morrow he
continued exultingly as he passed to-morrow we shall tread upon the
lake side and then god be with him who strikes for the honour and
innocence of woman

art thou there too lorenzo said the novice perceiving the
secretary riding at the heels of the young cavalier of cuenza and
burthened in like manner with the freight of affection guard thy
princess well and have great care of the bridge and the rough edge of
the dike for thy horsemanship is not yet so perfect as de morla's nor
can thy charger at all compare with the chestnut gelding ride on with
care and god be thy speed

the centre of the army was at last over the bridge the neophyte cast
his eye to the black mass of the rear-guard which contained the greater
part of the troops both christian and allied commanded by velasquez de
leon and the tonatiuh the latter of whom to show his affection for the
island of which he had been as he said a king and to prove his
contempt for his late subjects chose to ride the very last man in the
army while de leon conducted the front of the division the latter
stern decided and self-willed in all cases deferred for a moment to
give the signal to march in order that the centre might be well cleared
of the bridge but more perhaps from a natural love of tyranny to
torture with delay the spirits of his impatient followers

in this moment of quiet the sounds which don amador had forgotten
were repeated with more distinctness than at first but still they were
of so vague a character that he could not be certain they were produced
by any cause more important than the diving and flapping of water-fowl
nevertheless feeling a little uneasiness he clasped the hand of
jacinto tighter in his own and strode with him over the bridge he
paused again when he had crossed and was about to give his whole
attention to the mysterious sounds when suddenly he was amazed and
startled by the spectre of a man rising up as from the lake and
springing on the causeway close by his side

he drew his sword demanding quickly but with perturbation 

who and what art thou that comest thus from the depths of the waters

tetragrammaton peace dost thou not hear

hear what sir conjurer hast thou been listening likewise to the wild
fowl by my troth i thought thou wert a spirit

wild fowl muttered botello with a horse-laugh such wild fowl as
eat carrion and flap the water like crocodiles hah dost thou not
hear lay thine ear upon the causeway at the water's edge but thou hast
not time get thee to thy horse and delay not and if thou seest
cortes or any other discreet cavalier bid him draw and be ready i
said that some should escape but not all god be with thee follow
quickly and sheath not thy sword

surely this time thou art mad botello here are no foes

but the remonstrance of the cavalier was cut short by the instant flight
of the magician and ere the words were out of his mouth a horseman
crossing the bridge and riding up to him said sternly 

who art thou sir knave and sir witless that babblest thus aloud in
time of peril contrary to  

i am thy very good friend señor de leon said the novice abruptly
and waiving any difficulty which might spring from the heat of thy
words if duly considered i think fit to assure thee that i have but
just parted from the necromancer botello by whom i am advised to bid
thee as well as all other discreet officers whom i may see to draw
sword and remain in readiness for a foe there being certain sounds on
the water which in his opinion are ominous of evil for myself i bid
god guard thee meaning in person to join the van as soon as
possible

the cavaliers parted de leon riding back to his party without
uttering a word and don amador with the page stepping forwards so
fleetly as soon to find himself among the tlascalans of the centre
through these he made his way ever and anon casting his eye to the
lake and looking for the tokens of a foe but without perceiving
anything at all unusual he gained the midst of this band of allies
reached the side of his friend and laid his hand on de morla's arm a
low wailing voice came from the folds of the garments which veiled the
countenance of minnapotzin and some strong agitation shook the frame of
his friend

think not of love now my brother cried the neophyte hurriedly
but be warned that thou art in danger and minnapotzin with thee it is
thought that enemies are at hand

having thus spoken and without waiting for an answer don amador still
urging jacinto along endeavoured to make his way through the dense
bodies of tlascalans which separated him from don hernan he reached
their front he stepped upon the little space left between them and the
general and placed his eyes upon cortes but before he had yet spoken
it seemed as if the whole moving mass of the army had been converted
into marble on the causeway for instantly as if with one consent the
train came to a dead halt and a cry low but breathed from the hearts
of men struck with mortal dread rose from the van to the rear in one
universal groan

the cavalier turned where all eyes were turned and beheld a sudden
pyramid of fire like one of the many gushes of flame he had already
seen in this volcanic land save that the blaze was steadier shoot up
from a vast height in the air over the distant city and plunge its
sanguine point against the heavens while at the same moment its lurid
mass reflected and reversed on the lake darted over the water to his
feet in a path of blood as if mexitli the terrible god had at
last roused from slumber and couched his gigantic spear against the
slayers of his children the blaze illumined the lake far round and
shining on the casques of cavaliers and the plumes of tlascalans
disclosed the whole line of the army stretched along the calzada in an
instant more the neophyte petrified with awe perceived that this
mighty bale-fire was kindled on the top of the great temple and in the
strong and glaring line which it struck out upon the water there was
revealed a mass of living objects floating like birds upon the
element yet speckled with the human colours of mexico at the same
moment and while his eye yet wavered between the flaming pillar and the
moving objects on the water there came from the pyramid a sound heard
once before and never more to be forgotten the horn of the gods was
winded the doleful and dismal note came booming with hideous uproar
over the waters and before the hills had caught up its echoes the
whole lake right and left in front and on the rear rang roared and
trembled under the yells of an hundred thousand infidels




chapter lviii


the situation of the spaniards at that moment though sufficiently
frightful to every one was yet known in all its horrors only to the
leaders of the van as hope is ever independent of judgment ever
unreasonable and unreflective the absence of the bridge at the first
sluice was not enough to persuade the fugitives that the passage of
the second might be equally interrupted but at the moment when the
signal-fire was kindled on the temple sandoval had already reached this
ditch and perceived that its bridge was also demolished and as it
seemed very recently too for there yet remained a huge timber lying
across the chasm left as he feared rather as some decoy and trap
than as was more probable deserted suddenly by workmen scared from
their labours by the approach of the spaniards

the three ditches divided the dike into four portions of as many
furlongs in extent on the second of these portions was concentrated the
whole retreating army its front resting upon a sluice of great depth
passable by footmen for the great beam was soon discovered to be
sound but not by the horse and artillery without the portable bridge
which yet rested over the first breach this second obstacle being
overcome it was apparent that a third would still remain to be
surmounted and the passage of both was to be effected in the presence
and in the midst of a great enemy

as we have said the beacon-light shooting up from the pyramid and
continuing to burn with intensity brought light where all before was
darkness and revealed such innumerable fleets of canoes hovering on
both flanks as the novice had not seen even on that day when he first
trode upon a dike of mexico but the spirit that then slumbered was now
awake and as the rowers responded with their wild cries to the roar
of the sacred trumpet they struck the water furiously with their
paddles until the whole lake seemed to boil up with a spray of fire
and thus they rushed madly against the causeway

the novice cast his eye upon the general the ruddy glare of the beacon
could not change the deadly pallor that covered his cheeks but
nevertheless with this ghastly countenance turned to the foe he cried
out cheerily or at least firmly to those immediately in advance 

who ho cannoniers your quoins and handspikes your horns and matches
and show me your throats to the lake-rats then raising his voice to
its trumpet-tones he continued as if giving counsel and command to
all be bold and fearless and strike for the honour of god brave
christians soho de leon valiant brother and thou alvarado
matchless cavalier raise me the bridge and be quick for here we need
it

the voices of other officers were heard faintly mingled with the din
but not long every moment the shouts of the mexicans continued without
intermission became louder and their canoes were plunging nearer to
the causeway

a pang rent the bosom of don amador

i must get me to my companions he cried to jacinto and what can i
do for thee this night young page that i love

i will follow thee said the page tremulously i will die with my
lord

would that i had thee but upon the back of fogoso for methinks that
even de morla should not strike more truly for minnapotzin than would i
this night for thee

where goest thou de leste cried cortes as the novice pushed by
pause thou art best among the cannoniers

a dreadful yell at that moment drowned the general's voice but one
still more dreadful was heard when as the pagans drew breath to repeat
the cry the christians in front heard the rear-guard exclaiming with
loud and bitter shrieks the bridge the bridge it is fast and
immoveable the weight of the horses and artillery had sunk it deep
into the chasm and no human strength could stir it from its foundation

these words and sights were all the occurrences of a moment there was
neither time for observation nor lamentation the infidels on the water
rushed to the attack with the same fury which had so often driven them
upon the spears of the garrison and not less by their cries than their
apparent numbers it was made obvious that the whole strength of the
great city was gathered together for this undertaking for those who had
caught a little of their language could distinguish the different
quarters of the island encouraging each other with cries of ho
tlatelolco shall majotla strike first at the foe alzacualco on for
tecpan is swift and mirthful on ho for mexitli is speaking on for
our gods are on the temple and they hunger for the teuctli the line
of the army was full half a mile in length but as far as it stretched
and further than the eye could penetrate beyond either extremity a
triple row of canoes on each side of the causeway was seen closing
upon it with the speed and fury of breakers dashing against a stranded
ship

now cannoniers cried don hernan elevating his voice above the
tumult when the rushing masses were within but a few paces of the
causey now to your linstocks and touch in the name of god

the damp gunpowder sparkled and hissed on the vents but did not fail
the christians in their need the roar of the volley was like the peal
of an earthquake and right and left as eighteen horizontal columns of
fire darted from the engines the lake boiled up with a new fury
fragments of canoes and the bodies of men were seen flung up into the
air and yells of agony which chilled the blood bore witness to the
dreadfulness of the slaughter

quick and again cried don hernan eagerly shoot fast and shoot
well and know that i will shortly be back with ye ho sandoval why
dost thou loiter plunge into the ditch and swim rest where thou art
de leste for thou art too weak for battle give thine aid to the
cannoniers

the confused and huddled tlascalans who formed the rear of sandoval's
party shouted at the cry of the teuctli and made way for him a
cavalier bearing a burthen in his arms spurred after with a mad
impetuosity which rendered him regardless of the many naked wretches he
trampled to the earth it was de morla the example thus set by the
apparent flight of the two hidalgos was followed by others and the
allies were broken by the hoofs of christians while still enduring the
arrows that came like a driving rain from the lake

meanwhile it was evident though the cannon recharged and shot off
again with extraordinary quickness served to keep the part of the
causeway where they stood free from assailants that they had effected a
landing perhaps both in front and rear certainly on the
latter where they were already engaged hand to hand with the
spaniards the thunder of the explosions did not conceal from the novice
the shrieks of his countrymen his blood boiled with fury

come with me jacinto he cried we will reach fogoso and then i can
do my duty to my friends and smite these accursed murderers without
deserting thee

he dragged the trembling page after him he darted among the cannoniers
and passed the artillery he reached the tlascalans who followed the
van but havoc was already among their ranks as he gained them he
perceived the shelving sides of the causeway lined with canoes from
which were springing up like locusts a cloud of mexicans brandishing
their glassy maces and rushing with the yells of wolves upon their
ancient foes barbarians were mingled with barbarians in one hideous
mass of slaughter impassable and impenetrable

his heart sunk within him i have prejudiced thy life as well as my
own this night he said would that i had never left the back of
fogoso

before he had yet time to resolve whether to return to the cannoniers
or to make one more effort to pierce the bloody mass he was descried by
the crew of a piragua which that moment was urged upon the dike with
such violence that it was split in twain by the shock the eager
warriors rushed up the ascent with a shriek of exultation and
brandished their spears the neophyte retreated but neither the
rapidity of his steps nor the keenness of his blows would perhaps
have availed against their numbers enfeebled as he was and trammelled
by the grasp of the affrighted jacinto had not a party of spanish
footmen flying from the rear come that moment to his aid these
though they forced the barbarians to give way were in their turn
driven back upon the cannon and don amador was fain to follow them

the audacity of the foe seemed still to increase rather than diminish
and twice or thrice efforts were made by certain valiant madmen among
them to spring to land immediately in the mouths of the cannon these
were instantly speared by the many desperate spaniards who flying from
their posts in the rear which were now known to be in extremity took
refuge among the artillery as the only place of safety and there
fought with better resolution

in the meanwhile the efforts of the enemy still remaining unabated the
prisoners and many of the rear-guard pressing wildly forward and don
hernan and most of the officers having fled to the front from which
they had not returned the gunners were themselves seized with a panic
and without regarding the death on which they were thus rushing began
to leave their pieces and fly the representations of don amador served
to arrest some of them and other soldiers taking their places at the
guns they yielded passively to his instructions and he found himself
at once in the post of a commander

the many bitter reflections that harrowed his own bosom he spoke not
and sharply he reprimanded others who were yielding to despair
whatever might be the difficulty of advancing he felt that such a
measure was become indispensable as promising the only hope of
salvation for every instant the clamours increased on the rear as if
there the barbarians had attacked in the greatest numbers and were
approaching nearer to the cannon flushed with slaughter and victory he
instructed the gunners in what manner they should rush forwards with
their charged pieces pointed obliquely so as to sweep the sides of the
dike shoot them off when arrested by too determined a front of
resistance and loading quickly take advantage of the confusion
following each discharge so as to gain as much ground as possible
while still manfully fighting he hoped thus besides succouring the
tlascalans in front and giving room for the rear-guard to follow to
reach the second ditch where as he had heard the beam still gave
passage to the footmen but where his most sanguine wishes could point
him out no other hope than to stand by the cannon till relieved or
abandon them and fly as it seemed to him all had done who had
already crossed the breach

he animated the gunners with his voice and with his actions and so
great was the effect of the discharges on the indians landing that the
artillerymen were able to rush forwards perhaps a score yards after
each volley thus convincing all of the wisdom of the measure and the
probability of escape

two circumstances however greatly diminished the exultation which the
cavalier would have otherwise felt at the success of his stratagem
though the tlascalans in front ever responded to the shouts of his
gunners and though each discharge seemed to bring him nearer to them
yet ever when a volley was preceded by the loud viva meant to
encourage the allies the answer seemed to come from the same distance
and the mass of feathered warriors lit up by the discharge disclosed
the bodies of none but frowning mexicans the other circumstance was
still more appalling the space behind left vacant by his advance was
occupied no longer by foot or horse by treasure-bearer or prisoner by
spanish musketeer or tlascalan spearman a few dusky groups could be
seen running to and fro behind but yet they seemed rather to rush
backwards than to follow after

god save the rear-guard he muttered for it is surely
surrounded on brave cannoniers cortes shall not be ignorant of your
deeds this night and don carlos the emperor shall know of your fame

the shout with which the cannoniers again poured forth the deadly
volley was repeated with victorious energy when the mexicans
scattered by the discharge or leaping to avoid it into the water
parted away from before them and they found themselves suddenly upon
the brink of the second ditch the great beam lay in its place but the
dark water in the chasm was filled and agitated by the bodies of men
wounded and suffocating the white tunic of the mexican was confounded
with the plume of a christian cavalier the red arm of an
infidel tlascalan or foeman shook by the side of a castilian spear
the white visages of dead men rolled on the necks of drowning horses
bales of rich cotton stuffs lances dancing up and down like the leaded
bulrushes of children armour of escaupil garments and bodies of
dying and dead were floating together in such horrible confusion that
the water seemed to heave and bubble as with a living corruption

the sight of the ditch and the beam clear of enemies fired the
cannoniers with new hopes and in the frenzy of their joy they would
instantly have dropped their fuses and handspikes and taken to flight
had it not been that don amador flung himself upon the beam and
striking the first man dead commanded them still to stand to their
pieces

base caitiffs are ye all he cried who thus having the victory and
the lives of half the army in your hands should so desert your posts
in the midst of triumph wheel round half your pieces and sweep the
causey sides behind for i hear the coming of friends would ye give up
your pieces to infidels they are your safety

the reproof of the cavalier the sight of their dead comrade and the
sword which had punished him still commanding the narrow pathway the
voices of christians behind but more than all the manifest truth of
the declaration that their safety depended on their remaining by the
artillery turned the gunners at once from their purpose and their
resolution received a new confirmation when a christian voice was heard
shouting in the front as if of some cavalier heading a band of
returning friends and when the next moment a spanish soldier was
seen to run towards them leap on the beam and then spring from it to
the causeway

santiago and shoot on cried the overjoyed gunners for cortes is
coming

what ho knave lazaro cried the novice as the blaze of the
discharge showed him in the new comer the countenance of his henchman
where goest thou wherefore hast thou left the horses and where is don
hernan

master dear master is it thou cried lazaro with such a shout of
joy as drowned even the yells of death about him quick for the love
of god over the beam with all these varlets for life for life for
don hernan is fled and all the cavaliers

peace thou villain heed not this trembling fool exclaimed amador
quickly you hear the last ditch is bridged and free and ye can at
any moment reach the firm land as the cavaliers have done give me
another volley or two for god for the honour of spain and for your
friends who are fast approaching we will march together with the
whole rear to ensure safety quick see ye not how yonder fiends are
rushing into your muzzles viva a bold shot for st james and our
people

the cavalier turned to lazaro he was bleeding and he cast a look of
despair on his master

why art thou idle thou wert bred to the linstock sirrah show thyself
a christian man and true hark hearest thou not tis the shout of de
leon bravely bold hearts the rear-guard is nigh hah halon halon
don pedro

tis the voice of the secretary cried lazaro and god help me but
he cries for succour

ho señor señor don amador for the love of christ the wild shout
of fabueno for the neophyte could no longer doubt it was he was
suddenly interrupted the shrill shriek of a woman succeeded and then
every thing was lost in a hurricane of yells so intermingled that no
one could say whether they came from christians or pagans

stay drop thy match hold me this boy as thou holdest thy life and
suffer none to pass the beam  

for the sake of the cross thou adorest the maiden thou lovest cried
the terrified boy clinging to the cavalier leave me not oh leave me
not in this horror to die alone the mexicans will kill me for i have
now no gown of a priestess to protect me  

notwithstanding the boiling excitement of the novice these last words
filled his brain with strange thoughts but still so confused that they
were more like the momentary phantasms of delirium than the proper
suggestions of reason but whatever they were they were instantly
driven out of his mind by another cry from fabueno seemingly hard by
but so feeble and wailing that a less acute ear might have supposed it
came from a considerable distance

he shook the boy off flung him into the arms of lazaro crying answer
his safety with thy life with thy life and immediately darted
through the cannoniers and retraced his steps on the causeway

by this time the fire on the pyramid had attained its greatest
brilliancy and the wind having died entirely away it projected its
lofty spire to heaven and burned with a tranquillity which seemed to
leave it motionless while its reflection on that part of the lake which
shared not in the agitations of conflict produced a spectacle of peace
in singular contrast with the horrible scene of carnage that moment
represented on the causeway the light it shed though it made objects
visible even as far as the second ditch did not illuminate the furthest
part of the dike and there whatever deed of death might be presented
was hidden from the eyes of all but the actors themselves

raising his voice aloud and running towards the nearest group don
amador sought out the secretary but this group before he had yet
reached it started away and fled with loud cries towards the city
or to where the tumult was greatest and he knew by their shouts of
tlatelolco ho tlatelolco that they were mexicans on the spot they
had thus deserted the novice stumbled over the body of a man his
throat cut from ear to ear his cotton armour torn to pieces and from
the shreds as the carcass rolled under his foot there fell out
rattling and jingling on the stones divers vessels of gold and jewels
such as had been grasped in the treasury

without pausing to survey this victim of covetousness the cavalier ran
on and hearing many christian voices ringing now with curses now
with prayers and now with shouts of triumph he called out at the top
of his voice 

on brothers on to the artillery advance strike well and
forward ho lorenzo comrade where art thou and why answerest thou
not

a gurgling sound as of one suffocating in the flood drew his eye to
the lake almost under his feet the water rippled as if lately
disturbed by the falling of some heavy body and just where the circling
waves washed sluggishly up the shelving dike there lay a white mass
like a human figure the head and shoulders buried in the tide the wash
of the ripple stirred the garments and in part the corse so that it
still seemed to be living but when the novice had caught it up he
beheld the visage of a very youthful girl her forehead cloven by a
sword of obsidian and the broken weapon wedged fast in the brain at
the same instant the water parted hard by and there rose up a dark
object that seemed the back of a horse across which lay the body of a
man in bright armour the legs upwards but the head and breast
ingulfed for an instant this dreary sight was presented but slowly
the steed whose nostrils were still under water as if held down by the
grasp of the dead rider rolled over on his side and the body slipping
off the other way sunk headlong and silently into the flood followed
presently by the horse and the next moment the waters were at rest

god rest thee lorenzo cried the novice laying down the corse of
eugracia thy life and thy hopes thy ambition and thy love are ended
together but now can i not lament thee

he started up as the causeway suddenly shook with the tramp of hoofs
and a cavalier without spear or helm dashed madly by almost at the
moment of passing whether it was that the strength of the fugitive had
suddenly given out or whether as seemed more probable a flight of
arrows had been sent in pursuit and struck both horse and rider the
steed made a fierce bound into the air and then pursued his course
masterless

follow onwards ye men of the rear cried the novice struck with a
sudden horror for now he became conscious that the artillery had been
for several moments silent and when he looked after the flying steed
though he could not at that distance perceive any thing he could hear
fierce voices mingling together in strife and presently the riderless
horse as if driven back by a wall of foes returned passing him again
with the speed of the wind

the limbs of the cavalier were nerved with the strength of fury for he
thought he heard the screams of jacinto ascending with the harsher
cries of the gunners and scarcely did that frightened charger fly more
swiftly from the battle than he himself now back to it

thy duty knave lazaro he cried the boy save the boy

don amador oh amador don amador came to his ears in a voice that
rent his heart

i come i come shouted the cavalier redoubling his exertions but
not his speed for that was at the highest

oh heaven amador amador  

in his distraction the neophyte confounded two voices into one and
while he replied to one his thoughts flew to another

i come answer me where art thou i am here where art thou

as he uttered these words he sprang through the artillery which was
without servers among bodies which were lifeless and stood
alone for there was no living creature there but himself on the
borders of the sluice the beam over which was broken off in the middle
and the further portion only left standing in its place

he cast his amazed and affrighted eye from the water heaving as before
with the struggles of dying men to the corpse on whose bosom he was
standing in the grinning countenance covered with blood and horribly
mutilated by a blow which had pierced through the mouth jaws and
throat to the severed spine he beheld the features of lazaro fixed in
death and looked wildly at his side to discover the body of the page
no corse of jacinto was there but on the ground where he had stood
on the spot where he had charged him to stand the novice perceived a
jewel catching a ray from the distant fire glittering red as with
blood and held by a golden chain to which it was attached in the
death-grasp of the henchman he snatched it from the earth and from the
hand of the dead and looking on it with a stare of horror beheld the
holy and never to be forgotten cross of rubies

with that sight the scales fell from his eyes and a million of wild
thoughts beset his brain the magical knowledge of the page coupled
with his childish and effeminate youth his garments so fitted to
disguise his scrupulous modesty his tears his terrors his
affection and his power over the mind of the cavalier the garb of the
priestess so lately acknowledged the vision in the house of the wali
abdalla the cross of jewels doubtless snatched from the neck of
jacinto when barbarians were tearing him from the faithful lazaro all
these came to the brain of the cavalier with the blaze and the shock of
a cannon suddenly discharged at his ears he looked again to the corses
about him they were those of the gunners to the ditch it writhed no
more and then uttering the name of leila he sunk in a stupor to the
earth




chapter lix


while these scenes of blood were passing in the centre of the army and
a hideous mystery concealed the fate of the rear the condition of the
advanced guard though not altogether hopeless was scarce less
terrific when the forces of sandoval comprising many of the followers
both common soldiers and captains of narvaez were made acquainted with
the fate of the bridge and beheld the vast number of foes that impelled
their canoes towards the further bank of the second ditch as if to
secure the passage they waited not for directions to cross over by
swimming they imitated the example of their commander sandoval who
leaping from his horse and leading him into the water passed over by
the beam while still holding and guiding the swimming animal this mode
of proceeding being necessarily very slow and the barbarians rushing
in the meanwhile against them with unspeakable fury the impatience of
the cavaliers became so great that many of them spurred their steeds
down the sides of the dike and thus swimming them along by the beam
passed to the other side divers of the footmen seduced by the example
leaped in like manner into the lake and the tlascalans at all times
less formidable opponents than their armed allies being at the same
moment violently assaulted sprang also into the water so that it
became alive with the bodies of man and horse as if a herd of caymans
such as haunt the lower rivers of that climate were disporting and
battling in the tide while thus embarrassed and entangled together in
the water the swimmers were set upon by the mexicans who pushing
their canoes among them and handling their heavy paddles as well as
war-clubs despatched them almost without labour and with roars of
exultation

it was at this instant of confusion and while those tlascalans who
still remained on the dike contended but feebly with the augmenting
assailants that don hernan followed closely by de morla and others
dashed over friend and foe and reached the ditch the scene of horror
there disclosed the miserable shrieks of christian comrades perishing
in the gap and the neighbouring parts of the lake the increasing yells
of infidels behind touched the stout heart of cortes with fear he
descended from his steed sprang upon the beam and crossed crying out
at the same time to those who followed 

hold cavaliers wait ye here for the artillery leave not this gap to
the murderers fight ye here well and ye shall have help from the van

so saying he sprang again upon his horse de morla was at his heels
bearing minnapotzin in his arms but on foot the chestnut gelding was
left drowning in the sluice entangled and sinking under the weight of a
dozen men who had seized upon him in their terror

god forgive thee cavalier cried cortes as he caught the eye of
francisco for for this barbarian puppet thou playest the coward and
leavest thy friend to perish without the aid of a blow

de morla answered not but with a ghastly smile uncovered and pointed
at the features of the unconscious princess

if she be dead cried the general give her body to the waters of her
native lake if she live commit her to the care of the tlascalans then
call on thy saints and show that thou art not a craven

then without waiting for an answer don hernan spurred onwards
striking down almost at every step for the whole causeway was
beset some luckless savage and now and then in his desperation
smiting at the hands of certain of his own countrymen who strove to
arrest the galloping steed and spring behind him

he reached the third and last ditch it was bridge-less like the
others and like the others a theatre of disorder and massacre the
pillar of fire here revealed its figure but luridly and faintly
through the thick mists and the cannon-smoke sluggishly driving over
the lake but he thought he could trace in the distant gloom in front
the outline of those rugged hills which lie along the western borders
of the lake he turned his face backwards to the city a tempest of
yells the pagan shouts of victory and the last cries of spaniards to
god came mingling on a gust that waved the distant flame to and fro
like a sword of fire in the hands of some colossal fiend a bolt of ice
smote through his bosom and when he plunged into the sluice and
rising on the opposite bank drove the sharp spurs into the flanks of
his charger no man of all the army fled with more craven horror than
himself

an hour afterwards the moon diminished to the thinnest crescent crept
with a sickly and cadaverous visage to the summit of the eastern hills
and peeped down into the valley preceding the dawn that was soon to
look upon its scenes of death

at this moment of moonrise those few christians who had escaped from
the battle were grouped at the end of the dike deliberating in
unspeakable agitation upon the course they were to pursue many advised
that they should instantly resume their flight and trust to their speed
to put them before morning beyond the reach of their merciless
enemies some insisted upon remaining to give help to such wretches as
ever and anon made their way from the causeway and with tears of joy
and loud thanks-givings threw themselves among their friends a few
more honourable or more insane among whom were sandoval and don
christobal de olid a very valiant cavalier to whom other histories
have been juster than this demanded with stern reproaches that their
leader should conduct them again to the combat which was still raging
on the lake and rescue their countrymen out of that fiery furnace or
at once honourably and justly perish with them

is there one here who if i refuse this most mad counsel will say i
do it from fear demanded the general with a voice broken by agony and
despair what i do i do for the good of heaven the king and
yourselves if i suffer you to return then will ye perish spain lose
an appanage worthy the first-born of an emperor and in that accursed
city god be daily grieved by the sight of idolatry and sacrifice by
remaining where we are we shall save many lives and this land of milk
and honey of corn and of gold though now torn from us for our sins
will be yet the guerdon of our resolution i aver and protest that if
we return to the hell that is on the lake we shall be lost to a man
is there one then who says i remain here from fear

notwithstanding the deep grief and agitation which gave their tone to
the words of the general there was mingled withal a touch of such
sternness as forbade even the boldest to reply great therefore was
the surprise of all when a hollow and broken voice murmured in answer
from the causeway 

there is one there are an hundred there have been but now they
are not a thousand men who say that this night cortes hath proved a
craven a deserter of his friends a traitor to his king a betrayer of
his god and therefore a villain

as these words were uttered there staggered up the bank on which the
party rested a figure seemingly of a cavalier but his armour so rent
and demolished as in many places to leave his body naked his helmet
was gone and his locks dripping with water and blood fell over his
breast leaving their crimson stains on the white mantle muffling the
body of some slighter figure which he bore in his arms

i forgive thee de morla cried the general rushing forwards and
then recoiling as don francisco deposited the burden at his feet and
removing the cloth reeking with water as with gore disclosed to the
view of all gently touched by the ray of that wasted and melancholy
moon the countenance of the dead princess who hath struck the
daughter of montezuma who hath done this deed

he who hath smitten the hearts of a thousand christians by leading
them into peril and deserting them in their need said the cavalier
with a tranquillity that struck all with terror for it was unnatural
he who commanded me to fling while living this child of a murdered
king into the lake or upon the spears of tlascalans and then get me
back to the foe that he might himself fly in safety

thou art mad francisco and thou doest me foul injustice said don
hernan hurriedly i fled not nor did i bid thee do aught but entrust
this hapless maiden to some strong band of allies thou being thyself
on foot and therefore incompetent to protect her

you called me craven too said the cavalier with a hoarse laugh
raising his voice aloud thou liest i am braver than thou for my
body is covered with wounds from the crown to the sole there is no
part but is mangled and yet thou hast not a limb but is untouched you
call me craven god smite you with punishment for you are all
cravens knaves and murderers together you wait on the banks while we
are dying and you call us cravens god will do us right god will
avenge us god will hear our prayers and so god curse you all and keep
your bones for the maws of infidels

thus speaking and concluding with the voice of a madman the young
cavalier cast a look on the dead princess and uttering a horrid
scream ran back distracted to the causeway

in the name of god on exclaimed an hundred voices we are not
cravens and murderers and spaniards shall not fall unaided

don hernan himself stung by the sarcasms of the unhappy and
well-beloved cavalier was the first to clap spurs to his horse and
again the thunder of cavalry and the quick tread of footmen moving in
order were heard on the dike of tacuba




chapter lx


thousands of infuriated and exulting savages had in the meanwhile
landed from their canoes at the second ditch raised their cries of
triumph over the abandoned artillery and struck with a rage not to be
appeased by death the christian corses which lay so thick among them
but while living invaders remained either in the front or rear they
tarried not long to waste their malice on the dead

the cavalier don amador when he made the marvellous discovery detailed
in a preceding chapter and perceived that the fair and lamented being
of his dreams heaven had permitted so long to walk by his side in this
new and strange world revealing her to his eyes only at the moment
when destined to be snatched from them for ever felt at that instant
of discovery as if all the ties which bound him to existence were at
once dissevered rage at his blindness furious compunctions of remorse
for his negligence and an agony of grief at the supposed dreadful fate
of the maiden were mingled with a sort of wild indignation against the
providence which by veiling his eyes and shutting his ears to the
suggestions of his heart for surely from the moment he looked upon
the page his affections were given him had robbed him of his
mistress it was not therefore wonderful that such a conflict of
mind acting upon a body weakened by previous wounds and sickness and
exhausted by present exertions should have thrown him across the body
of lazaro himself to all appearance full as lifeless and thus he
lay for half an hour insensible to the battle which was now drawing
nigh to the ditch and now leaving it to its charnel solitude

he was recalled to life by feeling some one tug forcibly at the sacred
jewel which he retained throughout his lethargy with the same instinct
which had preserved it in the death-grasp of the henchman more lucky
than lazaro yet scarce more happy this violence woke up the sleeping
energies of life and he raised his head though only to stare about him
with a bewildered look of unconsciousness

god be thanked exclaimed a christian voice in his ear as a friendly
hand seized him by the shoulder lead or gold glass or precious stone
never was cross of christ picked up on the wayside but good fortune
followed after it what ho señor up and away the things that i spoke
of have come to pass kalidon-sadabath dances in the crystal he loves
the smell of blood up arise and away for thine hour is not come

the cavalier arose and stared at the friendly magician which botello
seeing and supposing he was now fully restored to his wits this
lunatic of another sort seized him by the arm and dragging him towards
the water said 

fear not if thou hast not the skill of a crocodile know that i can
bear thee across the channel and that the more easily that it is
already choked with corses and no mexicans nigh to oppose us

the neophyte broke from his companion and with wild cries of leila
leila ran towards the cannon

god save thee art thou mad dost thou call upon woman or devil this
is no place for girls and never heard i of imp called leila

thou knowest not my wretchedness botello said don amador let me
look again if her body be not here hah he cried struck with a
sudden thought and turning quickly to the conjurer thou art a
magician and knowest of the dead as well as the living i have decried
thine art but now i acknowledge thy wisdom behold this rubied
cross oh heaven that i should hold it in my hand and know that but
a moment since it was on the neck of leila look enchanter this jewel
came from the neck of a woman whom but now i left standing on this
brink call her from the dead if she have perished or show me what
path she hath trodden if she be living and i will reward thee though
i give thee the half of my patrimony a woman i tell thee wilt thou
not believe me half my estate but to look upon her

it was manifest even to the unhappy novice himself that botello
regarded him as a madman but nevertheless he replied earnestly here
is no place for conjurations there be devils enough about us already
tarry not here for this will neither benefit thee nor her of whom thou
speakest spring into the ditch rush with me to the main and then
what thou seekest thou shalt know courage courage dost thou not see
yonder star that creeps up by the dim moon under the rack dimmer even
than the dim moon under that star came i into earth and while it
shineth in that conjunction the dart of a savage cannot wound me no
not though it strike me upon the naked brow hark dost thou not hear
the fragments of the rear-guard are approaching let us swim this abyss
before they reach us lest we be entangled among them hesitate not we
will go together for i see thou art worn and feeble and i remember
that thou gavest me succour in the streets of mexico

the neophyte had yielded with a sort of captive-like and despairing
submission to the will of botello and was descending with him moodily
to the water when suddenly the latter paused listening to a christian
shout in the distance as of one approaching them from the shore

hark it is repeated viva they come from the main they have beaten
the cubs of darkness viva viva santiago and quick valiant friends

the joyous shouts of botello were re-echoed though only by a single
voice yet this was evidently approaching and with great rapidity

during the whole time of the resuscitation of don amador and of his
dialogue with the enchanter the causeway in the neighbourhood of the
ditch had been free from foes but only because it was free from
christians and the lake in the vicinity was equally solitary but now
as they stood listening to the shouts the two companions could perceive
the lake some distance in front on both sides of the dike boiling up
in foam under canoes impelled towards them with extraordinary violence
seemingly upon the flank of the party from which proceeded the cry but
whatever was the speed of the canoes it seemed to be unequal to that of
the christian whose shouts wild and loud and now almost incessantly
repeated grew shriller and nearer every moment

on valiant friends on heed not the pagans on shouted botello as
the canoes cut the water within an hundred paces of the ditch thanks
be to god i see them hah good and here hark to his voice how
cheery here comes the valorous de morla

as he spoke the figure of de morla outstripping the wind was seen
running towards the ditch while some of the arrows shot after him by
the pursuers and passing him fell even at the feet of the expectant
pair

the sight of his friend kindled the ardour of don amador he shouted
aloud

on valiant brother it is i thy sworn friend of cuenza

to this speech de morla answered with a yell that chilled the heart of
his townsman and running without a moment's hesitation and without
slackening his speed to the end of the broken beam where it overhung
the middle of the sluice he sprang from it as if assisted by its
elasticity to so great a height into the air that it was plain he
would clear the chasm in the bound as he leaped he waved his sword
and uttered a scream a cloud of arrows at the same time whistled
through the atmosphere and when he reached the ground twenty of these
deadly missiles were sticking in his body

the neophyte raised up his head one arrow was in his brain it snapped
off as the head rolled on amador's arm a thrill and a gasp were the
last and only manifestations of suffering the next instant the body of
de morla rolled down the shelving plane of the ditch and sunk with a
few bubbles among a hundred of his countrymen already sepulchred
therein




chapter lxi


meantime the reappearance of the barbarians seemed to cut off the last
hope of escape from amador and his companion but the magician
answering the cavalier's sullen look of despair with a laugh and
pointing to the little star which still made its way up the cloudy arch
along with the moon said dragging him at the same time towards the
artillery

what the spirits say is true all this said they of de morla may he
rest with god amen fear not be of good heart while the star shines
there is hope and hope for both for though i have not yet read thy
fate in full still while thou art at my side thou canst be in no
great peril at the worst and when the worst comes it is written that
eagles shall come down from heaven and bear me away on their
backs hast thou never a flint and dry tinder to light me a linstock
here hath some knavish gunner left his piece charged and the grains of
sulphur still heaped up from rimbase to cascable a good roar now might
do marvels quick they are upon us fling thee under the wheels and
look but as dead as thou didst erewhile till the cut-throats be
passed hah fore god dost thou hear he exclaimed suddenly leaping
up kalidon soho brave imp and thou shalt be a-galloping
yet hearest thou that shout like the clang of a bugle on a
hill-top tis cortes and he cometh

it was even as the magician had said from the moment that de morla took
the fatal leap the rowers ceased paddling in their canoes as if
certain of his fate or unwilling to follow so feeble a prey and
remained huddled together as though they awaited the approach of a more
tempting quarry they had not perceived the two companions just as
botello was about to creep under a falconet around whose wheels the
corses lay very thick the strong voice of cortes was heard rising over
the din which at some quarter or other of the causeway was kept up
incessantly during the whole conflict it echoed again sustained and
strengthened by the voices of a considerable party

they approach said botello they are a-horse too i hear the
trampling god quicken the rear methought there were many who followed
me

hark cried the cavalier the foul knaves desert us their voices are
weaker they fly again to the land

here's that which shall fetch them back if they be men exclaimed
botello catching up a port-fuse not yet extinguished striking it on
his arm to shake off the ashes and whirling it in the air till it
glowed and almost blazed it will show them there be some living yet
and with god's blessing will scatter yon ambushed heathen like
plashing water-drops ojala and all ye fiends of air and water of
earth and of hell that are waiting for pagan souls carry my hail-shot
true and have at your prey

so saying the conjurer applied the match the roar of the explosion was
succeeded not only by the yells of mexicans dying in their broken
canoes or paddling away from so dangerous a vicinity but by spanish
shouts both on the rear and in front

on brave hearts cried cortes there be bold knaves yet at the
ordnance

the next moment the little band of horse that headed the relief sprang
into the lake and swimming aside so as to avoid the sunken bodies and
the bales still floating in the ditch crossed over to the cannon while
a large body of men arranged with such order that they blocked up the
whole causeway from side to side came marching up from the rear
fighting as they fled and still valiantly resisting the multitudes that
pursued both on the dike and in the water

thanks be to god cried don hernan rejoiced that so many lived and
yet appalled at the numbers and ferocious determination of the foes who
still like venomous insects following the persecuted herd pursued
whithersoever the christians fled art thou alive de leon praised be
st james who listened to my prayer turn ye now and let us succour
the rest

they are in heaven said de leon with a faint voice for he was
severely wounded as indeed were all his crew push on in the name of
god all who can swim the others must perish

hold stay exclaimed cortes fling the cannon into the
sluice think not of the enemy heave over my good falconets they will
make a bridge for ye all

the wounded footmen seized upon the guns with the energy of despair
and flinging over the ropes to that company of their fellow infantry who
had followed don hernan and now stood on the opposite side the pieces
were pushed and dragged into the water and together with the mass of
corses already deposited in that fatal chasm made such a footing for
the infantry as enabled many to pass in safety among these was don
amador de leste his hand grasped by the faithful magician who
perceived that he was sunk into such sluggishness of despair that he
must have perished if left to himself

it is not to be supposed that this passage was effected without
opposition and loss on the contrary the barbarians redoubled their
exertions and while many rested at a distance shooting whole clouds of
arrows others pushed their canoes boldly up to the gap and there slew
many taken at such disadvantage

nevertheless the passage was at last effected and the footmen joining
themselves to their fellows and forming as before twenty deep
followed the horsemen towards the shore

hold shouted botello when the party was about to start save your
captain ye knaves of the rear save de leon the valiant velasquez

a few roused by this cry and heedless of the shafts shot at them
rushed back to the brink and beheld the wounded and forgotten captain
in the water struggling in the arms of two brawny barbarians who
strove to drag him into a canoe while his followers stood hesitating
not knowing how to give him aid the little vessel agitated by his
struggles which were tremendous suddenly overset and captive and
capturers fell together into the water the two warriors were presently
seen swimming towards a neighbouring canoe and de leon strangling
under the flood heaved not his last groan on the gory block of
sacrifice

the fugitives paused not to lament they resumed their march and gained
the last ditch

the events of that march and of the passage of that ditch are like
the others a series of horrors enough has been narrated to picture out
the dreadful punishment of men who acknowledged no rights but those of
power and preferred to rob a weak and childish race with insult and
murder rather than to subdue them as could have been done by the arts
of peace in the sole incident which remains to be mentioned we record
the fate of an individual whose influence had been felt through most of
the events of the invasion in many cases beneficially but in this
disastrously enough this was the enchanter botello a man just shrewd
enough to deceive himself which is in other words to say that he
mingled in his own person so much cunning with so much credulity that
the former was ever the victim of the latter the devoutness of his own
belief in the efficacy of his arts was enough to secure them the
respect and reverence of the common herd as well as of better men in
an age of superstition how much confidence was given to them by cortes
does not clearly appear in the older historians but it is plain he
turned them to great advantage and had the art sometimes to make the
stars as well as kalidon of the crystal furnish revelations of his own
hinting and it is suspected not without grounds that this very
nocturnal flight projected originally under the impression that the
barbarians would not go into battle after night-fall and when the
later events of the siege had disproved this hope still persisted in
from the persuasion that no mexican would handle a weapon on the day of
an emperor's burial was conceived in the brain of the general before it
was counselled by the lips of botello

at all events the enchanter did not this night manifest any doubt in
his own powers with a strange and yet natural inconsistency he seemed
to rejoice over the slaughter of his countrymen as over the
confirmation of his predictions twice or thrice at least he muttered
and once even in the thick of combat to don amador by whose side he
ever walked at the head of the retreating party 

i said this night we should retreat we have retreated i said there
should be death for many and safety for some the many are at rest
god receive their souls and angels carry them to the seats of
bliss and some of us are saved

be not over-quick in thy consummations said amador we are here now
at the third ditch which is both wide and deep and no bodies to bridge
it and seest thou not how the yelling curs are paddling in to oppose
us

bodies enow cried the enchanter to-morrow at midday when the sun
is hottest ye shall see corses lying along on both sides of the causey
like the corks of a fisherman's net and at the ditches they will come
up like ants out of the earth when a dead caterpillar falls at their
door yet say i we shall be saved and thou shalt see it for i
remember how thou didst carve the back of that knave that lay on me in
the streets of mexico and i will carve a dozen for thee in like manner
ere dawn on this causeway

boast no more such confidence offends heaven for thy life hangs here
as loosely as another's

the star the star cried botello the dim little star is it not
shining the morning comes after it and the eagles are waking on the
hills they will snuff the battle they will shriek to the vultures to
the crows and the gallinazas and down will they come together to the
lake-side and the lake at eventide ye will see dead men floating about
in the wind and on the breast of each a feeding raven but devils shall
be perched on the corses of the heathen

heaven quit me of thy wild words for they sound to me unnatural and
damnable as though spoken by one of those same demons thou thinkest
of speak no more look to thy life for it is in jeopardy

hast thou not seen me in the battle and lo you now i have not a
scratch said the enthusiast i have fought on the dike when there
were twelve men of us good men bold and true eleven were slain but
here am i untouched by flint unbruised by stone unhurt by arrow i
fought three screeching infidels in the water hard by to where two
valiant cavaliers were pulled off their horses and so smothered and
yet strangled i my heathens without horse to help or friend to say god
speed me the life that is charmed is invulnerable the star shines the
eagle leaves her nest and kalidon-sadabath laughs in the
crystal viva lo now how sandoval the valiant will scatter me yon
imps in the boats he spurs into the water catalan the left-handed
juan of salamanca torpo the growler ferdinand of bilboa and de olid
the devil's ketch they spring after him there they go dance
kalidon thy brothers shall have souls to be fetched up from the mud as
one rakes up clams of a fish-day crowd hell with damned
heathens there be more to follow

never before had such life possessed the spirits of botello he stood on
the edge of the causey shouting loud vivas as the bold cavaliers
rushed among the canoes that blocked up the sluice the novice though
shocked at such untimely exultation was not able to avoid it for he
was enfeebled and botello held him with a fast and determined gripe

unhand me conjurer he cried and i will swim the ditch

tarry a little till the path be made clear thou wilt be murdered
else

i shall be murdered if i remain here and so wilt thou hah did that
shaft hurt thee

never a jot how could it there flies not the arrow this night there
waves not the bludgeon that can shed my blood

art thou besotted god forgive thee this is impiety

the magician held his peace for about this time the mexicans knowing
that this band diminished disordered and divided by the ditch into
two feeble parties was the sole remaining fragment of oppression and
determined that no invader should escape alive rushed upon the causeway
on all sides with such savage violence as seemed irresistible those who
had not yet crossed broke in affright and flung themselves into the
sluice with such speed that in a few moments don amador began to
think that he and botello were the only christians left

why dost thou hold me madman he cried let me free

hark dost thou not hear there are christian men behind us said
botello courage what if these devils be thicker than the thoughts of
sin in man's heart fiercer than conscience deadlier than remorse yet
shall we pass them unharmed patience tis the voice of a spaniard i
tell thee and behind

it is in front hark tis don hernan

it is behind and it is the cry of alvarado let us return and give
him aid ho ye that fly return the tonatiuh is shouting behind us
will ye desert him return return

before amador could remonstrate the lunatic for at this moment more
than any other botello seemed to deserve the name had dragged him to
the top of the dike where he stood exposed to the view and the shots
of the foe a thousand arrows were aimed at the pair

thou art a dead man said amador

dost thou not see the star cried the magician impatiently not a
bird hath yet flapped her wing not an eagle hath fled from her cliff
and my star my star  

as he spoke he let go his hold of the cavalier to point exultingly at
the diminutive luminary at that very instant an arrow aimed close at
hand struck the neophyte on the breast entering the mail at a place
rent by blows of a previous day and without wounding him forced its
way out through links hitherto uninjured

hah said the cavalier as the arm of botello fell heavily on his
shoulder art thou taught wisdom and humility at last let us
descend and swim

as he moved he became sensible that the shaft was still sticking in his
hauberk he grasped the feathered notch the head was in the
astrologer's heart the stout wood snapped as botello fell it struck
him in the moment of his greatest hope he dropped down a dead man

while amador stood confounded and struck with horror he was seized he
knew not by whom and suddenly found himself dragged through the water
before he could well commend his soul to heaven for he thought himself
in the hands of the enemy he beheld himself on firm land while the
voice of cortes shouted in his ear 

rouse thee and die not like a sleeper hold me by the hand and my
good horse shall drag thee through the melée i would sooner that my arm
were hacked off than that thou shouldst sleep in the accursed lake
enough of thy blood rests in it with don gabriel

ay thought the unhappy cavalier enough of my blood and all of my
heart don gabriel de morlar lazaro lorenzo and ay and leila
better that i were with them

a sudden cry from beyond the ditch interrupted his griefs

pause pause cried the voice leave me not i am nigh i am
alvarado

the cavaliers looked back at these words and beheld a man come flying
as it were through the air over the ditch perched on the top of a long
chinantlan spear the bottom of which was hidden in the water he fell
quite clear of the sluice after making a leap which even his comrades
who had not individually seen it held impossible for mortal man and
which even to this day has preserved to the spot the name of the
salto or leap of alvarado

the appearance of the tonatiuh was hailed with shouts of joy and the
spaniards receiving it as a good omen closed their ranks and slowly
for every inch was contested fought their way to the shore when they
trode upon the firm ground the little star had vanished in the gray
beams of morning and a thick mist rising up from the water like a
curtain concealed from the eyes of the fugitives along with the
accursed signal-fire the fatal towers and temples of mexico

thus closed a night of horror and wo memorable as the noche triste
or melancholy night of mexican history and paralleled perhaps in
modern days if we consider the loss of the retreating army as compared
with its numbers only by the famous and most lamentable passage of the
berezina more than four thousand tlascalans and five hundred
spaniards were left dead on the causeway or in the lake of the
prisoners but two or three escaped two sons and as many daughters of
montezuma with five tributary kings as well as many princes and
nobles perished all the cannon were utterly lost left to rust and rot
in the salt flood that had so often resounded to their roar and of more
than an hundred proud war-steeds that champed the bit so fiercely at
midnight scarce twenty jaded hacks snuffed the breath of morning

with this broken and lamenting force with foes still hanging on his
rear and ever flying from his front cortes set out to seek a path by
new and unknown mountains to the distant tlascala he turned his eyes
but once towards the lake the pagan city was hidden among the mists
and the shouts of victorious mexicans came but faintly to the ear he
beat his breast and shedding such tears as belong to defeated hopes and
the memory of the dead resumed his post at the head of the fugitives




chapter lxii


we draw a curtain over the events of the first five days of flight
wherein the miserable fugitives contending at once with fatigue
famine and unrelenting foes stole by night and through darkling
by-ways along the northern borders of the fair valley from which they
were thus ignominiously and as it seemed for ever expelled of the
twenty mounted men each like a red-cross knight in the ancient days
of the order bore a wounded companion on his crupper and don amador
himself on a jaded beast that had belonged to marco for fogoso had
been lost or killed in the melée thus carried the only remaining
servant of himself and his knight the ancient baltasar other mangled
wretches were borne on the backs of tlascalans in rudely constructed
litters

in this manner the ruined and melancholy band pursued its way by
lake-side and hill over morass and river ever pursued and insulted by
bodies of barbarians and frequently attacked till on the evening of
the fifth day they flung their weary forms to sleep in the city as it
may be called of pyramids among those mouldering and cactus-covered
mounds which the idolatry of a forgotten age reared to the divinity of
the greater and lesser luminaries of heaven on the field micoatl that
is to say the plain of death the visitor of san juan de teotihuacan
still perceives these gigantic barriers rising among the hundreds of
smaller mounds the houses of the stars which strew the consecrated
haunts and perhaps conceal the sepulchres of a holozoic people

at sunrise the spaniards arose ascended the mountain of aztaquemacan
at the north-eastern border of the valley and prepared with a joyous
expectation which had not been diminished even by the significant and
constantly-repeated threats of the pursuers to descend into the
friendly land of the tlascalans by way of the vale of otumba for the
last two days the name of this valley had been continually on the lips
of the mexicans following on the rear and their cries as interpreted
by marina who survived the horrors of the melancholy night intimated
plainly enough that the work of revenge so dreadfully commenced upon
the lake was to be consummated in the gorges of the mountains
nevertheless the spaniards in the alacrity of spirit which the
prospect of soon ending their sufferings in the land of bread produced
forgot these menaces or regarded them as the idle bravados of impotent
fury and clambered upwards with increasing hope until they reached
the crest of a ridge and looked down the slope to the wished-for
valley the sight which they beheld will be described in another place
it remains now to return to an individual whose fate has long been
wrapped in mystery

at the moment when the spaniards approached the highest part of the
ravine by which alone they could pass in that quarter from the vale
of tenochtitlan there lay in a wild and savage nook of the mountain
which went shelving upwards on the right hand and at so short a
distance that had a bugle been winded in the army it must have reached
his ears one who had been a companion in many of their battles and
sufferings a number of huge rocks fallen ages ago and rolled from some
distant pinnacle were heaped together on a broad and inclined shelf
and enclosed a space of ground so regular in form and yet so rudely
bounded by those sprawling barriers that it looked to the imagination
not unlike the interior of some stupendous temple built by a barbaric
people and overwhelmed many ages before by some great convulsion one
side was formed by a cliff in whose shivered side yawned the entrance
of a black and dismal cavern while the broken masses of rock themselves
formed the others among and over these where they lay in contact with
the cliff there rushed a torrent which in the times of drought might
have been a meager and chattering rivulet making its way merrily
through gap and hollow but which now swollen by the summer rains
came raving and roaring over the rocks broken by them into a series of
foaming cascades and then shooting over a corner of the enclosure
and darting through the opposite wall it went thundering down the
mountain a few stunted trees stretched their withered limbs among these
savage masses and the noontide sun peeping down into the nook and
lighting up a part of the cliff fell pleasantly on the mosses and
alpine flowers which ornamented its shelving floor tinting with
momentary rainbows the mists that hung over the fall a sable steed
without bridle or halter and much the worse for such primitive
stabling but yet to all appearance the relic of a once noble
war-horse wandered at liberty through the enclosure cropping the few
plants which bedecked it or drinking from the little pools at the side
of the torrent while at the mouth of the cave at the foot of a wooden
crucifix of the rudest description lay sleeping the figure of his
master a stained and tattered garment of leather investing his limbs
was not altogether hidden under a black mantle which partly covered his
body the head of the sleeper lay on his right arm and this embraced
the foot of the cross so that the grizzly locks which fell from his
forehead rested against and almost twined around the holy wood

the sunbeam played unregarded on his withered cheeks and flickered
over a heap of rusted armour both of man and horse which lay hard by
shining also with a fierce lustre upon what appeared a scarlet
surcoat hung like a banner on the point of a knightly lance which
rested against the side of the cliff

disease as well as age had furrowed the cheeks and wasted the form of
the slumberer famine seemed to have been at work as well as all other
privations incident to a habitation in the desert and there was in his
whole appearance such an air of extreme and utter misery as would have
moved the pity of any beholder nevertheless he slept on regardless of
the roaring fall and heedless of the fierce sunbeam in such
tranquillity as augured at least a momentary suspension of suffering

as the sun stole up to the meridian another human creature was suddenly
added to the scene the browsing war-horse pricked his ears and
snorted as if to do the duty of a faithful sentinel and convey to his
master a note of alarm as certain dried branches crackled among the
rocks of the wall and a stone loosened as by a footstep fell
rattling down their sides and buried itself in the pool at the base
of the fall but the anchorite for such the solitude of his dwelling
the poverty of his raiment and more than all the little rugged cross
which he embraced caused him to appear heard not these sounds he
slept on lulled by the accustomed roar of the water-fall and the steed
was left alone to watch the approach of the stranger

presently he was seen dragging himself up the rocks by the aid of a
drooping bough and when he had reached their top he rested for a
moment still clinging to the branch as if worn out with toil as was
indeed made apparent by the youth and feebleness of his appearance he
cast a haggard and uninterested eye on the romantic torrent leaping and
foaming at his feet and seemed to hesitate whether he should descend
into the prison-like enclosure or retrace his steps and retreat as he
had come but suddenly his gaze fell upon the steed and he started
with surprise at a sight so unexpected the sagacious animal whinnied
loudly as if with recognition and the youth devoutly crossing
himself looked with an agitation that denoted terror on the red
garment the cross and the human figure that still lay sleeping or
perhaps as he thought dead under its holy shadow then as if
resolved he hastened to descend from the rugged fragments and seeking
where he might safely cross the brook over the stones that obstructed
its bed he at last stood at the side of the good steed which snuffed
at him a moment with joy and then gambolling about a little fell to
cropping the plants again satisfied that the comer was a friend

the youth stole up tremblingly to the side of the sleeper and seemed
shocked at his emaciated and neglected appearance he stooped as if to
awake him and then started back wringing his hands in fear and grief
he bent over him again a smile passed like a beam over the countenance
of the recluse and a murmur escaped his lips of which the youth caught
only a few broken syllables

though i shed thy blood were the words he distinguished yet did i
not aim at thee and therefore hast thou forgiven me for the sin was
the sin of frenzy thou pardonest me too alharef for thou art also
of the angels it is good to walk with thee through the seats of
bliss

a tear fell upon the cheek of the knight calavar for it was indeed
he but it fell like the spray-drop or the gentle dew and it was not
until the hand of the youth touched his shoulder that he awoke and rose
feebly to his feet

whoever thou art said the unfortunate devotee thou breakest the
only dream of happiness that hath visited my slumbers for long and many
years and callest me from the paradise that filled me with bliss to
the earth which is the wheel whereon i am broken miserere mei deus

alas my lord

art thou sent back to bid me prepare cried don gabriel starting
wildly at the voice of the intruder lo i have flung me off the
harness of war and devoted me to penance in the wilderness giving my
body to sleep on the earth and in caves drinking of the wild floods
and eating of the tough roots with the earth-worm while i sleep my
heart is scourged within me whilst i wake i pray and i pray that i
may sleep for ever know therefore jacinto thou that dwellest in
paradise that i am ready and that i thank heaven i am called at
last for weary has been my life and long my repentance

alas my lord i live like thyself and i call upon thee that thou
mayest continue to live i thought indeed that thou wert dead and so
thought and yet think thy friends who are now in great peril

god snatched me from the hands of the heathen said the knight and
brought me to this place that i might seek for peace for oh my heart
was but filled with scorpions that stung me day and night and my head
strewn with coals ever burning and tormenting whilst i sat in the
infidel city and remembered how he that hath been my son was slain by
murderers in the streets because he loved me all that loved me have
perished and wo betide the hand that struck and is not yet withered
two under mine own steel yea alharef thou art remembered and zayda
thou art not forgotten then came the blow to thee dear seraph and
thou wert carried off by the angry spirit of alharef who defied me at
the palace-gate and in the temple-yard raised me to my feet and bade
me think of zayda verily i remember her and my heart is black with
recollection then fell the bolt upon my boy he that was matchless in
honour and love peerless in war incomparable in truth would that the
barbarous knives had struck my bosom instead of thine amador would
that thou wert now upon thy gallant bay shaking thy lance and shouting
the cry of the hospital and i in thy place mouldering in the streets
of mexico i lay on my couch whilst thou wert calling to me for aid i
slept while thou wert dying cursed be thy foundations pagan city
ruin fall upon thy towers havoc ride howling through thy palaces and
lamentations come up from thy lakes and gardens for he that was the
last and first the loving and beloved rots like a dog upon thy
pavement

noble and dear master said jacinto in this at least thou art
mistaken my dear lord thy kinsman perished not that day in the
streets for i myself did watch by his sick couch and see him after
thou hadst departed return in safety to the palace

dost thou say so he died not in the streets praised be god for this
his goodness cried don gabriel falling on his knees my sin then
hath not been visited on the guileless and true my son amador yet
liveth

he looked to the page and now for the first time observed as far as
this could be seen through his thickly padded garments that the form of
jacinto was greatly attenuated his cheeks were hollow and colourless
and his countenance altered as by some such grief as had been at work
in his own bosom he seemed too to be very feeble but if such were
the appearances of sorrow on his visage they assumed a yet more
striking character of agony and despair when the knight's words of joy
fell on his ear his face grew paler than death he trembled like a
linden leaf and his lips scarcely obeyed their function when he
replied with a faint and fruitless effort at calmness 

i will not deceive my lord no heaven be my stay i will not deceive
my lord though my friend my patron my protector the noble
amador fell not in the streets but returned to his people yet is his
fate wrapped in mystery in darkness and in fear that night that
dreadful night o heaven the causey covered with men shrieking and
cursing stabbing and rending the lake choked with corses and with
dying men still contending and suffocating each in the grasp of a
drowning foe but i think not of that i think not of that who lived
who died we searched for the body of my lord but found it not he was
not with those they led to the pyramid his corse floated not among the
hundreds which befouled the lake yet did they discover his goodly
war-horse on the water-side his surcoat was dragged from a ditch
among cannon under whose heavy bulk lay many bodies which the indians
strove to push up with poles but my lord's body rose not among them
and yet he sleeps in the lake yes he sleeps in the lake for how
could he escape that night and i no more by his side

as jacinto spoke he wept and sobbed bitterly giving himself up to
despair but not so the knight he listened somewhat bewildered to the
confused narration of an event in which he had shared no part but
catching the idea at last and mingling it with another the fruit of
his very distempered mind he said quickly and almost joyously 

dry thy tears for now i perceive that my son is not dead but liveth
and straightway we will go forth and seek him jacinto regarded the
knight with a melancholy look he noticed the incredulity and resumed
with much devout emphasis but a moment since before thou camest into
this den mine eyes were opened upon paradise it was vouchsafed to me
who must never hope to enjoy such spectacle again no desdichado de
mi never again never again to look upon the golden city of god
wherein i walked with all those whom in my life i had loved and who
were dead there saw i among the saints and seraphim my father who
fell in arms at the sack of alhama my mother who died giving me birth
together with all the friends of my childhood who perished early
there also i beheld alharef and zayda the murdered and the
blest with all others that were truly dead now thou wilt see how god
opened mine eyes in this trance for though i wept thee dear child as
truly believing thou wert deceased yet thee i saw not among the
blissful where thou must have been hadst thou been discarded from
earth as i thought thee and i remember me too and great joy it is to
remember that my son amador was not among those saints for which
reason heaven makes it manifest to us that he lives now therefore
let us go forth from this desert and seek him though mine eyes are
sealed among these hills and my feet stumble upon the rocks yet will
heaven point us out a path to mexico

alas my lord need not seek so far said the page the pagans are now
alone in the city having driven out their enemies with terrible
slaughter never more will the spaniards return to it

ay now i remember me said the knight catching up some of his
battered armour as he spoke this defence that i had thought for ever
rejected must i again buckle on i remember me thou spokest of a night
of retreat by the causeway very dreadful and bloody ay and thou
saidst thou wert at amador's side how was it that thou wert taken
from him and didst yet live

my father abdalla said jacinto sorrowfully my father by chance
heard me cry at the ditch when my lord don amador was gone and he
saved me in his canoe

thy father thy father abdalla i remember me of abdalla said the
knight touching his brow there is a strange mystery in abdalla i am
told that is i heard from my poor marco that abdalla the moor did
greatly abhor me even to the seeking of my life

he wronged him said the page whatever was my father's hatred of my
lord he never sought to do him a wrong

strange muttered don gabriel thou acknowledgest he hated me then
wherefore should he whom i have not injured hate me and wherefore
after confiding thyself to my good keeping

let me not deceive my lord said jacinto sadly but firmly my
father entrusted his child to him he hated because he knew him just and
honourable and my father did receive great wrong as well as other
unhappy moors of my lord in the alpujarras  

the knight dropped the dinted cuishes which he had snatched up and
clasping his hands wildly exclaimed 

miserere mei deus my sin is inexpiable and my torment endless for
in the alpujarras did i slay him whom i had sworn to love and deface
with a murderous sword the loveliest of thine images

dear my lord said jacinto shocked and grieved at his agitation
forget this for thy sin is not what thou thinkest and it has been
already forgiven thee zayda hath seen from heaven the greatness of
thy grief and she intercedes for thee with our holy mother

she follows me on earth she comes to me in visions cried don
gabriel vehemently rememberest thou not the night of cholula then
stood she before me as thou dost and with face of snow and finger of
wrath she reminded me of my malefaction

my lord is deceived this was no spectre but a living woman said
jacinto hurriedly

the knight stared aghast

if i make it appear to my lord continued the page that this was
indeed no phantom sent to reproach but a living creature haply
resembling her of whom he speaks and therefore easily mistaken in
the gloom for one of whom my lord thought in his delirious
moment will it not satisfy my lord that he is not persecuted but
forgiven

if thou canst speak aught to remove one atom and grain from this
mountain of misery which weighs upon my heart said calavar
earnestly i adjure thee that thou speak it many times have i thought
that she whom i slew stood at my side but yet had i hopes and a
partial belief that these were the visions of my disease for my mind
is sometimes very sorely distracted what i saw at cholula was beyond
such explication very clearly and vividly represented and seen by me
when my thoughts were not disordered

let my lord be content and know that this was a living creature as i
have said and no apparition let him do on his armour and by-and-by
all shall be revealed to him

speak to me now said the knight

not now not now interrupted jacinto for at this moment the
myriads of vengeful fiends who seek for the blood of my lord don
amador if he be yet living are rushing upon the poor fugitives doth
not my lord hear hark

tis a trumpet it blasteth for a charge of horse cried calavar as
the distant sound came echoing up the mountain even over the roar of
the fall the ancient war-horse heard the remembered note and pricking
his ears neighed loudly and fiercely running to a gap in the wall as
if to seek the contest till recalled by the voice of his master

the infidels are then at hand and they do battle with christians
exclaimed don gabriel the fire of chivalry again flashing from his eye
and almost driving away the thought of zayda buckle me these straps
and see that thou art speedy for this brooks not delay god hath called
me to this mountain that i should be ready to do battle with the
heathen in defence of the holy cross which is my sworn vow and in
the fulfilment of the same i pray god that i may die sound again
brave heart smite me the godless fast and well for presently i shall
be with ye striking for the faith why how thou loiterest young
knave be speedy for my son amador is with the christian host and
this day heaven wills that i shall bring him succour

alas my lord cried the page i would that i could give my life to
aid him but my fingers are skilless and feeble

thou art a godly boy and well do i love thee buckle me as thou canst
and care not to buckle well for in this fight god will be my armour
buckle me therefore as thou canst and while thou art thus engaged
give me to know what good angel brought thee to be my messenger

i followed my sire said the trembling jacinto with the forces of
mexico that were sent to join the mountain bands and cut off the
fugitives and being commanded to rest me on the hill till the battle
was over i lost myself which with my great grief of heart caused me
to seek some nook wherein i might die for truly now unless my lord
amador be living i care not myself for life

the forces of mexico be they many and these dogs of the hills are
they in numbers

countless as the drops of spray which the breeze flings over us said
jacinto with much perturbation so that nothing but the goodness of
god can rescue the spaniards out of their hands and conduct them forth
on the path so blocked up by their bodies the mexicans are many
thousands in number and triumphing still in the thought of their horrid
victory on the lake they swear that no spaniard shall escape them this
day

i swear myself said calavar fiercely and heaven will listen to
the vow of a christian though one sinful and miserable that this day
even they themselves the godless pagans shall be scattered as dust
under our footsteps quick my war-coat and now my good lance that
hath drunk the blood of the heathen santa madre de dios señora
beatificada the infidel shall fall under the cross and the true
believer rejoice in his slaughter

with such exclamations of fervour the spirit of youthful days
returning at each blast of the trumpet which was still winded at
intervals the knight ceased doing on his armour and then with
jacinto's feeble assistance caparisoned his impatient steed when this
was done he bade the page to follow him and riding through one of the
many gaps in the colossal wall began to descend the mountain




chapter lxiii


the midday sun was illuminating the peaks and darting its beams into
the narrowest and darkest ravines of these mountains when don hernan
at the head of his little army rode to the crest of a hill and looked
down upon the narrow but beautiful valley of tonan opening on the
fields of otompan or as the name has been more euphonically rendered
by spaniards otumba the level vale itself as well as the hills on
both sides as far up at least as the gentleness of their slope
allowed such cultivation was sprinkled with maize fields which being
now at their utmost point of luxuriance covered such places with
intense verdure while the green forests that here and there
overshadowed the upper ridges with flowery cliffs protruding from their
waving tops added the charm of solitude to the pleasant prospect of
human habitation but there was one accidental beauty at present
revealed which however disagreeable and even terrible to the leader
he could not but acknowledge in his heart to surpass all the others

at the cry with which the general beheld this phenomenon his followers
rushed up to his side and perceived the whole valley as it
seemed beginning at the bottom of the ridge they now stood upon and
extending not only from hill to hill but as far as the eye could
see filled and indeed blocked up with enemies the white and scarlet
hues of their garments the plumes of divers colours waving on their
heads like a sea of feathers over whose surging surface there passed
here a bright sunbeam and there the shadow of a cloud the glittering
of copper spears of volcanic falchions and of jewels for this day
the pagans decorated themselves as for a triumph in their richest
array produced a scene which was indeed both glorious and terrific
through this human flood don hernan knew he must conduct his weary and
despairing people but without daring to hope that the hand which had
parted the sea of the desert from before the steps of the israelites
would open for him a path through this equally fearful obstruction

the christians gathered round their leader in silence the loud roar of
shouts sounding from below as if a whole world shrieked at once shook
the mountain under their feet but they replied not every man was at
that moment commending his soul to his maker for each knew there was
no path of escape except though that valley and felt in addition
that perhaps not even the whole army fresh well-appointed full of
spirits and resolution as when on st john's day it entered the city
of the lake could have made any impression on such a multitude
displayed in such a position the very extremity of the case was the
best counsel to meet it with fortitude every man considered his life
already doomed beyond respite and with such consciousness looked
forward to his fate with tranquillity their sufferings by famine and
fatigue on the road though the mutinous and lamenting fugitives did not
then know it had better prepared them to encounter such a battle-field
than a series of victories with spoils of gold and bread for these
torments having already rendered their lives burdensome they were not
greatly frighted at the prospect of ending them these causes then
added to the fury of fanaticism never entirely at rest in the bosom of
the invaders will account for their resolution and even impatience to
attack an army rated by many of the conquerors at two hundred thousand
men had they been happier men they would not have rushed upon such
manifest destruction

the priest olmedo stretched forth his arm holding a crucifix christian
and tlascalan knelt down upon the flinty ridge and mingled together
sullen prayers

as they rose the ever-composed sandoval cried out emphatically 

now my merry men all gentlemen hidalgos and gentlemen commoners god
hath this day given us a great opportunity to signalize our
valour which was all the oration it occurred to his imagination to
make the soldiers looked upon him with a gloomy indifference then out
spoke the hotheaded alvarado

there be to my reckoning in yonder plain he said with a grin of
desperation some five hundred thousand men we have of our own body
some four hundred and fifty christian soldiers and we may count the two
thousand tlascalans here at our heels for fifty more which just
leaves us a thousand dogs apiece to fight in yonder vale if we gain the
victory over such odds never believe me if we be not clapped down in
books by that german enchanter faust who hath invented a way of making
them in such numbers as being more heroical men than either don
alejandro the great emperor of egypt or some other country or don
rodrigo himself who was much greater than any such dog of a heathen
king this much i will say that never before had starving men such a
chance of dying like knights of renown and as doubtless god will send
us some fifty or an hundred thousand angels to fight on our side we
may chance stumble on a victory in hope of which or in the certainty
on the other hand of going to heaven i say santiago and at them for
their bodies are covered with gold and jewels

god will help us cried cortes and my friend alvarado hath very
justly said that there is a rich spoil in that valley for victors
though there be here perhaps fifty thousand men or more yet are they
infidels and therefore but as sparrows and gnats before the face of
god's soldiers there are also acres of very sweet corn in the valley
and beyond yon yelling herds are the gates of tlascala but let it not
be thought i will this day compel the sword of any christian yonder
are the hill-tops there are dens enow wherein one may give his bones
to wild-cats and there be tall cliffs from which they who prefer such
end may throw themselves and straightway be beyond the reach of
battle for myself though but one man follow me yet will i descend to
that plain walk through that multitude and marshalling an hundred
thousand tlascalans after i have rested me a little return by the
same path we are now treading to the gates of mexico to revenge upon
such as yonder scum the death of my brothers who are in heaven as
well as to lay claim to those rich lands and mines of gold which are
our right and which it is yet our destiny to overmaster if ye be
minded to disperse and starve among the hills let me be acquainted with
your resolution if ye will fight like soldiers and christians speak
out your good thoughts and in god's name let us begin

we will fight muttered the desperate men

at this moment some strong clear voice from the company began to
pronounce the words of the chant kyrie eleison and the rest joining
in cortes gave the signal to descend and thus they went slowly down
towards the host invoking mercy and singing the praises of god and
waxing in boldness and fanaticism as they sang until the neighbouring
rocks rang with the loud and solemn echoes of devotion

whatever was the piety of don hernan it did not however prevent his
taking all the steps which could be expected of a general in such a
situation and one while joining loudly with others in the chant and
at another pausing to give deliberate instructions to his officers he
arranged the order and expedients of battle before the wild anthem was
concluded his instructions were simple and related but to one point
he counselled no one to be valiant for he knew the veriest coward in
the ranks would be compelled to deeds of heroism that day he only
commanded that the little troop of horse should form five deep and
follow him whithersoever he might lead and that the footmen should keep
their ranks close and follow after the horse he knew as indeed did
most of his followers that the orders conveyed to a mexican army by a
mexican general instead of being transmitted from division to
division by messengers were directly communicated to all by the
general himself through the medium of the great banner which he bore
in his own hands and from the lofty litter on which he was carried
kept ever displayed to the eyes of his warriors a few simple motions of
this royal telegraph sufficed to convey all the directions which a
barbarous commander was required to bestow upon a barbarous army among
these the vailing or dropping the standard was the well-known signal
of retreat and whether it might be lowered by the general himself or
struck from his hands by some fortunate foe still it was equally
certain that in either case his followers would immediately upon
seeing it fall betake themselves to flight when cortes eyed this
immense multitude he calculated the chances of victory not by the
probabilities of routing it but by those of making his way to the great
banner

the imperial standard which in the tongue of mexico bore the horribly
uncouth title of tlahunmatlaxopilli was conspicuously visible even
from the mountain aztaquemacan which the spaniards were now descending
in the centre of the pagan army was a group of warriors made remarkable
by the height and splendour of their penachos the glittering of their
jewelled decorations and the sheen of their copper lances the blades
of which like some that had been seen in mexico were full a yard in
length and polished so that they shone like gold these were the
guards a body of young nobles which surrounded the person of the
general to protect the banner from violence in the centre of this
group upon a litter of almost imperial gorgeousness stood the stately
barbarian bearing on a long pike-staff the standard which was a sort
of net-work made of chains of gold and therefore a more significant
emblem of the object of conquest and the fate of subjugation than any
banner of a christian nation even at this day a few white feathers
waving amongst the links kept it ever conspicuous

as don hernan descended he explained to the horsemen his design to
merge every other object in that of seizing the mexican standard a
project which met the concurrence of each

all that i have now to say to you he added when approaching the base
of the hill is to charge with me at half-speed and take no thought
of slaying those of you who have ever endured the bastinado of a
pedagogue will remember that julius cæsar or some such knave of a
paynim it matters not who being opposed in some civil war to certain
cohorts of young gallants and hidalgos of rome directed his archers to
spare the lives but to let fly at the faces of these lady-puppets a
counsel of infinite wisdom for i remember that in my youth until i
got this gash o the chin from a gentleman of saragossa which somewhat
spoils the beauty of my beard i had a mortal aversion to fight with any
man much given to striking at the face what i have to advise
therefore is that you will imitate the wisdom of that same roman
hound and lance your spears full at the eyes of all who may oppose you
i have given charge to the footmen to finish our work while they are
slaughtering such curs as are not satisfied with scratched faces we
will make free with yon same knave of the gold net let it be
reckoned and tis worth a king's ransom the prize of him who
overthrows the general hark hear ye how the infidels shout are ye
ready in the name of god the virgin and santiago have at them now
like men amen santiago santiago

thus shouting his war-cry for now the horsemen had reached the bottom
of the hill don hernan couched his spear with four cavaliers at his
side of whom don amador de leste was one and followed by all the
others dashed furiously at the first ranks of the mexicans who were
already rushing against him

the savages sprang aside flinging their javelins and swords at the hot
christians and raining arrows on their armed bodies but ever though
thus expressing their hostility yielding rank after rank before the
irresistible charge until it became apparent to the most doubting that
they might succeed at last in reaching the banner they therefore
redoubled their exertions shouted the names of their saints and aiming
continually at the eyes of the foe made such progress that they were
already almost as it seemed within reach of the prize when a yell of
the indians of more than ordinary loudness echoed by the infantry with
exclamations of alarm brought them to a sudden stand

they had penetrated deeply into the mass but it was as a noble ship
ploughs her way through billows which yield and divide only to unite
again in her wake and roar after in pursuit from their lofty seats
they could overlook the multitude and behold how quickly the path they
had carved was filled up by screaming barbarians rushing turbulently
after them while others dashed in like numbers and with equal
ferocity upon the footmen now left far behind

as they looked thus over their shoulders they paused with surprise and
even perturbation for they perceived furiously descending the slope of
the hill on the left hand against the infantry which was already sorely
beset what seemed a christian cavalier in black armour mounted on a
noble bay horse and couching a lance like a trained soldier only that
behind him there followed with savage yells a band of several
thousand indians bearing the well-known colours of tenochtitlan itself

god be our stay cried the general looking aghast at this astonishing
apparition have we here an infidel god in very deed risen up against
us and riding a-horse like a christian man avoid thee satan and all
good saints spurn thee again to the pit from which thou comest

tis mexitli himself cried one

tis the devil said another

look exclaimed don pedro he rushes down upon the footmen like a
rock tumbled from the hill-top and hark heard ever man such horrible
voice tis mahound tis satan now all good angels befriend us

for my part said don amador de leste 

but before his words had yet been heard by any of his companions they
were cut short by such loud and thrilling cries of joy from the infantry
as equally confounded the cavaliers

elo santiago elo nuestro buen amigo el valoroso santiago that
is to say lo st james behold our good friend the valiant st
james burst from the lips of the footmen in a frenzy of triumph

the cavaliers looked again but to the opposite mountain and beheld
upon that as upon the other an armed and mounted cavalier descending
with lance in rest and with the speed of thunder as if rushing to a
tournay with him of the black armour but without being followed by any
one excepting a single youth who staggered far behind

at this sight the cavaliers uttered loud cries of joy not doubting
that st james had indeed come to rescue them from the claws of the
accursed mexitli as they began to consider the black phantom

our saint fights for us cried cortes on leave the black fiend to
him on and let him behold our valour the standard ho santiago is
nigh the standard the standard

the sight of the second apparition seemed to have smitten the pagans
with as much terror as the view of their own champion had infused into
the spaniards the young nobles who surrounded the banner looked to the
vision with awe and ere they had yet recovered from their confusion
the christian cavaliers elated and invigorated fell upon them with
such violence as left the long copper lances useless in their hands

on and quick shouted don hernan or the knavish colour-man will
spring from his perch and so rob ye of the gold on ho on hah
infidel art thou not mine own

as he uttered these last words he rose on his stirrups stretched over
his horse's neck and handling his heavy spear as one would an ordinary
javelin launched it with all his force at the chief there was never a
better mark for the barbarian instead of showing as cortes had
hinted any desire to desert his litter advanced to its very verge and
while he balanced the staff and its weighty crest with his left hand
whirled manfully a short dart round his head looking all the while at
the great teuctli there never was a better mark for his breast
covered with a flimsy hauberk of skins on which were sewed thin plates
of gilded copper was fully exposed there never was a better aim
before the dart had left his grasp the spear of don hernan smote him on
the chest and piercing copper and bone alike hurled him backwards
with the standard out of the litter

the cavaliers shouted victory and trampling down the litter-bearers
and the young nobles as these began to fly looked eagerly for the
prize

have the knaves robbed us hah mad john of salamanca thou pickest
my pocket of these crowns dost thou

these words of don hernan were addressed to a young hidalgo who the
moment he had perceived the spear of cortes take effect had flung
himself from his pied steed rushed upon the downfallen infidel and
striking his sword into his throat tore from him the badges of
authority

he who strikes the quarry said the elated youth flinging both plume
and golden net over the neck of his general's horse has the true claim
to the trophy

keep them thyself for thou hast won them and if don carlos be of
mind brave juan thou shalt mount them for thy coat of arms soho de
leste where art thou i thought this prize should have been thine

de leste has gone mad said alvarado shall we chase the runagates
see how they scamper

the words of alvarado were true no sooner had the golden banner fallen
from its height and been lost among the combatants than there rose a
dismal yell over the whole valley and the vast multitudes those near
at hand and those afar alike began to fly and in the utmost
confusion

victory praise be to god to god and our noble st james cried
cortes with a shout that thrilled to the hearts of the flying pagans
follow not the knaves leave them to the foot to the allies and our
mighty champion the saint soho de leste return follow not after
the knaves

tis de olid cried don pedro that halloos the hunt's-up i tell
thee de leste is mad

back to our champion said cortes hah what saidst thou of de
leste

that he is gone mad raving besottishly and very blasphemously mad
and that he deserted us the moment he saw thee fling thy spear

god forbid the youth should prove to be as was his kinsman before his
death-day said cortes for a more gallant and sufficient soldier
though somewhat self-willed have i never beheld mad sayst thou

he swore to me first said alvarado with a devout shrug that that
paynim god mexitli descending the hill yonder was mounted on his own
good horse fogoso which seems to me not unreasonable for fogoso was
in some sense the best charger lost that night which god punish to
the heathen for ever and doubtless huitzilopochtli if determined to
go out a pricking like a christian knight-errant would be wise enough
to pick up the best ghost of christian horse and secondly continued
don pedro crossing himself he swore that his most holy valour
santiago who came down from the hill-top to help us was no more than
the ghost of his kinsman the knight calavar who was drowned horse and
all in the salt lake near to iztapalapan but ho halon let us
follow the hunt

ha my masters cried don hernan let us return and fathom this
marvel for it may bode us much to know but stay i will not rob ye of
pastime as many of ye as will spur after the hounds and aid the
tlascalans

so saying and the foes now being scattered in flight over the
neighbouring hills the general returned towards the infantry while the
cavaliers shouting as if in a boar-chase urged their steeds up the
hills in pursuit of the fugitives

thus was fought and thus won a battle in which four hundred and fifty
spaniards aided by a handfull of tlascalans contended with a host of
such incredible numbers that to this day men remember it with wonder
and would reject it as a fable were it not that the testimony of a
thousand facts has placed it beyond the reach of question




chapter lxiv


what alvarado had reported of don amador was true the neophyte averred
that dead or alive a spectre or a creature of flesh and blood the
steed bestridden by the sable phantom and urged with such fury against
the footmen was neither less nor more than his own good beast fogoso
and he declared with even more impetuosity as don pedro had related
that the figure descending the opposite hill was the knight of
calavar on his ancient war-horse an apparition perhaps but no st
james unless this heavenly patron had condescended to appear in the
likeness of a knight so valiant and so pious strange fancies beset him
and so great was his impatience to resolve the marvel that he scarce
waited to behold the general balance his good spear before he turned
his horse and spurred furiously backward

meanwhile the black horseman descended with such violence upon the
footmen as threatened their instant destruction his fierce eyes as
the christians thought gleaming with the fires of hell so that
notwithstanding the sudden relief coming in the person of the supposed
saint they were seized with horror and gave way before him at the
moment when he rushed among them uttering what seemed the lelilee of
another land he was encountered by his celestial opponent whose strong
voice shouted out god and st john and down with thee paynim demon

the shock of two such steeds both of great weight each bearing a man
cased in thick armour each urged on by the impetus of descent from the
hills and meeting midway in a narrow valley was tremendous at the
moment of encounter the sable rider perceived for the first time his
opponent he checked his steed suddenly and flung up his lance as if
to avoid a contest but the precaution came too late his rising lance
struck the casque of his adversary tearing it off and revealing the
grim visage and grizzly locks of the knight of calavar while at the
same moment the spear of don gabriel aimed with as much skill as
determination smote the enemy on the lower part of the corslet and
piercing it as a buckler of ice penetrated at once to the bowels and
spine the shock that unseated the riders was shared by the steeds and
horse and man rolled together on the earth

the loud cry of calavar the penitent knight the valiant don gabriel
set up by the bewildered and awe-struck infantry reached the ears of
the novice he spurred on with new ardour and reaching the footmen just
as they divided in pursuit of the flying barbarians he sprung from his
horse and beheld his kinsman lying senseless and as it appeared to
him lifeless in the arms of the wounded baltasar

in the name of heaven and amen what is this and what do i see he
cried oh heaven is this my knight and doth he live

he lives said baltasar and he feels as of flesh and blood and yet
did he die on the lake-side god forgive us our sins for neither heaven
nor hell will hold the dead

just at that moment the knight opened his eyes and rolled them on his
kinsman but his kinsman regarded him not a low moaning voice of one
never to be forgotten fell on the ear of the novice as he gazed on his
friend and starting up he beheld hard by the page jacinto lying on
the body of abdalla from whose head he had torn the helm and now
strove with feeble fingers to remove the broken and blood-stained
corslet

jacinto leila cried amador with a voice of rapture flinging
himself at her side for now though the garments of escaupil still
concealed the figure of the moorish maid the disguise could be
continued no longer the joy of the cavalier vanished for the maiden
replied only with lamentations while the zegri fixed upon him an eye
in which the stony hardness of death was mingled with the fires of
human passion

place my head upon thine arm cavalier said abdalla faintly and
let me look upon him who has slain me

oh my father my father cried the moorish girl

god forbid that thou shouldst die even for the sake of the maiden i
love exclaimed amador eagerly supporting his head thou art a wali
a christian and the father of her that dwells in my heart live
therefore for though thou have neither land nor people neither home
nor friends neither brother nor champion yet am i all to thee for i
crave the love of thy daughter

the maiden sobbed and heard not the words of the cavalier but the
dying moor eyed her with a look of joy and then turning his gaze upon
amador said 

god be thy judge as thou dealest truly with her who although the
offspring of kings is yet an orphan landless homeless and friendless
on the earth

i swear to thee said the novice and i protest  

protest me nothing hearken to my words for they are few the angel of
death calls to me to come and my moments fly from me like the
blood-drops said the zegri until the day when i dreamed thou wert
slumbering in the lake i knew not of this that hath passed between ye
had it been known to me perhaps this death that comes to me might not
have come for what i did i did for the honour and weal of my child
knowing that in the hand of spaniards she was in the power of
oppressors and villains that i have struck for revenge is true i have
shed the blood of castilians and rejoiced for therein i reckoned me the
vengeance of granada yet had it been apparent to me that the feeble
maid who besides myself knew no other protector of innocence in the
world could have claimed the love of an honourable cavalier and
enjoyed it without the shame of disguise and menial occupation then had
i submitted to my fate and locked up in the darkness of my heart the
memory of the alpujarras

who speaks of the alpujarras cried the knight of rhodes staring
wildly around who speaks of the alpujarras

i said the moor with a firm voice bending his eye on don gabriel
and striving though in vain for his nether limbs were paralyzed to
turn his body likewise i gabriel of calavar i speak of the
alpujarras and good reason have i to speak and thou to listen for i
was of the mourning and thou of the destroyers

pity me heaven cried the knight staring on the moor in the
greatest disorder i have seen thee and yet i know thee not

rememberest thou not the field of zugar and the oath sworn on the
cross of a blood-stained sword by the river-side

hah cried don gabriel dost thou speak of mine oath mine oath to
alharef

and the town of bucarcs among the hills continued the zegri loudly
and with a frown made still more ghastly by approaching death dost
thou remember the false and felon blow that smote the friend of
zugar and that still falser and fouler which shed the blood of
zayda the beloved of the alpujarras

as the wali spoke the knight as if uplifted by some supernatural
power rose to his feet and approached the speaker staring at him with
eyes of horror at the name of zayda he dropt on his knees crying 

miserere mei deus i slew her and thou that art alharef though
struck down by the same sword yet livest thou again to upbraid me

struck down by thy steel yet not then but now exclaimed the moor
i live again but not to upbraid thee i am alharef-ben-ismail and i
forgive thee

at this name already made of such painful interest to the novice his
astonishment was so great that as he started he had nearly suffered
the dying prince for such were the walis of moorish spain to fall to
the earth he caught him again in his arms and turned his amazed eye
from him to don gabriel who trembling in every limb still stared with
a distracted countenance on that of his ancient preserver

i am alharef and though dying yet do i live went on the zegri
interrupted as much by the wails of his daughter as by his own
increasing agonies the sword wounded but it slew not it slew not
all zayda fell yet live i to tell thee thou art forgiven rash
man rash and most unhappy thine anger was unjust and therefore didst
thou shed the blood of the good the pure the loving and the beautiful
and thereby cover thyself and him that was thy true friend with
misery when thou soughtest the love of zayda she was the betrothed of
alharef miserable art thou gabriel of calavar and therefore have i
forgiven thee miserable art thou for i have watched thee by night and
looked upon thee by day and seen that the asp was at work in thy bosom
and that the fire did not slumber great was thy sin but greater is thy
grief and therefore doth zayda who is in heaven forgive thee

she pardons me not murmured don gabriel not a moment relaxing the
steadfast eagerness of his stare at the pyramid of cholula on the
anniversary of her death she appeared to me in person and o god with
the beauty of her youth and innocence yet robed in the blackness of
anger

and have thine eyes been as dark as the looks of the lover cried
alharef stand up zayda the child of zayda or turn thy face upon
calavar that his delusion may leave him

as he spoke he lifted feebly the arm which embraced his child removed
the cap and parted the thick clustering locks from her forehead
still however did she look rather the effeminate boy upon whom
calavar had been accustomed to gaze than a woman for there is no
effort of imagination stronger than that required to transform in the
mind the object which preserves an unchanging appearance to the eye
nevertheless though such a transformation could not be imagined by don
gabriel there came as he wistfully surveyed the pallid features of the
maiden strange visions and memories which every moment associated a
stronger resemblance between the living and the dead he trembled still
more violently heavy dew-drops started from his brow and he gazed upon
the weeping girl as upon a basilisk

wherefore continued the zegri speaking rapidly but with broken
accents when i had resolved to fly to the pagans as being men whom
i thought god had commissioned me to defend from rapine and slavery i
resolved to take such advantage of their credulity as might best enable
me to befriend them i say wherefore i resolved this i need not
speak i protected my child by recommending her to their superstition
and had i fallen dead in the streets still did i know that reverence
and fear would wait upon the steps of one whom i delivered to them as a
messenger from heaven in this light i revealed her to the princes at
the temple when  

it is enough muttered don gabriel with the deep and agitated tones
of sorrow i wake from a dream god forgive me and thou art of the
blood of zayda the child of her whom i slew alharef forgives me he
says that zayda forgives me but thou that art her child dost thou
forgive me

father dear father she doth cried amador gazing with awe on the
altered countenance of alharef and listening with grief to the moans of
zayda o holy padre he exclaimed perceiving the priest olmedo
rising at a little distance from the side of a man to whom he had
been offering the last consolations of religion hither father for
the love of heaven and absolve the soul of a dying christian

is there a priest at my side said the zegri reviving from what
seemed the lethargy of approaching dissolution and looking eagerly into
the face of the good olmedo then turning to amador he said solemnly
though with broken words thou lovest the orphan zayda

heaven be my help as i do replied the cavalier

and thou gabriel that wert my friend and standest in the light of
this young man's parent dost thou consent that he shall espouse the
daughter of zayda saved while a piteous infant by christian men from
out the house of death

the knight bowed his head on his breast and strove to answer but in
his agitation could not speak a word

quick father for heaven's sake quick cried alharef eagerly let
me ere i die know that my child rests on the bosom of a husband
quick for the sand runs fast and there is that in my bosom which
tells me of death love and honour thy bride for thou hast the last and
noblest relic of granada take her thou wert her protector from harsh
words and the violence of blows quick father quick quick for mine
eyes are glazing

the strangely timed and hurried ceremony was hastened by the
exclamations of alharef and the words of nuptial benediction were at
last hurriedly pronounced

i see thee not my child muttered the moor immediately after my
blessing to thee amador gabriel thou art forgiven thine arm round
my neck zayda thy lips to mine would that i could see thee get thee
to granada with thy lord to the tomb of thy mother i will follow
thee tarry not in this land of blood i will be with thee we have a
power yet in the hills  

let the cross rest on thy lips if thou diest a christian said the
father

the novice drew the maiden aside the zegri pressed the sacred symbol to
his lips but still they muttered strangely of granada

i am of the faith of christ and mahomet i defy my people shall be
followers of the cross but they shall sweep away the false spaniard as
the wind brushes away the leaves the emir of oran is prepared the
king of morocco will follow a power in the hills ah we will creep
by night to granada a brave blow africa shall follow ha ha seize
the gates storm the alhambra but spare life kill no women remember
zayda  

with such wild words accompanied by the faint cries of his daughter
the spirit of the moor passed away and alharef-ben-ismail lay dead in
the land of strangers

don gabriel uttered a deep groan and fell across the feet of his
ancient friend

at this moment cortes descended from his horse and followed by other
cavaliers stepped up to the lamenting group

and calavar the valiant has been murdered by this traitor moor he
cried

señor don hernan said the novice sternly and as he spoke rising
from the earth and folding the moorish maiden to his heart you speak
of him who was alharef-ben-ismail a wali of granada driven by the
injustice of our companions and in part by your own harshness to take
arms against you as one that am now his representative and as i may
say his son i claim for him the honourable burial of a christian
soldier and after that will hold myself prepared with sword and
spear to defend his memory from insult




chapter lxv


a few words will finish the first part of the chronicle of don
cristobal

the victory so marvellously gained removed the last obstruction from
the path of the spaniards the ensuing day beheld them entering the
territories of their allies and in four days more the chiefs of
tlascala ushered them with songs of joy into the republican city

six days after this happy event the novice of rhodes sat by the
death-bed of his kinsman from the moment when calavar roused out of
the fit of unconsciousness into which he had fallen on the field of
otumba his brain wandered with delirium but it gave his young kinsman
as well as the faithful baltasar much relief to perceive that his
visions were oftener of a pleasant than a disagreeable character thus
the reappearance of alharef after such long seeming death dwelt in his
memory without the recollection of his subsequent decease and with
this came the conceit that zayda yet lived among the alpujarras
restored like the wali to life and all forgetful of the wrongs he had
done her he prattled of returning now to spain and now to rhodes and
now of making a pilgrimage to the holy land it is true that
sometimes dark thoughts crept to his brain and agitated him with his
former griefs but these were ever chased away by the sight of leila
whose countenance seemed to him as that of a holy seraph sent from
heaven to bid him be of good cheer

on the fifth day he recovered his senses and being sensible of his
approaching dissolution assembled at his bed-side after having
received absolution the padre olmedo and the few friends and followers
whom heaven had spared him in this pagan land being the young cavalier
of cuenza the melancholy zayda or leila as amador yet loved to call
her and baltasar the spear of alharef had not harmed him he was
dying the victim of a long remorse or rather as it may be said he
expired when the excitement of this passion no longer supported him
for perhaps the same thing may be said of many mental diseases which
is true of certain physical ones to which a human constitution has been
long accustomed that is they may obtain so vital a command over all
its functions as to become in themselves the elements or at least the
bulwarks of life so that when they are arrested by some unskilful
leech death shall almost immediately follow the cure

i have now called you my children he said bending an eye of
affection upon the pair and speaking very feebly to give you such
counsel as may be drawn from the history of my life its secrets are
revealed to you its pages all lie open and as you read your spirits
will find their own instruction for they will discover that the
indulgence of passion especially the passion of anger doth lodge a
barb in the bosom never to be plucked out save by the hand of death
what i have to say is rather of command than advice and thou wilt
listen to me amador my son for god hath given thee in the person of
this gentle zayda an argument of obedience which will touch thy heart
more eloquently than words break thy sword hack off thy spurs cast
thine armour into the sea and think no more of war unless to defend
thy fire-side and the altars of thy country from the fury of
invaders

the novice started with alarm

think not that i rave said the knight i speak to thee with the
wisdom that comes from the grave think no more of war for war it is
that rouses our passions and passions have made me what i have been
and what i am i cannot think now for at this moment methinks i
stand in the presence of him who abhorreth contention that he will
pardon the shedding of any blood except that which the necessity of
self-preservation and the defence of our country enforce us to lavish
i repent me of that which i have poured though even from the hearts of
pagans for pagans are still the sons of god though walking in
darkness for which we should pity them not slay thou hast drawn thy
sword for glory but the lives that are taken for fame shall weigh upon
the souls of men as murders for such they are thou drawest for
religion give thy purse to the priest and bid him convert with the
cross for the wrath of god will rest for ever upon him who maketh
proselytes with the sword wo is me that the delusions of glory and
christian zeal have stained me so deeply live for happiness and thou
shalt wrong none neither man nor god and thus happiness shall be
awarded thee live for honour and thou shalt know that heaven
acknowledges none but that which is justice live for peace which is
virtue and for religion which is goodness get thee to thy castle to
the lands which thou shalt inherit plant thy vines and olives relieve
the unhappy succour the distressed and if thy young brother should
pant for the barb and lance teach him the history of thy kinsman be
virtuous be peaceful be charitable and be happy when thou hearest of
glory bethink thee of the poor deluded creatures we have slain in this
land when thou art told of pious crusades remember the days of the
alpujarras would that my days were to pass again

he paused with exhaustion

the noble knight said the padre hath spoken much good and wholesome
truth nevertheless in the matter of infidels what he has counselled
is not well for how is it written  

holy father murmured don gabriel there be men enow who will obey
thee in this matter and without exhortation or argument defeat not my
work for i rob thee of but one let me think that the son of my
affection will dwell in peace and thereby be clean in the eyes of god
and thus happy at his death-hour would that i might appear before my
maker without the stain of blood

with a few more such precepts of virtue for grief and the hand of death
had made his heart wise don gabriel continued to address the novice he
spoke many words of kindness also to the old and faithful baltasar
and was about to give his benediction to the child of zayda when a film
came suddenly over his eyes

give me thy hand he muttered faintly and almost inarticulately i
see thee not but mine eyes are opened to zayda where art thou amador
my son heaven is blissful alharef zayda all miserere mei
domine  thus he murmured for a moment his voice dwindling to a
whisper then his lips moved but without yielding any sound until at
last it was apparent that he had expired and yet so gently that not
even a spasm of muscle or change of countenance indicated the passage
of his spirit

 

three days after this at sunrise the señor cortes stood alone with don
amador de leste on the terrace of the great dwelling in which he had
quartered the remains of his army

thou leavest me then de leste he said in a low voice looking
westward to the hills beyond which lay the valley of the lakes

such is my purpose very noble señor said the cavalier mildly but
firmly my horses are caparisoned in the court-yard my little company
is in waiting my friends have been saluted and nothing remains for me
but to thank your excellency for your many manifestations of goodness to
me and mine the living and the dead together and to pray your
excellency wish me god speed

and can you look upon yonder blue cliffs and those snow-capt
pinnacles said don hernan with a smothered voice and think of
leaving the paradise they encompass in the hands of the heathen

i know not said don amador that it becomes me to intrude any advice
upon your excellency but you have already done deeds as i am myself a
witness which will give you immortal fame though you should proceed no
farther in the impossible attempt to subjugate this very potent and
wonderful empire

it shall be mine said cortes smiting his hands together and
speaking with clenched teeth though there were but an hundred men left
with me nay were there but ten i would sooner that they should see
me rent under the tusks of the wild mountain hogs than turning my back
for ever against the city of montezuma thou thinkest the case is
desperate yet with those ten christians and the hundreds of thousands
of disaffected barbarians whom i will gather together thou shalt hear
perhaps ere thou art housed in thy mountain castle of cuenza that he
whom thou leavest is the lord of mexico and the valiant men who remain
by him the barons and counts of the great empire

with mine own hills of olive and cork have i enough to content me
said the novice coldly

and thou carest not to revenge thy friends massacred so barbarously
that fatal night flames be on the soul of the enchanter for ever
exclaimed the general bursting into fury at the recollection

i say god pardon him replied amador and god receive to his rest
those friends of whom you speak i have naught to revenge i lament
their fate which was dreadful but i acknowledge that they were slain
in honourable combat

and thou carest not then to strike for the cause of christ and aid in
the conversion of countless souls from perdition

the cavalier regarded his general with a meaning eye cortes felt the
reproof and catching his hand said hastily 

it is enough thou hast a young and tender wife who would have dreamed
that such a creature walked with us throughout that night it is right
thou shouldst desire to bear her from these scenes of tumult and not
unnatural thou shouldst wish to share the peace and happiness to which
thou art conducting her for myself i sometimes think of my own fair
doña in the island and the pleasant sound of the surf rolling by
night on the beach under her lattice but nevertheless there are in
this same heathen clime certain charms which cause me to forget the
fair catalina and my merry brats into the bargain

for me said the novice sadly there is nothing in this land but
melancholy alharef sire of zayda sleeps under a rock at otumba and
calavar whom i may call my father since such he was to me now rests
in yon grove on the hill-side i have buried a faithful servant in the
lake and a good youth whom i loved an old follower of my knight and
a very dear friend i shall think of the land with regret yet must i
leave it without a sigh i have hopes to find me some conveyance to the
islands and there thank heaven it is not so difficult to light upon a
trader of seville bound on the homeward voyage

if thou art indeed resolute to depart said cortes i have it in my
power not only to wish thee god speed but to give thee a good ship of
my fleet at ulua commanded by thy very noble kinsman which he will
doubtless man to thy liking with choice sailors and wherein thou
canst proceed instantly to spain without the tedious necessity of
touching at cuba

the eyes of the neophyte sparkled don hernan smiled

assuredly said he i am rejoiced to pleasure thee so much and yet
thou wilt thyself confer upon me a very ineffable obligation by sailing
in that same good ship and taking charge of a certain letter i have
here written to his majesty our lord don carlos being the second
despatch wherein i have presumed to acquaint him with the success of our
arms fighting in his cause and in that of the holy church if it may
suit your convenience to bear the same in person to his imperial
majesty i hope you will have no cause to repent doing me so great a
favour

i will bear it to his majesty in person said the novice taking the
sealed packet laying it upon his forehead in token of fealty and then
warmly grasping the general's hand i will do this with much
satisfaction and in memory that thou hast upon three several
occasions done me such personal service as touches me to answer with a
life's thankfulness if there be any other act wherein i can pleasure
thee i pray thee command me to the same without any reserve for i
will consider that thou dost thereby acquaint me with a way to testify
my gratitude

i thank you said don hernan i have no commission with which i will
dare further to trouble you and yet and yet and yet he hesitated a
moment and his lip slightly quivered but instantly resuming an air of
indifference he continued if it should suit your good
convenience that is if you should prefer to travel rather by the
hot mountains of estremadura than the barren ridges of la mancha while
passing to the court at madrid i would crave of your goodness to
inquire me out a certain village called medellin that lieth on the
guadiana some few leagues above the city of merida

were it an hundred leagues and they of the rudest said amador i
should be no less ready to do your bidding but give me to know when i
am arrived at this same village of medellin in what i can pleasure
you

inquire me out said cortes a certain old man a poor hidalgo
called martin cortes as also his wife catalina by my conscience
señor they are my father and mother and they will have some joy to
hear you speak of me

now i vow to heaven cried amador struck by the sudden and
impetuous tone of feeling which don hernan strove to hide under a burst
of gayety i am sorry they live not as far away as pampeluna at once
that i might show you the readiness with which i will be your messenger
for herein do i perceive i shall be looked on by them as a good
angel sent to them from heaven

be not over-sanguine said cortes affecting a laugh for by my
conscience if you tell her not every thing to her liking my mother
hath somewhat of a shrewish way of admonishing you nevertheless it is
enough it hath been some long years since they have heard of my
whereabout and my what-about since sooth to say i one day played them
a dog's trick and a month after was chasing the indians in cuba it
will greatly amaze them to hear i have not been absolutely hanged as my
mother oft-times promised me for my sins and surely they will stare
at you when you tell them i have been killing a great emperor as some
idle fellows have charged on me whereas you know yourself having been
so forward to shield him that montezuma was slain by his own people a
murrain on them

i will bear witness to the truth and i will say nothing that can give
them pain

i shall be much beholden to you said don hernan eagerly for my
mother is somewhat more righteous than other women and might be
convinced out of the mouths of some of my friends that i am given to
godless acts on occasions which is very false and slanderous i will
beseech you to bear them certain curious jewels and trifles of golden
ware the fabric of my good savages here more as mementos of my
gracelessness than as presents of affection seeing that they are of
no great value they are such curiosities as will make mine old
play-mates stare ah the rascals they were all better than i at their
books and somewhat less acquainted with the pedagogue's palm but
pho he continued suddenly dropping the tone of bagatelle with which
he had spoken i do but fool the time your steed neighs in the
court-yard your lady looks up to the terrace i will detain you no
longer the king's letter which you bear will authorize you to demand
of the admiral the best ship in our small navy as also to have it
sailored and provisioned to your mind and therein you can voyage at
your good pleasure to the guadalquivir i have presumed to order in
waiting subject to your command a company of guides consisting of
four castilian soldiers ten tlascalans and thrice as many totonacs of
the coast with whom you will take your own will as to speed though i
recommend you to submit to theirs in the matter of the road commend me
to your kinsman the admiral as also very truly to my parents and if
the emperor should see fit to express doubts of the success of this
enterprise in which i am engaged tell him that i hernan cortes do
say and i gage my head for the fulfilment of the same that the land
shall be his all that lies between the two seas and betwixt the
narrow neck of panama to the south and the huge isle of florida to the
north this i promise and this i will fulfil and now señor giving
you my thanks for the good deeds you have already done me as well as
those which you meditate and wishing to your fair and noble wife a
green path by land and a smooth way by sea i do very truly and
devoutly and from the bottom of my heart pray you god speed remember
me for you shall hear of me yet

so saying the two cavaliers descended and parted don amador de leste
to cross the seas and discharging the commands of his friend both to
the ancient hidalgo of medellin and the great charles of austria to
seek for happiness in his castle of alcornoque in the society of his
moorish bride and hernan cortes to ponder alone upon the fall of
tenochtitlan




conclusion


of the secondary characters of this history enough has been already
narrated our respect however for the memory of the magician botello
requires that we should mention two circumstances in relation to his
fate and his chief and most mystical familiar his unexpected death
instead of destroying his credit among those who survived the noche
triste gave him additional claims to respect even in the grave for
when it was remembered that the arrows which slew so many spaniards
were adorned with the feathers of eagles as well as other birds of
prey they perceived in his fate only a confirmation of the juggling
subtlety of the fiends that palter with us in a double sense truly
said they botello was borne out of danger on the wings of eagles as
he prophesied albeit he was borne to heaven in after days when
mexico had become the prey of the invader the lake was dragged for the
bones of the christians who had fallen with him in the nocturnal
retreat which were then deposited with many religious ceremonies in
ground consecrated for the purpose in the last ditch at the very spot
where botello had fallen a fortunate fisherman hooked up the magic
crystal the prison of kalidon-sadabath who greatly to the horror of
the finder began instantly as of old to dance and curvet and
perform other diabolical antics in his hands no other conjurer in the
army having the skill to interpret the motions of this mysterious imp
his crystal habitation was transmitted along with divers mexican
rarities to the shelves of the escurial where it was long viewed with
wonder and respect as an instrument contrived by the hands and devoted
to its unearthly uses by the skill of the celebrated cornelius agrippa
a philosopher who was thought as was feyjoó in later days by his
countrymen to have too little consideration for vulgar prejudices
asserted after attentive examination that the marvellous crystal was
nothing more than a piece of glass hollowed by the maker into many
singular cavities wherein was deposited a coloured drop of some
volatile liquor which being at any time expanded by the heat of the
breath or of the hand would instantly dart about and assume the most
fantastic shapes according to the sinuous vacuities through which it
happened to be impelled this explanation was received with incredulity
but nevertheless kalidon of the crystal was treated with neglect and
in course of time entirely forgotten we surmise however and the
conjecture is not without argument that the enchanted crystal
presented half a century afterwards by the angel uriel to the famous
english conjurer doctor dee was no other than this identical stone
filched by the angelic thief from its dusty repository and given to him
who best knew how to put it to its proper uses

 

late in the autumn of the following year the señor don amador de leste
sat watching the sunset of a peaceful day from a little bower on a
lawn in front of his castle del alcornoque a clump of aged oaks flung
their branches over a low square and mouldering tower the work of
the moorish masters of spain many a long year back and a fragment as
it seemed of some ancient bath or fountain for a body of pure water
still made its way through the disjointed stones and fell bubbling into
a little basin beneath

the scene as beheld from this spot was one of enchanting beauty and
repose the fountain was perhaps midway on the slope of a long hill a
few rods in advance of the castle with which it was indeed connected
by a somewhat neglected walk of orange trees whose irregular turrets
and frowning battlements rose among groups of cork-trees while a broken
forest of these extended behind up to and over the crest of the hill
in front the little valley wherein was embosomed the silvery jucar
was bounded now by sharp cliffs and jutting promontories and now by
green lawns which ran sweeping upwards to the hill-tops on the opposite
side a hazy smoky atmosphere warmed into lustre by the sinking
luminary while it mellowed all objects into beauty did not conceal
from the eye the flocks of sheep which dotted the distant slopes the
cattle standing at the river-side and the groups of peasantry who
adding their songs to the lowing of the herds and the cawing of a flight
of crows urged forward the burthened ass from the vine-tree a
monastery rose in the forest a little village glimmered pleasantly on
the river bank under the shadow of a cliff and over the ridges which
shut in the valley to the south was seen the dim outline of those
sierras of morena from which might be traced the peaks of the
alpujarras

over this fair prospect the young cavalier looked with pride for it
was the inheritance handed down to him by a long line of ancestors not
snatched away by violence from vanquished moors but reclaimed from them
by a bold knight whose genealogical tree had been rooted in those
hills before tarik the arab had yet looked upon the pillars of
hercules he gazed on it also with joy for he had learned to love
peace and this seemed the chosen abode of tranquillity

it doth indeed appear to me now he muttered as if my past life
were a foolish dream there is a rapture in this quiet nook a happiness
in this prospect of loveliness and content entirely beyond any pleasure
which i ever experienced in my days of tumult and fame what can there
be to add a further charm to this paradise

perhaps he muttered this interrogatory in the spirit of an improver and
adorner of nature it was answered by the fall of a gentle footstep he
looked behind him and beheld standing at his back pausing a moment
with patient and yet dignified affection the fair figure of a woman
who had no sooner caught his eye than she smiled and pointed to a
female attendant who bore in her arms hard by a sleeping infant a
cross of rubies glittered on the lady's breast

if thou didst apprehend leila said the cavalier with eyes of joy
that i reckoned this hill-side a paradise without thinking of thyself
and my young gabriel thou didst most grievously wrong me for i protest
to thee i never cease thinking of ye

never murmured the mild voice of the moorish lady heaven be
praised but sometimes when thou lookest upon the sports of our
little brother rosario it seems to me thou dost forget us

i vow to thee my honoured and beloved lady said the hidalgo
earnestly and if thou wilt believe me the rather for that i swear by
the bright eyes of my young boy that since i discovered thou wert
alive and especially since thou hast been mine own zayda i have come
to look with new eyes upon those things which were the joys of my
youth let us sit down upon this mossy stone and while we gaze a
little upon rosario who thou seest is hacking the wooden turk's-head
on the knoll thou knowest he did so gash my young plantations of
olive-trees that i was enforced to allow him this block for his
recreation  while we thus regard him for of a truth he is a most
gallant boy and of soldierly bearing i will discourse to thee in such
manner as to convince thee that i have utterly weeded from my bosom the
foul plants of ambition and that i am equally solicitous to cleanse the
breast of my brother hah by my faith what now seest thou yonder
ill-looking lurking knave i doubt me he has been robbing my
vineyard may i die but the young varlet doth advance his sword
against him well done sir hector and he knows not i am near to give
him aidance what ho sirrah rosario put up thy sword this is no
robber

it is a pilgrim some poor pilgrim exclaimed the lady rosario
gives him his hand and leads him towards us

it was even as the fair doña had said the youth rosario who had at
first advanced valiantly towards the stranger as if to question his
right to walk so near the castle was now seen to sink his weapon speak
a word or two to the comer and then give him his hand as if to conduct
him to the cavalier

as they approached don amador could perceive that the stranger had
robed his figure in a cloak of the humblest texture he was barefooted
he held a staff in his hand and his great slouched hat was adorned with
scallop-shells he seemed a palmer who had performed a long and painful
pilgrimage for though obviously a young man his frame was wasted his
beard long and haggard and his cheeks were very thin and pale

by my faith said don amador this palmer hath speedily won the heart
of my brother for thou seest rosario doth look into his face as
though he had got him the hand of some great knight from judea i
welcome you with peace and good-will señor pilgrim and my gates are
open to you art thou from compostella or loretto or perhaps thou
comest even from the holy land

while the cavalier spoke the moorish lady surveyed the features of the
pilgrim with a surprise and agitation which drew the attention of don
amador but before he could speak the pilgrim replied

not from the holy land but from a land accurst from death and the
grave from the depths of the heathen lake and the maws of mexicans  

at these words the lady screamed and don amador himself started
aghast as he listened to the voice of the speaker

in the name of god amen he cried recoiling a step i know thy
voice and i saw thee perish

pardon me noble patron said the pilgrim hastily i spoke but in
figures and therein i spoke not amiss since i perceived that my noble
lord looked upon me as one that was dead alas señor i live i am
your honour's poor ward and secretary fabueno

fabueno cried the cavalier recovering himself a little if thou
livest thou liest for lorenzo is dead

hast thou been lying then thou knave cried rosario with much
indignation i will knock the cockles from thy cap for thou saidst
thou hadst fought with the great cortes among the indians

alas señor cried lorenzo will you still think me dead have sorrow
and misery so changed me that your noble goodness cannot see in this
broken frame and this withered visage your poor follower fabueno

by my troth i am amazed this hand is flesh and blood this darkened
brow and weeping eye pho look upon him zayda thou livest
then god be praised and thou sheddest tears too never believe me
but i am rejoiced to see thee and thou shalt dwell with me till thy
dying day heaven be thanked by what miracle wert thou revived after
being both killed and drowned i'faith thou didst greatly shock my
lady tis wondrous how soon she knew thee

knew me exclaimed the secretary gazing with a bewildered eye upon
the lady

why dost thou forget cried the cavalier catching the hand of leila
over whose brow a faint colour rose at the remembrance dost thou
forget my dear and beloved page jacinto

alas madam said lorenzo bending to the earth nothing but my
confusion could have made me so blind and this is more wondrous too
since his excellency don hernan had made me acquainted with the
happiness of my lord

speakest thou of don hernan cried the cavalier by my troth i have
an hundred thousand questions to ask thee and i know not which to
demand first but thine own reappearance is so marvellous that i must
first question thee of that and afterward thou shall speak to me of
don hernan how wert thou fished up

fished up señor said lorenzo sadly i know not well what your
favour means at that moment of distraction and horror he went on
with a shudder when i called to you for succour  

i heard you said amador and i ran to your assistance but heaven
forgive me i cursed the act afterwards when i discovered that it had
lost me my poor jacinto ah señora mia was there ever so dreadful a
night

when i called continued fabueno i was then beset by the infidels
the princess the poor princess was slain in my arms and my horse
speared under me so that we fell to the earth señor i know not well
what happened to me then for my mind fled from me i only remember
that as they flung me into a canoe there came a cavalier the valiant
don francisco de saucedo as i found by his voice to my assistance
shouting aloud i think he was slain on the spot for i heard a
plunging in the water as if his horse had fallen into the lake

it was he then said don amador whom i saw sink so miserably into
the flood heaven give him rest i thought it was thyself

señor continued the secretary i will not weary you now with all
the particulars of my sorrow when heaven restored me my reason i found
myself lying in a wicker den a cage of victims in the temple yard
under the pyramid and i knew that i was saved only to be made a
sacrifice

heaven forefend cried amador while zayda grew white with horror

i tell you the truth señor said fabueno trembling in every limb
there were more than thirty such cages around me and in every one a
wounded spaniard as i could both hear and see and every day there was
one dragged out by the priests and immolated i could hear their yells
from the temple top señor these things drove me into a delirium
which must have lasted long for when i came again to my wits i looked
out and saw that the cages were empty all but one then i beheld
the priests come to mine own dungeon and debate over me i tried to
pray but in my fear i swooned when i looked forth again they were
dragging away my fellow-prisoner i knew that i should die upon the
morrow that night i fell into a frenzy and with my teeth for my
arms were bound behind me i gnawed away the wooden bars of my cage
heaven helped me god gave me strength and st james to whom i cried
sharpened my teeth as though they were edged with iron so by this
miracle i escaped and bound as i was and beaten to the earth by a
tempest which raved over the lake i made my way i know not how by a
causeway that lies to the north until i had reached the shore of the
lake i hid me by day in groves and in marshes and when the night
came i journeyed onward though i knew not whither what sufferings i
endured from hunger and thirst i will not weary you by recounting mine
arms were still bound behind me and when it was my good fortune to find
a field of green maize i could only seize upon the ears like a beast
with my teeth i strove by rolling upon the earth and rubbing against
trees to get rid of the thongs but all in vain this maddened me and
i thought that heaven had deserted me but the good st james showed me
one day a place where the indians had made a fire i rekindled it with
my breath and when it began to blaze i prayed and held my arms in the
flames until the green withes wherewith i was bound were burned
asunder

good heaven cried amador starling from the stone on which he had
seated himself while zayda bent forward as if to snatch the poor youth
from the flames which still burned in her imagination didst thou
suffer all this horrible combustion or perhaps heaven vouchsafed thee
a miracle and scorched away the cords without suffering the fire to
do thee harm

had i been there said rosario doughtily i would have cut the
thongs with my sword and then i would have killed the bitter pagans
that wronged thee

the miracle whereby i escaped from the cage was more than my sins
deserved said the secretary bending his head upon his bosom and
speaking with an agitated voice heaven took not the pangs from the
fire but it gave me strength to bear them i am here again restored to
my native land and among christian men but mine arms are withered

were they hacked off at the shoulders cried amador ardently ay
and thy legs into the bargain yet will i so entertain thee here in my
castle that thou shall cease to lament them

nay said the youth looking with gratitude on the cavalier tis not
so bad as that as my lord may see for though i may never more bear
sword yet i can carry the pilgrim's staff ay and i can raise them to
my cheek to brush away my thanks i have yet strength enough left to
wield a pen and if my noble patron  

speak no more of this good lorenzo said the moorish lady quickly
and kindly my lord hath told thee thou art welcome and i say to thee
also thou art very welcome

by my troth i say so too cried rosario but after all thou wilt
be but pitiful if thou hast not strength left to handle a sword i
hoped you should teach me a little for old baltasar is grum and
crusty

peace hector what art thou talking about said don amador think
no more of thy misfortune lorenzo but give me to know the rest of thy
adventures

they are spoken in a word said the secretary when mine arms were
freed though so dreadfully scorched i could travel with more peace of
mind i doubted not that all the christians had been slain on the
lake yet i thought if i could but reach the sea-coast i might be
sometime snatched out of the hands of the barbarians nevertheless
this hope deserted me when i perceived that the land was covered with
people and one day finding a cave among the mountains hard by to a
water-fall with a wooden cross stuck up at the mouth  

surely said zayda this was the cavern wherein i found my lord don
gabriel

i doubt it not noble lady said fabueno but this i knew not then i
thought it was a retreat provided for me by the good st james who
willed that there i should pass my life under the shadow of that little
crucifix so there did i hide me and feeding upon roots and such
living creatures as i could entrap i remained in my hermitage a full
year until one day i heard a trumpet sounding at the bottom of the
mountain and running out in wonder i beheld thanks be to heaven i
beheld a company of spanish soldiers marching up the hill by these men
i was carried to mexico which was now fallen  

fallen say'st thou cried amador is the infidel city fallen

not the city only but the empire replied fabueno and cortes is now
the lord of the great valley

thou shalt tell me of its fate but first thou must rest and eat i
remember me now of the words of cortes

his excellency said lorenzo commanded me to bear to your favour
this little jewel in token that he has made good a certain vaunt which
he made you in tlascala the same being an emerald from the crown of
quauhtimotzin the king

hah my valiant ambassador at tlascala hath he been the emperor

and to your noble lady he craves permission to present this chain of
gold the manufacture of mexican artists since mexico has become a
spanish city

it is enough said the cavalier i perceive that his genius is
triumphant i would that i might bear this news to his father don
martin as i did the relation of his disasters but come let us retire
why hast thou on these palmer weeds

i vowed to st james on the mountains of mexico in my great misery
that if his good favour and protection should ever bless mine eyes with
the sight of christian man i would make a pilgrimage barefoot to his
holy shrine at compostella this it has been my good fortune already to
accomplish our ship having been driven by a storm into a port of
gallicia not thinking this penance enough for my sins i resolved to
continue my pains and neither doff my pilgrim's cap nor do on my
shoes until i had reached your favour's castle of the cork-tree

i welcome thee to it again and for thy life and i congratulate thee
that thou art relieved of the love of war wherein thou wilt find i
have somewhat preceded thee enter and be at peace when thou art
rested a little i shall desire of thee to speak for very impatient am
i to know what circumstances of marvel and renown of romance and
chivalry have distinguished the last days of tenochtitlan


i have often debated in my mind whether i should give to the world
or for ever lock up within the secrecy of my own breast the history
of the adventures which it has been my lot in life to experience the
importance of any single individual in society especially one so
isolated as myself is so little that it can scarcely be supposed
that the community at large can be affected by his fortunes either
good or evil or interested in any way in his fate yet it sometimes
happens that circumstances conspire to elevate the humblest person
from obscurity and to give the whole world an interest in his
affairs and that man may safely consider himself of some value in his
generation whose history is of a character to instruct the ignorant
and inexperienced such a man i consider myself to be and the more
i reflect upon my past life the more i am convinced it contains a
lesson which may be studied with profit while at the same time
if i am not greatly mistaken the lesson will be found neither dry
nor repulsive but here and there on the contrary quite diverting
the psychologist i hate big words but one cannot do without them
and the metaphysician will discover in my relation some new subjects
for reflection and so perhaps will the doctor of medicine and the
physiologist but while i leave these learned gentlemen to discuss what
may appear most wonderful in my revealments i am most anxious that the
common reader may weigh the value of what is at least in appearance
more natural simple and comprehensible

it will be perceived that many of the following adventures are of a
truly extraordinary character there are some men and to such my story
will seem incredible enough who pride themselves on believing nothing
that they do not know and who endeavour very absurdly to restrict
the objects of belief to those that admit of personal cognizance there
are others again who boast the same maxim but have a more liberal
understanding of the subjects of knowledge and permit themselves
to believe many things which are susceptible of satisfactory proof
but not of direct cognition now i must declare beforehand in order
to avoid all trouble that from the very nature of the life i have
led consisting of the strangest transitions and vicissitudes it is
impossible i should have laid up proofs to satisfy any one of the truth
of my relation who is disposed to be incredulous if any one should
say i doubt all the answer i could make would be doubt and be
hanged not however meaning any offence to anybody though it is
natural one should be displeased at having his veracity questioned
i write for the world at large which is neither philosophic nor
skeptical and the world will believe me otherwise it is a less
sensible world than i have all along supposed it to be




chapter ii


the birth and family of sheppard lee with some account of his temper
and complexion of mind


i was born somewhere towards the close of the last century but
the register-leaf having been torn from the family bible and no one
remaining who can give me information on the point i am not certain as
to the exact year in the state of new-jersey in one of the oldest
counties that border upon the delaware river my father was a farmer
in very good circumstances respectable in his degree but perhaps
more famous for the excellent sausages he used to manufacture for the
philadelphia market than for any quality of mind or body that can
distinguish one man from his fellows taking the hint from his success
in this article of produce he gradually converted his whole estate
into a market-farm raising fine fruits and vegetables and such
other articles as are most in demand in a city in which enterprise
he succeeded beyond his highest expectations and bade fair to be
as in the end he became a rich man the only obstacle to a speedy
accumulation of riches was a disproportionate increase in the agents
of consumption his children multiplying on his hands almost as fast
as his acres until he could count eleven in all a number that filled
him at one time with consternation he used to declare no apple could
be expected to ripen on a farm where there were eleven children and
as for watermelons and sugar-corn it was folly to think of raising
them longer but fate sent my father relief sooner and more effectually
than he either expected or desired nine of the eleven being removed
by death in a space of time short of six years three two of whom
were twin sisters were translated in the natural way falling victims
to an epidemic and were buried in the same grave a fourth was soon
after killed by falling out of an apple-tree my eldest brother then a
boy of fourteen years old upon some freak ran away from home for he
was of a wild madcap turn and getting into an oyster-boat made a
voyage into the bay where he was lost for having fallen overboard
and not being able to swim a clumsy fellow who thought to save him
in that way clutched him round the neck with a pair of oyster-tongs
and thereby strangled him two others were drowned in a millpond where
they were scraping for snapping-turtles another who was the wag of
the family was killed by attempting to ride a pig which running
in great alarm through a broken fence into the orchard dashed his
brains out against a white-oak rail and the ninth died of a sort of
hysterical affection caused by this unlucky exploit of his brother
for he could not cease laughing at it notwithstanding its melancholy
termination and he died of the fit within twenty-four hours

thus in a few years there remained but two of all the eleven
children to wit my oldest sister prudence and myself my mother
from whom i had my christian name sheppard that being her maiden
name died several years before this last catastrophe her mind having
been affected and indeed distracted by so many mournful losses
occurring in such rapid succession she fell into a deep melancholy
and died insane

being one of the youngest children i grieved but little for the loss
of my brothers and sisters nor was i able to appreciate the advantage
which in a worldly point of view their death must prove to me my
father however perceived the difference for having now so few to
look after and be chargeable to him he could with great propriety
consider himself a rich man he immediately resolved as i was now his
only son that i should have a good education and it was not his fault
if in this particular i fell short of his expectations i was sent
to good schools and in course of time was removed to the college at
nassau hall in princeton where i remained during three years that
is until my father's decease when i yielded to the natural indolence
of my temper and left the college or rather for i had formed no
resolution on the subject procrastinated my return from day to day
until it was too late to return

my natural disposition was placid and easy i believe i may say
sluggish i was not wanting in parts but had as little energy or
activity of mind as ever fell to the share of a jerseyman and how
my father ever came to believe i should make a figure in the world
i cannot conceive unless it was because he knew he had a fortune to
leave me and saw me safely lodged in a college it is very certain he
encouraged a strong belief that i should one day be a great man and
i fancy it was for this reason he showed himself so favourable to me
in his will he left me the bulk of his property bestowing upon my
sister who had recently married little beyond a farm which he had
purchased in a neighbouring county but which was a valuable one and
quite satisfied her husband

but my father was a better judge of sausages than of human character
besides being deficient as i humbly confess in all those qualities
that are necessary to the formation of a great man i had not the
slightest desire to be one ambition was a passion that never afflicted
my mind and i was so indifferent to the game of greatness which was
playing around me that i seriously declare there was a president
of the united states elected to office and turned out again after
having served his regular term without my knowing any thing about it
i had not even the desire so common to young men who find themselves
in possession of a fortune to launch out into elegant expenses to
dash about the country with fine horses servants and clothes and
to play the spendthrift in cities on the contrary i no sooner found
myself arrived at my majority which was a few months after my father's
death than i sat down very quietly on the farm resolved to take the
world easily which i supposed i might easily do i had some idea of
continuing to conduct the estate as my father had done before me but
it was a very vague one and having made one or two efforts to bear
myself like a man of business i soon found the effort was too tiresome
for one of my disposition and i accordingly hired an overseer to
manage the property for me




chapter iii


the pleasures of having nothing to do some thoughts on matrimony


having thus shuffled the cares of business from my shoulders to
another's my time began to weigh a little heavily on my hands and i
cast about for some amusement that might enable me to get rid of it as
there was great abundance of small game such as quails partridges
and rabbits in the neighbourhood i resolved to turn sportman and
in consequence i bought me a dog and gun and began to harry the
country with some spirit but having the misfortune to shoot my dog the
first day and soon after a very valuable imported cow belonging
to a neighbour for which i was obliged to pay him enormous damages
and meeting besides with but little luck i grew disgusted with the
diversion my last shot was soon fired for having forgotten the
provisions of our game-laws i killed a woodcock too early in the
summer for which on the information of a fellow who owed me a grudge
i was prosecuted although it was the only bird i ever killed in all my
life and soundly fined and this incensed me so much that i resolved
to have nothing more to do with an amusement that cost so much money
and threw me into so many difficulties

i was then at a loss how to pass my time until a neighbour who bred
fine horses persuaded me to buy a pair of blooded colts and try my
luck on the turf and this employment though rather too full of cares
and troubles to suit me exactly i followed with no little spirit
and became more proud of my horses than i can well express until i
came to try them on the race-course where it was my luck what with
stakes and betting together to lose more money in a single day than
my father had ever made in two years together i then saw very clearly
that horse-racing was nothing better than gambling and therefore both
disreputable and demoralizing for which reason i instantly gave it up
heartily sick of the losses it had occasioned me

my overseer or steward for such he may be considered whom i always
esteemed a very sensible fellow for he was shrewd and energetic
and at least ten years my senior then advised me as i was a young
man with money enough to travel a little and see the world and
accordingly i went to new-york where i was robbed of my luggage and
money by a villain whose acquaintance i made in the steamboat and
whom i thought a highly intelligent gentlemanly personage though
as it afterward appeared he was a professor from sing-sing where he
had been sawing stone for two years the governor of new-york having
forgiven him as is the custom the five other years for which he was
committed for i believe a fraud committed on his own father

this loss drove me home again but being re-encouraged by my overseer
i filled my purse and set out a second time passing up the hudson
river with which i was prodigiously pleased though not with the
overslaugh where we stuck fast during six hours i then proceeded
to saratoga where i remained for two weeks on account of its being
fashionable but i declare to heaven i was never so tired of any
place in my life i then went to niagara which in spite of the great
noise it made i thought the finest place in the world and there i
think i should have continued all summer had it not been for the
crowds of tiresome people that were eternally coming and going and
the great labour of climbing up and down the stairs however i was so
greatly pleased with what i saw both at niagara and along the way
that i should have repeated my travels in after years as the most
agreeable way of passing time had it not been for the dangers and
miseries of such enterprises for first the coaches were perpetually
falling over or sticking in the mud or jolting over stones so that
one had no security of life or limb and secondly the accommodations
at the inns along the road were not to my liking the food being cooked
after the primitive systems of shem ham and japheth and the beds
stuck together in the rooms as if for boys at a boarding-school it
is possible that these things are better ordered now but from what
i have since seen and heard i am of opinion there is a fine field
for cooks carpenters and chamber-maids in the agricultural regions
of america in those days i loved ease and comfort too well to submit
to such evils as could be avoided and accordingly after a little
experience in the matter i ceased travelling altogether the pleasures
bearing no sort of proportion to the discomforts

my time still weighing upon my hands i was possessed with a sudden
idea which my steward however endeavoured to combat namely
that the tedium of my existence might be dispelled by matrimony and
i resolved to look around me for a wife after much casting about
i fixed my eyes upon a young lady of the village for i must inform
the reader that my farm was on the skirts of a village and a very
respectable one too although there were many lazy people in it who
i thought was well fitted to make me comfortable and as she did not
seem averse to my first advances i began to be quite particular until
all the old women in the country declared it was a match and all the
young fellows of my own age as well as all the girls i knew became
extremely witty at my expense these things however rather encouraged
me than otherwise i believed i was advancing my happiness by the
change i contemplated in my condition and i was just on the point of
making formal proposals to the young lady when an accident set me to
considering the enterprise entirely in a new light

my charmer lived in the house of a married sister who had a large
family of children a pack of the most ill-bred imps i verily
believe that were ever gathered together in any one man's house but
for politeness sake during the first weeks of my courtship the young
sinners were kept out of my way and what with cuffing and feeding
with sugarplums were preserved in some sort of order so that i was
not annoyed by them after a while however and when matters had
proceeded some length it was thought unnecessary to treat me longer
as a stranger the children were suffered to take care of themselves
and the consequence was that in a short time i found myself in a
kind of pandemonium whenever i entered the house with such a whining
and squeaking and tumbling and bawling and fighting among the young
ones as greatly discomposed my nerves and to make the matter worse
the mother made no difficulty at times when the squabbling grew to a
height of taking a switch to one and boxing the ears of another and
scolding roundly at a third to reduce them to order and all this in
my presence and under the nose of my charmer

i began to fancy the married life could not be altogether so agreeable
as i had pictured it to my imagination and in this belief i was
confirmed by a visit to my sister who had three children of her own
all of whom as i now perceived for i had not noticed it before
having no particular inducement to make me observant were given to
squabbling and bawling just like other children while my sister did
her share of boxing and scolding i thought to myself what should i
do with a dozen children squeaking all day and night in my house and a
scolding wife dragooning them into submission

the thought disconcerted me and the fear of such a consummation
greatly chilled the ardour of my affection so that the young lady
observing my backwardness and taking offence at it cast her eyes upon
another wooer who had made her an offer and to my great satisfaction
married him on the spot

i was never more relieved in my life and i resolved to reflect longer
upon the subject before making advances of that nature a second time
my overseer who had from the first for i made him my confidant been
opposed to the match on the ground that i ought to enjoy my liberty
at least until i was thirty was greatly rejoiced at the rupture and
swore that i had made a lucky escape for he had always thought in his
own mind that the lady was at bottom though she concealed it from
me a tartar and fire-eater in this however he was mistaken for
from all i have heard of her since she has proved a most amiable and
sweet-tempered woman and her husband is said to be very happy with her




chapter iv


how to conduct a farm to the best advantage and steer clear of the
lawyers


it is not my intention to dwell longer upon the history of this period
of my life nor to recount in detail how my easy and indolent temper at
last proved the ruin of me i gave myself up to laziness neglecting
my affairs to such a degree that they soon became seriously entangled
and to make a long story short i found myself before i had completed
my twenty-eighth year reduced from independence and almost affluence
to a condition bordering upon actual poverty my farm under the
management of mr aikin jones for that was my steward's name went
gradually to ruin my orchards rotted away without being replanted my
meadows were converted into swamps my corn-fields filled with gullies
my improvements fell into decay and my receipts began to run short of
my expenses then came borrowing and mortgaging and by-and-by the
sale of this piece of land to remove the encumbrance upon that
until i suddenly found myself in the condition of my father when he
began the world that is to say the master of a little farm of forty
acres the centre and nucleus of the fifteen hundred which he had
got possession of and bequeathed to me but which had so soon slipped
through my fingers there was this difference however between us the
land when my father obtained it was in good condition it was now
so well had it prospered under jones's hands entirely worn out and
empoverished and not worth a fourth part of its original value

to add to my chagrin i discovered that mr aikin jones whom i had
treated rather as a friend than servant had abused my confidence in
other words that he was a rogue and villain who had taken advantage
of my disinclination to business and my ignorance as i believe i
must call it to swindle me out of my property which he had the best
opportunities to do whether he effected his purpose by employing
my own funds or not i cannot say but it is very certain all the
different mortgages in which i was entangled came some how or other
by hook and by crook into his hands and he took care to make the
best use of them in a word mr jones became a rich man and i a poor
one and i had the satisfaction every day when i took a walk over my
forty-acre farm as the place was familiarly called though the true
name was watermelon hill to find myself stopped which way soever i
directed my steps by the possessions of mr aikin jones my old friend
and overseer whom i often saw roll by in his carriage while i was
trudging along through the mud

at the same time that i met with this heavy misfortune i had to endure
others that were vexatious enough my brother-in-law and sister had
their suspicions of mr jones and often cautioned me against him
though in vain not that i had any very superstitious reliance on the
gentleman's integrity but because i could not endure the trouble of
examining into his proceedings and accounts and chose therefore to
believe him honest this and my general indolence and indifference to
my affairs incensed them both to that degree that my sister did not
scruple to tell me to my face that i had lost all the little sense i
ever possessed while my brother-in-law took the freedom of saying of
me in public that i was wrong in the upper story in other words
that i was mad and he had the insolence to hint that it ran in my
blood that i had inherited it from my mother she as i mentioned
before having lost her mind before her decease i was so much
irritated by these insults on their part that i quarrelled with them
both though by no means of a testy or choleric disposition and it was
many years before we were reconciled having therefore neither friends
nor family i was left to bear my misfortunes alone which was a great
aggravation of them all




chapter v


the author finds himself in trouble some account of his servant
honest james jumble


i have always described myself as of an easy contented disposition
and such i was born but misfortune produces sad changes in our
tempers as it was soon my lot to experience before however i
describe the change that took place in mine it is fit i should let the
reader understand to what condition i was reduced by the perfidy of
jones or as i should rather say by my own culpable neglect of my
affairs

my whole landed possessions consisted of a farm of forty acres which
i had after the fashion of some of my richer neighbours in other
states suffered to fall into the most wretched condition imaginable
my meadow-lands being broken in upon by the river and neglected
were converted into quagmires reed-brakes and cat-tail patches the
only use of which was to shelter wild-fowl and mire cattle however
my live-stock was scanty enough and the only sufferers were my
neighbours whose cows easily made their way through my fences and
stuck fast in the mud at their pleasure my fields were overgrown
here with mullein and st john's-wort and there with sand-burs and
poke-berries my orchards were in an equally miserable condition the
trees being old rotten or worm-eaten half of them torn down by
the winds and the remainder fit for nothing but fire-wood my barn
was almost roofless and as for a stable i had so little occasion
for one that my old negro-man jim of whom i shall have more to say
hereafter or his wife dinah or both together thinking they could
do nothing better with it helped the winds to tear it to pieces
especially in the winter when it formed a very convenient wood-pile
my dwelling-house was also suffering from decay it was originally a
small frame building but my father had added to it one portion after
another until it became spacious and the large porches in front and
on the rear gave it quite a genteel janty air but this it could not
long keep the sun and rain gradually drove the white paint from the
exterior and the damps getting inside the fine paper-hangings pied
and spotted peeled from the walls the window-frames rotted and the
glasses left them one after another and one day in a storm one half
the front porch tumbled down and the remainder which i propped up as
well as i could had a mighty mean and poverty-stricken appearance
the same high wind carried away one of my chimneys which falling on
a corner of the roof crushed that into the garret and left one whole
gable-end in ruins

it must not be supposed that my property presented altogether this
wretched appearance at the moment of my losses it was in truth bad
enough then but i am now describing it as it appeared some few years
after when my miseries were accumulated in the greatest number and i
was just as poor as i could be

in all this period of trouble and vexation i had but one friend if i
dare call him such though i should have been glad half the time to be
rid of him this was my negro-man jim or jim jumble as he was called
of whom i spoke before an old fellow that had been a slave of my
father and was left to me in his will he was a crabbed self-willed
old fellow whom i could never manage but who would have all things
his own way in spite of me as i had some scruples of conscience about
holding a slave and thought him of no value whatever but on the
contrary a great trouble i resolved to set him free and accordingly
mentioned my design to him when to my surprise he burst into a
passion swore he would not be free and told me flatly i was his
master and i should take care of him and the absurd old fool ended by
declaring if i made him a free man he would have the law of me he
would by ge-hosh

i never could well understand the cause of his extreme aversion to
being made free but i suppose having got the upper hand of me and
being wise enough to perceive the difference between living on the one
hand a lazy life without any care whatever as my slave and on the
other labouring hard to obtain a precarious subsistence as a free man
he was determined to stick by me to the last whether i would or not
some little affection for me as i had grown up from a boy as it were
under his own eye was perhaps at the bottom of his resolution but if
there were it was of a strange quality as he did nothing but scold
and grumble at me all day long i remember in particular that when
the match i spoke of before was broken off and he had heard of it he
came to me in a great passion and insolently asked what i meant by
courting a wife who would be a good mistress to him and not marrying
her and on my condescending to explain the reasons of my change of
mind he told me plumply i had no more sense than a nigger for women
was women and children children and he was tired living so long in a
house with none but me and massa jones for company

i suppose it was old jim's despair of my ever marrying that put him
upon taking a wife himself for one day not long after i was reduced
to the forty-acre farm he brought home a great ugly free negro-woman
named dinah whom he installed into the kitchen without the least
ceremony and without so much as even informing me of his intention
having observed her two or three times and seeing her at last come
bouncing into the dinner-room to wait on me i asked her who she was
and what she wanted to which she answered she was jim's wife and
jim had sent her in to take care of me

it was in this way the old rascal used me it was in vain to complain
he gave me to understand in his own language he knew what was what
and there was no possuming an old nigger like him and if i had made
him overseer instead of massa jones it would have been all the
better for me

and in truth i believe it would for jim would never have cheated
me except on a small scale and if he had done no work himself it is
very certain he would have made everybody else work for he was a hard
master when he had anybody under him

i may here observe and i will do the old fellow the justice
to confess that i found him exceedingly useful during all my
difficulties what labour was bestowed upon the farm was bestowed
almost altogether by him and his wife dinah it is true he did just
what he liked and without consulting me planting and harvesting and
even selling what he raised as if he were the master and owner of all
things and laying out what money he obtained by the sales just as his
own wisdom prompted and finding i could do nothing better i even let
him have his own way and it was perhaps to my advantage that i did

but i grew poorer and poorer notwithstanding and at that period
which i shall ever be inclined to consider as the true beginning of my
eventful life i was reduced almost to the point of despair for my
necessities had compelled me to mortgage the few miserable acres i had
left and i saw nothing but utter ruin staring me in the face




chapter vi


sheppard lee experiences his share of the respect that is accorded to
honest poverty his ingenious and highly original devices to amend
his fortune


it may be asked why i made no efforts to retrieve my fortunes i
answer to that that i made many but was so infatuated that i never
once thought of resorting to the most obvious rational and only
means that is to say of cultivating with industry my forty acres as
my father had done before me this idea so sluggish was my mind or so
confused by its distresses never once occurred to me or if it did
it presented so many dreary images and so long a prospect of dull and
disagreeable labour that i had not the spirit to pursue it the little
toil i was forced to endure for my necessities now compelled me at
times to work with my own hands appeared to me intolerably irksome
and i was glad to attempt any thing else that seemed to promise me good
luck and did not require positive labour

the first plan of bettering my fortune that i conceived was to buy
some chances in a lottery which i thought an easy way of making money
as indeed it is when a man can make any i had my trouble for my
pains with just as many blanks as i had bought tickets upon which i
began to see clearly that adventuring in a lottery was nothing short of
gambling as it really is and so i quitted it

i then resolved to imitate the example of a neighbour who had made
a great sum of money by buying and selling to advantage stock in a
southern gold-mining company and being very sanguine of success i
devoted all the money i could scrape together to the purpose and that
so wisely that a second instalment being suddenly demanded i had
nothing left to discharge it with and no means of raising any the
consequence of which was that i was forced to sell at the worst time
in the world and retired from the concern with just one fifth the sum
i had invested in it i saw then that i had no talent for speculating
and i began to have my doubts whether stock-jobbing was not just as
clear gambling as horse-racing and lottery speculation

i tried some ten or a dozen other projects with a view to better my
condition but as i came off with the same luck from all i do not
think it necessary to mention them i will however state as a proof
how much my difficulties had changed my mind on that subject that
one of them was of a matrimonial character my horror of squabbling
children and scolding wives melted away before the prospect of sheriffs
and executions and there being a rich widow in the neighbourhood
i bought me a new coat and made her a declaration but it was too
late in the day for me as i soon discovered for besides giving me
a flat refusal she made a point of revealing the matter to all her
acquaintance who did nothing but hold me up to ridicule

i found that my affairs were falling into a desperate condition and
not knowing what else to do i resolved to turn politician with the
hope of getting some office or other that might afford me a comfortable
subsistence

this was the maddest project that ever possessed my brain but it was
some time before i came to that conclusion but in truth from having
been the easiest and calmest tempered man in the world i was now
become the most restless and discontented and incapable of judging
what was wise and what foolish i reflected one day that of my old
school and college mates who were still alive there was not one who
had not made some advance in the world while i had done nothing but
slip backwards it was the same thing with dozens of people whom i
remembered as poor farmers boys with none of the advantages i had
possessed but who had outstripped me in the road to fortune some
being now rich cultivators some wealthy manufacturers and merchants
while two or three had got into the legislature and were made much
of in the newspapers one of my old companions had emigrated to the
mississippi where he was now a cotton-planter with a yearly revenue
of twenty or thirty thousand dollars another had become a great
lawyer in an adjacent state and a third whom i always thought a
very shallow ignorant fellow and who was as poor as a rat to boot
had turned doctor settled down in the village and besides getting
a great practice had married the richest and finest girl in all the
county there was no end to the number of my old acquaintances who had
grown wealthy and distinguished and the more i thought of them the
more discontented i became

my dissatisfaction was increased by discovering with what little
respect i was held among these happy people the doctor used to treat
me with a jocular sort of familiarity which i felt to be insulting
the lawyer who had eaten many a dinner at my table when i was able to
invite him began to make me low bows instead of shaking hands with
me and the cotton-planter who had been my intimate friend at college
coming to the village on a visit to his relations stared me fiercely
in the face when i approached him and with a lordly hum ha asked me
who the devil i might be as for the others they treated me with as
little consideration and i began to perceive very plainly that i had
got into the criminal stage of poverty for all men were resolved to
punish me it is no wonder that poverty is the father of crime since
the poor man sees himself treated on all hands as a culprit

i had never before envied a man for enjoying more consideration in
the world than myself but the discovery that i was looked upon with
contempt filled me with a new subject for discontent i envied my
richer neighbours not only for being rich but for being what they
considered themselves my superiors in standing i may truly say i
scarce ever saw in those days a man with a good coat on his back
without having a great desire to beat him but as i was a peaceable
man my anger never betrayed me into violence




chapter vii


the author becomes a politician and seeks for an office the result
of that project


my essay in politics was soon made i spent a whole week in finding
out who were the principal office-holders candidates and busybodies
both in the state and the general governments and which were the
principal parties there being so many that an honest man might easily
make a mistake among them being satisfied on these points i chose
the strongest party on the principle that the majority must always be
right and attended the first public meeting that was held where i
clapped my hands and applauded the speeches with so much spirit that
i was taken notice of and highly commended by several of the principal
leaders in truth i pleased them so well that they visited me at my
house and encouraged me to take a more prominent part in the business
of politics and this i did for at the next meeting i got up and
made a speech but what it was about i know no more than the man in
the moon otherwise i would inform the reader my only recollection of
it is that there was great slashing at the banks and aristocrats that
ground the faces of the poor for i was on what our opponents called
the hurrah side and these were the things we talked about i received
uncommon applause and in fact there was such a shouting and clapping
of hands that i was obliged to put an end to my discourse sooner than
i intended

but i found myself in great favour with the party and being advised
by the leaders who considered i had a talent that way to set about
converting all i knew in the county who were not of our party and they
hinting that i should certainly in case the county was gained for our
county happened to be a little doubtful at that time be appointed
to the postoffice in the village i mounted my old horse julius
cesar and set out with greater zeal than i had ever shown in my life
before i visited everybody that i knew and a great many that i did
not know and wherever i went i held arguments and made speeches
with a degree of industry that surprised myself for certainly i was
never industrious before it is certain also that there was never a
labourer in the field of politics that better deserved his reward 
never a soldier of the party ranks that had won a better right to a
share in the spoils of victory i do not pretend to say indeed that
i converted anybody to our belief for all seemed to have made up
their minds beforehand and i never yet knew or heard of a man that
could be argued out of his politics who had once made up his mind on
the subject i laboured however and that with astonishing zeal and
as i paid my own expenses and treated all thirsty souls that seemed
approachable in that way to good liquor i paid a good round sum
that i could ill spare for the privilege of electioneering and was
therefore satisfied that my claim to office would hold good

and so it did as was universally allowed by all the party but the
conviction of its justice was all i ever gained in reward of my
exertions the battle was fought and won the party was triumphant
and i was just rejoicing in the successful termination of my hopes
when they were blasted by the sudden appointment of another to the very
office which i considered my own that other was one of the aforesaid
leaders who had been foremost in commending my zeal and talents and
in assuring me that the office should be mine

i was confounded petrified enraged the duplicity and perfidy of my
new friends filled me with indignation it was evident they must all
have joined in recommending my rival to the office for he was a man
of bad character who must without such recommendations have missed
his aim all therefore had recommended him and all had promised their
suffrages to me the scoundrels said i to myself i perceived that
i had fallen among thieves it was clear that no party could be in the
right which was led by such unprincipled men there was corruption at
the heart of the whole body the party consisted of rogues who were
gaping after the loaves and fishes their honesty was a song their
patriotism a farce in a word i found i had joined the wrong party
and i resolved to go over to the other sincerely repenting the
delusion that had made me so long the advocate of wrong and deception

but fortune willed otherwise i had arrived at the crisis of my fate
and before i could put my purpose into execution i was suddenly
involved in that tissue of adventure which i have no doubt will be
considered the most remarkable that ever befell a human being



chapter viii


a description of the owl-roost with mr jumble's ideas in relation to
captain kid's money


for five mortal days i remained at home chewing the bone of
reflection and a hard bone it was on the sixth there came a villanous
constable with a the reader may suppose what i struck a bargain with
him and he took his leave and julius cesar also saddle bridle and
all whereby i escaped an introduction to the nearest justice of the
peace the next visit i had good reason to apprehend would be from
the sheriff for having failed to pay up the interest on the mortgage
the mortgagee had discoursed and that in no very mysterious strain
on the virtues of a writ of venditioni exponas or some other absurd
and scoundrelly invention of the lawyers i was at my wits end and
i wished that i was a dog in which case i should have gone mad and
bitten the new post-master and all his friends

very well said i to myself the forty-acre is no longer mine i
clapped on my hat and walked into the open air resolved to take a
look at it before the sheriff came to convince me it belonged to some
other person as i passed from the door i looked up to the broken
porch may it fall on the head of my successor i said

it was a summer eve a day in july but a raw wind blew from the
northeast and the air was as chill as in november i buttoned my coat
and as i did so took a peep at my elbows i required no second look to
convince me that i was a poor man

the ruined meadows of which i have spoken lie on a little creek that
makes in from the delaware their shape is the worst in the world
being that of a triangle the longest leg of which lies on the water
hence the expense of embanking them is formidable a circumstance for
which the muskrats have no consideration the apex of the angle is a
bog lying betwixt two low hillocks or swells of ground between which
crawls a brook scarce deep enough to swim a tadpole though an ox may
hide in the mud at the bottom it oozes from a turfy ledge or bar a
few feet higher than the general level of the hollow which terminates
above it in a circular basin of two acres in area this circular
basin is verdant enough to the eye the whole surface being covered
by a thick growth of alders arrow-wood water-laurels and other
shrubs that flourish in a swamp as well as a bountiful sprinkling of
cat-tails on the edges the soil is a vegetable jelly and how any
plant of a pound in weight could ever sustain itself on it i never was
able to comprehend it is thought to be the nearest road to the heart
of the chinese empire to find which all that is necessary to do is
to take a plunge into it head foremost and keep on until you arrive at
daylight among the antipodes

the whole place has a solitary and mournful appearance which is to
many made still more dreary and even sepulchral by the appearance of
a little old church built by the swedes many a year ago but now in
ruins and the graveyard around it these being but a short distance
off and on the east side of the hollow the spot is remote from my
dwelling and apparently from all others nevertheless there is a small
farmhouse it was once mine on a by-road not many rods from the old
church a path not often trodden leads from my house to the by-road
and crosses the hollow by the grassy ledge spoken of before it is the
shortest path to the village and i sometimes pursued it when walking
thither

this lonesome spot had a very bad name in our neighbourhood and was
considered to be haunted its common name was the owl-roost given
it in consequence of the vast numbers of these birds that perched
and i believe nested in the centre of the swamp where was a place
comparatively dry or supposed to be so for i believe no one ever
visited it and a clump of trees larger than those in other places
some called the place captain kid's hole after that famous pirate who
was supposed to have buried his money there as he is supposed to have
buried it in a hundred thousand other dismal spots along the different
rivers of america old jim jumble was a devout believer in the story
and often tried his luck in digging for the money but without success
which he attributed to the circumstance of his digging in the daytime
whereas midnight was in his opinion the only true time to delve for
charmed treasure but midnight was the period when the ghosts came down
from the old graveyard to squeak about the swamp and i never heard of
jim being found in that neighbourhood after nightfall the truth is
the owls never hear any one go by after dark without saluting him with
a horrible chorus of hooting and screeching that will make a man's
hair rise on his head and i have been sometimes daunted by them myself

to this place i directed my steps and being very melancholy i sat
down at the foot of a beech-tree that grew near the path i thought
of the owls and the ghosts and of captain kid into the bargain and
i marvelled to myself whether there could be any foundation for the
belief that converted such nooks into hiding-places for his ill-gotten
gold while i thought over the matter i began to wish the thing could
be true and that some good spirit might direct me to the spot where
the money lay hid for sure enough no one in the world had greater
necessity for it than i i conned over the many stories that old jim
had told me about the matter as well as all the nonsensical ceremonies
that were to be performed and the divers ridiculous dangers to be
encountered by those who sought the treasure all which were mere
notions that had entered his absurd head but which he had pondered
over so often and long that he believed they had been told him by
others

the great difficulty according to his belief and a necessary
preliminary to all successful operations was first to discover exactly
the spot where the treasure lay buried and indeed this seemed to
be a very needful preliminary the discovery was to be made only by
dreaming of the spot three nights in succession as to dreaming twice
that was nothing jim had twenty times dreamed two nights together that
he had fallen upon the spot but upon digging it discovered nothing
having been so lucky as to dream of a place three successive nights
then the proper way to secure the treasure as he told me would be
to select a night when the moon was at the full and begin digging
precisely at twelve o'clock saying the lord's prayer backwards all
the time till the money was found and here lay the danger a single
blunder in the prayer and wo betide the devotee for the devil who
would be standing by all the time would that moment pounce upon his
soul and carry it away in a flame of brimstone




chapter ix


sheppard lee stumbles upon a happy man and quarrels with him


while i sat pondering over these matters and wondering whether i
could say the prayer backwards and doubting for to my shame be
it spoken i had not often of late years said it forward i
heard a gun go off in the meadow and rising and walking that way
i discovered a sportsman who had just shot a woodcock which his dog
carried to him in his mouth i knew the gunner at first sight to be a
gentleman of philadelphia by the name of higginson a brewer who was
reputed to be very wealthy and who had several times before visited
our neighbourhood for the purpose of shooting i knew little of him
except his name having never spoken to him the neighbours usually
addressed him as squire though i knew not for what reason he was a
man of forty or forty-five years old somewhat fat and portly but with
a rosy hearty complexion looking the very personification of health
and content and indeed as i gazed at him strolling up and down with
his dog and gun i thought i had never before seen such a picture of
happiness

but the sight only filled me with gloom and anger here said i to
myself is a man rich and prosperous who passes his whole life in an
amusement that delights him goes whither he likes does what he will
eats drinks and is merry and the people call him squire wherever
he goes i wish i were he for surely he is the happiest man in the
world

while i pondered thus regarding him with admiration and hatred
together a bird rose at his feet and he shot it and the next moment
another which he served in the same way

i noted the exultation expressed in his countenance and i was filled
with a sudden fury i strode up to him while he was recharging his
piece and as i approached him he looked up and gave me a nod of so
much complacency and condescension together that it rendered me ten
times madder than ever

sir said i looking him full in the face before you shoot
any more birds here answer me a question who do you go for the
administration or the opposition

this was a very absurd way of beginning a conversation with a stranger
but i was in such a fury i scarce knew what i said he gave me a stare
and then a smile and nodding his head good-humouredly replied

oh for the administration to be sure

you do sir i rejoined shaking my fist at him then sir let me
tell you sir you belong to a scoundrelly party and are a scoundrel
yourself sir and so sir walk off my place or i'll prosecute you
for a trespass

you insolent ragamuffin said he

ragamuffin was i sunk so low that a man trespassing on my own
property could call me ragamuffin

you poor miserable shote 

so degraded that i could be called a pig

you half-starved old sand-field jersey kill-deer 

a jersey kill-deer

you vagabond you beggar you dicky dout 

i was struck dumb by the multitude and intensity of his epithets and
before i could recover speech he shouldered his gun snapped his
fingers in my face and whistling to his dog walked off the ground
before he had gone six steps however he turned round gave me a hard
look and bursting into a laugh exclaimed tapping his forehead as he
spoke 

poor fellow you're wrong in your upper story

with that he resumed the path and crossed over to the old church
where i lost sight of him

wrong in my upper story it was the very phrase which tom alderwood
my brother-in-law had applied to me and which had given me such
mortal offence that i had never forgiven him and had refused to be
reconciled even when as my difficulties began to thicken about me
he came to offer me his assistance wrong in my upper story i was
so much confounded by the man's insolence that i remained rooted to
the spot until he had got out of sight and then not knowing what else
to do i returned home when i had a visit from old jim who entered
the apartment and not knowing i had sold my horse cried out massa
sheppard want money to shoe julius cesar morrow morning blacksmith
swear no trust no more

go to the devil you old rascal said i in a rage

guess i will said jim shaking his head follow hard after massa

that insinuation which struck me as being highly appropriate was
all i got for supper for it was jim's way when i offended him of an
afternoon to sneak off taking dinah with him and thus leave me to
shift for myself during the whole night as i could there was never a
more tyrannical old rascal than jim jumble




chapter x


sheppard lee has an extraordinary dream which promises to be more
advantageous than any of his previous ones


i went therefore supperless to bed but i dreamed of captain kid's
money and the character of my dream was quite surprising i thought
that my house had fallen down in a high wind as indeed it was like
enough to do and that i was sitting on a broken chair before the
ruins when squire higginson made his appearance looking however
like a dead man for his face was pale and he was swathed about with
a winding-sheet instead of a gun he carried a spade in his hand and
a great black pig followed at his heels in place of his dog he came
directly towards me and looking me full in the face said sheppard
lee what are you doing here but i was struck with fear and could
make no reply with that he spoke again saying the sheriff is
coming to levy on your property get up therefore and follow me
so saying he began to walk away whistling to the pig which ran at
his heels like a dog and i found myself impelled to follow him he
took the path to the owl-roost and arriving there came to a pause
saying sheppard lee you are a poor man and eaten up with discontent
but i am your friend and you shall have all your wishes he then
turned to the pig which was rooting under a gum-tree and blowing his
whistle said black pig show me some game or i'll trounce you
and immediately the pig began to run about snuffing and snorting and
coursing like a dog so that it was wonderful to behold him at last
the squire growing impatient and finding fault with the animal's ill
success for he discovered nothing took a whip from under his shroud
and fell to beating him after which the pig hunted more to his liking
and having coursed about us for a while ran up to the beech-tree
under which i had sat the day before and began with snout and hoof to
tear up the earth at its roots oho said squire higginson i never
knew black pig to deceive me we shall have fine sport now then
putting the spade into my hands he bade me dig exhorting me to be of
good heart for i was now to live a new life altogether but before i
struck the spade into the earth he drew a mark on the ground to guide
me and the figure was precisely that of a human grave not daunted
by this circumstance for in my dream it appeared natural enough i
began to dig and after throwing out the earth to a depth just equal
to the length of the spade i discovered an iron coffin the lid of
which was in three pieces and not being fastened in any way was
therefore easily removed judge of my transports when having lifted
up the piece in the middle i found the whole coffin full of gold and
silver some in the form of ancient coins but the most of it in bars
and ingots i would have lifted up the whole coffin and carried it
away at once but that was impossible i therefore began to fill my
pockets my hat my handkerchief and even my bosom until the squire
bade me cease telling me i should visit the treasure at the same hour
on the following night i then replaced the iron cover and threw the
earth again into the grave as the squire commanded and then leaving
him and running home as hard as i could in fear lest some one should
see me i fell into a miry place where i was weighed down by the mass
of gold i had about me and smothered in the midst of my dying agonies
i awoke and found that all was a dream

ah how much torment a poor man has dreaming of riches the dream made
me very melancholy and i went moping about all that day wishing
myself anybody or any thing but that i was and hiding in the woods at
the sight of any one who chanced to pass by for i thought everybody
was the sheriff i went to bed the following night in great disorder of
spirit and had no sooner closed my eyes than i dreamed the same dream
over again the squire made his appearance as before led me to the
owl-roost and set the black pig hunting until the grave was found in
a word the dream did not vary in a single particular from that i had
had the night before and when i woke up the next day the surprise
of such an occurrence filled me with new and superstitious ideas and
i awaited the next night with anxious expectations resolved if the
dream should be repeated again to go dig at the place and see what
should come of it

remembering what old jim had said in regard to the full of the moon
i went to a neighbour's to look at his almanack for i had none of my
own and discovered to my unspeakable surprise and agitation though
i had half known it before that the moon we then had would be at her
full between ten and eleven o'clock on the following morning

such a coincidence betwixt the time of my dreams and the proper period
for hunting the treasure since at the full moon was the proper time
was enough of itself to excite my expectations and the identity
between the two visions was so extraordinary that i began to believe
that the treasure did really exist in the owl-roost which being very
solitary and yet conveniently accessible from the river through the
medium of the creek was one of the best hiding-places in the world
and that i was the happy man destined to obtain it

i went to bed accordingly the third night with a strong persuasion that
the vision would be repeated i was not disappointed i found myself
again digging at the beech-roots and scraping up great wedges of gold
and silver from the iron coffin what was remarkable in this dream
however was that when i had picked up as much as i could carry the
squire nodded to me and said now sheppard lee you know the way to
captain kid's treasure and you can come to-morrow night by yourself
and what was further observable i did not dream of falling into a
miry place on this occasion but arrived safely home and beheld with
surprise and delight that my house which i had left in ruins was
standing up more beautiful than ever it had been newly painted from
top to bottom and the pillars of the porch were gilded over and
shining like gold

while enjoying this agreeable prospect i awoke and such was the
influence of the vision on my mind and the certain belief i now
cherished that the vast treasure was mine a whole coffinful of gold
and silver that i fell to shouting and dancing so that old jim
jumble who ran up into my chamber to see what was the matter was
persuaded i had gone mad and began to blubber and scold and take on
in the most diverting way in the world

i pacified him as well as i could but resolved to keep my secret until
i could surprise him with the sight of my treasure all collected
together in the house and i proceeded without delay to make such
preparations as were proper for the coming occasion i took a spade and
mattock and carried them to the hollow where i hid them among the
bushes but this i found difficult to do as secretly as i wished for
old jim either from suspecting what i was after or believing i had
lost my mind kept dogging me about so that it was near midday before
i succeeded in giving him the slip and carrying my tools to the hollow




chapter xi


in which the reader is introduced to a personage who may claim his
acquaintance hereafter


in this place to my dismay i stumbled upon a man who from the
character he had in the neighbourhood i was afraid was hunting the
treasure as well as myself he was an old german doctor called
feuerteufel which extraordinary name as i had been told signified
in german fire-devil he had come to our village about two weeks
before and nobody knew for what reason all day long he wandered about
among the woods swamps and marshes collecting plants and weeds
stones animals and snakes which he seemed to value very highly
some thought he was a counterfeiter in disguise and others called
him a conjurer many were of opinion he was hunting for gold-mines
or precious stones while others had their thoughts and said he was
the devil his appearance being somewhat grim and forbidding as for
myself having lighted upon him once or twice in the woods i did not
know what to think of him but i did not like his looks he was very
tall and rawboned with long arms and immense big hands his skin was
extremely dark and pock-marked and he had a mouth that ran from ear to
ear and long bushy black hair his eyes were like saucers and deep
sunk in their sockets with tremendous big black eyebrows ever frowning
above them and what made him look remarkable was that although he was
ever frowning with his eyes his mouth was as continually grinning in
a sort of laugh such as you see in a man struck with a palsy in the
head he was the terror of all the children and it was said the dogs
never barked at him

i found him in the hollow hard by the beech-tree and had scarce
time to fling my implements among the bushes before he saw me he was
standing looking over towards the old church where there was a funeral
procession for that morning the neighbours were burying a young man
that had taken laudanum for love two days before but had only expired
the previous evening

as soon as the german beheld me he started like a guilty man
and made as if he would have run away but suddenly changing his
mind he stepped towards me and just as we met he stooped down and
pulled a flower that struck his eye then rising up he grinned at
me and nodding said gooten morrow mine prudder it ish gooten
dag though what he meant by gooten dag i know no more than the
man in the moon having never studied german i did not at all like his
appearance in this spot at such a time but i reflected at last that he
was only culling simples and had paused near the beech-tree to look
at the funeral as would have been extremely natural in any man but
i liked the appearance of the funeral still less at such a particular
time and i thought there was something ominous in it

but my mind was fixed upon the treasure i was soon to enjoy too firmly
to be long drawn off by any such doleful spectacle and accordingly
having waited impatiently until the attendants on the funeral had
all stalked away as well as the german doctor i stole towards the
beech-tree and surveyed the ground at its roots there were some
stones lying among them which i removed as well as the long grass
that waved over their tops and looking closely i thought i could
see among some of the smaller roots of the tree that were pleached
together on the surface of the earth a sort of arrangement very much
in shape of a grave this was a new proof to me that the treasure lay
below and i considered that my good angel had platted these roots
together in order to direct me in what spot to dig

i could scarce avoid beginning on the instant but i remembered that
was not the hour i therefore concealed my spade and mattock and went
home when the first thing i did was to hunt me up a book that had the
lord's prayer in it for i feared to trust to my memory alone and
write this out backwards with the greatest care and i then spent the
remainder of the day in committing the words to memory in that order
but i found it a difficult task

as the evening drew nigh i found myself growing into such a pitch of
excitement that fearing i should betray the secret to jim jumble who
was constantly prying in upon me i resolved to walk to the village
and there remain until the hour for seeking the treasure should draw
nigh i had another reason for this step for my watch having gone
some month or two before julius cesar to satisfy a hungry fellow to
whom i owed money i knew not how to be certain of the hour unless
by learning it of some one in the village and to the village i
accordingly went soon after sunset




chapter xii


sheppard lee visits the village makes a patriotic speech and leaves
the fence


having arrived at the village i proceeded to a tavern which was the
chief place of resort especially after nightfall for all the idlers
and topers of the town of whom there were great numbers the village
at that time being a place of but little business

i found some ten or a dozen already assembled in the bar-room
drinking brandy smoking chewing talking politics and swearing i
had no sooner entered than some of them who were discoursing loudly
concerning the purity and economy of the government and the honesty of
those who supported it appealed to me my electioneering pilgrimage
through the country having caused me to be looked upon as quite a
knowing politician to assist them in the argument they were holding

remembering the scurvy way in which i had been treated by the party i
felt strongly tempted to give them a piece of my mind on the other side
of the question but i thought of my buried treasure and conceiving
it unwise to begin the quarrel at that time i made them no answer
but sat down in a corner where i hoped to escape observation here i
employed myself conning over the prayer backwards until i was assured
i was perfect in the exercise

i then still keeping aloof from the company gave my mind up to a
consideration of what i should do when i had transferred captain kid's
hoards of gold from the coffin to my house

the first thing i resolved to do was to pay my debts which how
greatly soever they oppressed me were not actually very fearful in
amount after which i was determined to rebuild my house restore my
fields to their original condition and go to law with mr aikin jones
who i had no doubt had cheated me out of my property it did not occur
to me that by such a step i should get rid of my second fortune
as expeditiously as i had the first all that i thought on was the
satisfaction of having my revenge on the villain whom i should have
punished in perhaps a more summary way had it not been for my respect
for the laws and my being naturally a peaceable man but i did not
think long of mr jones the idea of the great wealth i was soon to
possess filled my mind and i gave myself up to the most transporting
reveries

from these i was roused by hearing some one near me pronounce the words
captain kid's money the idea that was uppermost in my own mind
and looking round in a kind of perturbation i saw a knot of people
surrounding feuerteufel the german doctor one of whom was discoursing
on the subject of the treasure in the owl-roost and avowing his
belief that he that is the german doctor was conjuring after it
an imputation that gained great credit with the company there being
no other way to account for his visit to our village and his constant
perambulations through the woods and marshes in the neighbourhood of
the owl-roost

the german doctor to my great relief replied to this charge by
expanding his jaws as if he would have swallowed the speaker though he
was guilty of nothing beyond a laugh which was in depth and quality
of tone as if an empty hogshead had indulged in the same diversion
his voice was indeed prodigiously deep and hollow and even his laugh
had something in it solemn and lugubrious mine friends said he in
very bad english i fos can do men creat t'ings put i can no find no
captain kitt's money not at all i toes neffer looks for coldt except
in places fare gott puts it t'at iss in t'a coldt-mines with that
he laughed again and looking upon the people about him with great
contempt he walked up stairs to his chamber for he lodged in the inn

soon after this occurrence and just when i had sunk again into a
revery a man stepped up to me and saluted me in a way well suited to
startle me

sir said he friend kill-deer before you scratch your head
any more on this bench answer me a question what do you go
for brandy-toddy or gin-sling

it was squire higginson and he looked very good-humoured and waggish
but as i had dreamed of him so often and always as being in his
grave-clothes i was rather petrified at his appearance as if it were
that of a spectre rather than a mortal man as for our quarrel in the
meadow it had slipped my mind altogether until having recovered
my composure a little it was recalled to my recollection by the
associations arising out of his words

but i remembered the circumstance at last and being moreover offended
by his present freedom which was nothing less than sheer impertinence
i told him i desired to have nothing to say to him on which he fell
into a passion and told me i might go to the devil for a ragamuffin
and a turncoat politician but mad as he was he ended his speech by
bursting into a laugh and then tapping his forehead as before and
nodding his head and winking he left the bar-room to seek his chamber
 for he put up at the tavern as well as the german doctor

these insults threw me into some ferment and being irritated still
farther by the remarks of the company especially when some one asked
what the squire meant by calling me a turncoat politician i allowed
myself to be thrown into a passion in the course of which i gave such
of my old friends as were present to know that i had forsworn their
party and considered it to be composed of a pack of the corruptest
scoundrels in the country

this unexpected denunciation produced a great explosion my old friends
fell upon me tooth and nail as the saying is reviling me as a
traitor and apostate but on the other hand those of the opposition
who happened to be present ranged themselves on my side applauding
my honesty judgment and spirit to such a degree that i was more
than ever convinced i had been on the wrong side i met reproaches
with contempt and threats with defiance opposed words to words
and assertions to assertions for in politics we do not make use
of arguments and finding myself triumphantly victorious i mounted
into a chair and made a speech that was received by my new friends
with roars of applause intoxicated with these marks of approbation
i launched at once into a sea of declamation in which i might have
tossed about during the whole night had i not by chance while balking
for a word rolled my eyes upon the clock that stood opposite to me
in the bar and perceived that it wanted just a quarter of an hour
to twelve o'clock in a moment i forgot every thing but the treasure
that awaited me in the owl-roost i stopped short in the middle of a
sentence took one more look at the clock and then leaping down from
the chair rushed from the tavern without saying a word and to the
amazement of friend and foe ran at full speed out of the village and
this gait i continued until i had reached the old swedes church for i
had taken the footpath that led in that direction




chapter xiii


what befell the author on his way to the owl-roost


as it was now the full of the moon there was of course light enough
for my purpose but the sky was dappled with clouds very dense and
heavy some of which crossing the moon every minute or two there
was a constant alternation of light and darkness so that the trees
and all other objects were constantly changing their appearance now
starting up in bold relief white and silvery from the darkness and
now vanishing again into gloom

a cloud passed over the moon just as i reached the old church and the
wall of the burial-ground having fallen down at a certain place where
the rubbish obstructed the path it was my ill luck to break my shin
against a fragment the pain of which caused me to utter a loud groan
to my amazement and horror this interjection of suffering was echoed
from the grave-yard hard by a voice screaming out in awful tones
o lord o lord and casting my eyes round i beheld as i thought
three or four shapes that i deemed nothing less than devils incarnate
dancing about among the tomb-stones

i was seized with such terror at this sight that forgetting my hurt
and the treasure together i took to my heels and did not cease
running until i had left the church some quarter of a mile behind me
and i am not certain i should have come to a halt then had it not
been my fate to tumble over a cow that lay ruminating on the path
whereby besides half breaking my neck and cruelly scratching my nose
i stunned myself to that degree that it was some two or three minutes
before i was able to rise

i had thus time to recollect myself and reflect that i was running
away from captain kid's money the idea of losing which was not to be
tolerated a moment

but how to get to the owl-roost without falling into the hands of
the devils or spectres at the old church was what gave me infinite
concern the midnight hour the only one for attempting the treasure
with success was now close at hand so that there was no time left
me to reach the place by a roundabout course through the woods to the
right or over the meadows to the left i must pass the old church or
i must perhaps give up the treasure

there was no time to deliberate the figures i had seen and the cries
i had heard might have been coinages of my own brain nay the latter
were perhaps after all only the echoes of my own voice distorted
into something terrible by my fears i was not naturally superstitious
and had never before believed in ghosts but i cannot recollect what
precise arguments occurred to me at that moment to cause me to banish
my fears the hope of making my fortune was doubtless the strongest of
all and the moon suddenly shining out with the effulgence almost of
day i became greatly imboldened and in a word set forward again
resolved if met by a second apparition and driven to flight to
fly not backwards but forwards that is in the direction of the
owl-roost

on this occasion it was my fortune to be saluted by an owl that sat
on the old wall among some bushes and hooted at me as i went by and
notwithstanding that the sound was extremely familiar to my ears i was
thrown into a panic and took to my heels as before though as i had
resolved i ran onward pursuing the path to the swamp it is quite
possible there may have been a crew of imps and disimbodied spirits
jumping among the graves as before but as i had the good fortune to
be frightened before i caught sight of them i did not stop to look for
them and for the same reason i heard no more awful voices shrieking
in my ears i reached the owl-roost and the memorable beech-tree
where the necessity of acting with all speed helped me to get rid of
my terror i knew that i had not a moment to spare and running to the
bushes where i had hidden my mattock and spade i fetched them to the
tree and instantly began to dig not forgetting to pray backwards all
the while as hard as i could






chapter xiv


sheppard lee digs for the buried treasure but makes a blow with the
mattock in the wrong place


i was but an ill hand at labour and of the use of the spade and
mattock i knew nothing the nature of the ground in which i was digging
made the task especially difficult and disagreeable there were
many big stones scattered about in the earth which jarred my arms
horribly whenever i stuck them so that all my efforts to the contrary
notwithstanding i was every minute or two interrupting my prayer
with expressions which were neither wise nor religious but highly
expressive of my torture of body and mind and then i was digging among
the toughest and vilest roots in the world some of which i thought i
should never get through for i had not remembered to provide myself
with an axe and i was afraid to go home for one lest some evil
accident or discovery might rob me of the expected treasure

accordingly i had to do with a tougher piece of labour than i had ever
undertaken before in my whole life and i reckon i worked a full hour
and a half before i had got the hole i was excavating as deep as i
supposed would be necessary i succeeded at last however in throwing
out so much earth that when i measured the depth of the pit with my
spade i found the handle just on a level with the surface of the
ground

but i was not so near the treasure as i supposed i struck my mattock
into the clay scarce doubting that i should hear the ring of the iron
coffin instead of reaching that however i struck a great stone and
with a force that made the mattock-helve fly out of my hands to my
chin which it saluted with a vigour that set all my teeth to rattling
knocking me down into the bargain

having recovered from the effects of this blow i fell to work again
thumping and delving until i had excavated to the depth of at least
five feet my heart began to fail me as well as my strength as i got
so deep into the earth without finding the gold for i began to fear
lest my dreams had after all deceived me in my agitation of mind i
handled my tools so blindly that i succeeded in lodging my mattock
which was aimed furiously at a root among the toes of my right foot
and the pain was so horribly acute that i leaped howling out of the
pit and sinking down upon the grass fell straightway into a trance





chapter xv


in which sheppard lee finds himself in a quandary which the reader will
allow to be the most wonderful and lamentable ever known to a human
being


when i awoke from this trance it was almost daybreak

i recovered in some confusion of mind and did not for a moment notice
that i was moving away from the place of my disaster but i perceived
there was something strange in my feelings and sensations i felt
exceedingly light and buoyant as if a load had been taken not merely
from my mind but from my body it seemed to me as if i had the power
of moving whither i would without exertion and i fancied that i swept
along without putting my feet to the ground nay i had a notion that
i was passing among shrubs and bushes without experiencing from them
any hinderance to my progress whatever i felt no pain in my foot
which i had hit such a violent blow and none in my hands that had
been wofully blistered by my work nor had i the slightest feeling of
weariness or fatigue on the whole my sensations were highly novel and
agreeable but before i had time to analyze them or to wonder at the
change i remembered that i was wandering away from the buried treasure

i returned to the spot but only to be riveted to the earth in
astonishment i saw stretched on the grass just on the verge of the
pit the dead body of a man but what was my horror when perusing the
ashy features in the light of the moon i perceived my own countenance
it was no illusion it was my face my figure and dressed in my
clothes and the whole presented the appearance of perfect death

the sight was as bewildering as it was shocking and the whole state
of things was not more terrifying than inexplicable there i lay on
the ground stiff and lifeless and here i stood on my feet alive
and surveying my own corpse stretched before me but i forgot my
extraordinary duality in my concern for myself that is to say for
that part of me that eidolon or representative or duplicate of me
that was stretched on the grass i stooped down to raise the figure
from the earth in an instinctive desire to give myself aid but in
vain i could not lift the body it did not seem to me that i could
even touch it my fingers strive as i might i could not bring into
contact with it

my condition or conditions for i was no longer of the singular
number at this time can be understood only by comparing my confusion
of senses and sensations to that which occurs in a dream when one
beholds himself dead surveys his body and philosophizes or laments
and is all the time to all intents and purposes without being
surprised at it two persons one of which lives and observes while
the other is wholly defunct thus i was or appeared to be without
bestowing any reflection upon such an extraordinary circumstance or
being even conscious of it two persons in one of which i lived but
forgot my existence while trembling at the death that had overcome
me in the other my true situation i did not yet comprehend nor
even dream of though it soon turned out to be natural enough and i
understood it

i was entirely overcome with horror at my unfortunate condition and
seeing that i was myself unable to render myself any assistance i ran
upon an impulse of instinct to the nearest quarter where it was to be
obtained this was at the cottage or little farmhouse which i spoke
of before as standing on the by-road a little beyond the old church
it was occupied by a man named turnbuckle whom i knew very well and
who was a very industrious honest man although a tenant of mr aikin
jones

i arrived at his house in an amazingly short space of time rather
flying as it seemed to me through the air than running over the
marsh and up the rugged hill it was the gray of the morning when i
reached his house and the family was just stirring within as i ran
towards the door his dogs of which he had a goodly number as is
common with poor men set up a dismal howling clapped their tails
between their legs and sneaked off among the bushes a thing that
surprised me much for they were usually very savage of temper i
called to turnbuckle by name and that in a voice so piteous that in
half a minute he and his eldest son came tumbling out of the house
in the greatest haste and wonder no sooner however had they cast
eyes on me than they uttered fearful cries the old man fell flat on
his face as if in a fit and the son ran back into the house as if
frightened out of his senses

help me thomas turnbuckle said i i am lying dead under the
beech-tree in the hollow come along and give me help

but the old man only answered by groaning and crying and at that
moment the door opened and his eldest son appeared with a gun which
he fired at me to my inexpressible terror

but if i was frightened at this how much more was i horrified when the
old man leaping up at the discharge roared out o lord a ghost a
ghost and ran into the house

i perceived it all in a moment the howling of the dogs which they
still kept up from among the bushes the fear of turnbuckle and
his family all of whom old and young male and female were now
squeaking in the house as if old nick had got among them my being
in two places together and a thousand other circumstances that now
occurred to me apprized me of the dreadful fact which i had not
before suspected i was a dead man my body lay in the marsh under the
beech-tree and it was my spirit that was wandering about in search of
assistance

as this terrible idea flashed across my mind and i saw that i was a
ghost i was as much frightened as the turnbuckles had been and i took
to my heels to fly from myself until i recollected myself a little
and thought of the absurdity of such a proceeding but even this fatal
conception did not remove my anxiety in relation to my poor body or
myself as i could not help regarding my body and i ran back to the
beech-tree in a kind of distraction hoping i might have been revived
and resuscitated in my absence

i reached the pit and stared wildly about me my body was
gone vanished i looked into the hole i had excavated there was
nothing in it but the spade and mattock and my hat which had fallen
from my head when i leaped out of it after hurting my foot i stared
round me again the print of my body in the grass where it had lain
was quite perceptible for it was now almost broad day but there was
no body there and no other vestige excepting one of my shoes which
was torn and bloody being the identical one i had worn on the foot
hurt by the mattock




chapter xvi


sheppard lee finds comfort when he least expects it the extraordinary
close of the catastrophe


what had become of me that is what had become of my body its
disappearance threw me into a phrensy and i was about to run home
and summon old jim jumble to help me look for it when i heard a dog
yelping and whining in a peculiarly doleful manner at some little
distance down in the meadow and i instantly ran in that direction
thinking that perhaps the bloodthirsty beast might be at that very
moment dragging it away to devour it or hoping at the least to
light upon some one who could give me an account of it

i ran to a place in the edge of the marsh where were some willow-trees
and an old worm fence the latter overgrown with briers and
elder-bushes and there to my exceeding surprise i discovered the
body of squire higginson for he was stone dead lying against the
fence which was broken his head down and his heels resting against
the rails and looking as if while climbing it he had fallen down and
broken his neck his gun was lying at his side undischarged and his
dog whose yelping had brought me to the spot was standing by but i
must add that as soon as i approached him the animal betrayed as
much terror as turnbuckle's dogs had done and ran howling away in the
same manner

greatly incensed as i had been with squire higginson i felt some
concern to see him lying in this lamentable condition his face
blackened with blood as if he had perished from suffocation and
stooping down i endeavoured to take off his neckcloth and raise his
head in the hope that he might yet recover but i reckoned without my
host i had forgotten that i was a mere phantom or spirit possessing
no muscular power whatever because no muscles for even in walking
and running as i was now aware i was impelled by some unknown power
within me and not at all carried by my legs i could not bring my hand
into contact either with his cravat or head and for a good reason
seeing there was no substance in me whatever but all spirit

i therefore ceased my endeavours and began to moralize in a mournful
mood upon his condition and mine he was dead and so was i but there
seemed to be this difference between us namely that i had lost my
body and he his soul for after looking hard about me i could see
nothing of it his body as it lay there in the bushes was perfectly
useless to him and to all the world beside and my spirit as was
clear enough was in a similar predicament why might i not that is
to say my spirit deprived by an unhappy accident of its natural
dwelling take possession of a tenement which there remained no spirit
to claim and thus uniting interests together as two feeble factions
unite together in the political world become a body possessing life
strength and usefulness

as soon as this idea entered my mind or me for i was all mind i
was seized with the envy that possessed me when i first met the squire
shooting over my marshes how much better it would be i thought to
inhabit his body than my own in my own fleshly casing i should revive
only to poverty and trouble i had forgot all about captain kid's
money whereas if once in the body of squire higginson i should step
out into the world to possess riches respect content and all that
man covets oh that i might be squire higginson i cried

the words were scarce out of my mouth before i felt myself vanishing
as it were into the dead man's nostrils into which i that is to say
my spirit rushed like a breeze of air and the very next moment i
found myself kicking the fence to pieces in a lusty effort to rise to
my feet and feeling as if i had just tumbled over it

the devil take the fence and that jersey kill-deer that keeps it
in such bad order i cried as i rose up snatching at my gun and
whistling for my dog ponto my dog ponto it was even the truth
i was no more sheppard lee the poor and discontented no longer a
disimbodied spirit wandering about only to frighten dogs out of their
senses but john hazlewood higginson esq solid and substantial in
purse and flesh with a rosy face and a heart as cheerful as the
morning which was now reddening over the whole east if i had wanted
any proof of the transformation beyond that furnished by my own senses
and sensations it would have been provided by my dog ponto who now
came running up leaping on and about me with the most extravagant joy

god be thanked i cried dancing about as joyously as the dog i am
now a respectable man with my pockets full of money farewell then
you poor miserable sheppard lee you ragamuffin you poor wretched
shote you half-starved old sand-field jersey kill-deer you vagabond
you beggar you dicky dout with the wrong place in your upper story
you are now a gentleman and a man of substance and a happy dog into
the bargain ha ha ha and here i fell a laughing out of pure joy
and giving my dog ponto a buss as if that were the most natural act
in the world and a customary way of showing my satisfaction i began
to stalk towards my old ruined house without exactly knowing for what
purpose but having some vague idea about me that i would set old jim
jumble and his wife dinah to shouting and dancing an amusement i would
willingly have seen the whole world engaged in at that moment




chapter xvii


a natural mistake which although it procures the author a rough
reception at his own house has yet the good effect to teach him the
propriety of adapting his manners to his condition


i had not walked twenty yards before a woodcock that was feeding on
the edge of the marsh started up from under my nose when clapping my
gun to my shoulder i let fly at him and down he came

aha ponto said i when did i ever fail to bring down a woodcock
bring it along ponto you rascal rum-te ti ti rum-te ti ti
and i went on my way singing for pure joy without pausing to recharge
or to bag my game i reached my old house and began to roar out
without reflecting that i was now something more than sheppard lee
hillo jim jumble you old rascal get up and let me in

if it were the most natural thing in the world for me to be in one and
as i spoke i raised my piece when bow wow wough went my old dog
bull who had not bitten a man for two years but who now rushed from
his kennel under the porch and seized me by the leg

get out bull you rascal said i but he only bit the harder which
threw me into such a fury that i clapped the muzzle of my gun to his
side and having one charge remaining blew him to pieces

golla-matty said old jim from the window whence he had surveyed
the combat golla-matty shoot old bull

and with that the black villain snatched up the half of a brick which
i suppose he kept to daunt unwelcome visiters and taking aim at me
he cast it so well as to bring it right against my left ear and so
tumbled me to the ground i would have blown the rascal's brains out
in requital of this assault had there been a charge left in my piece
or had he given me time to reload but as soon as he had cast the
brick he ran from the window and then reappeared holding out an old
musket that i remembered he kept to shoot wild ducks and muskrats in
the neighbouring marsh with seeing this formidable weapon and not
knowing but that the desperado would fire upon me i was forced to beat
a retreat which i did in double quick time being soon joined by my
dog ponto who had fled like a coward at the first bow-wough of the
bulldog and saluted in my flight by the amiable tones of dinah who
now thrust her head from the window beside jim's and abused me as
long as i could hear

chapter i


some passages in the life of john h higginson esq the happy
sportsman with a surprising affliction that befell the author


i went off in a towering rage to think of the reception i had met and
that too after an absence of a whole night i had been bitten by my own
dog and driven from my own doors by my own servants but there was
something in these circumstances to admonish me of the change that had
come over me they reminded me of a fact that was not always present to
my thoughts to wit that i was no longer sheppard lee but mr john
hazlewood higginson a very different sort of personage altogether

to account for my forgetfulness of this important transformation i
must relate that although i had acquired along with his body all
the peculiarities of feeling propensity conversation and conduct
of squire higginson i had not entirely lost those that belonged
to sheppard lee in fact i may be said to have possessed at that
time two different characters one of which now governed me and now
the other though the squire's it must be confessed was greatly
predominant thus the moment after the transformation i found
myself endowed with a passion for shooting as if i had had it all my
life long a buoyant tone of mind and in addition as i by-and-by
discovered with somewhat a hot temper none of which had ever been
known to me before the difficulty was that i could not immediately
shake off my old sheppard lee habits and the influence of these
perhaps if one must scrutinize into the matter more than the
absolute retention of any other native peculiarities drove me into the
inconsistencies of which i was for a short time guilty but i will not
trouble the reader with philosophizing

i perceived from the repulse i had received from jim jumble that it
now became me to sink his old master altogether which i was very well
content to do and resolved accordingly although i could not help
thinking as i strode over the forty-acre farm how much satisfaction i
should have now that i was a rich man in putting it into fine order
but these thoughts were soon driven from my mind by ponto making a set
at some game and in a moment i was banging away right and left and
slaughtering the birds in the finest style imaginable

oh the delights of shooting woodcock it is rather hot work though
of a midsummer day and notwithstanding the prodigious satisfaction i
had in pursuing the sport i felt that my satisfaction would have been
still greater had i been a few stone lighter i began to think squire
higginson's fat rather inconvenient and i had the same opinion of a
touch of asthma or something of that nature which i found in his
lungs and besides there was a sort of whizzing and humming and
spinning in my head where they had been all the morning which were not
altogether agreeable

in consequence of these infirmities of my new body i began after a
while to weary of the sport and was just on the point of setting
off to the village to get my dinner when a crowd of men made their
appearance in the marsh and setting up a great shout at sight of
me began to run towards me i could not conceive the cause of such
a concourse nor could i imagine for what reason they directed their
steps towards me but hearing them utter the most furious cries and
perceiving that a multitude of dogs they had with them were rushing
against me as if to devour me i was seized with alarm and began to
retreat towards a wood that was not far off

this evidence of terror on my part only caused the people to utter
louder and more savage cries besides setting the dogs to running
faster and these ferocious animals gaining upon me and being on the
point of tearing me to pieces i was obliged to let fly my piece among
them whereby i shot one dead and disabled two or three others i then
defended myself with the breech of my gun until the men came up one
of whom tripped up my heels while the others seized and disarmed me
crying out that i was a murderer that i was found out and should be
hanged if there was any law in the county

i was confounded at this charge but how much greater was my amazement
when i understood as they haled me along towards the village which
they did very roughly that i was accused of having murdered sheppard
lee that is my own identical self

this accusation appeared to me so preposterous that in spite of my
indignation for my fears had now subsided i burst into a laugh
which only made them rail at me more furiously than i can express
hear him said they he laughs he thinks because he is a rich man
he can shoot any poor man he pleases and buy himself off but we will
show him there's law in jersey for aristocrats as well as poor men and
that we can hang a purse-proud man as soon as a beggar

and so they went on reviling me as if i had been the greatest criminal
in the land and dragging me as they said to a squire who would soon
show me what law was

i tried to reason with them but it was all in vain i then fell into
a passion and cursed and swore at them in a way which i am certain i
never did before at any human being having always had while sheppard
lee a great horror of profanity but this was just as fruitless
an expedient as the other they dragged me on until we reached the
village where we found all in a hubbub men women and children
running about as if mad and exclaiming that squire higginson had
murdered sheppard lee and hid the body in the owl-roost swamp as
soon as they saw me they set up a shout and some low fellows among
them raged in such a degree that i thought they would have massacred
me in the street they crowded round me hustled me seized me by the
collar shook their fists in my face and in general testified such a
vindictive concern for the murder of poor sheppard lee as they called
him that i might have supposed there was never a man more widely
beloved than myself had i not known otherwise or rather had i not
been too closely occupied to suppose any thing about it

in a word they carried me before squire andrew parkins who was a
fat man that i heartily despised and here they called upon him for
justice while i did the same thing swearing that i would prosecute
every rascal of them for assault and battery conspiracy defamation
and the lord knows what beside all of which it seems only inflamed
the mob against me the more they charged me with the murder and
the evidence they brought to support the charge appeared to justice
parkins sufficient to authorize his issuing a mittimus there were
twenty persons to swear i had two or three days before acknowledged
having had a quarrel with sheppard lee on his farm that is the
forty-acre and that he had ordered me off and there were twenty
more to swear i was a man of such a hot and furious temper that it
was a wonder i had not shot the poor man down on the spot then came
old turnbuckle and his son who swore that the ghost of sheppard lee
had come to them in the gray of the morning calling for help and
assuring them that he or his body lay murdered under the beech-tree
in the hollow that as soon as the phantom had vanished and they
recovered from their fears they roused the neighbours and sending
some to my house who learned i had not been at home all night the
others proceeded to the hollow where they found a freshly-dug grave
with spade and mattock in it and near it they lit upon my hat and one
of my shoes which latter was bloody as well as the grass on which
it lay that then looking round them they discovered me that is
john higginson sneaking away through the reeds on the marsh in a
suspicious way that at that moment old jim jumble was brought forward
who said i john hazlewood higginson had come to the house shot his
bulldog threatened to blow his brains out and bragged that i had
just finished or in other words murdered his master sheppard lee
and finally that this confirming the suspicions they all had against
me they pursued me i retreating and shooting their dogs like a
man conscious of guilt and anxious to escape and captured me not
without a furious resistance on my part

on the strength of this testimony i was committed to jail whither i
was conducted amid the shouts of the mob squire parkins doubtless to
beg off as well as he could afterward privately assured me that he
had committed me to prison not from any belief that i was guilty or
that the testimony really warranted such a step but because he was
afraid the people would otherwise murder me and considered that the
only way to protect me from their violence

meanwhile there was a great search made for my that is sheppard
lee's body the general belief being that i that is john h
higginson had cast it into the swamp after having been at the pains
to dig a grave wherein i at first designed to hide it and i do verily
believe that had my unfortunate old casing been found i should have
begun my new existence in the body of the man i had so much envied by
being hanged for the murder its sudden disappearance was therefore not
more extraordinary than it was really fortunate




chapter ii


the author being in prison makes a confidant of a deputy
attorney-general the inconvenience of telling a truth which happens
to be somewhat incredible


my wrath gave way when i found myself in prison and hearing from the
jailer that the grand jury was then in session and the prosecuting
attorney actually engaged in framing a bill of endictment against me
to send up to its members i began to think the matter rather serious
and resolved to end it before it proceeded further

i had already experienced the ill effects of attempting to sustain the
character of sheppard lee while in the body of another man and for
this reason was resolved to be more cautious for the future but i now
perceived i had no better way of relieving myself of my troubles than
by making the prosecutor who had been an old friend of mine and had
always treated me with respect acquainted with my transformation
after which i had no doubt he would throw his bill of endictment into
the fire i sent for him accordingly but was obliged to repeat the
message before he thought fit to make his appearance

you have perhaps made a mistake mr higginson said he as he
entered you have occasion for counsel but none that i can imagine
for me for as to my giving you any advice in this unfortunate
affair 

the devil take the affair said i in no amiable voice it was to
get rid of it entirely that i sent for you for i must stop that cursed
endictment of yours i don't want it said of me hereafter that i was
once in my life endicted for a felony

oh sir said he with a smile we are in no hurry about these
things the bill will lie over till we can procure a little more
evidence and some of a better quality don't be in any alarm but
allow me to recommend you to employ counsel my friend sharphead i
think will be your best man

i don't want any counsel said i and sharphead may go to the devil
i want to confide to you the true secret of this extraordinary affair

faith sir said he looking at me in surprise if you can do that
the case is not so ridiculous as i thought really mr higginson i
was rather amused than otherwise at the charge brought against you
not supposing you knew any thing of or had any connexion whatever
with the disappearance of poor sheppard lee but since you talk of
secrets sir i must inform you i am not the person you should make
any confessions to i must again recommend you to employ counsel

and with that he was about leaving me but i arrested him stop
jack said i his name was john darling and he is very well known
in the state though he was turned out of office you and i are old
friends and we must have a talk together

at these words he gave me a hard stare looking more astonished than
ever

jack said i taking him by the hand i'll make you stare harder
than that sheppard lee is no more dead than i am though as for his
body i believe old nick has got it now my boy i take it you will
act as a friend in this matter and not blab my secret but the truth
is it is john h higginson who is dead and i who am living

the deuse it is said the lawyer whose amazement set me into a
capital humour and pray sir he added if john h higginson is
dead who are you

sheppard lee said i bursting into a laugh only that you see me
now in john h higginson's body

i then proceeded to inform him as i have informed the reader of my
digging for the treasure of my sudden death of the visit of my spirit
to old turnbuckle's of the disappearance of my body of my finding
and entering that of squire higginson in which he now saw me and in
fine of all the other circumstances connected with the transformation
all which he heard like a man whom the novelty of the relation
astounded into marble

upon my soul said he when i had done you have told me a most
surprising story and so you really think yourself sheppard lee that
is sheppard lee's spirit in squire higginson's body

think myself sir said i a little fiercely

do you presume to slight my veracity sir or to doubt my common
sense

by no means said he i have the utmost respect for both your story
has completely satisfied me of your innocence a most wonderful story
sir truly a most wonderful story and repeating these words over and
over again he fell to nodding his head and musing staring at me all
the time like one who is lost in wonder and then suddenly rousing up
he burst into a roar of laughter seeing that i was incensed at his
merriment he hastened to apologize declaring that he was not laughing
at my story but at the absurdity he had been so nigh committing in
endicting me for my own murder and he added that my relation was
altogether the most remarkable he had ever heard in his life

i then gave him to understand i expected for very good and obvious
reasons that he would keep the story to himself which he faithfully
promised he then fell to cross-questioning me in relation to different
points and he was particularly curious to know what i supposed had
become of my body when not being able to satisfy him on that point
he himself suggested that perhaps squire higginson's spirit had taken
possession of it as i had done with his and carried it off for some
purpose or other and that we should soon have news of him an idea
that was so agreeable to him that he fell to laughing as hard as ever
sir said he shaking me by the hand in excellent good-humour we
will soon have you out of this dog-hole and that without betraying
your secret heaven forbid i should spoil the good fortune of my old
friend sheppard lee no sir i am no tale-bearer or blabber of
secrets comfort yourself sir i never had the least idea of endicting
you on this absurd charge nobody believes sheppard lee has been
murdered by you nor indeed by any one else no poor devil the
general opinion now is that he has taken himself off to get clear of
duns and sheriffs and as for the bloody shoe and hat why that's a
common way of turning pursuers off the scent by throwing dust in their
eyes the charge will be abandoned sir you will be liberated and
may if you like such amusement prosecute your captors by the dozen
for assault and battery farewell mr higginson that is mr lee
fortune smiles upon you at last and you are a happy a wonderful man
sir farewell

the attorney then left me and so much diverted was he by my adventure
that i could hear him indulge peal after peal of mirth until he had
got out of the prison

now it may be supposed that my story from its reasonableness carried
conviction to the attorney's mind and so i was persuaded but i
reckoned without my host the hypocritical gentleman did not believe
a word of it however much he pretended to do so but in this he was
like the rest of the fraternity i never indeed knew a lawyer to
believe any thing unless he was paid for it and i forgot to present
my gentleman a fee my story therefore not being paid for or proved
according to law only convinced this skeptical person that i the
unfortunate higginson as he called me had suddenly lost my senses
and gone staring mad and in consequence disregarding all his promises
of secrecy he ran over the whole village diverting every one he could
lay hands on with an account of the poor squire's hallucination
as he termed it that is to say his conceit that his body was now
inhabited by the soul of sheppard lee

but to give a certain personage his due or one of that personage's
representatives i must confess that darling who was at bottom a
good-natured fellow recollected one part of his promise and took
measures to effect my discharge from prison which was no very
difficult matter people being now pretty well aware of the folly
of the charge they had brought against me and the absurdity of the
evidence designed to support it the opinion was already entertained
that poor sheppard lee instead of being murdered had taken himself
out of the neighbourhood to avoid his creditors having left his hat
and shoe in the swamp only as blinds to those who might be most anxious
to secure his person and pursuers had already left the village to
discover his place of concealment




chapter iii


sheppard lee is visited by new friends released from prison and
carried to his new place of abode


another service that the attorney did me according to the jailer
through whom i discovered all these things was to despatch a messenger
to my friends in philadelphia with the news of my insanity and
imprisonment and a request that they should send proper persons to
take charge of me after being liberated and i was roused the following
morning by the appearance of some half a dozen kinsmen who had come to
the village for that purpose fully persuaded that they should find me
a raging lunatic

but the jailer's information had set me to reflecting upon my
difficulties all of which as i clearly perceived were owing to my
indiscretion in attempting to keep up the character of sheppard lee
while in another man's body i saw the necessity i was now placed under
to be mr john h higginson and nobody else for the future and so
i resolved to be for i did not like the idea of being clapped into a
mad-house by my new friends

yet they took me so much by surprise that i was guilty of some few
inconsistencies for it was not immediately that i felt myself at case
in my new character

the truth is my situation was peculiar and embarrassing with the body
of mr higginson i had acquired all his distinctive peculiarities
as i mentioned before but many of these were in a manner stupified
within me and required to be renewed or resuscitated by processes
of association i was like a man who has been roused from a lethargy
which had destroyed or obscured his memory though not his instincts
and who betrays complete ignorance of past events and forgetfulness
of old friends until some accidental circumstance a casual reference
to some past event the tone of a voice or other such cause recalls
him it may be to sudden and complete though usually imperfect
consciousness

thus when i was roused up in the morning and beheld a good-looking
personage of about my own years shaking me by the shoulder i regarded
him only as some impertinent stranger intruding upon my privacy
saluted him with divers epithets expressive of rage and indignation
and concluded by asking him who the devil he was

what i said he with the most doleful visage in the world why
timothy that is tim doolittle your brother-in-law don't you know
me

and don't you know me and me and me your cousin tom this
and your old friend dick that cried they all with horrible long
faces the oddity of which after a while set me a laughing especially
when i came to recollect them all as i did by-and-by when they had
pronounced their names for at each name it seemed to me as if a film
fell from my eyes and some spirit within awakened me to a vague
recollection of the person to whom it belonged in a word i became
aware that i was surrounded by a knot of my oldest and best friends
all of them excellent jolly dogs and good fellows who were come to
escort me home and assured me that i was no longer a prisoner

i shook them all by the hand and contrasting for a moment in my mind
the melancholy condition in which i had lived as sheppard lee with
my present glorious state surrounded by friends and conscious of
possessing lands houses stocks schuylkill coal-mines and the lord
knows what other goods beside i fell into a rapture danced about my
cell and hugged every person present as well as the jailer and my
old friend darling the attorney who happened at that moment to enter

bravo said tim doolittle now you're the true jack higginson again
and i don't believe you are mad a bit

mad said i thinking it needful to explain away that imputation
no and i never was i tumbled over an old rotten fence and hurt my
head which was in consequence in a whiz all day yesterday but now
it is clear enough i think i said some silly things about one thing
and another but that's neither here nor there

ah said tim doolittle touching his forehead and looking as grave as
a bullfrog it's well it's no worse for i always thought you had a
turn for apoplexy but i'm glad you are so well it will be good news
for poor margaret

margaret who the deuse is she said i feeling quite strange at the
name

why my poor sister your wife to be sure said he

my wife i recollected that i had a wife but the recollection
made me feel i knew not exactly why as if i had been suddenly soused
into cold water it was a highly uncomfortable idea and accordingly i
hastened to get rid of it

let us leave this confounded place i said and we left the prison

the prospect of a fine sunshiny day infused animation into my mind
which was vastly increased when i stepped into a splendid new barouche
with a pair of bay horses worth a thousand dollars for so much tim
gave me to understand i that is to say my prototype had given for
them scarce a month before the whole establishment being therefore my
own what a happy man am i ah poor miserable sheppard lee farewell
now to poverty farewell to discontent

such were my secret ejaculations as we set out in my splendid barouche
followed by a train of gigs and carriages that contained my friends i
esteemed myself the happiest man in the world and i gave my last sigh
to the memory of sheppard lee

what a glorious time we had of it on our way to philadelphia i found
myself the richest man in the company my pocketbook was full of
bank-notes and i resolved to give my friends a blow-out we stopped at
a certain village and at a certain hotel therein the master of which
prepares the best dinners and has the best butt of genuine madeira in
all new-jersey let us rest and rejoice i said and we will drive
into town after nightfall

my friends agreed we ate drank and were merry and it was not until
after sunrise the next morning that we found ourselves in philadelphia
and in my yes excellent reader in my house in chestnut-street
south side two doors from the corner of but it is needless to be
particular the house is yet standing in a highly aristocratic
neighbourhood and is not yet converted into a dry-goods shop

i reached my house i but before i relate what befell me in that
splendid pile of red bricks which like its neighbours seems to be
blushing all the year round at its naked simplicity i must say a few
words more of sheppard lee




chapter iv


containing illustrations of the advantages of dying an unusual death
in times of high political excitement


i never felt the slightest inclination to revisit the scenes of my late
trouble and discontent but the newspapers which are the lights of the
age though occasionally somewhat smoky acquainted me with the events
that followed after my marvellous disappearance what has become of
sheppard lee was the cry after his creditors had sought for him
in vain during a space of two weeks and more no vestige of him was
discovered not the slightest clew to indicate his fate beyond those
already brought to light in the owl-roost it was impossible he could
have fled without leaving some traces and none were found and why
should he fly men at last began to ask he was in debt it was true
but what could he gain by absconding since his little property was
necessarily left behind him

in a word the improbabilities of his having voluntarily fled were so
great that men began to recur to their original idea of his having
been murdered but why was he murdered and by whom some few began
to revive the charges against me that is to say against john h
higginson but brighter ideas were struck out and john h higginson
was forgotten an old friend of mine who never cared a fig for me
but who was ambitious to create a tumult and become the leader of a
party got up in a public place and recounted the history of william
morgan and his mysterious abduction and murder by the masons of the
empire state a terrible agitation at once seized his listeners poor
dear unfortunate sheppard lee they cried the masons have morganized
him for apostatizing from his oaths and revealing the secrets of the
society yes he has been morganized and giving way to their rage
they were on the point of tarring and feathering all the free-masons
they could lay their hands on when presto as the conjurers say
they suddenly made discovery that the masons could not have murdered
me for divulging secrets inasmuch as i had never known them nor for
apostatizing as i had never been a mason in my life

but the tumult was not allowed to subside my old friends of the
administration finding that their strength was dwindling away in
the country and dreading the event of the coming election unless a
reaction could be got up in their favour suddenly burst into a fury
swore that i had been made away with by the opposition on account
of my remarkable zeal energy and success as an electioneerer and
political missionary and taking my old hat and shoe and carrying
them round the village in solemn procession they stopped in the
market-place where one of their chief orators my faithful friend
the new postmaster delivered a sort of funeral address in which
he compared the opponents of the administration to cut-throats and
cannibals pronounced them the enemies of liberty swore that no honest
patriot was safe among them and declared his declaration being
illustrated by shouts and groans and grim faces that i had perished
the victim of a murderous opposition

but as if that was not immortality enough for one of my humble
pretensions the opposition instantly turned the tables upon their
accusers witnesses stepped forward to prove that on the night when
i was seen for the last time i had in the bar-room of the first
hotel in the village publicly denounced the hurrah party as being
based upon deception and fraud and avowed my determination not only
instantly to leave it but to go my death thenceforth in opposition
see the bloody vindictiveness and malice of the hurrah party
they cried before the sun rose upon this unfortunate and honest
man honest because he deserted his party the moment his eyes were
opened to its corruption he was a living man no longer the bravoes
of this horrible gang of mid-night murderers who have trampled on our
rights and liberties and now trample on our lives met the unlucky
patriot as he returned to his lowly cot and just heavens where was
he now save in his bloody and untimely grave he the humble the
unoffending the honest the universally-esteemed the widely-beloved
the patriotic sheppard lee waylaid and ambushed killed slain
murdered massacred the victim of a despotic and vindictive
cabal the martyr of liberty the  in short the noblest honestest
dearest best and most ill-used creature that ever dabbled in the
puddle of politics one might suppose that this outcry of the antis
backed as it was by the full proof of my change of politics would have
stopped the mouths of the hurrah-boys but it did no such thing they
only raved the louder as for the proof of my backsliding they treated
that with contempt proofs being as little regarded in politics as
arguments they accused the antis more zealously than before and the
antis recriminated with equal enthusiasm

there were some men in the village who strove to appease the ferment
by directing suspicion upon the german doctor and divers other
personages just as the humour of suspicion seized them furiously
accusing these suspected individuals of having had some hand in the
catastrophe but the german doctor and the other persons accused
had nothing to do with politics and were therefore suffered to go
their ways it is a great protection to one's reputation to keep
clear of politics the guilt of my murder was left to be borne by the
hurrah-boys and the antis one party or the other but as the evidence
was equally strong against either party and just as strong against
any one individual of either party as another it resulted that i was
murdered not only by both parties but by every man of both parties a
peculiarity in my history that proved me to have possessed though i
never dreamed it before a vaster number both of energetic friends and
bloodthirsty enemies each man being both friend and enemy than any
other man in the whole world

how the antis and the hurrah-boys settled the affair among them i did
not care to inquire i was engrossed by the novelties and charms of a
new being and willing to forget that such a poor devil as sheppard lee
had ever existed




chapter v


the true meaning of the word podagra


let the reader judge of my transport when my elegant new barouche
and splendid pair of horses that cost me a thousand dollars drew up
before my house in chestnut-street i stood upon the kerb-stone and
surveyed it from top to bottom the marble of the steps basement and
window-sills was white as snow and the bricks were redder than roses
the windows were of plate glass and within them were curtains of
crimson damask fronted with hangings of white lace as fine and lovely
as a bride's veil of true paris blonde and a great bouquet of dahlias
wreathed around a blooming rose glittered in each it was evidently
the house of a man of wealth and figure

the neighbourhood it was equally manifest was of the highest vogue
and distinction on one side was the dwelling of a fashionable
tailor who built a house out of every ten coats that he cut on the
other side was the residence of a retired tavern-keeper and right
opposite on the other side of the street was the mansion of one of
the first aristocrats in the town who had had neither a tailor nor
a tavern-keeper in the family for a space of three full generations
there was no end to the genteel people in my neighbourhood here was
the house of a firstrate lawyer there of a shop-keeper who had not
sold any thing by retail for ten years here a croesus of a carpenter
who turned up his nose at the aristocrat and there a plutus of a
note-shaver who looked with contempt on the gentleman of chips in
short my house was in a highly fashionable neighbourhood and i felt
as i mounted my marble steps that jack higginson the brewer as my
brother tim always called me was as genteel a fellow among them as
you would find of a summer's day

i entered the house as proud as lucifer telling my friends that they
should crack a bottle or two of my best port for tim had given me a
hint that my cellar contained some of the best in the world and
said tim giving me a wink we may take our fun now as sister
margaret  at that name i felt a cold creeping in my bones as
sister margaret is still in the country the ague left me i did not
think it he continued worth while to alarm her

the lord be thanked said i though why i said it i knew no more
than the man in the moon

we sat down we drank and we made merry that is to say they made
merry as for myself a circumstance occurred which nipped my pleasure
in the bud and began to make me doubt whether in exchanging the
condition of sheppard lee for that of john h higginson i had not made
somewhat of a bad bargain

i had managed somehow or other in the course of the night to stump
my toe or wrench my foot and though the accident caused me but
little inconvenience at the time the member had begun gradually to
feel uneasy and now as i sat at my table it grew so painful that
i was forced to draw off my boot but this giving me little relief
and finding that my foot was swollen out of all shape and beauty my
brother tim pronounced it a severe strain and recommended that i
should call in my family physician dr boneset a very illustrious
man and fine fellow who at that moment chanced to drive by in his
coal-black gig which looked as physicians gigs usually look as if
in mourning for a thousand departed patients

what's the matter said the doctor

why doctor said i i have given my foot a confounded wrench i
scarce know how but it is as big and as hot as a plum-pudding

hum ay very unlucky said the doctor off with your stocking and
let me look at your tongue pulse quite feverish fine port he said
drinking off a glass that tim had poured him and cocking his eye like
one who means to be witty fine port sir but one can't float in it
for ever without paying port-charges a very gentlemanly disease at
all events it lies between port and porter

port and porter disease said i slipping off my stocking as he
directed without well knowing what he meant my foot was as red as
a salamander swelled beyond all expression and while i drew the
stocking it hurt me most horribly

zounds doctor said i can that be a wrench

no said the doctor it's the wrencher genuine podagra pon
honour

podagra said i podagra said tim and podagra said the others
what's that

gout said the doctor

gout cried my friends gout roared my brother tim and gout
yelled i starting from the doctor as if from an imp of darkness who
had just come to make claim to me it was the unluckiest leap in the
world i kicked over a chair as i started and the touch was as if i
had clapped my foot into the jaws of a roaring lion crunch went every
bone crack went every sinew and such a yell as i set up was never
before heard in chestnut-street

you see gentlemen i'll take another glass of that port mr
doolittle you see what we must all come to this is one of the
small penalties one must pay for being a gentleman when one dances
one must pay the piper now would my friend higginson there give a
whole year of his best brewing that all the pale ale and purple port
that have passed his lips had been nothing better than elder-wine
and bonny-clabber but never mind my dear sir said the son of
æsculapius with a coolness that shocked me as long as it's only in
your foot it's a small matter

a small matter i grinned at him but the unfeeling wretch only
repeated his words a small matter

i had never been sick before in my life as john h higginson my
worst complaints had been only an occasional surfeit or a moderate
attack of booziness and as sheppard lee i had never known any disease
except laziness which being chronic i had grown so accustomed to
that it never troubled me but now ah now my first step into the
world of enjoyment was to be made on red-hot ploughshares and pokers
my first hour of a life of content was to be passed in grinning and
groaning and but it is hardly worth while to say it the gout should
be confined to religious people for men of the world will swear and
that roundly

for six days  six mortal days  did i lay upon my back enduring
such horrible twitches and twinges in my foot that i was more than
once on the point of ordering the doctor to cut it off and i do not
know how far that conceit might have gone had not the heartless
fellow who i believe was all the while making game of my torments
assured me that the only effect of the dismemberment would be to drive
the enemy into the other foot where it would play the same tricks over
again the gout said he has as great an affection for the human
body as a cat has for a house in which she has been well treated when
it once effects a lodgment and feels itself comfortable 

comfortable said i with a groan

in good easy quarters 

don't talk to me of easy quarters said i for if i were hacked
into quarters and that by the clumsiest butcher in the town i could
not be more uneasy in every quarter

i am talking said dr boneset not of you but of the disease and
what i meant to say was that when it once finds itself at home in a
good wholesome corporation of a man there you may expect to find it a
tenant for life

for life said i i am the most wretched man in existence oh
sheppard lee sheppard lee what a fool were you to think yourself
miserable doctor i shall go mad

not while you have the gout said he tis a sovereign protection
against all that but let us look at your foot and the awkward or
malicious creature managed to drop a tortoise and gold snuff-box of
about a pound and a half weight which he was always sporting right
upon the point of my great toe while he was looking at it had it been
a ton and a half instead of a pound and a half in weight it could not
have thrown me into greater torture and the the man he thought he
had settled the matter by making me a handsome apology he left me to
endure my pangs and to curse squire higginson's father grandfather
great-grandfather and in general all his forefathers who had
entailed such susceptible great toes upon the family in a word i was
in such a horrible quandary that i wished the devil would fly off with
my new body as he had done before with the old




chapter vi


sheppard lee's introduction to his wife and his suspicion that all is
not gold that glistens


but there is as philosophers say an unguent for every wound a solace
for every care and it was my fate to experience the consolation that
one provides beforehand against the gout as well as all other ills man
may anticipate in the person of a faithful spouse on the fourth day
of my malady and just at a moment when i was fairly yelling with pain
a lady neither young nor beautiful but dressed like a princess save
that her shoes were down at heel and her bonnet somewhat awry stepped
up to my bedside seized me by the hand and crying out oh my poor
dear husband burst into tears

her appearance acted like a charm even my foot that seemed to be
roasting over one of nott's patent anthracite blazers grew cool
and comfortable in the chill that was diffused over my whole body
complaint was silent at the sight of her pain vanished at her touch i
forgot that i had the gout and remembered only that i had a wife

i was struck dumb and presume i should not have groaned again for
twenty-four hours had not my consort in the exuberance of her
affection and grief thrown her arms around my neck and thereby
brought the whole weight of her body upon my foot which after
having tried all parts of the bed i had at last lodged upon the
very extremity of the feathers by which act of endearment my poor
unfortunate limb was crushed against the horrible log of mahogany that
made one side of the bed-stead and ground to pieces had my wife been
my wife twenty times over i must have uttered just as loud a cry as i
did and repeated it just as often

she started up and regarded me with severity

is that the way you use me said she i believe i had rather pushed
her away but how could i help it is that the way you welcome me
home whither i have come leaving kinsfolk and friends to nurse
you barbarous man you hate me yes and besides having no longer any
love for me you have not even the slightest regard for my feelings
but don't think mr higginson that i will be treated so any longer
you may break my heart your poor margaret's heart if you will
but but  and here the affectionate creature was so overcome that
she could not utter another word but sat down wringing her hands and
weeping as if i had broken her heart and she had not crushed my foot
but as far as my experience enables me to form any opinion on such a
subject i must say that wives have an extraordinary knack at turning
the tables on their husbands

for heaven's sake madam said i don't set me distracted the
pain and her absurd reproaches together made me both frantic and
ferocious don't make me believe that adam's wife was made out of the
bone of a gouty leg instead of a good sound rib

what do you mean by that sir said mrs higginson

only said i gritting my teeth that i have some thoughts she must
have been a piece of the sorest bone in his body

my wife marched up to the bed and looked me in the face my wrath
went out like a gas-light before a black frost my agonies again
disappeared there was no standing that look unless one could stand
the look of a jersey black-snake famous beyond all other snakes for
its powers of fascination and talking of snakes i must add that
while my wife gave me that look i felt as if one just turned out of
winter-quarters horribly cold and creepy were slipping down my back
she looked at me with mingled anger and disdain

how often have i told you mr higginson she said never to attempt
to be witty since you only expose your folly i won't use any harder
word and whatever you do sir she added beginning to cry again
don't make a jest of your wife sir you're always doing it sir
you're always making me appear ridiculous to your friends and to
myself you treat me as if i were a fool you 

madam said i endeavouring to appease her a little for i was quite
overcome by her violence remember that i have the gout and am
suffering the 

yes she cried and you are determined that everybody else shall
suffer as well as yourself and me in particular oh mr higginson
how can you use me so i'll never speak to you another word

and down she sat again weeping and wringing her hands harder than
ever and moping and whining the lord knows how long

sheppard lee sheppard lee i muttered but i took good care not to
mutter aloud you were not the most miserable dog in the world by a
great deal a gouty constitution and a perverse wife are oh pangs and
purgatory

i hoped my consort being so greatly incensed would take herself out
of the room when i determined though it should cost me a howl for
every step to get up and lock the door on her come of it what might
but she was not of that mind she maintained her seat sobbing and
sighing and by taking off her hat and flinging it pettishly into
a corner made it manifest that she had determined to nurse me in
earnest though in a way entirely of her own happily the paroxysm of
suffering which was at its height when she entered soon subsided
and being left greatly exhausted and her sobs having somewhat of a
soporific quality i managed notwithstanding my mental disquiet to
fall fast asleep whereby i got rid for a time of an evil in many
respects equal to the gout itself

two days after i was able to leave my bed though not to walk had i
been i am strongly of opinion i should have walked out of my house 
out of the city of philadelphia and perhaps out of the united states
of america nay and upon a pinch out of the world itself to get rid
of my beloved wife who would have believed in our village that john
h higginson who seemed to have nothing in the world to do but to
slaughter woodcocks beat his dog ponto and ride about in a fine new
barouche with a pair of horses that cost a thousand dollars who had a
dwelling-house in chestnut-street a brewery in the northern liberties
with an ale-butt as big as the basin of the mediterranean a goodly
store of real estate in town and country bank-stock and coal-mines
and a thousand other of the good things of the world who i say
would have believed that this same john h higginson was decidedly the
most miserable dog in the whole universe it was truth every word of
it and before i was six days old in my new body i wished no not
that the devil had me but i was more than willing he should have the
better half of me i had the gout my wife was a shrew and i was a
henpecked husband

yes the reader may stare and bless his stars the manly john h
higginson who seemed to have no earthly care or trouble and who was
so little deficient in spirit that he could quarrel with a jersey
farmer while trespassing on his grounds shoot his bull-dog and take
aim at his negro had long since succumbed to the superior spirit and
acknowledged the irresponsible supremacy of his wife in the field
and at a distance from his house he was a man of spirit and figure
but at home the most submissive of the henpecked resistance against a
petticoat government is as all know the most hopeless of resistance
a single man has often subverted a monarchy and overturned a republic
but history has not yet recorded an instance of successful rebellion on
the part of a married man against the tyranny of a wife the tongue of
woman is the only true sceptre for unlike other emblems of authority
it is both the instrument of power and the axe of execution john h
higginson attempted no resistance against the rule of his wife the
few explosions of impatience of which he was now and then guilty were
punished with a rigour that awed him into discretion on this subject i
feel myself eloquent and i could expatiate on it by the hour but i am
writing not so much the history of my reflections as of my adventures
and i must hasten on with my story




chapter vii


a comparison between dunning and scolding with some thoughts on
suicide


no one but a henpecked husband who may happen to be shut up in prison
with his wife can appreciate the horror of the situation in which
i now found myself placed the gout prevented my escaping even for
a moment from the sway of my spouse she truly had me tied to her
apron-string and as i may say by a cord that went round my sore
foot i was a martyr to two of the greatest ills that ever afflicted
a son of adam and the two together were not to be borne either if
alone i might perhaps have tolerated in consideration of the many
good things that marked my lot i might have endured the gout if i
had had a wife who instead of scolding at me would have suffered me
as a good wife should to do all the scolding myself or i might even
have submitted to the tyranny of my margaret had i been able to beat a
retreat when i grew tired of it but my wife and the gout together were
not to be borne by any human being they set me after a while quite
distracted

what pleasure had i in being the rich john h higginson it was in vain
that my brother-in-law tim who it appears was the junior partner
and factotum in the brewery as well as manager-general of my affairs
bragged to me of the astonishing rise in my property and declared
i was already worth a hundred thousand dollars in the midst of my
exultation i heard my wife's voice on the stairs and my joy oozed out
of the hair of my head i could only look at tim and groan and tim did
the same for poor fellow though only her brother he was as much
henpecked as myself never mind said tim consolatorily your foot
will be well by-and-by and then we shall have a jolly time together
but my comforter took great care on such occasions to sneak out of the
house in good time and so leave me to bear the evil by myself

in the course of two weeks or thereabouts my foot had so far
recovered that i was able to put it on the ground and hobble about a
little with a crutch but i had lost all hope of ever being able to
resume my exercises in the field i was therefore reduced to despair
and my wife becoming more intolerable every day i began to be so weary
of existence that i was once or twice on the point of making away with
myself

she was in truth the nonpareil of women and of scolders i have
called her a shrew but it must not be supposed she was of that species
to which men give the name of tartar she was none of your fierce
pepper-tempered creatures who wrangle in a loud voice over the whole
house and sometimes take broomsticks to the servants such viragoes
are in a measure sufferable for they are sometimes in a good-humour
my margaret was of the family of croakers as they are called that
is of a lugubrious grumbling complexion always sad and whining full
of suspicions and reproaches now in tears now in hysterics always
in an ill-humour and so keeping every one about her in a state of
misery i never knew a servant male or female old or young black
or white to remain in the house two weeks at a time except a poor
little negress that had been bound to me that is my prototype under
indentures and she after running away a dozen times began to mope
and pine and look so sorrowful that out of pity i sent her home
to her mother as for myself being incapable of flying and exposed
all day long to her lectures and reproaches i became melancholy and
desperate wished myself sheppard lee again with the constable and
sheriff both after me and twice or thrice as i have hinted before
resolved to put an end to my life

one day while i was reading the papers i fell upon the account of
a man who had hanged himself he was in good circumstances said
the journal and had a wife and three children no reason has been
assigned or suspected for his rash act

no doubt his wife was a shrew said i to myself and there was no
way of getting rid of her and so it was the wisest thing the poor man
could do

i thought over this occurrence so long that it produced a great
effect upon my mind and my wife leaving me one day more incensed and
desperate than ever i snatched up a bit of cord that lay in my way
and resolved to strangle myself forthwith i should have hanged myself
over the chamber door but was in dread i might slip down to the floor
and hurt my foot and thinking it more genteel to die in my bed i made
the cord into a noose or ring through which having placed it about
my neck i clapped a silver candlestick by means of which i thought i
might twist the cord tight enough to strangle me and so i might had i
possessed the nerve but in truth i no sooner found my breath a little
obstructed than i became alarmed with the idea of apoplexy which was
always frightful to me and so gave over my purpose

on another occasion i sent to an apothecary whom i knew for a vial
of prussic acid which takes life so expeditiously that as i
supposed one could have no time to be in pain but that i might know
in what manner it operated i gave a quantity to a neighbour's cat
which had found her way into my chamber and made friends with me
during my confinement and the creature was thrown into such horrible
convulsions and set up such a diabolical yell that although she was
stone-dead in less than half a minute i was convinced this was the
most uncomfortable way of dying that could be hit on

i had then some thoughts of drowning myself and only hesitated whether
i should try the experiment in the bath-tub or wait until i could bear
a ride over the paving-stones to the river as to cutting my throat or
blowing my brains out i had never the slightest idea of trying either
for in respect to the former besides that it makes such a horrible
puddle of blood about one's body it causes one to look as vulgar and
low-lived as a slaughtered bullock and as for the latter i was so
familiar with fire-arms that i knew them to be weapons one cannot
trifle with

but fortune that had served me such a scurvy trick in saddling me with
gout and a scolding wife along with the wealth of john h higginson
willed that i should employ none of these deadly expedients against my
life but get rid of my distresses in a manner much more remarkable and
novel




chapter viii


sheppard lee forms sundry acquaintances some of which are genteel


it was three full weeks before i left my chamber and during the last
days of that confinement the only amusement i had consisted in looking
from the window after properly poising my leg on a soft cushion upon
what passed in the streets and this as the reader may suppose i only
enjoyed when my wife left off tormenting me for a moment to go down
stairs and torment the servants

this was poor pastime for one of my habits and turn of mind but my
wife had made me contemplative and had it not been for the perpetual
dread of her return that i was under i think i might have extracted
some diversion from what i saw in the streets but being in constant
fear and vexation i looked on with a spirit too morose and cynical for
my own enjoyment

day after day between the hours of five and six in the afternoon
i observed mr cutclose the tailor descend from his marble steps
and climb upon the back of a horse to take the evening air he
rode like one who had taken his chief lessons on the shop-board
and i often wondered he did not draw up his legs and sit on the
saddle hunker-fashion at once but what particularly struck me
was the compliment he paid himself of wearing his own coats cut
american-fashion about the arm-holes and so keeping himself in
purgatory all day long he used to give parties every fortnight and
invite all the dandies whom he had down in his tick-book by which
means his entertainments were rendered highly genteel and fashionable

next door to mr cutclose lived the great lawyer of our square the
celebrated coke butterside esq i could see him sally out every
morning with his green bag which he carried in his own hands either
because he intended to be a candidate at the next congressional
election and would seem democratic or because he was afraid if
he intrusted it to another the devil might snap it up as his own
property he had a lordly self-satisfied air about him as if he felt
the full merit of his vocation and prided himself upon having more men
by the ears than any other in the whole city his bow was exceedingly
condescending and his look protecting

nearer at hand was the dwelling of the old note-shaver old goldfist
as they called him though his true name was skinner he was horribly
rich and such a miserly insatiable old hunks that although he had
ostensibly retired from business he was originally a pawn-broker
for some six or seven years he still kept up his trade in a certain
way that was not so reputable as gainful and of which i shall have
occasion to say something by-and-by he was said to be a good friend of
such desperate young gentlemen as moved in high life and had passable
expectations from rich uncles and parents but he was said to hold his
friendship at very extortionate prices how such a skinflint as he
ever came to live in a good house and in a fashionable quarter was a
question not easy to solve but according to tim my brother-in-law's
story he came for economy having got the house of a demolished
aristocrat who had fallen into his clutches and found it in so
dilapidated a condition that he chose to live in it himself rather than
submit to the expense of preparing it for a tenant it brought him
moreover nearer to his customers and perhaps the old curmudgeon who
had a daughter and a brace of hopeful sons had a hope of thus getting
them into society

but one who lives at heaven's gate does not live in heaven as the
saying is old goldfist kept neither horses nor carriages nor did he
give parties i doubt whether he ever asked anybody to dine with him
in his life and as for his boys and his girl all of whom were grown
up he kept them in such a mean condition that they were not company
for genteel people everybody despised them especially cutclose the
tailor who turned up his nose at them and called them rooterers
which i am told for i never troubled myself to study the modern
languages there being so many of them is a french word signifying
low people

 perhaps roturiers rooterers is however good america french
 printer's devil

this old money-maker who had a stoop in the shoulders used to
parade the street up and down before his own door every sunshiny
day in a thread-bare brown coat to which he sometimes added a blue
spencer roundabout a silver-headed stick in one hand and a yellow
handkerchief in the other the latter he was wont every two or three
minutes to clap to his nose producing thereby an explosion which
notwithstanding the muffler over his nostrils was prodigiously strong
and sonorous and once to my knowledge it frightened a young lady
into the gutter

i could say a great deal more of this old gentle man whom everybody
despised but whom every man took off his hat to on account of his
wealth but i shall have occasion to speak of him hereafter

as for the rest of my neighbours i do not think them worthy of notice
i might indeed except mr periwinkle smith my opposite neighbour
spoken of before whom i knew to belong to that order of aristocracy
which is emphatically termed chip-chop and who was of such pure blood
that it had known no mechanical taint for three different generations
the nearest approach to such disgrace being found in a family of
ragamuffins who claimed to be mr smith's relations merely because
they were descended from his grandfather but who were very properly
discountenanced by him

this old gentleman had a daughter who seemed to be universally admired
judging from the numbers of visiters of both sexes who besieged her
father's door every morning to do her justice i must say she was very
handsome but she had the additional merit of being an only child and
therefore an heiress as was supposed i thought so myself until tim
who knew something of everybody's affairs assured me that her father's
estate was eaten up by mortgages that he was poor as a rat and would
die insolvent

among the many young gentlemen who paid court to the fair miss smith
i noticed one who besides being more assiduous in his attentions
seemed also to enjoy a greater share of her regard than others he was
a young fellow of uncommonly genteel figure that is he was long and
lank somewhat narrow in the shoulders but clean-limbed and straight
as an arrow he had a long face and hollow cheeks but what his jaws
lacked in flesh was made up to them in beard his whiskers which
were coal-black being as exuberant as if made by a brush-maker and
stretching from his temples to the point of his chin and so enveloping
his whole face he had besides a pair of peaked mustaches that would
have done honour to the grand seignior and with a turban and caftan
on he might have paid his respects to the alumni of any college in the
land without even the necessity of speaking bad latin he dressed
well walked with a step as easy and majestical as a stork or an
ostrich and was evidently a favourite with the ladies

 here sheppard lee seems to have had in his eye a very ingenious
loafer of pearl slip or thereabouts who some years since was seized
with the whim of travelling and bamboozling the politic especially
the learned part thereof by the aid of little dog-latin horribly
anglicized in idiom and pronunciation a stock of gothamic impudence
and features truly yankee and vernacular he convinced the cognoscenti
of one or more learned institutions that he was a highly unlucky son
of a turk born all the way off at damascus

his name tim told me was i d that is to say isaac
dulmer dawkins though in consideration of the rusticalness of the
first member of the triad and from regard to his feelings which
were outraged by its pronunciation his friends had universally
agreed to suppress it and in consequence he was called i dulmer
dawkins esquire that title being added because it is the only one
an american gentleman not in office or the militia can claim he
was as timothy assured me a dandy of the true style being a born
scion of the chip-chop order and as such admitted to all its honours
and immunities though without the support of any living relations
in society or as his ill luck would have it of connexions either
he was said to possess some little property in town and what was
still better to be the heir of a rich uncle without children whom he
expected to die within a reasonable period as for his town property
my brother tim doubted its existence altogether and would perhaps
have been as skeptical in regard to the uncle had he not known that
an uncle did really exist and a rich one too for he was largely
concerned in the distilling and lumbering business on the susquehanna

i am particular in making the reader acquainted with mr i dulmer
dawkins inasmuch as it was my fortune after a time to fall into a
connexion with him myself as intimate as it was unexpected

when i first saw him i accounted him an ugly and uncouth personage
and i regarded him with contempt and dislike i had acquired along
with other peculiarities of john h higginson a hearty hatred for all
people who considered themselves better than myself for rich and
respectable as i was i soon perceived that i was considered a very
low vulgar personage by the true chip-chop aristocracy and i longed
greatly at times as i looked out of the window upon them to take some
of them by the ears and settle the matter of superiority between us in
that way

but as for mr dulmer dawkins i soon began to experience an interest
in him which was indeed of a somewhat envious complexion i frequently
saw him dancing along at the side of the fair miss smith and he
seemed so exceedingly happy and content and she cast upon him so many
approving glances that i could not help contrasting his condition with
mine there he strutted in the open street young active and hale
as ignorant of disease as of care and here sat i in a sick chamber
imprisoned with the gout there he moved at the side of a young and
elegant woman who eyed him with admiration doubtless also with
regard and who had such native amiableness and cheerfulness imprinted
together on her countenance that it was plain she must prove a
blessing rather than a curse to him who should be so happy as to wed
her while i miserable i was tied to such a wife as i could scarce
have the cruelty to wish bestowed upon my worst enemy contracted to an
ague married as i may say to a toothache i should have been glad to
exchange conditions with mr dulmer dawkins ay by my honour if there
was ever honour in man or with anybody else

from tim's account it seemed that my young gentleman had a longer face
than head in other words that nature had endowed him more bountifully
with beard than brains and in truth i judged by the way he showed
his teeth and rolled his eyes at the fair miss smith and a thousand
other little grimaces and affectations i was witness to that he
was neither more wise nor brilliant than the others of his tribe
but what of that wisdom and care go hand in hand and wit makes us
uncomfortable fools are the only happy people so i used to think
while i looked on mr i d dawkins and the fair miss smith

but it is an ill way to pass time peeping into millstones or reading
men's history out of their faces dulmer dawkins had his cares as well
as another i suddenly missed him from the street the fair miss smith
made her promenades attended by other admirers and for three whole
days mr dawkins was invisible on the fourth he reappeared i saw him
as he came up the street escorting another belle entirely unknown to
me but of a dashing appearance as he passed mr periwinkle smith's
house the fair miss smith issued from the door mr dawkins made her a
low and most elegant bow his companion waved her fan and they passed
on looking unutterable things at one another the fair miss smith
seemed confounded a flush appeared on her face and then vanished
she looked after her admirer and then with her attendants two young
coxcombs who were with her descended the steps and walked down the
street i saw her once turn her head half round as if to look again
after dulmer but her curiosity anger sorrow or whatever feeling it
was prompted the movement was restrained and she strode off at an
unusually rapid and unfashionable gait so so my turtles have been
quarrelling i said to myself and the fair miss smith is just a
jezebel like the rest of her confounded sex it never occurred to me
to think a quarrel arising between two persons of different sexes could
be caused by any thing but the unreasonable behaviour of the lady

it was two weeks before i saw dulmer dawkins again and then i beheld
him under a new aspect




chapter ix


the author grows weary of his wife and mistakes the schuylkill for the
river lethe the tragical adventure that befell a young gentleman in
that romantic tide with its effects upon the destinies of sheppard lee


it may be supposed since i was able to amuse my mind with such
observations that they detracted from the miseries of my condition
or at least assuaged in some measure my pangs but as well might one
believe that the condemned malefactor who looks out from his cart
on the volunteer companies escorting him to the gallows and admires
the splendid incoherence of their trappings their infantry coats and
horsemen's hats their republican faces and imperial colours feels
thereby less dissatisfaction with his shroud and coffin and the rope
coiled so inelegantly round his neck my observations were made only at
intervals that were both brief and rare my wife was the most attentive
creature that ever set a husband distracted and under the plea of
nursing me gave me so much of her company that i was gradually driven
to desperation in course of time i was happily able to get into my
barouche and thus for a short hour or two escape my tormentor had
that period been deferred a week later i should certainly have taken
an ounce of arsenic that i found lying in a closet though i knew it
was awful bad stuff to swallow

as soon as i found myself once more at liberty i began to con over
a project i had formed of deserting my dear margaret altogether and
this i resolved to put into execution the moment my foot should be well
enough for travelling but oh horror just as the doctor pronounced me
cured i was seized with a second paroxysm and beheld nothing before
me but eternal captivity and unmitigated wife

this attack was brought on by the mere triumph of restoration the
afternoon before i drove out upon the schuylkill with tim and another
friend and several other jolly dogs meeting us we stopped together
at a well-known house of entertainment on the banks of that river and
resolved to enjoy ourselves i declare in all sincerity that i was
very moderate both in eating and drinking but having sat at the table
until after nightfall and being well content to tarry longer i made
a sudden and rash resolution not to return that night at all nor upon
the following day either if i could avoid it but as it was necessary
to account for my absence to my wife i instructed tim to tell her i
had contracted a sudden fit of podagra which made it proper i should
not expose myself to the night-air with this fib in his mouth tim
who considered the whole thing a capital joke as indeed he did every
other of my devising returned to the city whither he was followed by
the others before midnight

now whether it was that the immoderate satisfaction i indulged in at
enjoying even a few hours of quiet was an excess capable of bringing
on a paroxysm of gout whether it was the unwholesome night-air of
the schuylkill so famous for its agues and bilious fevers or whether
indeed it was not the lie i had invented which was punished upon me in
the reality of the affliction i had assumed it is certain that i woke
up the next morning in quite a feverish condition and with all the
symptoms of returning podagra though i did not immediately suspect it
it was not until towards nightfall that i understood my situation

in the meanwhile tim had returned and again driven back to town
without me to assure my affectionate spouse that being entirely
recovered i thought it best to defer my return until the evening at
which time i proposed to be sick again so as to excuse my remaining
from home a second night in this way i designed to put off my return
from night till morning and from morning till night as long as i
could

feeling a little better about dinner-time i indulged in a hearty meal
and then lay down but i had not slept many hours before i dreamed the
devil was tugging at my foot with a pair of red-hot tongs and starting
up in anguish i perceived clearly enough that my malady had returned

miserable wretch that i am i cried why was i not content to
be sheppard lee was poverty worse than the gout was debt equal
in torment to a scolding wife what a fool i was to change my
condition would that i was now a dog

i hobbled down to the porch of the inn not without pain for my foot
was awfully tender and began to picture to myself the misery that was
inevitably prepared for me the thought of living a month longer in the
same house with my wife entirely at her mercy drove me to despair in
the midst of which being roused by the sound of approaching wheels
i looked up and beheld my wife herself advancing as fast as my
elegant bays could bear her to pay me a visit i knew her by her white
feathers and my brother tim was sitting at her side

at this sight my philosophy forsook me altogether i fell into a
phrensy and disregarding the condition of my foot or rather sharpened
and confirmed in my purpose by the pangs it gave me i rushed down
to the river-side towards a spot where i knew there was deep water
resolved to throw myself in without a moment's delay and this without
considering that as it was hot weather i should spoil the water drunk
by my fellow-citizens this was an objection that partly occurred to
me before when debating the subject of drowning and i think it so
serious a one that i would recommend to the councils of philadelphia
to appoint a bailiff whose express duty should be to prevent people
drowning themselves in the basin and the same person might have an eye
to the drowned cats dogs pigs calves dead fish and swimming boys
that somewhat detract from the agreeableness of the water

i reached the place just as the barouche drew up at the door and
hopping forward i began to slip off my coat and waistcoat and draw
out my watch and pocketbook though for what purpose i am sure i
cannot say but what was my surprise to perceive myself forestalled
in my intentions by another person who stood upon the very rock from
which i designed to throw myself and was evidently preparing to
exercise justice upon himself in the same summary way he was a tall
lank personage of highly genteel figure and habit but his back being
towards me i could not see his face

i had scarce laid eyes upon him before with a very violent motion of
his arm he cast his hat into the stream and immediately afterward
his neck-cloth then slapping his hands together like one who is
about rushing into a fight and rushing into it with resolution he
exclaimed the devil take all women and tailors and leaped into the
river which instantly closed over his head

i was so petrified at his rashness that i forgot my own and stood
staring on the water as it came rushing in agitated ripples to the
shore lost in such confusion and horror that for a space of a minute
or more i neither moved hand nor foot the water which previous to
the plunge had been as smooth as a mirror was fast regaining its
tranquillity when on a sudden a great bubbling began to appear a few
yards below the rock and i saw the top of a man's head come to the
surface and immediately after sink again

at that sight my presence of mind was restored and being much
concerned that a young fellow as he appeared to be should perish so
miserably i rushed into the river and being a good diver had but
little trouble to fish him up and drag him to the shore but i pulled
him out a moment too late he was as dead as a herring or appeared to
be for his countenance was distorted and blue as an in digo-bag and
his mouth full of foam a circumstance which i regretted the more as i
no sooner looked him in the face than i recognised the features of my
friend if i may so call him mr i dulmer dawkins

as i was dragging the body to the shore a carriage came rattling along
the road which is there so near to the river that those who were in
it could easily perceive the act in which i was engaged and they
stopped it to give me assistance it was at that very moment that i
discovered who it was i was carrying and i was so much surprised at
the discovery that i cried out in a loud voice i d dawkins by the
lord

there was immediately a great screaming in the carriage and out
rushed my aristocratical neighbour mr periwinkle smith with two
young ladies one of whom was his daughter and such an uproar and
lamentation as they made about me were perhaps never before made by so
small a number of genteel people on any occasion i was particularly
affected by the expressions of the fair miss smith who seemed overcome
by grief and as i did not doubt she had an affection for the young
fellow i wondered what folly could have driven him into this act of
suicide

but my wonder was not very long-lived the cries of the two ladies had
reached the inn and drawn every soul therein to the scene of disaster
they came running towards us and i saw that my wife was among them

i could maintain my equanimity no longer in the bitterness of my heart
i muttered almost aloud and as sincerely as i ever muttered any thing
in my life i would i were this addle-pate dawkins were it only to be
lying as much like a drowned rat as he

i had not well grumbled the last word before a sudden fire flashed
before my eyes a loud noise like the roar of falling water passed
through my head and i lost all sensation and consciousness

containing much that will be interesting to young gentlemen in debt
and to fathers of families who desire to have their children rise in
society




chapter i

the inconveniences of being drowned the first chapter of the history
of i d dawkins esq


when i recovered my wits i thought i had got into the place which is
never mentioned among polite people except at church i perceived a
horrible smell of gin whiskey hartshorn tobacco-smoke and spirits
of firstrate camphire as if these made up the constituents of the
atmosphere of darkness and i saw though very obscurely for the light
was dim and there seemed to be films over my eyes a number of figures
that moved to and fro uttering discordant noises one of them it
seems and i took it for granted he was the chief devil stood by me
pressing my ribs with a fist that felt marvellously heavy while with
the other he maintained a grasp upon my nose to which ever and anon he
gave a considerable tweak while another little less dreadful stood
at his side armed with some singular weapon shaped much like a common
fire-bellows the nozle of which he held at but a little distance from
my own there were four others of them each of whom had me by a leg or
arm pulling and slapping with much zeal and as i supposed preparing
me for a gridiron while divers others flitted about as i mentioned
before talking with voices that appeared to me louder than thunder

such were the observations which i made vaguely and confusedly for
there was a great stupor over most of my senses and which led me
to suspect i was in the place of torment in which suspicion i was
confirmed by a thousand pangs i felt all over my body so strange
racking and horrible that unless one were to have the toothache
gout earache gravel rheumatism headache a stumped toe and locked
jaw all together it would be impossible to form any just conception of
the nature and variety of my torments i had i verily believed the
paddle-wheel of a steamboat in my head which was revolving full thirty
times a minute with a hideous crashing and clamour and churning
my brains to atoms and by the same rule i conceived there was an
iron-foundry in my lungs and heart every cell and cavity of which was
full of hot castings

but it would require a greater space than the subject is worthy of to
describe the agonies i endured in those moments of torture and they
were perhaps the more poignant since i could neither move a muscle
nor vent my distresses in a single cry which i was the more inclined
to do from conceiving myself in the kingdom of darkness

when i opened my eyes i heard him who had me by the nose yell out
something to the others upon which there was a great stir and outcry
among them and i distinctly heard one say after a great oath we'll
do well enough without a doctor

what said i to myself have they doctors here too do they follow
their patients

but continued the same voice we'll never finish the job till we
roll him over a barrel he'll never show game till the water's out of
him

these words it may be supposed were sufficient to give my mind the
right cue and relieve me of all apprehensions in relation to death
and condemnation on the contrary they confirmed me the more strongly
in my conceit how there should be water in me i knew not but my idea
was the inhuman imps wished to roll it out of me only to make me burn
the better fortunately for me another voice made answer and opposed
the atrocious proposal

no rolling on barrels it said nor hanging up by the
heels hanging up by the heels thought i it is against the rules
of the humane society and here they are

the humane society thought i is there a humane society among the
devils

the rule is the second voice went on as soon as the body shows
signs of life snaps its eyes and breathes to pour a little brandy
and water down

brandy and water said the first voice evidently in a passion and
i wonder if that a'n't against the rules of the temperance society
better give the man so much burning brimstone

the temperance society thought i i might have brought myself to
believe they had a temperance society as well as a humane one in
the lower regions had it not been for the violent ardour of him who
pronounced its name i knew by his rage and fury he could belong to
no temperance society but in the united states of america and the
inference was therefore plain that instead of being in the other
world i was in the united states of america myself

but before i could infer myself into this happy belief i was confused
by a hot argument that grew up between the advocates of the two
societies who waxed quarrelsome until there was a sudden cry the
doctor has come which pacified them in a moment and satisfied me i
was neither dead nor buried

the doctor stalked up to me i thought i knew his features and voice
but my sight and hearing were still confused i have no doubt he
treated me secundum artem but in about five minutes i was as dead as
ever




chapter ii


a conversation betwixt the author and his bosom friend john tickle
esq


however it was not my fate to die in good earnest by-and-by i opened
my eyes feeling in very passable health though somewhat weak and
dejected

the devils or my late attendants whoever they were had all vanished
and with them noise darkness and the various ill odours that had
afflicted my nostrils i was lying in a very good bed and chamber with
curtained windows the curtains being closed to keep out the sunshine
that was playing on them and at my side there sat in an arm-chair a
young gentleman of a buckish appearance sound asleep the creaking
of the bed as i rose on my elbow roused him he started rubbed his
eyes and looking me in the face burst into a hearty laugh

bravo he cried i told old boneset so i could watch as comfortably
as ever a child's nurse of messina i thought i should have the child
wake me with crying i vow to gad i've been snoozing all night and so
you've opened your peepers like an honest man at last dawky pray
what the devil made you drown yourself

and here the young gentleman seizing me by the hand fell a laughing
again and that with more zest than before

sah said i looking at him with both surprise and confusion for
though his voice and face seemed familiar to me i could not for the
life of me say who he was sa ah really i ah  and here i stopped
for first i knew not what to say and secondly my bewildered looks
set him into such a roar of merriment that there was no saying a word
to him

come you dog said he with a grin here and a roar there don't be
comical just after coming out of the grave a man just fished out of a
river and rescued from death after a hard fight between the doctor and
the devil should be serious and ecclesiastical solemn of visage and
sanctified of conversation no joking you dog but get up absalomize
and talk no joking i say no joking with jack tickle

as he spoke he seized me by the shoulder and dragged me half out of
bed

ged and demmee said i remember my foot for my toe catching in
the bed-cord i suddenly recollected the gouty member

i will said he with another roar for the lord knows tis the
best part of you spoil dawky's foot and ruin him with women and
shoe-makers for ever the one ceases to adore and the other trusts no
longer

but i mean the gout said i

the fiddlestick and fiddle said he whoever heard of a poor dandy
living on tick having the gout up dawky my dog and tell me what
set you to drowning if twas about betty small twas a small matter
what drown for being jilted if twas about the tailor's bill twas
still more ridiculous i say dawky my fellow what made you drown
yourself

drown myself said i but i said it with a stare the odd behaviour
and expressions of the young gentleman who called himself jack tickle
a name that i never remembered to have heard before in my life
although his countenance was certainly highly familiar and certain
queer associations his appearance gave birth to the singularity of
my feelings and more than all the appearance of my foot and leg
the former of which instead of being tumid and red with gout was
white and of elegant shape while the latter which but the day before
had a calf to compare with any old quaker's in arch-street was now
as lank as a sword-blade i say these circumstances had the effect
to increase my confusion to that degree that i felt like one who is
asleep and knows it provided one ever did or can feel so

in the midst of all i suddenly cast my eyes upon a goodly large
looking-glass that hung against the wall and saw my reflection
therein it was the image of mr i dulmer dawkins his exact
representation perfect in beard and visage save that the former was
in great disorder and the latter somewhat white and equally perfect
in figure as far as i could compare a man in buff and linen to one in
the full panoply of the tailor

my ged said i i am transformed again

and with that i made a hop up to the glass to look at myself closer
there was no mistaking the matter even if the looking-glass had i
looked at my legs and i gave a tweak at my mustaches my shoulders
were elegantly narrow and my foot as sound as a savage's i jumped up
cut a pigeon-wing and then descending attempted a ballet-dancer's
pirouette after which i looked again into the glass i was a young man
of twenty-five and the most elegant fellow i ever laid eyes on

i ran to jack and hugged him round the neck crying lard jack you
rogue i'm the most comical creature that ever lived

ay said he smothering with laughter and my embraces together but
what made you drown yourself

i recollected all about it and suddenly felt astonished i remembered
how i had jumped into the water and how i had fished myself out as
dead as a poker that is how mr higginson had fished me or rather
how i had fished mr dawkins i remembered how i john hazlewood
higginson had wished to be mr i dulmer dawkins and now i was mr i
dulmer dawkins himself and nobody but he i sat down on the bedside
marvelling how such a thing could be and the wonder of it was indeed
amazing that my spirit should creep into a man's body though strange
enough was not so prodigiously surprising but that my spirit and
body together for i did not know it had been otherwise disposed of
especially so corpulent a one as john h higginson's should get into
one that was truly marvellous

but my study was brought to an end by tickle suddenly exclaiming with
a voice of concern curse him gad poor fellow i believe he has
washed his wits out he has gone mad

no more than you have said i shaking him by the hand but you must
allow it is a most extraordinary affair

pon honour yes said he laughing as hard as ever but what made
you throw yourself into the river

why said i in a hurry to save dawkins

to save dawkins said he looking at me as one would look at a
shoemaker who brings a pair of shoes home the day he has promised them

that is said i to save higginson

to save higginson he cried with such a roar of laughter as made
my teeth rattle why there were twenty people saw higginson drag you
out i say dawky no lillibullering what did you jump into the river
for

i jumped said i quite in a quandary after my hat

at this answer my friend jack tickle threw himself upon the bed where
he rolled over and over until his coat was covered with down and
feathers which cooled his transports a little

i see said he i see it was the last of the family for hatters
tick was exhausted right dawky in such straits of credit i think i
should have jumped after mine who would not fight roast or drown
for his hat when it was the last decent one he ever expected to
have on his head i am glad this was the cause it makes me think
better of you i thought like the rest it was on account of your
disappointment from the adorable betty 

the devil take betty said i but without well knowing why

he has cried jack uproariously at least a poor devil has
she has thrown away her seventy thousand upon a fellow no more to be
compared with you than a tame goose with a wild one and instead of
spending it like a man the rascal will buy stocks and save it i
say dawky you must have been surprised at her conduct as we all
were really we thought you had her and there was no one more
certain than the fair miss smith

the devil take the fair miss smith said i

he will said tickle shaking his head and laughing or if he
don't i don't know who will for it is a clear matter dad's done up
entirely and they say the sheriff is already making an inventory of
his chattels a great pity dawky for if she had but money miss
smith would be certainly an angel incarnate a nymph a houri the
finest woman in town i say dawky i think she almost had you




chapter iii


in which sheppard lee is prepared for the brilliant destiny that awaits
him


there were many things in the conversation of my friend tickle which i
did not exactly comprehend though i had a vague confused appreciation
of all and afterward understood him well enough the fact is i was
in the same difficulty which had beset me when scarce warm in the body
of mr higginson that is a confusion of characters propensities
and associations only that the last were imperfect as if my memory
had suddenly given way and besides the difficulty was in both cases
increased by the feeling of amazement with which for several hours
when properly conscious of it i pondered over the marvel of my
transformation how such a thing could happen or had happened i knew
no more than the man in the moon it was a new thing in the history of
man and there was nothing in philosophy at least such philosophy as
i had at that time to explain it i had certainly done nothing on my
part in either case to effect a change save merely wishing it and
it seemed to me that i possessed a power never before known to a human
being of transferring my spirit from body to body whenever i willed
at least under certain circumstances but on this subject i will have
more to say hereafter

happen how and by what means it might it was certain a transfer had
taken place and that i was no longer the poor miserable john h
higginson with the gout and a scolding wife the conception and full
consciousness of which were so rapturous that i suddenly bounded on
my feet and danced about like a madman now running to the glass to
admire my youthful and elegant appearance and now flinging my arms
round the neck of my friend and hugging him twenty times over

the conversation that passed between us was exceedingly joyous and
varied though as i said before i had but an imperfect understanding
of many things tickle said for which reason i will record no more of
his expressions lest they should confuse the reader's mind as they
did mine some things however i gathered from him in relation to my
catastrophe and resuscitation which are proper to be told

it seems that when i that is john h higginson wished i were or
might be the defunct dulmer dawkins i fell down under a sudden
stroke of apoplexy which was supposed to be caused by my exertions
to rescue the unfortunate beau and indeed i saw in the first
newspaper i looked into upon getting to philadelphia afterward a
long account of my demise with a highly eulogistic and affecting
account of my heroism in sacrificing my life for another's for as
the paragraph stated i was of a full and plethoric habit strongly
inclined to apoplexy of which i was aware myself as well as of the
danger of over exertion and therefore my act was the more truly
heroic the paper was of a highly democratic character and the notice
was closed by a ferocious warning to the young bug of aristocracy
meaning the elegant and fashionable i dulmer dawkins to remember
when wasting his trivial existence in that heartless society whose
pleasures were obtained at the expense of their worthier though poorer
fellow-creatures that the preservation of it had cost the nation one
of its most excellent citizens and the world a virtuous man and pure
patriot by which i understood that john h higginson was of the
democratic party although that was a circumstance of which the gout
and my wife had kept me ignorant as long as i lived in his body

as for me that is i d dawkins being lugged into the tavern along
with my late tenement the body of john h higginson i was fallen
foul of by all hands and what with tweaking my nose beating my arms
scorching my legs with hot bricks flaying me with salt whiskey
spirits and such things and filling my lungs with dust and ashes
from an old fire-bellows i was brought to life again greatly to
the triumph of my tormentors before the appearance of a physician
who however subsequently assured me they had revived me with such
effect as to give him double trouble to keep me in the land of the
living afterward for it seems after being more dead than alive all
that night i had remained in a kind of stupor all the following day
from which i awoke on the second morning well enough as the doctor
prognosticated i would be but only after i had remained more than
thirty-six hours in a state of insensibility

as for my body that is higginson's it had the honour after being
cogitated over by the coroner of riding home in my splendid barouche
with the thousand-dollar hourses but whether my wife went with it or
not i never cared to inquire it was enough she was gone and oh
rapture of raptures gone for ever

my friend tickle illuminated me as to other matters especially in
relation to the fair miss smith with whom it seems and i recollected
all about it when he had set my new associations properly to work i
had been quite particular until he himself discovered the insolvency
of her father's estate when and this i began to recollect in the same
manner i instantly turned my attentions upon another the fair miss
small who jilted me these things i say i soon began to recall to
mind as well as many other incidents in the past life of i dulmer
dawkins and indeed in the course of a few days i was as much at
home in his body and among his affairs as he had ever been himself
but of this anon i learned that mr periwinkle smith after seeing
me lodged in the tavern had driven off to town to engage medical
assistance and this he did so effectually that i had no less than
seven doctors at one time to send me their bills which was a very
foolish thing of them

of these things i say i discoursed with my friend jack tickle
whose conversation together with the happy consciousness i had of my
transformation infused inexpressible vivacity into my spirits i was
marvellously pleased at the idea of being a fine young fellow with the
freedom of chip-chop society and i was impatient to return to the city
to enjoy my happiness

bravo said jack we'll walk in together but do you know dawky he
went on nodding and winking that this is a cursed no-credit place
and that the man below betrayed a certain vulgar anxiety about scot and
lot and the extra expenses you had put him to what do you say about
paying

really said i clapping my hands into my pockets i have forgotten
my pocketbook

to be sure you have said tickle laughing but why need you tell me
so i am no shop-keeper

i mean said i in alarm demmee that i have lost it and with that
hundred-dollar bill my brother tim 

your brother tim said tickle who's he

i was struck all aback i remembered that i was i d dawkins

tickle perceived my confusion and enjoyed it attributing it to
another cause

right said he grinning with delight but don't make any pretence
with me i didn't expect you to have any money and the lord be
thanked i have i'll square your account my dear fellow and help you
to a pigeon besides

with these words and many others not needful to be mentioned he
led the way down stairs where he became astonishingly grave and
dignified a peculiarity i found myself falling into slapped his ratan
against his legs called for his friend dawkins's bill and paid
it that is i suppose he did for i stalked out upon the porch as if
i considered such vulgar matters beneath my notice

here being soon joined by tickle and the day proving uncommonly fine
we set out on foot towards the city and i was conducted by my friend
to the door of my own lodgings




chapter iv


in which sheppard lee has an interview with a lady who tells him a
secret


in and mount said tickle i see jem puddle in the street yonder
and i have an idea i can borrow fifty dollars of him i will drop round
on you by-and-by

so saying tickle started off and left me at the door of my lodgings
i had a sort of confused recollection of the place though i had never
seen it before in my life the dingy bricks and weather-stained
marble the rickety old iron railing on the steps and the ugly
worn-out brass plate with the j sniggles engraved thereon rose on
my memory like old acquaintances who had grown out of it the house
might have been a fashionable one in its day nay for the matter of
that it was not so humble in appearance but that a gentleman might
have lived in it if too poor to inhabit a better and though out of
the world being in a street called eighth it was within hail of
chestnut nevertheless it was but a poor place compared with my late
dwelling my house in chestnut the recollection of which together
with the reflection that i entered this only as a lodger somewhat
abated the transport of my joy ah thought i what a pity in giving
up john h higginson's gout and wife i had also to give up his house
and money but the recollection of the two first-named possessions was
fresh upon me and i ceased to murmur

i ascended the steps and rang the bell somewhat faintly i must
acknowledge for though i had my friend tickle's assurance and a
confused consciousness of my own that i was at the right place there
was a certain strangeness in it naturally arising from my situation
that made me hesitate the door however opened and the reception
that followed convinced me i was not intruding where i was not known

the door was opened by a bouncing irish wench of some twenty-five
years or thereabouts with hair as yellow as a broom-whisk and
shoulders twice as broad as my own besides which she was not
handsome she had staring gray eyes brick-coloured cheeks a nose that
looked up at her forehead and a mouth not so ugly as spacious

i was about to pass by this fair apparition with no further notice than
a nod which i made somewhat instinctively but i was not fated to get
off so easily no sooner did she lay eyes upon me than she set up a
squeak oh hubbuboo and is it you misther dawkins dear and
threw her great beef-steak arms round my neck

an embrace from a creature of her attractions i could have easily
dispensed with yet i might have been affected by her joy at seeing
me return alive from the bottom of the river it was so truly natural
and exuberant had she not been in a great hurry to qualify it oh
murder dear she cried and i'm glad for they said bad luck
till'em the vagabones you was drownded dear and was after chating
me out iv my money for the washin and mindin

the washing and mending thought i do i patronise such a tasty body
as this and do i owe her money

but while i muttered thus within the girl giving me another hug that
i thought would have made my shoulders change place with one another
roared out in continuation 

och throth but the man must drown dape that chates nora magee of her
own musha hinny darlint jist pit yer finger into yer pocket and pull
me out the tin dollars and seventy cents that you owe me

certainly nora said i and succuba let me go but ged now nora
i cried for well i knew my pockets were as empty as the promises i
intended to make her and i was driven by a sort of instinct upon the
proper course for pacifying the harpy a course i suppose that
i that is my prototype the true dawkins had often practised
before i say nora don't talk of dollars and cents for i intend to
pay you in eagles and half-eagles some of these days when my uncle
comes and besides nora you jade you i intend to give you a buss
into the bargain as ged i believe i will now

and with that i returned the compliment she had paid me took the great
creature by the neck and yea faith and i presume i should have done
the same thing with my tailor if he could have been managed the same
way absolutely kissed her

och blessings on yer pritty face said she looking pleased and
disappointed together but wiping her mouth as if to prepare for a
second salute and that's the way you bamboozles me wid your uncles
and your thricks upon a poor cratur's modesty but oh misther
dawkins dear ye'r lookin sick and pokey and so i'll not be after
throubling you and i hopes your uncle will be soon in phillydelphy
for there's our ould sniggles the hungry ould nagur that i should be
saying so of the master o the house that gives me a dollar a week
and a new bonnet at christmas he's been rampin and roarin and
swearin like a turk my heavy hathred on him he'll be havin you up
before the constables and squires for the dirty rint-money the ould
divil that you owe him

the rent-money thought i and i began to have a sort of feeling
about me i do not know what but it was not agreeable i clapped my
hand into my pocket there was a pocketbook there but i had examined
it before and there was nothing in it my mind began to misgive me a
little it was apparent the worthy i d dawkins had not yielded me his
body without leaving me some of his debts to pay and as to what means
of discharging them he might have bequeathed i was yet in the dark

i ascended to my rooms of which i discovered i had a brace but i was
in some dudgeon to find them in the third story very odd said i to
myself that i should be a fashionable man and a dandy and live in a
third story my instincts had gone nigh as i climbed the stairs to
carry me into a chamber on the first floor but arrah now hinny
said nora you'd be after forgetting you agreed to give up the best
chambers till yer uncle comes to town bad luck to him for keeping me
so long out iv my tin dollars

this uncle of mine thought i will settle all pothers but who he
was or what sort of claim i had upon him i knew no more than the man
in the moon my associations acted but slowly and imperfectly and when
i strove to look back upon the past history of my new body i felt
like a man who has clapped upon his nose his grandmother's spectacles
through which he can behold objects indeed but all so confused
distorted and mystified that they serve only to bewilder his vision
thus i beheld when i made the effort a jumble of events and persons
crowded together on my memory but without being able to seize upon any
one and examine it to my satisfaction i had an uncle it seemed but i
could not recall any thing like a recollection of having ever seen him
but time thought i will set these things right




chapter v


an inventory of a young gentleman's effects with some account of mr
sniggles his landlord


my chambers were but meanly furnished and this but it needs not i
should acquaint the reader with the divers proofs that rose every
moment to convince me mr i d dawkins though a dandy was not a rich
one before i had rummaged an hour among his chattels i discovered
enough to set me into a cold shiver and almost make me repent having
taken possession of his body i found lying upon his table no less
than thirty-seven folded papers the tribute doubtless of the two days
of his absence of which eight were either billetsdoux or mere cards
of invitation to ladies parties and twenty-nine were letters from
tailors shoemakers c all of them requesting payment of money owed
and most of them as ferocious in spirit as they were original in style
and grammar in an old trunk which i ransacked as well as every chest
of drawers and closet in the rooms the keys were ready at hand in my
pocket i discovered a bushel or two of bills i suppose there may
have been a thousand of them for they were of all dates not one of
which had a receipt to it

but to make amends for this evil i found mr i d dawkins's wardrobe
in pretty good condition except in the article of shirts of which i
discovered but six and those none of the best however there were
three dozen good dickeys and a great abundance of loose collars
and wristbands with which i perceived i might do without shirts
altogether

but what gave me most pleasure and indeed quite consoled me under the
feelings of disappointment and doubt that had begun to rise was a
marvellous great quantity of love-letters locks of hair finger-rings
odd gloves c that i found scattered about each as was apparent
the tribute or spoil of some admiring fair aha said i i am a
devil of a fellow among the girls who can resist me the idea of
being a favourite among the women and the prospect i had of shooting
conquests among them right and left were infinitely agreeable ged
and demmee said i i will look about me now and fix for life i will
pick out the finest creature i can find who has a fortune and marry
her and then i say demm all tailors and other people i will marry a
wife eged

it was doubly remarkable i should make such a resolution having had
but lately such a lesson of the joys of matrimony but i found myself
fast growing another man i still retained a lively recollection of
mrs higginson but fancy pictured an angel in the anticipated mrs
dawkins dim visions which seemed to be made up as much of crude
recollections as of half-formed anticipations dim visions of lovely
eyes and noses floated over my brain i sank into a soft elysium-like
revery when i suddenly heard a voice somewhat tremulous and feeble
but rude as the screech of a strawberry-woman in spring saying

sir i say sir mr dawkins i shall trouble you i say for the
amount of that ere small account

the accents were more horrible to my soul than the grating of a
dentist's file upon the tenderest of grinders i looked up from my
feet which i had been admiring and beheld a visage somewhat iracund
and savage but so vulgar and plebeian in all its lineaments that my
fear was changed into contempt

and i say sare whoever you ah said i looking the fellow to the
soul what do you want he-ah who ah you

at these questions the man looked petrified he opened his mouth till
i thought his under jaw would drop off and stared at me in dumb
amazement i had some hopes he was about to fall down in a fit i am
not naturally of a bloodthirsty turn but i knew he was a dun and such
persons one always wishes the devil would snatch up but he recovered
his tongue and to do him justice i must confess he used it with a
spirit i did not look for in such a mean shrivelled-up body as he had

don't go for to insult me said the goth gritting his teeth and
spluttering his words through them as through a watering-pot i'll let
you know who i am i'll have my money or i'll have the worth on it out
on you for i won't be cheated no more for nothing and as for what i'm
doing here i'll let you know as how i'm master in my own house and
as mrs sniggles says 

sniggles said i recollecting that the rascal was my landlord and
creditor i started up and seizing the enraged little man by the hand
i begged his pardon

really my dear soul said i i was in a brown study and i didn't
know you pray how d'ye do how is mrs sniggles you must know i have
hardly yet got over my unfortunate fall into the water really sah i
was almost drowned and i had the misfortune to lose my pocketbook

none on your gammon on me said mr sniggles looking as intrepid as
ever for i don't believe none on it and i don't believe you're no
gentleman neither or you wouldn't keep me out of my money you see
mr dawkins do you see you've had my rooms five months and i ha'n't
seen the colour on your money over once it's all promise and no pay
and so as i was saying i won't be diddled no longer or i'll see the
end of it for as mrs sniggles says we can't afford to be diddled
for nothing

come sniggles said i don't be in a passion i'll pay you what's
the amount

seventeen weeks on the second story seven dollars a week monstrous
cheap at that considerin there's breakfast in one hundred and
nineteen dollars and taking off the ten dollars you paid me as per
account one hundred and nine dollars four weeks on the third story
at five dollars and a half and good rooms too twenty-two dollars
and adding the ten dollars i paid the shoe-maker and the five dollars
sixty cents i loaned you to pay the fine at the mayor's office for
smashing the lamp makes jest a hundred and forty-one dollars sixty
cents no halves nor quarters precise and the sooner you shows me the
money the better

a confounded long bill that sniggles said i but i don't dispute
it and the moment my uncle comes to town 

the mean avaricious fellow had begun to look happy as he conned over
the hateful particulars of his account which he held in his hand but
no sooner had the words my uncle left my lips than he began to jump
up and down pulling his hair gritting his teeth and shaking his
fists like a mad-man and to my astonishment the contemptible fellow
waxed profane and actually cursed me and my uncle too his oaths
as may be supposed only made him appear more low-lived and vulgar
than before for cursing and swearing are the hardest things to do
genteelly that i know there are but few persons in the world who
can produce an oath with any thing like elegance it is the truest
criterion of gentility and in consequence i would recommend no person
to attempt one who is not confident of his high breeding

my landlord mr sniggles fell to cursing and swearing and insulted
me very grossly first by affecting to believe that no such person
as my uncle existed secondly by threatening to turn me out of his
house and thirdly by assuring me he would have his account in an
attorney's hands before i was an hour older it was in vain i exhorted
him to moderate his passion and strove to wheedle him into a better
humour i had forgotten or rather i did not yet know the true secret
of his character which was cowardice by addressing my arguments to
which i might have readily brought him to reason but in truth i was
frightened myself how i was to pay a bill of a hundred and forty-one
dollars sixty cents was a thing only to be guessed at and the prospect
of taking up my lodgings in the debtors apartments up arch-street was
as vinegar and wormwood to my imagination

the more i strove to sooth the wrath of mr sniggles the more
ferocious he became until at last he did nothing but dance round and
round me like a little dog barking at a big one that is tied to a
post crying out all the time frantic with despair and fury pay me
what you owe me pay this here bill here pay me my money or i'll have
you in jail with other expressions equally foolish and insulting




chapter vi


sheppard lee hears news of his uncle and mr sniggles is brought to
his senses


in the midst of my troubles up comes my friend tickle and pops into
the room he gave a stare at sniggles and next a grin and then just
as i was looking to be laughed at he made a spring and caught me round
the neck crying with uncommon exultation and eagerness 

i congratulate you dawkins you dog and mind you must lend me five
hundred dollars tomorrow

before i could answer a word to this surprising address he turned upon
sniggles and looking black as a thunder-cloud cried 

hah sniggles what is the fellow doing here dunning you for his
money the scoundrel hah what

i thought he would have kicked the poor man out of the room and so
thought sniggles also for though he exclaimed touch me if you dare
he ran to the door where he looked vastly alarmed and was able to
muster only a single expression of resolution i asks my money said
he and dang me but i'll have it for as mrs sniggles says i'll not
be diddled for nothing

pay the rascal his dirty money and then be done with him leave his
house and patronise him no more said jack then turning to me he
made three skips into the air clapped his hands and running up to me
and giving me a second embrace cried 

angels horses and women hug me kiss me and lend me that five
hundred dollars your uncle has arrived

uncle what uncle said i

why your uncle wiggins your rich old uncle your dad of an
uncle your bank and banker your but i say dawky you'll lend
me that five hundred won't you saw him at the hotel just
arrived asked anxiously for his nephew dawkins bad look about the
eyes will die in a month and then then my fellow fourteen
thousand a year if it's fourteen hundred

fourteen thousand a year echoed i the words were also muttered over
by sniggles i caught the fellow's eye he looked confounded and uneasy

if that's so said he then i hope mr dawkins will pay me my money
and not take no offence for none wasn't intended

pay you your money said jack tickle stepping up to him in a rage
no you rapacious dun he sha'n't pay you a cent you shall sue him
and get judgment and wait six months for your money

no you rascallion said i i won't take that revenge of such a low
fellow i'll pay you your money and be done with you but jack i
say demmee let's be off let's run down to my uncle wiggins

wiggins said my landlord why you always said his name was
wilkins

and so it is said tickle wiggins p wilkins the rich and
well-known wiggins p wilkins but what do you want here have you had
your answer what do you mean by intruding here you'll get your money
and so if you please do mr dawkins and me the favour to walk down
stairs or 

well said my amiable creditor whose fury was quite overcome by
tickle's violence and his report of my uncle's arrival i always
said mr dawkins was a gentleman and would pay me one day or another
and one day's just as good as another and so i hopes he'll take no
offence but as for you and the likes of you mr tickle said the
little man endeavouring to assume courage i don't like to be abused
in my own house but howsomever as you're mr dawkins's friend i'll
say no more about it

and with that my gentleman walked down stairs

let us go said i let us run let us fly

where said tickle

why to my uncle where is he

where cried tickle bursting into a roar of laughter are you as
big a fool as sniggles you didn't believe me ah lud is there nobody
witty but myself

and my uncle a'n't come then said i what made you say so

to rid you of a dun my fellow said jack i saw the rascal had
worked himself into a phrensy and that you were at your wit's end
i had pity on your distresses and so ran in with a huge lie as
irresistible as a broadsword to the rescue victory and jo pæan i
have routed the enemy and you are no longer in fear keep up the fire
and you are easy for a week

but my uncle really intends to leave me that fourteen thousand a
year said i

has he got it said jack giving me a comical stare

jack said i after pausing a little i want to ask you a favour

have but twenty-five in the world said tickle pulling out his
pocketbook but you shall have ten

it isn't that said i i want you to tell me my history

your history said tickle staring at me in surprise




chapter vii


in which sheppard lee is told his history


an idea had suddenly seized me and i must say that up to this time
it was the most brilliant one that ever entered my mind my ignorance
of mr i d dawkins's affairs was still highly inconvenient and
oppressive and i was determined with my friend's assistance to
remove it

tickle said i i really believe the doctor has only half
resuscitated me my body is pretty well but my mind is only so-so
would you believe it my memory is quite gone

as to your debts certainly said jack so is mine

ged said i tis gone altogether really it seems to me as if i
had only begun existence this morning my recollection of all events
and even persons known anterior to my sop in the river is so
imperfect you can't conceive would you believe it i really didn't
know that rogue sniggles and had to ask him his name the ladies
too jack miss smith miss small and the rest that you were talking
about who the deuse are they i have heard much talk of my uncle too
have i an uncle and if so who and what is he for i swear pon
honour jack i know no more than the man in the moon in a word jack
demmee i am in my second childhood and you must help me out of it
give me therefore my history my whole history and tell me all about
me for may i be dunned to death if i rightly know who i am

you don't said jack well that's funny but i have heard of such
things before is a dip in cold water then so hard on the memory
i say dawky my fellow couldn't we contrive some way to dip our
creditors but eged now dawky you a'n't serious

i am said i and i beg you'll give me an idea who i am and all
other things appertaining

oh said tickle who seemed vastly diverted by my embarrassment
that is soon done you are a dandy of pure blood and poor as a church
mouse but not yet out of favour your father who was a dandy before
you and in prime esteem having bought his way into notice with two or
three cargoes of indigo and young hyson for he was an india merchant
properly laid out in elegant entertainments gave up trade to live a
gentleman and died one leaving you an elegant fellow and ignoramus
as a gentleman's son should be to spend his leavings this you have
done dawky and most gloriously for five years none of us the sons
of nabobocracy could compare with you in dash flash and splash but
even phaeton fell horses galloped away buggies and curricles rolled
into the gutter and tailors looked alarmed stocks flew out at the
window bricks and mortar took to themselves wings and your stockings
began to want darning then said dawkins i will marry a wife and
he looked loving at periwinkle's fair daughter and periwinkle's fair
daughter looked loving at dawkins and dawkins calling counsel of his
friend john tickle of ticklesbury manor beheld and lo periwinkle's
fair daughter's father's fine estate was fenced round with rows
of mortgages as thick and thorny as prickly-pears whereupon the
inconstant swain forgetting his vows ran to the elegant miss small
who smiled on him and married another and the loss of this adorable
fair fortune and all together with an uncommon fit of dunning
so affected my friend's spirits that he threw himself into the
schuylkill whence he was fished by a fellow called what-d-ye-call-it
a brewer

well said i but do you mean to say i have squandered all my
property

every sous said my friend it is just six weeks since you spent the
last dollar of the last term of your annuity

what annuity said i

why the five years annuity you bought of old goldfist is it
possible you don't recollect him don't you remember the row of
negro-houses you owned down in southwark

i don't said i

a piece of arrant cheating sheer swindling said tickle but
when did old skinner ever make an honest bargain the houses and
lot of ground worth two thousand as they stood but title good and
indefeisible and capable of being made worth twenty thousand i
remember you offered em to old goldfist for seven what said the old
hunks give me immediate possession and thereupon you shall have a
bonus of a thousand on the nail together with the same sum yearly
for five years provided you live so long if not then as long as
you live snapped like a gudgeon and was bit and on the fifth
year beginning of august last had the last integer of payment with
comfort of seeing a property you had sold for six thousand yielding
its possessor just that much a year

the geds said i has old goldfist six thousand a year

say sixty replied jack

tickle said i the old curmudgeon has a daughter i'll marry her

no you won't said my friend shaking his head mournfully old
goldfist is too well acquainted with your affairs and unless you have
his consent what will you get by her

tickle said i i must marry somebody or be ruined but stay
there's my uncle now my dear fellow who is he

faith said tickle i don't know always supposed he belonged to the
apocrypha and was used to argue duns into good manners nobody sues
a young fellow that has good expectations from a rich uncle but now
i think of it i believe you did once tell me you had an uncle some
vagabond trading fellow or other in the west but i never heard you
say you expected any thing of him i thought you called him wiggins
but sniggles says wilkins all's one however for i remember you said
he had brats of his own

i began to feel uncomfortable and upon questioning my friend further
i discovered that my situation was far from being agreeable i had a
horrible quantity of debts on my shoulders and no fund to discharge
them and what was worse i found that my means of subsistence were
not only precarious but i had good reason to fear they were any
thing but reputable my dear friend john tickle though a gentleman
and dandy it was plain was a personage who lived by his wits and
i began to see that mr i d dawkins was another from tickle's
expressions i perceived that our chief dependance lay in the noble
trade of pigeon-hunting as this is a word some of my readers may be
too unsophisticated to understand i will explain it and in very few
words as there are in the world young fellows of plebeian origin
but full pockets who are ambitious to figure in elegant society so
there are also in elegant society sundry youths of better fame than
fortune who are willing to patronise them provided any thing can
be made by their condescension in which case the happy phaeton is
taught to spend his money in ways most advantageous to his patrons
though by no means to his own profit such a young gentleman is then
called a pigeon and is allowed to flutter in the sunbeams while his
eagle-clawed friends are helping themselves to his feathers the last
of which being abstracted he is commonly called a fine fellow and
kicked out of their company i cannot pretend to say what degree of
relish my prototype the true i d dawkins may have had for such
a mode of existence but i must aver in my own defence that i had
throughout the whole adventure while in his body so much of sheppard
lee's original sense of honour and honesty hanging about me that i was
more than once shocked at the meanness and depravity of such a course
of life and when i first understood the thing from tickle i was so
ashamed of myself that had i lighted upon the body of any decent man
at the moment i do verily believe i should have done my best to get
into it and so put an end to mr i d dawkins altogether but men's
bodies are not like the dry-goods dealers boxes in market-street to
be stumbled into at any moment

it was some comfort to me to find that our practice in this particular
was so little known that both tickle and myself but myself more
especially were considered in the main very excellent exemplary
young men as far as dandies could be and were still allowed to mingle
in elegant society

as for tickle indeed i soon discovered he was in but doubtful odour
with the ladies at least with their mammas for he had been for
some years living on his wits but i on the contrary being pretty
universally regarded as the heir-expectant of a rich uncle and being
besides a prettier fellow was received with general favour and
approbation

having obtained from tickle as much of my or mr i d dawkins's
history as was necessary i gave my worthy friend to understand i
should need his advice and assistance in returning into society for
said i and very truly too i really sha'n't know anybody and shall
feel very awkward here i added are two invitations for this very
evening one from mrs pickup and the other from the misses oldstyle
now who is mrs pickup and who are the oldstyles and where the
mischief do they live

it is very odd you should forget so much said tickle and then
proceeded to give me the information i wanted promising also to go
with me to both places himself and prompt me through all difficulties




chapter viii


a conversation with a tailor sheppard lee finds himself in a situation
truly appalling


having thus got upon the subject of the ladies we that is tickle
and myself fell into a highly agreeable conversation in the course
of which i lost sight of all my fears and anxieties until they were
suddenly recalled by the entrance and a very unceremonious one it
was of a tall fellow with hinge knees and crow-bar elbows fashionably
dressed but whom there was no mistaking for aught but a vulgarian i
knew his errand before he spoke and so did tickle who instantly cried
out

snip the tailor eged and another paroxysm of dunning

servant mr dawkins servant mr tickle said the gentleman
giving each of us a scrape hope no intrusion and no offence wouldn't
go to controvert gentlemen on no account but talking of accounts mr
dawkins hope you'll excuse me wouldn't dun a gentleman for the world
but have a cussed note in bank for cloth and must make up the sum by
to-morrow and so if it's convenient mr dawkins shall be obliged
for the amount of bill

my uncle said i 

can't go that no more said the tailor can't go that no more
begging pardon bill outstanding nineteen months and over wouldn't
mind letting it run the year out but for the cussed pressure on the
money-market no money to be had nowhere

right said jack and what makes you suppose you will get it here
now snip my dear fellow make yourself short tis not convenient
just now for my friend dawkins to pay you

must take up that note said mr snip can't think of waiting no
longer

the rascal spoke resolutely though more cowardly-looking than
sniggles but who could withstand the rage and indignation of my friend
tickle

away you ungrateful loon said he is that the way you serve the
man that made you who would have employed you you botch if dawkins
had not taken you up and made you fashionable

ay demmee snip said i taking my cue from tickle i say wasn't i
the making of you and do you come dunning me didn't i recommend you
into notice and business didn't i send my friends to you

can't deny said the tailor won't controvert but must say can't
always get my money of mr dawkins's friends but don't mean no
offence wouldn't think of pressing mr dawkins always said he was my
friend wouldn't mind holding back if mr dawkins would send me good
pay-customers

well said i thinking the man was modest in his desires i will
you shall have three johnny raws before the week is out and you may
charge them double

very much obliged and won't controvert said mr snip humbly but
can't take no more promises

and you really insist upon having your money said tickle

ay said i re-echoing his indignation and putting on a dignity
that even awed myself you are determined to have your money and to
lose your business tickle hand me back that five hundred i lent you
or enough of it to pay the rascallion shall have it again as soon as
i can run down and see my uncle wilkins i say tickle hand me the
money and let me pay the ungrateful rascal off

if i do said jack demmee encourage dunning never

he shall have his money said i here you snip you man you have
broken your own neck come back here to-morrow at half past twelve
with a receipt in full take your money and never look to make a
gentleman's coat again come tickle it is time i was with my uncle
you shall go along and dine with him a fine old cock i assure you

i surveyed the tailor my dignity and the sound of my uncle's name
had subdued him he slipped his bill into his pocket and looked
penitent

won't controvert a gentleman on no occasion he said always said
mr dawkins was my friend and as for mr dawkins's uncle 

yes said jack yes you said you did not believe in any such person
did not believe there was such a person

can't controvert no gentleman said the tailor looking as if he had
been rubbed down with his own goose but never said no such thing
mr tickle always believed in mr dawkins's uncle but only thought
perhaps he wouldn't pay that is wasn't certain and didn't mean no
offence and so if mr dawkins will say a word for me now and then to
gentlemen that wants coats i'll leave it to his convenience hoping
he will excuse my coming up stairs without asking not having found no
servant and not supposing he would take no offence and 

and so the rascallion was going on heaping apology on apology and
about to depart in contrition for his offence when as my evil genius
would have it in popped mr sniggles foaming with wrath and looking
daggers and conflagration

trouble you for the amount of that ere small account said the
fellow don't believe in no more uncles won't be diddled no longer
for nothing all diddle about uncle just as mrs sniggles says no
more uncle than she has

what do you mean said jack tickle but his indignation no longer
daunted the dun who cried out with uncommon emphasis and effect 

had my doubts about the matter and told mrs sniggles said i mr
dawkins's uncle has come says mrs sniggles run down to the tavern
and see for no sitch thing a'n't certain till we knows it and so i
runs down to the mansion house and mr wilkins wasn't there and then
i runs to the united states hoping it was a mistake and mr wilkins
wasn't there and then i runs to this place and that place and mr
wilkins wasn't there and as mrs sniggles said mr wilkins wasn't
nowhere but twas all diddle and throwing dust in my eyes and so as
for this here account one hundred and forty-one dollars sixty 

don't controvert no one said mr snip who had listened all agape to
the outpourings of the other and now turned his battery upon me again
but can't think of keeping the account open no longer don't want to
be hard upon any gentleman but must have my money

one hundred and forty-one dollars sixty cents said sniggles

two hundred and thirty-seven said snip

but why should i detail the particulars of that eventful hour even
tickle's courage sank before the fire of the enraged assailants and
as for mine had it been fortified by a heart of steel and ribs of
brass it must have yielded to the horrors that followed duns follow
the same laws as flies and carrion-crows no sooner does one swoop at a
victim than down drop a thousand others to share the feast scarce had
my landlord and the tailor begun the assault when there sneaked into
the room a consumptive-looking fellow smelling strongly of leather and
rosin who displayed a greasy scrap of paper and added his pipe to the
others then came another with inky hands a black spot on his nose
and a new hat under his arm then another and another and another
until i believe there were fourteen different souls in the room or
rather bodies for i don't think they had one soul among them all
of them armed with long bills all clamorous for their money and all
each being encouraged by the example of the others as noisy mad and
ferocious as any mob of free and independent republicans i ever laid
eyes on such a siege of dunning was perhaps never endured except by
a poor dandy they dunned and they dinned they poked out their ugly
bills and they gave loose to their inhuman tongues in a word they
conducted in such a manner that i was more than once inclined to jump
out the window being driven to complete desperation

in the midst of all and when i saw no escape whatever from my
persecutions they were brought to a close by a most unexpected
incident the door flew open and in rushed not a fifteenth tormentor
as i expected but an angel of light in the person of nora magee who
screamed out at the top of her voice 

och hinny darlint your uncle misther wiggins has come and in a
beautiful carriage and he looks as if he could pay your ditts twice
over sure now and ye'll ax him for my tin dollars




chapter ix


the author receives a visit from his uncle samuel wilkins esq and
is relieved from his tormentors


let the reader judge of the effect of such an announcement upon my
tormentors and myself i had an uncle then and he had arrived nay
he had paid me a visit and was in the house i could hear him
stumping up the stairs my debtors were struck dumb and so was i
and at that moment of confusion he stepped into the room i looked at
the gentleman and upon my soul i was somewhat disappointed his
appearance was scarce genteel enough for my uncle he looked like
a country squire of low degree who might pass for a man of quality
better in an unsophisticated village of the backwoods than anywhere
else and he had an atrocious white fur hat with a big brim all
puckered and twisted like the outer casing of a cabbage there was a
vulgar vivacity and good-nature about his visage an air of presumption
and familiarity in his motions and his nose turned up on the whole
i did not like his appearance and my first impulse was to give him a
look of contempt but i recollected he was my uncle and had come in a
carriage and seeing him stand staring about in great astonishment as
not knowing what to make of such a rout of ragamuffins as i had about
me nor how to distinguish his nephew among them i stepped up to him
and taking him by the hand said 

my dear saw ah looking for me what my uncle wiggins

wiggins said he ods bobs don't you know the name of your own
uncle wilkins

wiggins said i ged twas a mere slip of the tongue

ods bobs said he and is this you ikey my boy the very picture
of your aunt poor mrs wilkins but ods bless her she's dead ha'n't
seen you since you was a baby do declare you're as big as sammy
come to live in your town ikey my dear tired of living among the
clodhoppers have plenty of money and mean to be a gentleman now glad
to see you ikey but i say ikey who is all these here people always
heard you was a great gentleman but don't much like your acquaintance
ikey

this was pronounced in an under voice much to my satisfaction for
the liberty the old gentleman took with my name was not grateful to my
feelings ikey indeed none but a vulgarian would have made so free
with me

but he was my uncle he said he was rich and i perceived he might be
made serviceable

i shook him by the hand a dozen times over swore i was so glad to see
him he could not conceive assured him in his ear the fellows he saw
were ambitious cobblers and stitchers who had come to beg my favour
and recommendation to the fashionable circles for my countenance was
a fortune and the rascals would persecute me declared my friend
tickle who stood enjoying the scene from a corner was a young blood
and intimate who had just lent me a thousand dollars to pay a poor
fellow who was in distress and concluded by assuring him that as i
did not like being obliged to a man not a near kinsman i would hand
the sum back again and borrow it of him if he had brought so much to
town with him

the warm welcome with which i began my speech greatly delighted my
uncle's heart as i saw my apology for the appearance of the duns
it was evident caused him to look upon me as a young fellow of great
importance and distinction the reference to the young blood who had
just lent me a thousand dollars confirmed his opinion of my lofty
stand among the rich and fashionable and to all these members of
my discourse he hearkened with respect and satisfaction but when i
arrived at my climax and professed a readiness to borrow that sum of
himself i thought his eyes would drop out of his head they stared out
so far in a word i perceived that let him be as rich as he might
he was not the man to lend me money for which reason i despised the
relationship more than ever and resolved to disown it as soon as my
convenience would permit but it was proper to make it useful at the
present moment

i turned round upon my duns who were yet in confusion gentlemen
said i giving them a bow of dismission i will remember your claims
you may depend upon me but at present as you see i must attend to
those of my excellent uncle you understand me ehem

ehem said they all and i thought they would have all turned
somersets so profound were their congees as one by one they sneaked
out of the room the only ones who hesitated were my landlord nora
magee and snip the tailor the first was probably overcome by a sense
of having dunned me too hard and despair of forgiveness on which
supposition i gave him a frown and waved my hand and he retired as
for nora she perhaps loitered to feast her eyes with the spectacle
of the rich man from whose pockets were to be drawn her ten dollars
but i gave her a wink a very vulgar way of conveying a hint i
confess but one can't be genteel with one's creditors and she rolled
smiling away what kept the tailor i could not say till having given
him divers significant looks and gestures he began to drawl out can't
controvert no gentleman but  when i stepped up to him took him by
the arm and led him from the apartment

what you dog said i in a familiar affectionate sort of way as
soon as i had him out of my uncle's hearing do you want to raise a
hubbub and put the old fellow in a passion come you rogue your
fortune's made seven grown sons seven broadcloth suits a year
extravagant dogs they shall have them all you shall upon my
honour can twist the young apes round my finger and you shall
have'em seven times seven is forty-nine seven fifties is three
thousand and odd ged and demmee you'll make a fortune out of them

with that i pushed the giggling cormorant down stairs and ran back to
my uncle




chapter x


some account of sheppard lee's country kinsmen


adieu said tickle giving me a nod as much as to say make the
most of the old gentleman he then imitated the duns and left me a
circumstance for which i was not sorry for i was somewhat ashamed of
my uncle

fine-looking young fellow that said mr wilkins must be a rich dog
to lend you a thousand dollars but i say ikey 

uncle wiggins that is wilkins said i i beg you won't call me by
any such vulgar nickname as ikey i can't abide nicknames they are
horrid plebeian

ods bobs said my uncle i call my son sammy sammy and sam too 

what said i have you a son

ods bobs said he why didn't you know i say nevvy your dad
and me was never good friends proud as a turkey-cock thought me a
democrat and no great shakes but i snapped up his sister though and
so there was never no love lost between us never knew much about one
another especially him but i say nevvy ods bobs don't be a fool
and despise like your dad could buy him six times over if he was
alive and don't suppose you're much richer and don't value you a new
pin don't pretend you didn't know i had a son might as well say you
didn't know i had a daughter

the old gentleman looked somewhat incensed i hastened to pacify him
by assuring him i had had a violent fit of sickness and lost my memory
i then drew from him without difficulty as much of his history and
affairs as i cared to know

although of a vulgar stock his face had somehow or other captivated
the fancy of my father's sister who very ungenteelly ran off with
him and accompanied him to some interior village of the state where
the happy swain sold tapes and sugar that being his profession
here although discountenanced and despised by his wife's family he
gradually amassed wealth and in course of time mightily increased it
by laying his hands on those four great staples of the susquehanna
iron lumber coal and whiskey in fine having scraped together
enough for his purpose he yielded to a design which his wife had first
put into his plebeian head and which his children as they grew up
took care to stimulate into action this was to exchange his village
for the metropolis his musty warehouses for elegant saloons and live
during the remainder of his life a nabob and gentleman and in this
design as i discovered he expected to derive no little aid from my
humble self who being as he said a gentleman cut and dried and
knowing to all such matters could give him a hint or two about high
life and help his children the hopeful sammy and the interesting
pattie for such were their horrid names into good society the first
step of his design he had already taken having wound up his business
and got him to philadelphia with his brats both of whom were now
safely lodged in a hotel burning to make the acquaintance of their
fashionable cousin my distinguished self and to these worthy kinsfolk
he proposed to carry me forthwith

i debated the matter in my mind should i acknowledge the claims of a
brace of rustics with two such names sammy wilkins pattie wilkins
i felt that an old coat or a patched shoe could not more endanger my
reputation than two cousins named sammy and pattie but the old man
was rich and some good might arise from my condescension i agreed to
go with him and asked him at what hotel he had put up

oh said he at a mighty fine place the what-d-ye-call-it in
market-street

in market-street said i and i thought his nose looked more
democratic than ever horrible vulgar beyond expression how came you
to stop in such a low place can't expect any decent man to go nigh
you must carry you to head's without a moment's delay or you'll be
ruined for ever

ods bobs said my uncle it's a very good tavern with eating
and drinking for a king but if it's not fashionable sha'n't stay
there no longer shall go with us nevvy and show us the way to
what-d-ye-call-it's the hack will just hold four

i go to a tavern in market-street the idea was offensive and ride
thither and afterward my three country kinsfolk with me to head's
in a hackney-coach the market-street tavern and the hackney-coach
finished my uncle wilkins i suddenly recollected a highly important
engagement which would deprive me of the pleasure of going round with
my excellent uncle that moment to make the acquaintance of my worthy
cousins nay i feared it would occupy me all that evening being an
engagement of a very peculiar nature i would see them the next day
when they were safely lodged at head's whither i recommended mr
wilkins to proceed bag and baggage instanter my uncle accepted my
excuses and agreed to follow my advice with a ready docility that
might have pleased me seeing that it showed the respect in which he
held me but i perceived in it nothing more than a willingness to be
put into leading-strings arising from his consciousness of inferiority

i got rid of him and resolved i would consider the pros and cons
before compromising my reputation by any public acknowledgment of
relationship

then being vastly tired by the varied business of the day i threw
myself on my bed where i slept during the remainder of the day very
soundly and agreeably




chapter xi


containing a morsel of metaphysics with a short account of the
author's experience in good society


i was roused about nine o'clock in the evening by tickle who came
according to promise to squire me to mrs pickup's and the misses
oldstyle's and dressing myself in mr dawkin's best i accompanied him
forthwith to the mansion of the former

it was yet summer and the season of gayety was therefore afar off all
genteel people were or were supposed to be out of town according to
the rule which at this season drives the gentry of london to their
country-seats the few of philadelphia who could imitate the lords and
ladies in this particular were now catching agues on the schuylkill
while the mass consisting of those whose revenues did not allow
any rustication on their own lands were killing sand-flies on the
seashore or gnawing tough beef and grumbling over bad butter at some
fashionable watering-place in the interior there were some however
as there always are who considered themselves genteel and who stayed
at home either because they were tired of agues sand-flies tough
beef and bad butter as they freely professed because they really
believed they were better off at home or because they were like
me and my friend tickle not rich enough to squander their money on
vanities and so stayed at home from necessity

of such persons one can always even in summer-time assemble enough to
make a party of some kind or other where the contented guests can be
uncommonly sociable eat ices and pity their friends who may be at
the moment roasting in a ball-room at saratoga

it was undoubtedly a great misfortune that i should make my first
introduction to good society at a time when it was to be seen only
in its minimum of splendour whereby i lost the opportunity of being
dazzled to the same degree in which i found myself capable of dazzling
others nevertheless i was vastly captivated by what i saw and
for the few brief weeks that my destiny permitted me to live among
the refined and exclusive i considered myself an uncommonly happy
individual

the reception i met at mrs pickup's convinced me that in entering
mr dawkins's body i had done the wisest thing in the world for
however much it endangered me with the tailors it proved the best
recommendation to the ladies i found myself ushered into a suite of
apartments magnificently furnished and lighted and not so over crowded
for the season was taken into consideration but that the moschetoes
had room to exercise their talents i thought i should be devoured by
mrs pickup she was so amazingly glad to see me but i perceived
by a sort of instinct i had acquired along with dawkins's body that
there was something plebeian about her although a very fine woman as
far as appearances went and indeed tickle assured me she was a mere
parvenue or upstart whom everybody despised and whom no one would
come nigh were it not for her wealth and the resolution she avowed to
give six different balls of the most splendid character in the course
of the season she had a daughter who was very handsome and a decided
speculation but i did not think much of her especially as i found she
was already engaged to be married

i found here that i knew everybody or what was the same thing that
everybody knew me and with tickle's help i soon found myself as
much at home with mr i d dawkins's fair acquaintances as if i had
known them all my life it was still as it had been before a virtue
and peculiarity of my recollections that they were always roused by
a few words of conversation with any one known to my prototype from
which i infer that the associations of the mind as well as many of
its other qualities are more dependant upon causes in the body than
metaphysicians are disposed to allow

this dependance it has been my fate to know and feel more extensively
perhaps than any other man that ever lived the spirit of sheppard lee
was widely different from those of john h higginson and i d dawkins
as i think the reader must have already seen and yet no sooner had
it entered the bodies of these two individuals than the distinction
was almost altogether lost certain it is that in stepping into each
i found myself invested with new feelings passions and propensities 
as it were with a new mind and retaining so little of my original
character that i was perhaps only a little better able to judge and
reason on the actions performed in my new body without being able to
avoid them even when sensible of their absurdity

i do verily believe that much of the evil and good of man's nature
arises from causes and influences purely physical that valour and
ambition are as often caused by a bad stomach as ill-humour by bad
teeth that socrates in bonaparte's body could scarce have been
socrates although the combination might have produced a timoleon or
washington and finally that those sages who labour to improve the
moral nature of their species will effect their purpose only when they
have physically improved the stock strong minds may be indeed operated
upon without regard to bodily bias and rendered independent of it but
ordinary spirits lie in their bodies like water in sponges diffused
through every part affected by the part's affections changed with its
changes and so intimately united with the fleshly matrix that the
mere cutting off of a leg as i believe will in some cases leave the
spirit limping for life

but as i said before i am not writing a dissertation on metaphysics
nor on morals either and as my adventures will suggest such
reflections to all who care to indulge them i will omit them for the
present and hasten on with my story

and here the reader may expect of me a description of those scenes and
persons in fashionable life to which and whom i was now introduced
and if i valued the reader's approbation at a higher price than my own
conscience and reputation i should undoubtedly gratify him by putting
my imagination in requisition and painting at once some dozen or two
of such fanciful pictures as are found in novels of fashionable life
though never i opine in fashionable life itself in such i should
have occasion to represent gentlemen more elegant and witty and ladies
more charming and ethereal than are to be found in any of the ordinary
circles of society but as i am writing truth and not fiction and
represent things as i found not as i imagined them i declare that
the ladies and gentlemen of the exclusive circles to which i was
admitted were very much like the ladies and gentlemen of other circles
 that is as elegant and witty as they could be and as charming and
celestial as it pleased heaven and that after due exercise of
judgment and memory i cannot in the adventures of three whole weeks
in such society remember a single person or thing worth describing
for which reason i will pass on to more important matters




chapter xii


sheppard lee makes the acquaintance of his cousin miss pattie wilkins


although i now look upon those three weeks of my life as three weeks of
existence out of which i cheated myself i was nevertheless so greatly
delighted at first by the way in which i spent them that i had almost
forgotten my uncle wilkins and when i did think of him it was only
with renewed contempt and indifference finding however that the old
fellow had called upon me three or four times during my absence from
my lodgings on as many different days and remembering what he had
said of his riches it occurred to me that i might as well pay him a
visit were it only to satisfy mr sniggles and nora magee both of
whom manifested great uneasiness at my undutiful conduct it occurred
to me moreover that although my uncle wilkins was not a lending man
my cousin sammy might be and as i had now existed four different
days without a single sixpence in my pocket and began to be heartily
ashamed of such a state of things i thought it would be as well to pay
the rustics a visit and putting on a new coat which snip had just sent
me to seal our reconciliation and secure my seven extravagant cousins
i started off forthwith

as my evil luck would have it i found the old gentleman on the point
of setting out to pay me a fifth visit and i had the satisfaction
just as i placed my foot on the porch of the hotel in full view of
some half a dozen respectable-looking people who were congregated
there to receive an embrace from mr samuel wilkins with the old
white fur hat accompanied by a vocal salutation of oho ikey my
boy and so you have come have you ods bobs but i began to think
you was ashamed of your relations

not i said i i am never ashamed of my relations and i looked
around me with dignity so that all present might perceive i was
condescending i supposed i should find some of the spectators
giggling but was agreeably surprised when i beheld among them nothing
but grave looks of respect indeed two or three old gentlemen that
i knew by sight and who were what you call stanch citizens that
is rich old fellows not very genteel but highly respected made me
low bows and i heard one of them as i passed with my uncle into the
hotel whisper to another it is the rich old rascal's nephew quite a
promising young man

i began to feel a greater esteem for my uncle for i saw that others
respected him everybody seemed to know him and make way for him
seeing which i grew more condescending than ever and instantly began
to apologize for my seeming neglect by pleading that i had been
engaged night and day in preparing the way for the admission of him and
my cousins sammy and pattie into good society

you want a house in a fashionable quarter said i 

ods bobs said he yes and i've been looking all over town from
the glass-works down to the navy-yard and seen a power of them

i flatter myself i can suit you said i and better than you can
yourself besides said i i have been looking for carriages and
horses

why said my uncle it's expensive keeping horses in a city and i
was against it but there's pattie says we can't do without em

exactly so said i you must live like a gentleman or there's no
getting or keeping in society and besides i have been stirring up
the beaux and belles to come and see my cousin the fair i say uncle
eged has she no other name than pattie

yes said my uncle wilkins there's abby that's abigail martha
abigail wilkins called her after her grandmother and aunt and hoped
aunt abby would leave her something but she didn't

martha abigail wilkins worse and worse i despaired of doing any
thing if i even wished it for a creature with such a name

but what i had done that is what i said i had done for i had done
nothing had produced a great effect on my uncle and put him into
such a good-humour with me that he seized me by the hand swore i
was the right sort of a dog after all and reaching the door of his
private parlour where the fair martha abigail was sitting he kicked
it open crying aloud

here pattie you puss here's your cousin ikey the dandy as fine a
whole-hog fellow as ever you saw ods bobs give m a buss

i looked upon the unsophisticated rustic who was called upon to
manifest her breeding in such an agricultural style and upon my soul
i was quite surprised to find in her the aforesaid pattie abigail
one of the nicest little creatures i had ever laid eyes on of a most
genteel figure tolerably well dressed considering she had been
brought up in the country and with a sweet prudish face that was
quite agreeable to look on

she smiled and she blushed then laughed and blushed again but
without waiting to be bidden a second time tripped up to me gave me
both her hands and saying cousin ikey how do you do with a voice
that was charming in every word save one the infernal ikey she very
innocently turned her cheek up to be saluted

i felt myself called upon to give her a lesson in politeness and
therefore put my lips to her hand saying cousin p p pattie ehem
the girls will all call her petty-patty petty-patty wilkins i beg
your pardon but it is quite ungenteel and vulgar to kiss a lady that
is to say in common cases but as i spoke i admired her beauty the
more and began to think the etiquette in such cases was absurd but
as we are cousins i think that alters the case entirely

and with that i paid my respects to her cheek and upon my soul was
rather gratified than otherwise nay and upon an instinct which i know
not whether i owed to my soul or body i made an offer to repeat the
ceremony that i might be as condescending as possible when the little
minx to my surprise and indignation lifted up one of the hands i had
dropped and absolutely boxed me on the ear starting away at the same
time and saying with a most mischievous look of retaliation

i reckon i know manners as well as anybody

ged and upon my soul said i and marched up to the glass to restore
my left whisker to its beauty for she had knocked it out of its
equilibrium while my uncle wilkins fell foul of her and scolded her
roundly for her bad behaviour

it don't signify pa said the amiable pattie bursting into tears
i served cousin ikey no worse than cousin ikey served me for when
i wanted him to kiss me he wouldn't and if he had boxed my ear it
wouldn't have been half so bad for it was very rude of him not to kiss
me and say it was vulgar and he can't deny it

i have mentioned before i think the surprising facility women seem to
have of turning the tables upon a man in any contest that may happen
between the sexes for let a man be never so much in the right my
head for it the woman will soon prove him to be in the wrong

i found the truth of the maxim on the present occasion for there was
the pretty pattie who had just shocked my sensibilities wounded my
self-love violated my dignity and disordered my whisker by a buffet
on the cheek extremely well laid on considering the youth and sex
of the bestower now weeping and bewailing the injury i had done her
in moralizing over a kiss before taking it it occurred to me she was
an uncommon goose but she looked so wonderfully handsome pouting
her lips with such a beautiful pettishness that i was convinced i
had treated her very badly for which reason i stepped up to her and
begged her pardon so penitently that she relented and forgave me and
we were soon in a good-humour with one another

she seemed to me to be an odd creature disposed to be whimsical and
funny and i rather feared she was at bottom witty i say i feared
she was witty and lest the reader should draw wrong inferences from
the expression i think it right to inform him that while recording
my adventures in the body of mr i d dawkins i feel my old dawkins
habits revived so strongly in my feelings that i cannot avoid giving
some of the colouring of his character to the history of his body i do
not presume to say what women should be or what they should not in
confessing a fear that my cousin pattie was witty i only record the
horror with which i while a dandy in common with all others of the
class regarded any of the sex who were smarter or more sensible than
myself

my cousin pattie was then odd whimsical and i feared witty but
that remained to be proved she certainly acted in a manner highly
unsophisticated which arose from her youth for my uncle told me
she was not yet eighteen and her country breeding she had divers
rusticities of speech and a frankness of spirit that would at any
moment burst out in weeping and wailing or a fit of romping all which
was horridly ungenteel and a great objection to genteel people taking
notice of her

but on the other hand she was a positive beauty and although she
slouched about sometimes when forgetful her movements were commonly
graceful and lady-like

my judgment was therefore favourable beauty grace good clothes
and a grammatical way of speaking were as far as i knew the only
requisites for a fine woman and i thought it was possible to make her
one the two first requisites she already possessed good clothes were
to be had of a good milliner and as for her conversation i flattered
myself i could in a few lessons teach her to subdue all redundances
for in that particular she wanted nothing but pruning




chapter xiii


a further account of miss pattie wilkins


having made these observations in the course of a ten minutes
conversation i perceived i had no longer any reason to be ashamed of
her but on the contrary to congratulate myself on the relationship
then permitting myself to be affectionate and frank as a near kinsman
should i gave her freely to understand that with a little advice
and training which i would undertake to give her in a few lessons
she would be fit to shine in the very best society an admission that
set my uncle into an ecstasy of delight and triumph while it somewhat
discomposed the fair pattie she gave me a hearty stare a thing i was
glad to see for it looked lady-like then coloured a circumstance
i did not approve so much since blushing is girlish and ungenteel
and then burst out a laughing and concluded by seizing upon my hand
giving it a yeomanly shake and saying

very well cousin ikey you shall be my schoolmaster and teach me
all you know and as you say i think you can teach me in a very few
lessons

and here she looked as meek and quiet and almost as sanctimonious as
any saint i ever saw of a sunday

very good said i and the first lesson i will give you is never to
call me ikey again for that's vulgar but always mr dawkins or
just plain cousin or as we are so nearly related why i don't care
if you call me by my middle name dulmer

wouldn't dully be better said she as sweetly as could be it's
more affectionate and cousins ought to be affectionate

that's very true said i and upon my soul i thought her mouth was
the handsomest i had ever seen it is very true but it don't do to
be too familiar and besides dully don't sound a whit better than
pattie i wish to ged you had a better name than that and yet it
is the best of them all for martha is kitchen-like and abigail
wash-womanly 

and pat said my cousin 

pat said i struck with horror 

yes pat said she looking as if she would cry again it is the
most odious of nicknames and there's my brother sam who calls me
so all day long and there's pa who is not much better but i say
cousin i hope you'll take them to schooling too i won't say any
thing about pa but i reckon there's none of us will be the worse for a
little rubbing up

don't say reckon said i nor sam neither ged you have horrid
names among you but we'll do the best we can pattie miss pattie
wilkins well the name is not so very bad as for your brother you
must always call him brother occasionally you may say wilkins and
it will sound aristocratic as being a family name but i say uncle
we can't do any thing till we have you in your own house and if you
mean to pass for a man of quality it must be a grand one that is as
grand as can be had without building i say uncle if you please what
do you hold yourself worth

ods bobs said my uncle bristling up what's that any man's
business never blab a man's capital for 

oh said pattie pa's always thinking about trade and shop-keeping
but i'll tell you for i know all about it for he told me six months
ago and i know he's worth two  and here the little beauty looked
as if she designed to make me her confidant at once and swell my very
soul with the greatness of her revealment he's worth two hundred and
ninety thousand dollars and when he dies he is to leave me half a'n't
it grand

to leave you half one hundred and forty-five thousand dollars
said i so confounded by a sudden idea that entered my mind that i
could not even conceal it hang it if that's the case but i shall
certainly marry you and snap up that hundred and forty-five myself

would you said the imp looking so lovely and innocent and
willing that i positively threw my arms around her neck as if the
matter were already settled

ods bobs said my uncle none of your jokes here nevvy

as for pattie she jumped out of my arms though apparently more
pleased with the rudeness than with my former want of enthusiasm and
ran laughing to a chair

none of your jokes here nevvy i say cried mr wilkins and don't
talk to pattie about marrying for she has had enough of that already

i ha'n't pa said the daughter beginning to cry again you're
always twitting me with danny but i'm sure if you're willing i'd as
lief marry my cousin ikey that is cousin dulmer as anybody

who's danny said i

my uncle looked black but pattie answered boldly

why my sweetheart to be sure danny baker one of the truest
sweethearts you ever saw and oh so handsome but he was nothing but
one of pa's clerks and so we turned him off between us and because
i took his part and said it was no great harm in him to like me pa
is always twitting me about him and i can't abide it if i am to be
twitted about everybody that likes me i should like to know where will
be the end of it

i perceived that my little cousin had a good opinion of herself which
was proper enough but i reprobated the good-will she extended to her
admirer telling her that all clodhoppers were to be despised and
that she must now think of being liked by none but fine gentlemen my
counsel as i discovered afterward was peculiarly acceptable to my
uncle and greatly increased his respect for me and as for pattie she
dried her eyes and said she had as much spirit as anybody but danny
baker was no fool for all we might say of him

in short the interview was much more satisfactory than i had dared
to anticipate and finding my uncle and cousin were eager to have my
instructions and assistance so as to begin the world as soon and with
as much eclat as possible i summoned my wisdom and laid down the law
to them forthwith a house was to be immediately had and recollecting
the state of mr periwinkle smith's affairs i recommended that my
uncle should make proposals for his dwelling which was just the house
required and which i supposed mr smith or the sheriff for him would
soon bring to the hammer nay in the exuberance of my affection i
offered to begin the negotiation myself and visit mr periwinkle smith
that day whereby i might have an opportunity to return my thanks for
his friendly assistance at the schuylkill without exciting any false
hopes in the bosom of his daughter which i feared might be the result
if i went without an object

i then discoursed on the subject of carriages and horses furniture
tailors and mantuamakers and with such effect that i perceived
i should have the control of all my uncle's affairs directing his
expenses and making all his purchases which i saw would be highly
advantageous in reinstating my credit even if it led to no better
profit




chapter xiv


a short chapter containing an account of the author's cousin samuel
wilkins jr


having debated these matters to my satisfaction and theirs i was
about taking my leave when my cousin sammy unexpectedly entered the
apartment

his appearance struck me dumb and filled me with mingled terror and
despair what could i do with such a scarecrow his appearance was
death to my hopes of making the family fashionable he was a raw youth
of twenty or twenty-one but six feet high long-legged lantern-jawed
and round-shouldered he wore a white hat like his father but stuck
upon his head with a happy contempt of order and symmetry and his
coat hung down in a straight line from his shoulders as if cut to fit
the wall of a house he walked with a lazy grave swagger indicative
of vast serenity of mind and self-regard and until i cured him of
the habit with both hands in his pockets there was not an ounce of
brain in his whole head big as it was though from the gravity with
which he stared and whistled one in the face for staring and whistling
were two of his greatest characteristics it might have been supposed
otherwise i will not say the clown was ugly in visage or deformed in
person but he was a slouch from head to foot one could see at a look
that he considered himself a gentleman that he lived in the country
and that the highest exercise of his gentility had been to stalk about
from one mud-hole to another with his hands in his pockets

he did not seem at all daunted by my appearance but having surveyed
me with his great staring eyes he dragged one of his fists out of his
pocket and gave me a friendly grasp very much like the pinch of a
bear glad to see you hope you're well he said and said no more
but remained observing me with extreme gravity during the remainder of
the conference when i got up to depart he rose also and though i
could have well dispensed with such an escort attended me to the door
he uttered not a word until we came within view of the bar when the
great oaf opened his lips and said with an extremely knowing look i
say ikey my boy suppose we take a smaller

a smaller said i indignantly gentlemen in a city never drink
smallers

well then said the goose i don't care if we go the whole gill

come said i commiserating his ignorance you must never more talk
of such things none but vulgarians drink strong liquors slings
cocktails and even julaps are fit only for bullies gentlemen never
drink any thing but wine

wine's small stuff said my kinsman with great equanimity but i'm
for any thing that's genteel and dad says you're the boy for showing
us but od rabbit it it's a hard thing to play the gentleman in a
place where you a'n't up to it but i say now how do you think we'll
do me and pat

i could scarce avoid laughing in the booby's face he asked his
question with such simplicity and complacency i perceived that
notwithstanding his lazy serenity and stolid gravity he was as anxious
to be made genteel as either of the others and quite as ready to
submit to my guidance i told him i had no doubt he would do very well
when i had polished him a little which i would soon do and i resolved
to begin the task without delay i carried him to a private apartment
ordered a carriage and a bottle of chateau-margaux to amuse us while
it was getting ready and gave him to understand i would immediately
take him to a tailor's and this i did in a very short time to the
infinite delight of my friend snip whom i ordered to make three or
four different suits for him without troubling myself to ask his
opinion about either i then carried him in the same way to a hatter
shoemaker and man-milliner leaving the jeweller watchmaker and so
on for a future occasion

these important matters being accomplished greatly to my own
advantage for i took care to speak of my uncle wilkins in a way to
produce the strongest effect i ordered the coachman to drive up to mr
periwinkle smith's whither i thought i might as well proceed while
i had a coach to carry me i gave my gawky cousin to understand my
business was to buy the house for his father at which he expressed
much satisfaction for everybody in philadelphia knows the house is a
very fine one and a desire to help me examine it but telling him
there were many fine ladies there who must not see him till he was
properly dressed i charged him to wait for me in the coach until i
returned




chapter xv


in which sheppard lee visits mr periwinkle smith and his fair
daughter and is intrusted with a secret which both astonishes and
afflicts him


i pulled the bell with a most dignified jerk and asked for mr
smith but the servant who grinned with approbation as at an old
acquaintance and doubtless considered that he knew more about the
matter than myself as philadelphia servants usually do ushered me
into the presence of mr smith's fair daughter

ah said i to myself as i cast my eye around the apartment and saw
that her levee consisted of but a single beau a stranger whom i did
not know but who i learned afterward was a young millionaire from
boston the world begins to suspect the mortgages and friends are
falling away poor dear miss smith and i felt great compassion for
her

she seemed somewhat surprised at my appearance and i thought she
looked confused she was a marvellous fine creature and i was quite
sorry she was not rich

i saw she had a sneaking kindness for me yet but it was not right to
encourage her i hastened therefore to express my thanks for the
sympathy which i had been informed she had bestowed on me on the
memorable occasion of my dip in the schuylkill and regretted that the
indisposition consequent upon that disaster had prevented my calling
earlier i had not met the fair lady at mrs pickup's or the misses
oldstyle's or at the other two place where i had figured during the
last four evenings and although it was highly probable she knew my
indisposition had not prevented my going to these places yet my not
seeing her made the excuse perfectly genteel and fair yet she looked
at me intently i thought sadly and reproachfully for a moment and
then recovering herself expressed her pleasure to see me so well
restored and ended with great self-possession by presenting me to
her new admirer after this her manner was cooler and i thought her
pique rendered her a little neglectful it was certain she wished
me to observe that she had a high opinion of the new philander a
circumstance to which i was not so indifferent as i ought to have
been but in truth she was an elegant soul and the more i looked at
her the more i regretted she was not a fortune i felt myself growing
sentimental and to check the feeling i resolved to proceed to
business

i had no sooner asked after the old gentleman and expressed a desire
to see him than she gave me a look that bewildered me it expressed
surprise and inquiry mingled with what i should have fancied contempt
could i have believed anybody could entertain such a feeling for me
she rang the bell ordered my desire to be conveyed to her father and
in a few moments i was requested to walk up stairs to his study where
i found him in company with a gentleman of the law and a broker whose
face i knew and surrounded with papers

ah said i to myself things are now coming to a crisis he is
making an assignment

the gentleman of the law and the broker took their departure and mr
periwinkle smith gave me a hard look i began to suspect what he was
thinking of he was perhaps looking for me to make a declaration in
relation to his fair daughter

that he might not be troubled with such expectation long i instantly
opened my business and gave him to understand i came to make proposals
he opened his eyes and grinned for his house he looked astounded
which i had heard he was about to dispose of

indeed said he and then fell to musing a while pray mr dawkins
said he who sent you upon this wise errand

i did not like his tone but i answered i came on the part of my uncle
samuel wilkins of wilkinsbury hall for i thought it as well to make
my kinsman's name sound lordly

very good said he but what made you suppose i intended to sell my
property

i liked this question still less than the other and mumbled
out something about common report and the general talk of my
acquaintance

ah said he now i understand giving me a grin which i did not
let us be frank with one another there was something said about
mortgages was there not a heavy weight on my poor estate

thinking it was useless to mince the matter i acknowledged that such
was the report

and it is from the influence of that report i am to understand some
of the peculiarities of your that is to say it is to that i am to
attribute your present application really mr dawkins i am afraid i
can't oblige you my house i like very well and but i'll admit you
to a little secret and smiling with great suavity he laid his hand
on a pile of papers here said he are mortgages and other bonds
to the amount of some seventy thousand dollars they are my property
and not mortgages on my property the truth is and as you are an old
friend i don't scruple to tell you that having a little loose cash
which i did not know what to do with i took the advice of a friend
and invested it in the form in which you now see it and i believe it
is very safe the story of the mortgages was quite true only it was
told the wrong way

i was petrified and stood staring on the old gentleman with awe and
amazement

some people said he very good-naturedly might doubt the
propriety and even the honourableness of a private gentleman
investing money in this way but stocks are at a high premium and many
unsafe and money can't lie idle i hope you are satisfied i am quite
sorry i can't oblige your uncle my house as i said i like extremely
well and i have besides promised it as a wedding-present to my
daughter

oh ye gods of greece and rome a wedding-present to his daughter i
resolved to make her a proposal without delay and i thought i might as
well break matters to the old gentleman

your daughter said i your beloved and excellent daughter 

will doubtless always be happy to welcome her old friend and admirer
mr dawkins said he and i thought he looked beautiful though
i never thought so before he could not have spoken more plainly
i thought if he had said marry her at once i took my leave
intending to make love to her on the spot

i will have the pleasure to see you to the door said the old
gentleman and to the door he did see me i do not well know how it
happened but instead of entering the parlour again i found myself led
to the front door by the courteous mr smith and bowed handsomely out
to the great satisfaction of my cousin sammy who regarded proceedings
from the carriage window

good morning said mr periwinkle smith i can't sell my daughter's
house but i should be glad to have you for a neighbour and now i
recollect it there's higginson the brewer's house over the way there
advertised for sale and i am told it is very well finished

so am i said i to myself as the door closed on my face finished
unutterably it occurred to me i was turned out of the house and
the suspicion was soon very perfectly confirmed i called on the fair
miss smith the next day and though i saw her by accident through the
window i was met by the cursed fib not at home the same thing
was told me seven days in succession and on the eighth i saw to my
eternal wo and despair her marriage with my boston rival announced in
the papers he lives in philadelphia and can confirm my story but
this is anticipating my narrative

i say dawkins cried my cousin sammy i had cured him of the vulgar
ikey what does the old codger say

these words bawled by the rustic from the carriage window woke me
from a trance into which i had fallen the moment mr periwinkle smith
shut the door in my face

didn't he say there was a house over the way

i remembered the words my own house for sale i knew it well it
was just the thing wanted an elegant house provided genteel people
were in it i was on the point of running over and securing it when i
remembered mrs higginson a cold sweat bedewed my limbs no said i
i will go to tim doolittle i can face him

to make matters short for i have a long story to tell i drove up to
higginson's brewery it is now doolittle and snagg's or was when
i heard last of it saw my late brother-in-law whom i thought a
very plebeian body and made such progress with him that in three
days time for my margaret had gone to mourn in the country the
house changed owners and my uncle wilkins marched into it as master
followed by sammy and pattie




chapter xvi


containing much instructive matter in relation to good society whereby
the ambitious reader can determine what are his prospects of entering
it


three days after i had established my uncle in his new house the fair
miss smith was married

it was a great blow to me and i mused with melancholy on the
fickleness of the sex wondering what it was in woman's nature that
enabled her so easily to change from one love to another i considered
myself very badly used and the more i thought of the wedding-present
and the seventy thousand dollars in bonds and mortgages the more
deeply did i feel my loss i read the announcement of her marriage in
the newspaper cursed her inconstancy and hard-heartedness and gave
myself up to grief the whole morning she had certainly used me ill
but by dinner-time i remembered i had served her pretty much in the
same way

besides my cousin pattie i always dined with my uncle wilkins
of course and intended soon to live with him altogether looked
uncommonly handsome and who knows said i to myself whether she
won't have more than miss smith after all in addition to this
great consolation i had another in a few days and the two together
quite comforted me for the loss of periwinkle's daughter but of this
in its place

in three days time as i have mentioned i had my uncle wilkins in his
new house and was busy polishing the family but the task was harder
than i supposed the rusticities of my uncle were inveterate and as
for sammy the only change i could effect in him was such as the tailor
effected for me i found him a clown and a clown i left him i should
have given him up after the first day had it not been that his father
kept him pretty well supplied with pocket-money which was an advantage
to me for i never could borrow any thing of my uncle i therefore
treated him civilly and carried him about to divers places taking
good care however that he should not fall into the hands of my friend
tickle or any other poor dandy

my cousin pattie was more docile and i perceived that as soon as i
should cure her of a mischievous habit she had of playing tricks upon
everybody in the house and myself too upon occasions she would be
fit for any society

as soon as my uncle had procured a carriage and i took care it should
be a good one i made an effort to buy my fine old thousand-dollar
bays but mr doolittle would not part with them i took her out
airing and shopping to teach her how to behave in public and i
contracted with mrs pickup who lived close by and who it was
supposed on account of her six balls would make a favourable
sensation to chaperon her for the season i took care to bestow her
patronage among the aunts and sisters of my tradespeople in such a way
as to advance my own credit and thinking it would be to my advantage
to have such a friend near her i recommended nora magee to her for a
maid although nora was not quite so genteel as i should have wished

in short i did every thing that was proper to prepare her way for
the approaching season and as soon as i thought her fit to receive
company went round among all the leading fashionables and requested
them to visit her

it was here that the invaluable nature of my services on behalf of my
country kinsfolk was shown as i took care to make them understand for
without me to help them or some other equally genteel person my uncle
and cousins might as well have tried to get into congress as into good
society my request was not granted until i had answered ten thousand
different questions and removed as many scruples on the part of the
monarchs of the mode there were a thousand reasons why my uncle's
family should be denied admission into that elegant society they were
so ambitious to enter and nothing but the force of my recommendations
ensured them success

my labours on this occasion made me familiar with the principles
upon which republican aristocratic society is founded and as these
principles are not universally understood even in america i think
i can do nothing better than explain them for the benefit of all my
young and aspiring readers

the pretensions of any individual to enter the best society of the
republic depend upon his respectability and the measure of this is
determined by the character of his profession if he have one if
not by that of his father i never knew even the most exclusive
and fastidious of examiners to carry his scrutiny so far back as a
grandfather for indeed all our grandfathers in america were pretty
much alike and the sooner we forget them the better

the first profession in point of dignity is that of a gentleman who
has nothing to do but to spend his revenue if he has one there are
some gentlemen well received in good society who live upon their wits
but they are born in it poor gentlemen not already in society had
better not try to get into it for rich men who have romantic daughters
are afraid of them a gentleman then always stands a fair chance of
being admitted and if his father was of a respectable profession
he is received with open arms the preference accorded to this class
is just since founded upon nature all occupations are more or less
disgraceful a strong proof of which is found in the fact that all
primitive nations such as the hottentots and north american indians
look upon them with contempt considering idleness and war as the only
business for gentlemen providence indeed ordained that men should
live by the sweat of their brows but it is horrid ungenteel to do so

the next profession in point of dignity is law and lawyers as i may
say form the true effective nobility of america for though the mere
gentlemen deem themselves higher and purer they are pretty generally
considered by others as only the lady-dowagers of society but the
lady-dowagers sometimes consider the gentility of lawyers doubtful

the third profession is that of arms which owes its consideration
mainly to the women who although the ministers of love and mercy to
man are wondrous fond of those who deal in blood and gunpowder these
are the only respectable professions in america

divinity physic merchandise agriculture and politics are the only
others from which a man is occasionally allowed to enter good society
but they are considered low and it is only peculiar circumstances
which can give any of their followers a claim to rise

i have said that the claim of the gentlemen to consider themselves the
highest class is founded in nature they form the nucleus of society
and around them as they are admitted the members of the other
professions establish the grand order of fashion according to their
creed law is a respectable profession because it keeps down the mob
or people by keeping them constantly by the ears and because it makes
money and arms they hold to be reputable because it does the same
thing and paves the way to the presidency divinity and physic they
consider to be naturally low occupations since their provinces are
only to take care of dirty souls and bodies merchandise is denounced
since it consists of both buying and selling whereas buying is the
only part of traffic that is fit for a gentleman agriculture is
contemned because there are so many clodhoppers engaged in it and
politics because it demands consociation with the mob

in these five professions however certain fortunate circumstances may
give a claim to notice parsons who are often doctors of divinity and
always reverends and physicians are titled gentry and this counts in
their favour and the same thing may be said of politicians when they
rise to be secretaries of departments or foreign ministers or become
renowned as orators great distinction will secure them favour for
they are then people that people look at merchants are allowed to be
respectable as soon as they are worth a million provided they have two
or three daughters and no sons and are willing to be splendid in their
entertainments an agriculturist of our own latitudes can never expect
to be made respectable but a planter of cotton or tobacco who owns a
hundred negroes and puts the name of his farm or the county he lives
in after his own has as good a chance as any

all other classes are vulgar and mechanical and therefore ineligible
men of science and genius are excluded on account of their manners
which are outlandish and their arrogant display of superiority which
is disagreeable and as for the actors dancers and singers that
are sometimes met with the two first are admitted because they are
foreign and famous and the last because they bring good music for
nothing

from this exposition of the code of society it will be seen that my
uncle wilkins could boast but slender claims to an introduction his
occupation had been vulgar and he had not made money enough to ennoble
him i trebled his two hundred and ninety thousand as is usual but i
could not deny that his son was named sammy and his daughter pattie

but what spoke highly in his favour was that whatever had been his
profession he had now abandoned it with the praiseworthy intention of
living a gentleman during the remainder of his life and what was also
advantageous he had pursued it at such a distance from the haunts of
fashion that his new friends might with the greatest propriety affect
an entire ignorance of it

his having a daughter too and but one son to divide with her his
eight hundred and seventy thousand that is to say his two hundred and
ninety was also a strong recommendation to those mammas who had sons
to provide for and his determination to indulge the fair pattie in
as many balls and parties as she desired was another circumstance to
propitiate favour

but to crown all i countenanced him and that settled the matter
in a few days time there was such a rattle and trampling at the
brewer's door as had never been known before the whole square was in
commotion being choked up with carriages and such was the throng of
genteel people rushing into the house that an unsophisticated dealer
in second-hand furniture supposing there was an auction to be held
stalked into the parlour and electrified everybody by wondering in
the way of a question not addressed to any particular person when the
sale was to begin

in short the thing was settled my uncle was dubbed a gentleman and
every occurrence went to show that in the approaching season his rank
would be confirmed and his daughter recognised as a belle by everybody
in town

but before that time a change came o'er the spirit of my fate and but
i shall confess the whole affair to the reader




chapter xvii


in which sheppard lee relates the passion he conceived for his fair
cousin and his engagement to elope with her


my uncle wilkins it seems was not merely ambitious to get into good
society he was ambitious to have his daughter married and as he
said into the best family in the land an object not very difficult
to compass considering the fortune he intended to leave her but my
uncle was resolved her husband should be rich as well as distinguished
and i discovered the old curmudgeon had an extreme horror of poverty
perhaps one of the strongest reasons for his leaving the country was
a fear he had lest his adorable daughter should be snapped up by that
aforesaid danny baker whom my cousin had pronounced one of the truest
and handsomest sweethearts i ever saw although i never saw him at
all nor indeed any other extremely true and handsome sweetheart of
the male gender in all my life for those that are true are ugly and
those that are handsome are as uncertain as politics i say this was my
uncle's fear and indeed he confessed to me his belief that pattie
had really a sneaking kindness for the young rustic for which reason
he was anxious to have her married as soon as possible

i may here observe that if a bachelor is to judge of the excellence of
love by the character of its vocabulary he will discover no stirring
reason to lament his insensibility all the expressions on the subject
go to show that there is something mean and contemptible in the tender
passion which men otherwise profess to be the most heavenly of the
passions as if indeed heaven had any thing to do with any of them
the moment a man begins to think a woman uncommonly charming he is
said to cast a sheep's eye on her when he feels a friendship for
her it becomes a sneaking kindness and the moment his heart is in
a hubbub he is deep in the mire from these terms and others that
might be mentioned it results as i have said namely that men and
women who have experienced the tender passion are notwithstanding
their pretences to the contrary really ashamed of it that a lover is
a sheep and a sneaking fellow ordained to grovel in the mud at the
feet of his mistress and finally that a bachelor has no good reason
to execrate his stars for keeping him single

but i had other notions when i was in mr i d dawkins's body

i was entirely of my uncle's way of thinking and proposed to take her
myself to which my uncle replied in some perturbation none of your
jokes there ikey my boy and gave me plainly to understand that was
a thing he would never think of nay the proposition seemed to him so
unpalatable that i was compelled to pretend i had made it entirely in
jest though i demanded supposing i had been serious what objection
he could have to me oh none in the world said he except your
being so near of blood for a cousin-german is almost the same as a
brother

i understood the old hunks better than he thought he had somehow
or other found out that i had spent my fortune and was therefore
in that particular no better off than mr danny baker i saw too
clearly enough that he only valued me as a sort of stepping-stone into
society and that having once had all the advantage of me he could he
would be ready to forget all my benefits the curmudgeon he had found
out i had been borrowing money of his son sammy and he was already
longing for the time to come when he might safely discard me

i resolved to marry pattie in spite of him and began to cast about for
some device by which to secure her share of his two hundred and ninety
thousand which it was more than probable he would withhold in the
event of her marrying against his will this device i soon hit upon

i told him there was among all my acquaintance not above one man whom
i could recommend as a husband for pattie for though there were dozens
of genteel young fellows fortunes were by no means so plentiful my
friend tickle i assured him was just the man a little gay to
be sure indeed quite dissipated and what was worse an enemy to
matrimony which was the more extraordinary as by marrying he might
come at once into possession of a splendid fortune and thereupon i
told him that jack's father who was a saint in his way and a bigot
to reclaim him had by will for i assured him the poor man was dead
bequeathed his superb estate to him only upon condition that he married
before the expiration of five years failing in which the whole
property now in the hands of trustees would revert to other persons
with the exception of a shabby annuity of a thousand a year the five
years i told my uncle wilkins were now nearly expired and jack
being in some alarm was already expressing an inclination to seek a
spouse but she must be a rich one otherwise he would never think of
her

this story which i fabricated for the purpose produced a strong
effect upon my uncle wilkins and i concluded it by recommending he
should without delay settle half his fortune upon pattie by legal
grant of dedi et concessi as the lawyers call it and register the
same in which event i would do all i could to bring the marriage
about not doubting that we should succeed since pattie was as i
averred just the sort of girl that tickle liked

my uncle was rather dumbfounded at the last proposal and swore he
would do no such thing he was not going he said to bribe anybody
to take his girl off his hands not he she should have her share when
he was dead and if she married to his liking why she should have
something before i might bring my friend tickle to see her if i would
and he would see what he thought of him

my uncle put a bold face upon the matter but i perceived he was eager
to make the acquaintance of my friend tickle and would be soon brought
to reason and indeed after having seen the intended son-in-law
and listened some half a dozen times over to my arguments he opened
his heart so far as to settle the sum of forty thousand dollars upon
pattie which or rather the yearly interest of that sum for the
crafty old sly-boots took care to constitute himself trustee for the
girl and retain the principal in his own hands he conditioned to pay
her after her marriage

i was provoked at his stinginess but as no better terms could be had
i thought i might as well bring the matter to a conclusion trusting
that something better would turn up after my marriage

i say my marriage for i had no thoughts of bestowing forty thousand
dollars or the interest thereof upon my friend tickle i made him my
confidant in the matter and easily prevailed upon him to assist me in
deceiving my uncle wilkins by appearing to pattie in the light of a
wooer as for pattie herself who i was persuaded had fallen in love
with me at first sight i made her a declaration which diverted and
delighted her beyond expression and revealing to her also my project
to secure her an independence she agreed to do her part in the play
pretend a great fancy for mr tickle and run away with me the moment
her father should make her the grant in question

the grant was made as i mentioned before but by that time i was in
a dilemma having made an engagement to elope with another lady who
was in some respects highly attractive and had fallen devouringly in
love with me indeed i may say she made me the first offer though it
was not leap-year but her situation excused her especially as it was
i she made love to she was the reader will be surprised to learn the
daughter of old skinner or goldfist the usurer and she was rather
handsome than otherwise the engagement was brought about as will be
shown in the next chapter




chapter xviii


in which sheppard lee recounts an engagement of a similar nature which
he formed with the fair alicia


my creditors looking with great certainty for their money now that
my long-talked-of uncle had got to town having waited a couple of
weeks for payment in vain began to besiege me in a highly importunate
way and as no assistance was to be had of my uncle and sammy's purse
was not so well filled as i could have wished i was reduced to great
straits

conversing on this subject with my friend tickle he advised me to
visit old goldfist as i that is my prototype the true dawkins had
often done before and see what could be had out of him on the strength
of my projected nuptials

the advice being as good as could be had for tickle's pockets were
as empty as my own i proceeded to the old fellow's house after
nightfall for i did not care to be observed

having knocked at the door it was opened by no less a person than
skinner's fair daughter herself as i soon discovered and in fact i
had some faint recollection of having seen her before there was a lamp
on the pavement before the door by which i could see her very plainly
she blushed and smiled and looked confused and when i asked for her
father made me some answer which i did not understand but as she
invited me to enter i followed her into the house expecting to be led
to the money-lender she conducted me however to a parlour not over
and above well furnished for skinner was a notorious skinflint when
having vouchsafed to converse with her a while i again asked after her
father

she told me he was not at home but seeing me rise to depart she
stammered out an assurance that he would soon return which caused me
to resume my seat evidently to her great pleasure

seeing this i condescended to make myself agreeable and with such
effect that the simple-hearted foolish creature began to tell me how
often she had seen me at her father's house a year or two before when
she was a little school-girl as she said and how glad she was to
see me back again as if a year or two before we had been intimate
acquaintances when on the contrary as my associations assured me i
or my original had never taken the slightest notice of her as in
truth why should i her father being so much beneath me

i believe i rather gave her a stare but she looked so admiringly at
me i could do no less than continue to be agreeable and to tell the
truth i was afterward amazed at my condescension

by-and-by there dropped in one of her brothers a very fine looking
young man for one of his rank in life but of a dissipated
under-the-table look and i thought somewhat julapized which is
a word that among certain classes signifies that one is not sober
however he behaved with great decorum and instead of taking a
seat as i expected to make my acquaintance he gave me a nod and a
laugh as much as to say i know what you're after my boy and went
stumbling into the back part of the house

in a few moments after there came another equally good looking but not
so obliging for he helped himself to a seat without any ceremony and
with just as little proceeded to inform me he supposed i was after
dad but dad was fast on an arbitration and would not be home for at
least three hours

poor alicia for that was her name and in this particular she was
better provided than my cousin pattie gave her brother an angry look
for at this announcement i got up and took my leave she followed
me however to the door and told me if i would come at about eight
o'clock on the following evening i would find her papa at home and
she added softly that she would be glad to see me she glad to see
me poor soul

i went though according to appointment and poor soul she was
glad to see me as was plain enough but sorry that papa had not yet
got through with that arbitration and so i could not see him unless
i would be so good as to wait until he came home and if i would it
would be charity for there was nobody in the house with her except old
barbara the housekeeper who was but poor company and indeed she
had but poor company always living a very lonesome life of it c
c and she concluded by promising if i would sit down to play me a
tune upon the piano

she played me a tune accordingly and horrid work she made of it but
as she did her best i praised her and that pleased her she then
to show me that she was accomplished introduced me to divers bits of
paper with colours on them which she told me were drawings and as i
knew but little of such things i took her word for it after which she
exhibited some two or three dozen handsome-looking volumes in french
and italian of which languages i knew no more than dandies in general
and for that reason i told her such things were now considered bores
and left to children and schoolmasters

i perceived we were to have a tête-à-tête of it and i began to suspect
the lassie knew so when she invited me when this idea entered my
mind i felt a little indignant yet it was diverting to think of her
simplicity i thought i would amuse myself with her a little while and
unbend from the austerity of dignity which seemed to gratify her most

in this humour i permitted myself to be merry and easy and having
romped with her one way and another much to her delight i at last
seized upon her and gave her a buss whereupon she acted pretty much
as my cousin pattie had done before her that is she laughed and
blushed and cried oh la but looking all the time any thing but
incensed

in short my condescension affected her to that degree that she
began to treat me as her most undoubted friend and in the height
of her confidence informed me that she was just eighteen years old
minus two months the very age of my cousin pattie that she was
her father's favourite as far as any one could be the favourite of
such a curmudgeon and that besides her fine expectations from him
she enjoyed in her own right a fortune of twenty thousand dollars a
bequest from some old aunt or other which she would come into
possession of as soon as the aforesaid two months and a few odd days
had expired

this was news that affected me very strongly and had her father been
a gentleman all things considered i believe i should have made her a
declaration on the spot

as it was i felt my soul growing tender towards her for though twenty
thousand dollars was but a small sum it was if i could take her word
for it certain which was not yet the case with any of my cousin
pattie's expectations however before i could digest the information
we were surprised by the turning of a dead-latch key in the front
door and alicia cried with a tone of disappointment oh la it is
papa and so it was

the old gentleman looked upon the open piano and the books and
drawings upon the table with surprise and then upon me with
uneasiness

mr dawkins has been waiting papa said alicia

humph said old goldfist and pointed her to the door she stole me a
look and as she passed out raised her hand archly to her lips she
was rather free i confess but she had lived a secluded life and knew
no better

the old fellow gave me a sharp look coughed phthisically twice or
thrice and then with but little superfluous ceremony asked me what i
wanted

money said i

oh ay always money who is to pay it what's your security

my uncle wilkins said i

very good name don't doubt growled the bear the banks will take
it don't do any business of that sort

ged faith no said i i don't come for money at six per cent
but on the old terms of usury you know my uncle wilkins eh only two
children a fortune of eight hundred and seventy thousand dollars

bah said the bull that will do for the girls and boys know all
about him one hundred and twenty and half of it in railroads good
for nothing

two hundred and ninety bona fide said i and half of it in
bank-stock

know all about it said mr skinner but what's that to you has a
son of his own

and a daughter said i giving him a nod which brought a christian
look into his face and doubtless a christian feeling into his
hearts i took advantage of it to inform him that she and i were about
to elope and wanted a thousand dollars to bear our expenses assuring
him also that her father was on the eve of making her a grant of fifty
thousand dollars as soon as which was done we should be off at a
moment's warning to be brief i told the old fellow all that was
necessary for my purpose and made so good a story of it that i have
no doubt i should have got something out of him had not my evil genius
suddenly prompted me to refer to his own daughter alicia and ask him
what he intended to give her over and above her own twenty thousand

he looked as black as midnight and asked who told me she had such a
sum

i saw i had alarmed him and said i had it of a friend of mine a very
fine fellow who thought of taking her off his hands provided he would
add twenty more to it

want no fine fellows and no friends of yours said he gruffly
won't give her a cent and has nothing of her own all a fool's
story told you so herself a jade's trick never told a truth in her
life

the old miser's soul was up in arms the prospect of being called upon
in two months space to render up the girl's portion to a son-in-law
was so much scotch snuff thrown into his eyes if it did not blind
it at least distracted him and the reward i had for conjuring up the
vision was my own dismissal notwithstanding all my arguments to the
contrary with my pockets as empty as when i entered a rude assurance
that he had closed accounts with me and a highly impertinent request
that i would avoid troubling him for the future

so i got no money of him but his daughter fell in love with me
and the next day she sent me by the post a very tender and romantic
billetdoux in which she lamented her father's harshness and barbarity
hoped i would not think ill of her for venturing upon an apology and
concluded by informing me with agreeable simplicity that her father
was never at home between eight and nine o'clock in the evening when
the weather was clear from all which i understood that she was as
ready to run away with me as my cousin pattie

having pondered over the matter for a while it appeared to me proper
to encourage her enthusiasm so that in the event of my uncle wilkins
refusing to make pattie independent i might be certain of a wife
who could bring me something i had many objections indeed to the
lady's family and relations but the latter i could easily cut in case
of necessity and the other i considered scarce worth thinking of
her twenty thousand dollars was a strong recommendation and there
was no telling what her father might leave her if reconciled after
her marriage i liked my cousin pattie best but upon the whole i
considered it advisable to have a second string to my bow

with this impression on my mind i took occasion to drop in upon her
the first clear evening repeating the visit now and then as suited my
convenience and promised to run away with her upon the first fitting
occasion and this promise i resolved to keep provided my affairs with
my cousin pattie should render it advisable




chapter xix


the ingenious devices with which sheppard lee prepared the way for the
elopement


i had scarce brought my friend tickle upon the stage and introduced
him into my uncle's family before my mind began to misgive me i
suspected that instead of being content to play the stalking-horse for
my sole advantage he would take the opportunity to advance his own
interest and gain if he could my cousin pattie for himself

to remove all temptation and bind him more closely to be faithful i
told him of my adventure with alicia taking care however to conceal
her name for i did not wish to forego my advantages in that quarter
until convinced i could do so without loss described her claim to the
sixty thousand dollars for of course i trebled her inheritance and
concluded by engaging to make her over to him the moment i was myself
secure of pattie which would be the moment pattie was secure of an
independence

upon this promise tickle made me a thousand protestations of friendship
and disinterestedness and i felt my mind more easy

he acted his part assisted by pattie who at my suggestion feigned
suddenly to be violently in love with him and besieged her father
to the same end as myself the old gentleman at last com plied and
actually executed the deed of gift which i mentioned before by which
he secured to her the revenue accruing upon a sum of forty thousand
dollars the principal which he retained in his own hands in trust
to revert to her at his death and to this deed i was myself made a
witness

with these terms as it seemed there were no better to be had i
allowed myself to be satisfied and trusting to a final reconciliation
with my uncle wilkins to augment the dowry i ran to my cousin pattie
and informed her of her good fortune

she was filled with repture and began fairly to dance with joy she
told me i was the best and sweetest of cousins and vowed she would
love me to her dying day her joyous spirits fired my own and i
answered in terms equally ecstatic in short we agreed to elope that
very night and arranged our plan accordingly it was agreed i should
have a carriage in waiting at the corner of the street during the
evening and that pattie who was to feign herself unwell as an excuse
for not going to mrs pickup's first ball which was to take place
that evening should find some means to get her father out of the way
immediately after which i having disposed of the redoubtable sammy by
depositing him in the aforesaid mrs pickup's drawing-room was to make
my appearance and bear her in triumph to a reverend divine previously
secured for the ceremony

having settled all these things and sealed our engagement with a kiss
my adorable cousin admitted me to a secret which nearly froze my blood
with horror

she informed me that my friend tickle disregarding all his vows
of fidelity had been busy ever since i brought him into the house
besieging her on his own account that he had taken every occasion to
undermine me in her affections by disparaging my good qualities both
of soul and mind and especially by assuring her i was a great ass
and fortune-hunter those were his very words and finally that he
had so used the power his knowledge of our secret had given him by
occasional threats of betraying it to her father that she had been
compelled to accept his addresses and make him the same promise she
had just made me that is to elope with him the perfidious fellow had
by some means got wind of the deed of gift and while i was engaged
in signing it he had paid my cousin a visit with the same object as
myself and she had promised to decamp with him nay at this moment
the villain was engaged in securing his carriage and his parson with
the prospect of chousing me out of my wife and fortune

my horror was however soon dissipated my cousin pattie had made the
engagement only in self-defence and she looked upon the whole affair
as the best joke in the world how we will cheat him said she the
base fellow and she danced about smiling and laughing and crying
together so that it was a delight to see her yes said she with
uncommon vivacity we will cheat him for i'm sure he deserves no
better for i'm sure he's just as much of a goose and fortune-hunter as
he said you were and i'm sure i despise a goose and fortune-hunter
above all things and i'm sure i know how to treat a goose and
fortune-hunter as well as anybody how we'll laugh at him to-morrow
how he'll stare when he finds i'm gone how papa will stare too how
sammy will stare and how he'll whistle oh dear i do love to cheat
people of all things i do cousin ikey and ods fishes i'm almost
half minded to cheat you too

and with that she flung her arms round my neck gave me a kiss and ran
laughing away to prepare for the hour of elopement

there was an extraordinary coincidence between the situation of my
cousin pattie and myself she had agreed to run away with two different
people at the same moment and so had i the day before my uncle proved
unusually crusty and self-willed and i began to think i should never
effect my point with him and what was equally dispiriting i fell
among duns who persecuted me with astonishing rancour my uncle's
appearance as it seemed serving rather to sharpen than to allay their
appetites for payment being thus goaded on by doubt and dunning i
resolved to make sure of goldfist's daughter which i did by visiting
her as soon as night came and proposing an elopement on the following
evening and this it was the more easy to put into execution since her
father as she told me was fast in bed with a sciatica or some such
vulgar disorder

no one could be more willing and delighted than the fair alicia and it
appeared that in anticipation of the happy event she had already made
all her preparations having as she assured me arranged with a friend
of hers at whose house she designed the ceremony to be performed
ordered secretly a whole trunk full of bride's clothes and notified an
old schoolmate whom she had engaged to wait upon her

i thought upon my soul she was taking matters pretty easily and
acting somewhat independently but she was ignorant of the world as i
said before and knew no better i was still more disgusted with the
thought of being shown off among her friends and told her a bridemaid
was wholly superfluous but she had made her mind up as to what was
right on such an occasion and i judged it proper to submit it was
agreed i should meet her at her friend's house at nine o'clock in the
evening and she hoped very modestly i thought that i would bring
some nice pretty fellow to wait on me that would make a good match
with her dear julia who was the nicest dear soul in the world

this nice dear soul as i afterward discovered and as i think proper
to inform the reader now that he may understand into what a slough of
democracy i was rushing was no less a personage than a cousin-german
of mr snip my tailor and her appointment to the honour of waiting
upon the bride of the distinguished i d dawkins was productive of a
casualty expected neither by herself nor by my adored alicia

i laughed in my sleeve at that hint of my alicia and yet i did after
all provide myself with an attendant and one who was perhaps better
suited than any other person i could have lighted on as an offset
and pendent to the fair julia this was my cousin sammy wilkins
and the reason of my appointing him was this he was although the
stupidest creature on earth of a meddling and prying nature and
had an extraordinary fancy to go sneaking after me whithersoever i
went from admiration and affection perhaps but of that i was not
certain and at all events he was a great burden to me he discovered
my repeated visits to skinner's house and was seized with a stupid
curiosity to know the reason and what was still worse he made so
many observations on my attentions to and secret conferences with
his sister pattie that it was clear he suspected there was something
in the wind there too being kept in eternal torment lest he should
discover more than i liked or by his indiscreet tattling awake the
suspicions of others i saw no better means of averting the mischief
and turning his eyes from his sister than by taking him aside and
telling him with many injunctions to secrecy that i was courting old
skinner's rich daughter and wished to have him wait upon me at the
wedding

such confidence coupled with the intention to do him so much honour
entirely overcame his rustic imaginations he swore he approved of
marrying rich wives and was looking out for one himself and hoped i
would put him on the track of one which i promised and the clownish
juvenile was content he looked forward to the great event with a
measure of glee i had never seen him roused to before and he ordered a
new coat of snip that he might do honour to his service

it is quite true i never really intended he should trouble himself in
the matter but when the fated evening came when the loving alicia
arrayed in satin and white roses was awaiting her lover who was
preparing to run away with her rival i thought it better to despatch
him to my charmer than to leave him at mrs pickup's whence he might
stray at a moment's warning and indeed with no warning at all it
was quite necessary to have him out of the way for which reason i sent
him to the house where alicia was in waiting with a special message
to the lady to make his introduction the more easy and a thousand
instructions in relation to nothing

it was fortunate that my cousin sammy though as great a rustic as
ever lived was as little troubled with bashfulness as wisdom hence
i found no difficulty in despatching him to my inamorata whom he had
never laid eyes on and to her friends with regard to whom i was in
the same predicament i promised to follow him in a short time and
thus to my great joy succeeded in getting him out of the way




chapter xx


the guests that sheppard lee invited to his wedding


the appointed hour drew nigh and all things had gone on swimmingly
with one single exception the persecution i had endured from messrs
sniggles snip co the day before i was fated once more to endure
for going home to my lodgings about dusk to put on my best shirt
i found my chief creditors assembled in solemn divan or rather in
warlike ambush and such a troop of bears and wolves as they were was
perhaps never seen by an unfortunate gentleman before what had brought
them together especially at such an unlucky moment it was impossible
to divine but it seems they had had in consideration the state of
my affairs and prospects and had just come to the conclusion as i
entered that they were none the better off for the coming of my uncle
wilkins who for it appeared the villain sniggles had been sounding
him on the subject had disavowed all responsibility for my debts and
all disposition to discharge them in terms not to be mistaken it had
just been resolved nem con as the saying is that i had cheated
them that i was cheating them and that i would cheat them as long as
i could and that terms therefore should be kept with me no longer

to this moment my flesh creeps when i think of the yell the villains
set up when i stumbled among them and the audacity with which they
heaped on my devoted head their upbraidings menaces and maledictions
they used highly uncivil language and some laid their defiling fingers
upon my collar while all as with one voice cried out to carry me
before an alderman and make a public spectacle of me at once

i say my flesh yet creeps while i think of their ferocious conduct
and i shall remember it to my death-bed for of all the various
woes and grievances to which flesh is heir and which i have had
uncommon opportunities to test there are none more truly awful in my
recollections than a high case of dunning

it was several moments before i could utter a word in defence and when
i did having nothing better to say i assured the rascals i was just
on the eve of running away with my uncle's daughter and of course
would be soon able to answer all their scurvy demands i told them the
time was fixed the carriage and parson prepared and my fair pattie
in waiting but as i had told them many thousand things before which
were not always exactly true i found my present assurances received
with so little credit that i was obliged to give them ocular proof of
my honesty and fair-dealing i invited them to follow me to my uncle's
door and there station themselves until they beheld me come forth
conducting my bride to the carriage after which they might if they
would follow me in like manner to the parson and i engaged in the
confidence of my heart if i failed to bring out a wife according to
promise to follow them without any further demur to the alderman or
to old nick himself which was pretty much the same thing

this proposal being highly reasonable was accepted and i had the
honour of such an escort to my uncle's doors as was never before
enjoyed by a bridegroom the only one who did not accompany me to my
uncle's door was mr snip the tailor who passing a house where lived
as he said a young lady of his acquaintance stepped in to show one
of his customer's new coats that he had on promising to follow after
us in a moment as my stars or the father of sin would have it this
young lady was that identical dear julia his cousin-german of whom
i spoke before and whom he found rustling in satin just prepared
as she informed him to join her dear alicia skinner who was to be
married to the handsome mr dawkins at the house of their friend mrs
some-one-or-other

the tailor was thunderstruck as tailors doubtless often are assured
the dear julia she was mistaken and acquainted her with the true state
of the case the result of which was as may be understood when she
had carried her news to the expectant alicia a certain scene of a
highly interesting nature as for mr snip himself he rushed out of
the house to bring me to an explanation but when he reached the party
i had already taken refuge in my uncle's house




chapter xxi


containing a scialogue or curious conversation with nothing with a
discovery extremely astonishing to several persons


i found my cousin pattie also in her satins and nora magee whom she
had resolved to take with her decked out with extraordinary splendour
and what i thought was diverting enough the creature had a long
bridal veil like her mistress and as huge a cloak to conceal her
person from observation they were prepared to start with each her
bundle at hand and they hailed my appearance with delight

but there was a difficulty before us my uncle wilkins was yet in the
house and so was sammy as for the latter i soon got rid of him by
sending him to alicia as i mentioned before but my uncle we could
not remove my cousin's affectation of sickness to confirm which and
conceal her nuptial preparations she kept aloof in her chamber or
pretended to do so concerned him and he refused to leave the house
but being left to himself we knew he would soon drop asleep that
being one of his rustical propensities

by-and-by while we were discoursing upon our difficulties we heard a
carriage drive by and just as it passed the door the coachman gave
three loud cracks with his whip it was a sign i had agreed upon with
the fellow and i knew all was now in readiness i proposed that we
should instantly steal down stairs and 

at that moment i heard the front door softly open and shut

who's that said i

ah i'm sure i don't know said my cousin pattie turning so pale
i thought she was going to fall down in a faint perhaps it is mr
tickle yes she cried recovering her spirits and almost jumping for
joy now we'll sort him i'll show him how i serve fortune-hunters
i reckon i'll lock him up in a closet i will and there he shall
kick his heels till morning and i don't care if the rats eat him i
don't oh goody gracious he's coming up stairs she cried was
there ever anybody so impudent but i'll fix him here cousin ikey do
you run in here pointing to her chamber and don't let him see you

no said i thinking it proper to appear courageous i will face
the faithless rascal and punish his impertinence on the spot i
had no idea of doing any such thing which of course must have
alarmed my uncle and i intended to yield to pattie's fears and
importunity swallow my wrath for the present and conceal myself as
she recommended but my display of resistance awoke the indignation of
nora magee who cried och the divil take him thin does he mane to
rob us of our husbands and seizing me by the shoulders she thrust me
towards the chamber

run in cousin ikey said my cousin driving the irish barbarian
away but seizing me herself and urging me into the chamber while
she seemed dying with suppressed mirth you'll see how nora will sort
him you'll hear it you mustn't speak a word and ods fishes you
must remember to behave yourself here she seemed more diverted than
ever ods fishes you must behave yourself in a lady's chamber

at that moment nora blew out the light so that we were left in
darkness and my cousin locked the door thus as i supposed dividing
us from the enemy i say pattie my soul said i whispering in her
ear what is nora going to do with him but she answered me not a
word and i took that as a hint to hold my own peace the next instant
i heard a rustling in the next room and the voice of jack tickle
saying softly and almost in my own words

i say pattie my soul what did you blow out the light for where are
you oh you divine creature and i heard the smack of a kiss that
quite astonished me

pattie said i what the deuse is the meaning of that

but pattie was as dumb as before the rustling was transferred from the
antechamber i had taught my cousin to call it her boudoir into the
passage and i could tell by the creaking of a step that my friend
tickle was going down stairs

pattie said i what's in the wind now

but still pattie refused to answer me

while i was wondering at her silence now that there was no fear of
being overheard i again distinguished the sound of the house door
softly opened and shut

i say pattie said i what the devil is all that and pray why
don't you speak

it occurred to me that her silence was all owing to a fit of
bashfulness caused by her having me locked up in the chamber with her

pattie said i reaching out my hands but without being able to
reach her you shouldn't be bashful nor nothing considering we're to
be married in less than half an hour i say pattie what are we to do
now where are you

while i spoke i heard a carriage again rattle by the door and to my
astonishment the coachman saluted the house with three such cracks of
his whip as my own had given a few minutes before

pattie said i while a cold sweat broke over my limbs where are
you and why don't you speak

i felt about the door for her but felt in vain i listened for the
sound of her breath hoping she might have hidden herself out of sheer
mischief but not a breath was to be heard i went feeling about the
chamber and with as little effect

a horrible suspicion seized upon my fancy there were two doors to the
apartment one opening upon the passage the other into the boudoir
and both were locked as fast as doors could be where was the key my
cousin pattie turned when we entered the chamber together it was gone
i discovered its absence and looked round the chamber in astonishment
and dismay

at that moment some person in mr periwinkle smith's house which
was right opposite entered a front chamber therein with a light
which streamed into the windows of pattie's apartment with a lustre
sufficient to make every object visible my cousin pattie was not to be
seen i looked under the bed and into the bed examined the presses
and peeped behind the chairs but no cousin pattie was to be found she
had locked me in the chamber but not herself horror of horrors she
had played a trick upon me she had jilted me and ay there was no
doubting it a moment longer she had run off with my friend tickle
i'll show you how i serve fortune-hunters said she lock him up in
a closet kick his heels till morning eaten up by rats shall hear
yourself how i'll serve your rival tickle death and destruction and
after all she has run away with him eloped in the very carriage i
provided married by the parson i engaged decamped with the forty
thousand i secured and i i the unfortunate jilted cozened
i was the person left kicking my heels in a closet

the idea filled me with phrensy and the light from mr periwinkle
smith's house being removed at the moment i tumbled over a chair that
lay in my way and besides breaking my head and shin woke up such a
din in the house that the very servants in the kitchen bounced up in
alarm and screamed out for assistance

what's the matter pattie said my uncle wilkins turning the key
which the faithless creature had left sticking in the outside of the
door and entering i say pattie ods bobs what's the lord bless
us cousin ikey is that you what's the matter what are you doing in
pattie's chamber

i answered my uncle wilkins only by opening my mouth as wide as i
could and staring at him in anguish horror and despair

where's pattie said he in alarm

the question restored me to my faculties

eloped said i cheated me beyond all expression and run off with
my rival jack tickle

what a fool said my uncle recovering his composure i'm sure i
never opposed her

so much for not giving her to me said i

to you said my uncle

uncle wilkins said i from this moment i shall cut your
acquaintance pattie has jilted me so horribly you can't conceive and
has married jack tickle

well said my uncle where's the harm to be sure and a'n't he as
good now as worth ten thousand a year

not worth a cent said i shaking my fists at the old gentleman and
then drumming on my own breast not worth a cent and down in every
tailor's books in town except snip's who wouldn't trust him

oh you villain said my uncle wilkins how you've cheated me

he ran down stairs and i after him he was bent upon pursuing his
daughter and so was i



chapter xxii


in which sheppard lee finds that he has made the fortune of his
friends without having greatly advantaged his own


as we reached the foot of the staircase the house door opened and in
came my friend tickle dragged along not by our dear and faithless
pattie as we fondly supposed but by the raging nora magee

help murder help cried my friend tickle

och murder and twenty murders more upon ye ye chatin crathur and
won't ye marry me cried nora magee

my uncle wilkins and myself rushed forward lost in amazement and
separated the fury from her prey what is the matter cried both and
where is pattie

the devil is the matter cried jack panting and blowing and where
pattie is i know no more than you i thought i was running away with
her until i reached the squire's and then i found i had this wild
indian under her cloak who insisted i should marry her or else 

ay ye murderin faithless villain said nora magee i'll marry ye
or i'll have the breaches of promise and the damages out of ye och
but i have the law of ye for didn't my missus pattie promise ye should
marry me i say ye ugly-faced hin-souled tickle that they call ye i
have the law of ye and i'll be married before the squire or i'll have
the breaches out of ye

my breeches said jack you may have and my coat and waistcoat too
for may i be hanged and quartered if i am not cheated out of my very
skin

where's my daughter pattie said my uncle wilkins he looked at me
and i looked at him it was plain my cousin pattie had not run away
with my friend tickle

where could she be i began to recover my spirits when they were
suddenly put to flight by a knock at the door which being opened a
letter was thrown in the messenger instantly taking to his heels so
that no one beheld him it was a letter to my uncle wilkins he opened
it and read the following words 

dear papa and honoured father

this is to inform you that i don't like mr tickle and so can't
marry him and hope you will excuse me for following my own fancies
being now independent as you have made me for which i will remain
your dutiful loving daughter for life give my love to cousin dully
and tell him i consider him my best friend next to my dear papa and
my dear husband for oh papa i'm really married and going off
travelling to-morrow

hope you'll forgive us papa and shall ever love and pray for you and
rest your loving dutiful children

 pattie and danny baker

danny baker roared my uncle danny baker groaned i the clodhopper
had got her and i had been only toiling in his service

oh you villain said my uncle wilkins this is all your doings

sir said i no hard words

you're a villain said my uncle you wanted to steal her yourself
and i a'n't sorry danny baker has choused you out of her and for that
reason i don't care if i forgive him yes sir i'll forgive danny
baker but for you sir i owe you a debt 

if you do said tickle pay him but we took no notice of him my
uncle because he was enraged and i because i was devoured by the
greatness of my misfortune in truth the loss of my cousin pattie was
so unexpected that it had astounded me out of my faculties i was
reduced to a mere automaton conscious indeed of being in a horrible
quandary but incapable of seeing my way out of it when i suddenly
heard the voice as i thought or some one very like it of my cousin
sammy at the door

this roused me at once i remembered that at this moment my alicia was
waiting for me and i fell into a rapture

uncle wilkins said i you may say what you please jack tickle you
are a rascal nora magee you are a jade but it is all one to i d
dawkins i will marry my miss skinner

as i spoke i looked upon the door which opening disclosed a sight
that petrified me body and soul together it was the apparition of
my alicia in bridal array leaning upon the arm of my cousin sammy
and followed by a brace of youthful damsels decked in white flowers
all of whom stalked into the door with the solid step of flesh and
blood and advanced towards my uncle my alicia looking as silly and
shame-faced as could be while sammy on the contrary held up his head
and strutted like a turbaned turk in the midst of his harem

what the deuse is all this said jack tickle as for me i could not
speak a word being a hundred fold more amazed than before i looked at
my alicia who seeing me began to blush and bridle and simper and
hold fast to sammy's arm as for sammy he looked not a whit the less
turkish but marched up to his father as if charging him at the head of
a regiment

the old gentleman was as much astonished as myself and at last cried
out

ods bobs what's the matter sam have you been running away too

no said my cousin sammy i reckon i'm not gone yet but i've come
to get ready and first dad as in duty bound let's have a bit of
your blessing if you've no objection on me and my wife

your wife said i and said no more

well said my cousin sammy i reckon i may say so for you see
dawkins my boy when i saw lishy here i liked her and when july
here came and told us as how you had run off with sister pat wilkins
why then said i i may as well speak up for myself and so as the
parson was ready and lishy dressed up to be married already we made
but short work of the courtship and now as the saying is one and one
is one this here is my wife for better and for worse and i hope
neither you nor father has any objection




chapter xxiii


a crisis sheppard lee is reduced to great extremities and takes
refuge in the house of mourning


i never knew what my uncle wilkins replied to the aforesaid speech
the longest i ever heard my cousin sammy utter nor do i know what
reception he gave to the bride i made but one jump to the front
door where my horror was consummated my departure was greeted by an
uproarious cry but it proceeded from the street not the house i
found myself among the philistines whom an hour before i had myself
placed there in wait i had forgotten the barbarians which was natural
enough as they were my creditors but they had not forgotten me they
hailed my appearance on the steps with some such yell of wrath and
hunger as that with which the beasts of a menagerie express their joy
at the appearance of their daily meal

that cry was the finisher i leaped from the steps and took to my
heels not however without leaving in the hands of my tailor one tail
of the last coat he had made me which was i believe the only payment
i ever made him my hat flew into the gutter and that was perhaps
recovered by its maker in which case it was doubtless brushed up
and sold over again as a new one i fled like the wind my creditors
followed me the clatter of our footsteps and the uproar of their
interjections threw the street into a tumult some persons yelled
murder and others cried stop thief while the little boys catching
up the cry from a distance screamed out fire and ran to the nearest
engine-house to enjoy their evening amusement

how long i ran and whither it is quite impossible for me to say i
recollect doubling two or three times and diving into alleys to throw
my pursuers off the track my efforts were however in vain i found
myself lodged at last in a vile alley and hemmed in both on the front
and rear i made a leap at a garden gate which i cleared then running
forward and perceiving a back door in a house standing open i rushed
in scarce knowing what i did

i immediately discovered that i was in a sort of servants hall
or anteroom to the kitchen in which an old woman sat sleeping in
an arm-chair she was disturbed by the noise of my entrance and i
dreaded every moment to see her open her eyes and by her shrieks draw
my pursuers after me i was afraid however to retreat for in the
confusion of my mind i thought i heard my tormentors rushing to and
fro in the garden

in this uncertainty seeing a flight of stairs in one corner of the
room i darted up them without reflecting a moment upon what might be
the consequences but what evil could happen to me more horrid than
that i was fleeing i might stumble into a lady's chamber and throw her
into hysterics or i might find myself at the bedside of some valiant
personage sleeping with a brace of pistols under his pillow the
contents of which he might transfer to my body but such catastrophes
had now lost their terrors it was all one to i d dawkins as i had
said to my uncle wilkins i could receive no addition to my woes go
whither and do whatsoever i might

i rushed up the stairs therefore and entered a chamber where a
tallow candle burning all on one side stood flaring on a little
table among vials gallipots and other furniture of a sick chamber
throwing a dim and spectral light on a bed near to which it stood i
cast my eyes upon the bed and perceived i had nothing to fear either
from timorous ladies or nervous gentlemen




chapter xxiv


what happened in the dead-chamber the dirge of a wealthy parent


upon that couch lay the ghastly spectacle of a human corse stiff and
cold it was that of an old man and i thought at first that he slept
but upon looking closer i perceived that he had been dead for at
least an hour and it appeared as if he had died untended by friend or
servant for the bedclothes had been nearly tossed from the bed in his
last convulsion and now lay tumbled about his limbs and the floor
just as they had fallen his features were greatly distorted having an
expression of rage upon them that was highly disagreeable to look on
yet i had a vague feeling that i had seen him before

while i was wondering who he could be i perceived a paper clutched in
his right hand and taking it to the light the secret was at once
revealed

it was a letter from my adorable alicia to her father dated that very
evening in which she gave him to understand in the most romantic
language in the world that his opposition to her wishes in relation to
her beloved dawkins had broken her heart that she could never think
of marrying any one else as if indeed the old gentleman ever wished
her that she could not live without her dawkins and accordingly
had made up her mind to fly with him afar from parental severity
and concluded by assuring him that when he read those lines penned
by a grieved and determined but still dutifully loving heart she
said nothing of her fingers she would be in the arms of a lawful
husband there was appended a postscript in which she expressed much
contrition hoped he would forgive her and hinted that she would be of
age in two months

i looked at the old man again and wondered i had not known him before
it was old skinner sure enough and the secret of his death was
readily explained he had been sick before and this elegant epistle
had finished him or rather the necessity so romantically hinted at
in the conclusion of settling two months thereafter his guardian's
account with her husband had done his business i did not suppose the
wound in his parental feelings had done him much hurt but there was
more perhaps in that than any one would have thought that knew the
old miser

and there he lay then the owner of thousands and hundreds of
thousands with none to mourn him nay with not even a hand to smooth
the bed-robe over his neglected body he had squandered health
happiness good name and perhaps self-approbation the true riches of
man in the pursuit of the lucre which cannot purchase back again one
of these treasures and notwithstanding which lucre he was now and
indeed had been at his death-hour no better off than the beggar in his
coffin of deal he had heaped up gold for his children that they might
begrudge him the breath drawn in pain and infirmity and rejoice in the
moment of his death he had but why should i moralize over a subject
worn just as threadbare as any other the old fellow was a miser and
met the miser's fate nobody accused even his children of loving him
and while i stood by his side i had a stronger proof of their regard
than spoke in the neglected appearance of his deathbed i had scarce
entered the room before i heard from some of the apartments below the
sounds of mirth and festivity

they were not to be mistaken it was plain that some persons were
feasting and making merry in one of the old fellow's parlours and i
doubted not they were his two sons ralph and abbot both of whom had
very bad characters the latter in particular who was a notorious
profligate they were young men of promise i had heard but the
avarice of the parent had ruined them their education neglected from
indifference or a miserable spirit of parsimony their minds and
morals uncultivated the consciousness of their father's wealth and
their own golden prospects at his decease stimulated them to excesses
which were perhaps rendered still more agreeable to their imaginations
and certainly more destructive to their weal by the difficulty of
indulging in them resulting from the niggardliness of their father

but the reign of denial was now over the rattle and crash of glasses
and vessels in the room below the tumbling down of chairs and tables
with the sounds of singing shouting and laughter proclaimed with
what a lusty lyke-wake the abandoned sons were honouring the memory of
their father with what orgies of bacchus they were celebrating their
own deliverance from restraint suddenly the sound of the singing grew
louder as if some door between the revellers and the dead had been
opened and a moment after i perceived from the increase and direction
of the uproar that the sots were ascending the stairs and perhaps
approaching the chamber of death

an idea seized upon my mind i was heartily sick of mr i d dawkins's
body being ready at that moment to exchange it for a dog's and i was
incensed at the heartless and brutal rejoicings of the young skinners
it occurred to me if i could get my spirit into old goldfist's body i
should avoid all dunning for the future and give these two reprobate
sons of his such a lesson as would last them to their dying day

the idea came to me like a blaze of sunshine i remembered in a moment
the vast wealth of the deceased and i pictured to my imagination the
glorious use i should make of it i had always hated and despised the
old villain but a sudden affection for him now seized upon my soul i
had a strong persuasion in me resulting from my two former adventures
that i possessed the power of entering any human body which i found to
my liking and i resolved to exercise it or at the worst to make
proof of its existence for a third time of the manner of exercising
the power i knew but little i remembered however that on the former
occasions i had merely uttered a wish and the transformation was
instantly completed i stepped up to the body and chuckling with the
idea of chousing the unnatural sons out of their expected inheritance
i said old goldfist if you please i wish to be in your body

in less than a second of time i found myself starting up from the bed
as if i had just been roused from sleep by the noise of some falling
body and exclaiming what's that


i looked over the side of the bed and saw the body of i d dawkins
lying on the floor on its face the transformation was complete and
had been so instantaneous that my spirit heard through the organs of
its new tenement the downfall of its old i felt a little bewildered
indeed posed and remained upon my elbow staring about the room and i
may add that i was more disconcerted by the bacchanalian voices now at
the chamber door than by any thing else

the door opened and the young skinners entered i shall remember them
to my dying day they were both royally drunk and each armed with
a candle with which scattering the tallow over the floor as they
advanced they came staggering and hiccoughing into the chamber

i say bravo dad and no offence said the foremost but don't feel
so sorry as i ought and here's ralph a'n't sorry neither

led us a devilish hard life of it grumbled the other but shall
have something done for his soul by the catholics i say abby shall
buy that black horse and the buggie

and a tombstone for dad said the worthy abbot laying his candle
upon the table and striking an attitude like a dancing-master which
however he could not keep i say ralph he went on it isn't right
to say so but don't you feel good three hundred thousand apiece
dammee i say ralph let us dance

and the villains took hands and attempted a pas de deux as the
theatre people have it while the old woman who had been sleeping
below and was roused by the fall of my late body came running into
the room to see what was the matter by this time the dogs had
chasséd up so nigh to the bed that for the first time they laid
their eyes upon the reanimated countenance of their father

the effect was prodigious the moment before their faces were all
drunkenness and triumph now they were all drunkenness and horror the
light of the candle held by ralph flashed over my visage but abbot was
the first to observe me resting on my elbow and staring at him with
looks of wrath and indignation

lord love us ralph said he dad's coming to

yes you villains said i i am coming to you unnatural undutiful
rascals i have come to

they looked upon me and upon one another unutterably confounded
and i wondered myself that i did not laugh at them their confusion
however only filled me with rage and i railed at them with as much
emphasis and sincerity as if i had been their father in earnest

they dropped on their knees but their rueful appearance only added to
my fury i stormed and i scolded until being quite exhausted with the
effort a film came over my eyes and i fell back in a swoon

chapter i


the private history of abram skinner the shaver


my swoon was i believe of no great duration and i awoke from it a
new man as well as an old one

yes i was changed and with a vengeance and into such a miserable
creature that had i justly conceived what i was to become in entering
old goldfist's body i doubt whether even the extremity in which i was
placed would have forced me upon the transformation i forgot that
the title to skinner's wealth was saddled with the conditions of age
infirmity and a thousand others equally disagreeable but i soon made
the discovery though it was some time before i discovered all

the first inconvenience of the transformation which i felt was a
thousand aches in my bones a great disturbance in my inner man and
a general sense of feebleness and impotency highly vexatious and
tormenting my eyesight was bad my hearing indistinct and indeed
all my senses were more or less confused my hand trembled when i
lifted it to my face my voice quavered while i spoke and every effort
to breath seemed to fill my lungs with coal-gas and ashes in a word i
was a man of sixty years or more with a constitution just breaking up
if not already broken

my resuscitation produced a hubbub of no ordinary character my
sons for wonderful to be said i had sons and i soon felt as if
they were in reality mine were confounded and so doubtless was
barbara the housekeeper to the latter of whom it was perhaps owing
that i ever recovered from my swoon for my two boys overcome with
horror and despair rushed out of the house and it was a week before i
saw their faces again

what added to the confusion was the discovery of my late body lying
on the floor no one being at all able to account for its appearance
to this day indeed the thing remains a mystery among tailors and
shop-keepers it was pretty generally considered that the unfortunate
i d dawkins met his death by dunning and i believe the coroner's
jury returned a verdict accordingly but how he made his way into the
chamber of the usurer to give up the ghost just at the moment the
other was resuming it was never known some supposed he had visited
the old gentleman to borrow money and had knocked his head against the
bedpost in despair upon finding the lender past lending speculation
was alive upon the subject for two full days and was then buried in
the young gentleman's grave along with his body and his memory for
the memory of a dandy passeth away unless recorded on the books of his
tailor

i was confined to my bed a week suffering with a complication of
disorders for though i possessed the power to reanimate a corpse i
had none to conjure away its diseases in this period i had leisure to
exchange all previous characteristics that might have clung to me for
those that more properly belonged to my new casing and when i rose
from my bed the transformation was in every particular complete my
soul had lost its identity it had taken its shape from the mould it
occupied it was the counterpart of the soul of abram skinner

my last act as i d dawkins was to chuckle over the prospect of
spending abram skinner's money my first as abram skinner was to take
care it should be spent neither by myself nor by any one else the
desire to enjoy myself had vanished the thoughts of fine clothes
horses and carriages and so on entered my mind no more the only idea
that possessed me was what am i worth how much more can i make myself
worth and the first thing i did when i could sit in a chair was to
ransack a certain iron chest that stood under my bed containing my
prototype's books of accounts over which i gloated with the mingled
anxiety and delight that had doubtless distinguished the studies of the
true goldfist

i found myself rich beyond all my previously-formed expectations
and glum and rigid as were now all my feelings i think i should
have danced around my chamber for joy had not the first flourish
of a leg introduced me to the pangs of rheumatism i indulged my
rapture therefore in a soberer way and while awaiting the period of
emancipation from my chamber arranged a thousand plans for increasing
my wealth

my sons had deserted me but i was not left entirely to solitude
i received divers visits from old fellows like myself who after
growling out a variety of wonder and congratulation at my return to
life proceeded to counsel with me on subjects the discussion of which
speedily brought me to the knowledge of my new condition where it had
not been supplied by the iron chest and my instincts

these persons formed a confraternity of which it seems i or rather
my prototype abram skinner was a prominent member and the objects
of the association were to secure to each member the fruits of his
ambition with as little danger and trouble as possible we were a
knot of what the censorious call stock-gamblers and by working in
common and playing into each other's hands without taking pains to
acknowledge any connexion we were pretty sure of our game

it is astonishing how soon i entered into the spirit of my new
character on previous occasions the adaption of soul to body was a
work of time but here it seemed the work of but a few hours the cause
was however simple abram skinner was possessed of but one or at
most two characteristics and with these i easily became familiar the
love of money was the ruling passion and this i honestly confess
came to me so naturally that i was not conscious while giving up my
whole soul to it of any change of character whatever before i left
the house i was as busy shaving notes receiving bonds mortgages and
pledges for abram skinner was a gambler of all work and devising
schemes for cornering and blowing high and low in the stock-market
as if i had been born to the business

i found on my books the records of all imaginable operations from the
mem of a thousand shares of the moonlight manufacturing company
bought of a b on time to the entry of mrs c ds silver spoons and
pitcher purchased abram skinner scorned all dealing on pawns
that being illegal to the unlicensed at such a sum but redeemable at
such another sum which was generally at fifty per cent advance on a
certain day or forfeit here was a memorandum of a note bought at
half its value there of a mortgage taken in form of a purchase and in
other places a thousand other forfeitures such as marked the extent
and universality of business the skill the forethought and the
success of abram skinner the shaver

i have my compunctions when i think of the life i led that winter for
so long did i continue the life of a money-maker but i entreat the
reader to remember that i had got into abram skinner's body and that
the burden of my acts should be therefore laid upon his shoulders a
swearing gentleman once borrowed a quaker's great-coat with a promise
not to dishonour it by any profanity while it was on his back upon
returning it to his friend he was demanded if he had kept his promise
yes said the man of interjections with one of the most emphatic
but it has kept me lying all the time i never heard anybody doubt
that the lying was the fault of the coat and in like manner i hope
that the reader will not hesitate to attribute all my actions while in
abram skinner's body to abram skinner's body itself

besides my friends of the honest fraternity i had other visiters
before my infirmities permitted me to leave the house and the dealings
i had with them besides enabling me to get my hand in as the saying
is would afford the reader if described some insight into the
excellences of my new character

but i cannot pause over such pictures in detail the rulers then over
us to please the poor had got up a pressure in the money-market
whereby the poor were as is usual in such cases put under
contribution by the rich such a pressure however may be said to
please everybody though it puts everybody in a passion to the
rich who have money to lend it is as great a season of jubilee
as a rain-storm to ducks or a high wind to the bristly herd in an
apple-orchard and they are in a passion because they fear it will
be soon over to the poor who borrow their money at a higher rate
than usual it affords an opportunity to rail at the aristocracy and
the grinders of the poor which is a pleasing recreation after a bad
dinner at such times abram skinner was a happy man for he made money
without the trouble of stirring from his house every knock at the door
was the signal of a god-send every jerk at the bell was as the jingle
of coming dollars and cents




chapter ii


sheppard lee's first hit at money-making


it was at such a season that i entered the shaver's body the knocks
at my door were frequent and the demands of my visiters to be
brought into presence irresistible what cared they for my pains and
sickness they wanted money what cared i for my pains and sickness
 i was anxious to make it i ordered my house-keeper barbara for
it seems i was such a niggard i had no other servant to admit all
well-dressed applicants for i scorned to deal with any other

the first person admitted was a woman very good looking but advanced
in years she kept a boarding-house but as barbara informed me
had seen better days having been the wife of a rich merchant who
failed was absurd enough to keep his books so straight as to allow no
opportunity for defrauding his creditors surrendered up every cent
of his property and died a beggar leaving a widow and six orphan
daughters to lament his honesty

she was in some little flurry and perturbation of spirits but i spoke
with a blandness that astonished myself until i found that this was
always my practice with a customer whom i was not tired of this
restored her to confidence and garrulity

her tale was soon told her boarders were all very fine gentlemen
and ladies and good pay but the times were so hard they were just
at this moment compelled to pay with promises with which coin her
landlord was not so easily satisfied she would not distress poor mr
g who owed her a hundred and fifty dollars nor mr h nor mrs i
who were all in a peck of trouble just then but were well enough to do
in the world no not she she had heard i was so good as often to lend
to people who wanted money for a few days even when the banks would
not provided they were good and safe and who was better and safer
than she with all her troubles and the lord he knew they were many
and enough she had always paid her debts and she defied anybody to
say the contrary and so she hoped i would be so good as to oblige her
with the small sum of two hundred-dollars which upon her honest word
she would pay as soon as she had the money

to this eloquent suggestion i answered and i doubt if the true abram
skinner could have answered better by lamenting her difficulties and
assuring her i was in as great trouble as herself not having a cent at
command that i could call my own the iron chest told another story
and there were divers handsome hundreds placed to my credit in three
or four different banks nevertheless i had a little money belonging
to a friend which i thought i might make so free as to lend to one of
her excellent character and standing but that would be taking a great
responsibility on my shoulders c c in terms which the reader can
easily imagine and i concluded by hinting that if she had any plate
or other valuables to deposite as a security it would save her the
trouble of giving her note and the inconvenience such an instrument
might prove to her if my friend's necessities should compel him to
throw it into the market

the widow delighted with my frankness and penetrated by my
friendliness ran home and returned with a basket of chattels to the
value of perhaps three hundred and fifty dollars

very good said i you shall have the money though i should have to
pay for it myself

sure said she but you are a good obliging man and i shall be much
beholden and sure but i thought all pawnbrokers had golden balls at
their doors

madam said i thank your good fortune that i am not a pawnbroker
had you gone to such a person you would have paid dear for your money
and perhaps lost your silver into the bargain now supposing this
silver to be worth three hundred dollars 

three hundred lack-a-daisies said the old lady why it cost more
than four hundred dollars for i remember the coffee-pot 

yes ma'am said i that was the cost of making i reckon the silver
at about three hundred dollars though that is a large allowance now
had you taken this to a pawnbroker what do you think he would have
loaned you on it

to be sure and i suppose but i can't say

one hundred dollars perhaps if a moderate fellow said i but i
am another sort of man i scorn to take any advantage of any one yes
said i feeling warm and virtuous i scorn them there fellows that
take advantage and grind down the poor to the last mite i mrs 
hum ha mrs 

mrs smith said the old lady eying me with admiration

i mrs smith will treat you in another way i will let you have
what you want the full two hundred dollars for the space of thirty
days and charge you but twenty-five dollars for the favour

sure said mrs smith and that's dear

on the contrary madam said i it is but twelve and a half per
cent a month whereas money will often fetch fifteen

will it indeed said the foolish widow and sure but you must
know better than myself well then mr skinner let me have the two
hundred dollars and you shall have the plate in pawn

no ma'am said i none but a pawnbroker can do that a gentleman
like myself does this sort of thing in another manner for were i to
receive this silver as a pawn you might prosecute me for it in court
and make me pay a fine the way we do is this i buy the plate of
you for two hundred dollars taking a receipt from you for that
amount and granting you on my part a written permission to purchase
the same back again this day month for the sum of two hundred and
twenty-five dollars

la said the old lady is that the way but what if i should not get
the money in a month

why then said i with a look of benevolence why then i think i
must give you a month longer

sure and you are the best man in the world said mrs smith and you
think my silver won't be in no danger and you'll lock it up in some
big iron chest for thieves are quite thick already and your paper to
buy again will be just as good as a pawnbroker's certificate

i hastened to satisfy the old lady's mind on this and all other
subjects i then wrote out a receipt which i caused her to subscribe
being a due acknowledgment on her part of having sold me certain
specified articles of plate after which i delivered her a paper
in which without troubling myself to make any reference to the
conveyance i covenanted to sell her the same articles at the price
mentioned before at the expiration of thirty days

with this and the two hundred dollars which i now gave her the foolish
woman departed very well satisfied and as for me i actually rubbed my
hands together with the delight of having made such a good bargain i
say again old skinner himself could not have managed the affair with
greater address than myself and young as i was in his body i felt as
much satisfaction at having overreached a silly old woman as ever a
less avaricious man felt at deluding a young one this was small game
to be sure for a man who dabbled in stocks and counted profits not
by dollars but by hundreds and thousands but as i said before abram
skinner was a man of all work who thought no gain small enough to be
despised and who cheated a single tatterdemalion with as much zeal as
he would fleece a community

the end of the bargain was this in a month's time mrs smith called
on me again but without money whereupon i spoke to her with greater
benevolence than before assured her she need not be distressed
and renewed the engagement between us by adding twenty-five dollars
the interest upon the money advanced to the sums specified in
the conveyance and covenant and the same amount i added at the
expiration of the second month and this course i intended to pursue
for two months more until the amount of interest should swell the
purchase-money to three hundred dollars after which i designed to
close the bargain and consider the silver fairly purchased

if anybody supposes i treated the old woman ill that i acted
dishonestly and even illegally in the matter all i have to say is
that i only did what abram skinner the shaver had done a thousand times
before me and what i have no doubt other worthy gentlemen of his
tribe have done after me he who rides with the devil must put up with
his driving and he who deals with his nephews must look for something
warmer than burnt fingers

the transaction with mrs smith was a sample of divers others begun
and conducted on the same principles though involving more momentous
profits the system of forfeitures as practised by a skilful hand
is applicable to all species of property and i practised it with
great effect in the case of houses and lands and the lord knows what
besides the pressure continued long and i think i should have made
a handsome fortune in the course of the winter out of this single
branch of my business alone had not destiny arrested me in the midst
of a prosperous career and left the business to be settled by my
administrators




chapter iii


reflections on stock-jobbing and other matters


but this was but a branch and a small one of my profession my
noblest blows were struck at the community at large and struck
in that most magnificent of gambling-fields the stock-market my
skill here for i inherited all the sagacity and daring that had
distinguished the original owner of my body was such as to keep me at
the head of that confraternity of which i have spoken before i was the
very devil among the fancy stocks and had the good luck to originate
and conduct a stroke of cornering by which no less than twenty young
shop-keepers who were ambitious to be seen on change and in brokers
offices and to dare that achievement of audacity selling on time
were smashed like coal-candlesticks and half as many wiser and richer
desperadoes were driven to the verge of ruin

my chief strength indeed was shown in the management of small stocks
and especially those that were good for nothing and more especially
still in southern mining-companies it was here that we of the clipping
club as the members of the fraternity delighted to call themselves
found our fairest opportunity to prey upon those passions of cupidity
and terror which lay the ignorant at the mercy of the knowing no one
knew better than myself how to get up or depress such a stock i knew
how many ignorant widows poor parsons infirm artisans and other
needy persons were to be cajoled by the prospect of handsome and
increasing dividends to invest their petty savings when it could be
done at small premiums and i knew how easily the terror of loss could
drive them out of their investments to say the truth the principal
business of myself and my brother clippers was to bob for such minnows
and it is incredible how they bite though it is only to be bitten a
few words scattered at random and still fewer uttered in confidence
were enough to send shoals of these unlucky creatures to swallow what
we thought proper to sell and a few doubts and long faces added to
the throwing away at low prices of a few dozen shares sufficed to
convert the trembling holders into sellers whenever we deemed it
advisable to buy in this way i have known a pet stock to be tossed
up and down like a ball while every ascent and downfall served the
purpose of filling the pockets of the fraternity and emptying those of
the victims

in such occupations as these passed three months of my existence
and sinner that i am i thought that they passed very honestly the
spirit of abram skinner had left such a taint of rascality in his
body that my own was thoroughly imbued with it from which i infer
that a man's body is like a barrel which if you salt fish in it
once will make fish of every thing you put into it afterward a grain
of lying or thieving or any such spicy propensity infused into the
youthful breast by a tender parent will give a scent to the spirit
for life and as this is a fact i recommend parents to take no notice
of it not supposing parents will take advice except by contraries
the passion of abram skinner destroyed every trait that had belonged
to sheppard lee and as for those i had taken from john h higginson
and i d dawkins they were lost in like manner i was abram skinner
and nothing but abram skinner i scarce remembered that i had ever been
any thing else i am free now to confess what i was not so certain of
then though i had my doubts on the matter at times namely that in
labouring so hard after lucre i was only striving to sell my soul to
the greatest advantage

idleness is said to be the root of all evil the root of much evil i
never doubted it was but my experience in the body of abram skinner
has convinced me that the industry to which a man is goaded by the
love of money is the root of much greater evil of a bigger upas
indeed than ever sprung from the bed of the sluggard the idler may
betake him to the bottle as the idler usually does and then lapse
into a reprobate which is a common consequence but at the worst his
crimes are committed at the expense of individuals the man of avarice
drinks out of his purse which intoxicates quite as deeply as the
bowl makes war upon communities preys legally upon his neighbour's
pocket and just as legally consigns his neighbour's children to want
and beggary from which it appears that he is a drunkard thief and
murderer just as naturally as the idler the latter by indulging his
propensity loses his character the former by indulging his loses
all those generous sentiments and feelings the sense of honour and
instinct of integrity upon which character should be founded the man
who enriches himself by extracting wealth from the soil and the bowels
of the earth or by the practice of any art or business which supplies
the necessaries of life or ministers to the convenience of society
makes his money virtuously and deserves to enjoy it in honour but he
who gains a fortune by the mere gambling legerdemain of speculation
by turning his neighbour's pockets wrong side out is not so much
of a christian as he supposes my honest opinion formed after much
reflection and experience is that bulls and bears are as little
likely to go to heaven as any other animals

in regard to myself i am as free to confess that my course of life
while in abram skinner's body was deserving of all reprobation i hope
that the acts i then committed may be laid to old skinner's door but
for fear of a mistake i have endeavoured to repent them as being sins
of my own committing and this course i recommend to all those good
folks who are persuaded their peccadilloes are the fault of others and
for the same reason namely lest they should be mistaken i confess
also that i had my doubts even at the time of committing them of the
righteousness of my acts and that i sometimes had bad dreams but the
fury of avarice stilled the pangs of conscience as the fury of wrath
and battle stills those of the wounded soldier having made these
admissions i will now betake me to my story

 chapter iv

the miser's children


it will scarcely be supposed that with the passion of covetousness
gnawing at my heart i had space or convenience for any other feeling
but abram skinner had loved his children and to this passion i was
introduced as well as to the other at first i was surprised that i
should bestow the least regard upon them seeing that they were no
children of mine i endeavoured to shake off the feeling of attachment
as an absurdity but could not in spite of myself i found my spirit
yearning towards them and by-and-by having lost my identity entirely
i could scarcely even when i made the effort recall the consciousness
that i was not their parent in reality

indeed the transformation that had now occurred to my spirit was more
thorough than it had been in either previous instance i could scarce
convince myself i had not been born the being i represented my past
existence began to appear to my reflections only as some idle dream
that the fever of sickness had brought upon my mind and i forgot that
i was or had been sheppard lee

yes reader i was now abram skinner in all respects and i loved his
children as he had done before me in entering his body i became as
i have mentioned repeatedly before the subject of every peculiarity of
being that marked the original possessor without which indeed the
great experiment my destiny permitted me to make of the comparative
good and evil of different spheres of existence must have been made
in vain what my prototype hated i was enforced to hate what he loved
i found myself compelled in like manner to love while moving in the
bodies of john h higginson and i d dawkins i do not remember that
i experienced any affection for anybody which happened doubtless
because these individuals confined their affections to their own
persons abram skinner on the contrary loved his children which i
suppose was owing to their being the worst children that ever tormented
a parent he loved them and so did i he pondered with bitterness over
the ingratitude of their tempers and the profligacy of their lives
and i despite all my attempts to the contrary did the same i forgot
at last that i was not their parent and my feelings showed me that i
was and i found in the anguish that attacked my spirit when i thought
of them one of the modes in which heaven visits with retribution the
worshipper of the false god of the country when the votary of mammon
has propitiated his deity let him count the children he has sacrificed
upon his altar avarice as well as wrath sows the storm only to reap
the whirlwind

i am growing serious upon this subject but i cannot help it this
portion of my history dwells on my remembrance with gloom it keeps me
moralizing over the career of my neighbours when i see or hear of a
man who is bending all his energies to the acquisition of a fortune
and is already the master of his thousands i ask what has become of
his sons or what will become of them

with the affection for the children of abram skinner that took
possession of my mind came also a persuasion exceedingly painful
that they were a triad of graceless ungrateful reprobates and what
was worse there was something whispered within me that much if not
all the evil of their lives and natures was owing to the neglect in
which their parent while engrossed with the high thought of heaping up
money had allowed them to grow up the consequences of this neglect i
felt as if it had been my own act

the first pang was inflicted by the girl alicia and i felt it
keenly not indeed that i had any particular parental affection
for her as doubtless i should have had had she not run away so
opportunely on the contrary a vague recollection of my amour and
the inconstancy of her temper caused my feelings in relation to her
to assume a very peculiar hue so that i regarded her with sentiments
due as much to the jilted lover as the injured father but what
chiefly afflicted me was the hint she had given in the postscript of
her letter warning me of the fatal call to be made upon me within
two months space to render up an account of my guardianship and
surrender into the hands of that detestable sammy wilkins my late
cousin the rich legacy of her aunt sally which being chiefly in real
estate i or rather my prototype before me had without anticipating
such a catastrophe managed so prudently that it was now worth more
than double its original value the thought filled me with such rage
and phrensy that had she been twice my daughter i should have
rewarded her with execrations

my quondam uncle mr samuel wilkins of wilkinsbury hall who it
seems received the girl as well as he afterward did his daughter's
husband thought fit to pay me a visit a week after my transformation
to confer with me on the subject and receiving no satisfaction for i
was in a rage and refused to see him sent me divers notes proposing a
reconciliation betwixt myself and his daughter-in-law and these being
cast into the fire i received in course of time a letter from his
lawyer or his son sammy's in which i was politely asked what were my
intentions in relation to settlement and so forth and so forth

i received letters from the damsel also but they went into the fire
like the others and my rage waxing higher and higher as the time of
settlement drew nigh i set myself to work to frame such a guardian's
account as would materially lessen the amount of my losses

but all was in vain the married alicia was at last of age and all i
could do was to fling the matter into the lawyers hands so as to keep
the money the dear money in my own as long as possible

my reader may think this was not a very handsome or reputable way of
treating a daughter but he must recollect i was in abram skinner's
body the matter was still in suit when i departed from my borrowed
flesh but i have no doubt the execrable samuel wilkins jr got
possession of the legacy as well as ten times as much to the back of
it

but this great as was the anguish the evil inflicted was nothing
to the pangs i suffered on account of the two boys ralph and abbot
on these i showered not openly indeed for i was crabbed enough of
temper but in my secret heart all the affection such a parent could
feel but i showered it in vain the seeds of evil example and neglect
had taken root the prospect of wealth had long since turned brains
untempered by education and moral culture and the parsimony of their
parent only drove them into profligacy of a more demoralizing species
they were ruined in morals in prospects and in reputation and while
yet upon the threshold of manhood they presented upon their brows the
stamp of degradation and the warrant of untimely graves

the younger abbot had evidently been a favourite from his childhood
up his temper being fierce and imperious yet with an occasional dash
of amiableness that showed what his disposition might have been if
regulated by a careful and conscientious parent he possessed a fine
figure of which he was vain and being of a gay and convivial turn
there was the stronger propensity to dissipation and greater fear of
the consequences these were now lamentable enough he was already
beyond redemption a sot and almost a madman

the elder brother was a young man to all appearance of a saturnine
mood and staid habits but this was in appearance only he was the
associate of the junior in all his scenes of frolic and an actor in
others of which perhaps abbot never dreamed a strong head and a
spirit of craft enabled him to conceal the effect of excesses which
sent his brother home reeling and raging with drunkenness i knew his
habits well and i knew that besides being in a fairer way to the
grave if not to the gallows he was a hypocrite of the worst order
his gravity being put on to cover a temper both fiery and malicious
and his apparent correctness of habits being the mere cover to the most
scandalous irregularities he was a creature all of duplicity and wo
to the father who made him such

the scene in the dying chamber of their father they never forgot
though perhaps i might have done so it drove the younger from all
attempts at pretended regard or concealment of his profligacy and
was i believe the cause of his final ruin he absconded out of mere
shame for a week and then returned to put a bold or indifferent
face upon the matter and to show himself as regardless of respect as
restraint

the other after concealing himself in like manner for a few days came
to me apparently in great contrition of spirit and almost persuaded
me that his brutal conduct on that eventful evening arose rather from
grief than joy he had been so much affected by my death he assured
me as scarce to know what he did when swallowing a glass of brandy
his brother gave him that he declared with half a dozen tears had
set him crazy and he knew not what he had done only he recollected
something about going to the chamber where he believed he had
behaved very badly for which he begged my forgiveness and hoped i
would not think his conduct was owing to any want of affection

i had proof enough that the villain was telling me falsehoods and i
knew that if either should in a moment of soberness and compunction
breathe a single sigh over my death-bed he was not the one in
truth they were both bad both perhaps irreclaimable but while
the conduct of abbot gave me most pain that of ralph filled me with
constant terror nothing but the daily excitement of speculation and
gain could have made tolerable an existence cursed by incessant griefs
and forebodings it may be supposed that i frequently took the young
men to task for their excesses i might as well have scolded the winds
for blowing or the waters for running it is true that ralph heard me
commonly with great patience and sometimes with apparent contrition
but at times a scowl came over his dark features that frightened me
into silence and once giving way to his fierce temper he told me
that if there was any thing amiss or disreputable in his conduct it
was the consequence of mine that i instead of granting him the means
for reasonable indulgence and elevating him to the station among
honourable and worthy men to which my wealth gave him a claim and
which he had a right to expect of me had kept him in a state of need
and vassalage intolerable to any one of his age and spirit

as for abbot this kind of recrimination was a daily thing with him
i scarce ever saw him except when inflamed with drink and on such
occasions he was wont to demand money which being denied he would
give way to passion and load me with reproaches still more bitter of
spirit and violent of expression than those uttered by ralph nay upon
my charging him with being an abandoned profligate and ruined man he
admitted the fact and swore that i was the author of his destruction
that my niggardliness had deprived him of the opportunities that gave
other young men professions and independence that i had brought him up
in idleness and ignorance and by still refusing him his rights was
consigning him to infamy and an early grave

such controversies between us were common and perhaps expedited the
fate that was in store for him as well as his brother i thought in my
folly to punish and at the same time check his excesses by denying
him all supplies of money and by refusing to pay a single debt he
contracted a deep gloom suddenly invested him he ceased to return
home intoxicated but stalked into and out of the house like a spectre
without bestowing any notice upon me the change frighted me and in
alarm lest the difficulties under which he might be placed were driving
him to desperation i followed him to his chamber with almost the
resolution to relieve his wants let them be what they might

the absence of intoxication for several days in succession had induced
me to hope he had broken through the accursed bondage of drink were it
only from rage and shame but i was fatally mistaken as i entered the
apartment i saw him place upon the table a large case-bottle of brandy
which he had just taken from a buffet he looked over his shoulder as
i stepped in and without regarding me proceeded to pour a large
draught into a tumbler his hand was tremulous and indeed shook so
much that the liquor was spilt in the operation

i was shocked at the sight and struck dumb seeing which he laughed
with what seemed to me as much triumph as derision and said you see
this is the way we go it your health father come help yourself
don't stand on ceremony

i abbot said i as he swallowed the vile potion have you
neither respect nor shame i never drank such poison in my life

the more is the pity muttered the young man but rather as if
speaking to himself than me i should have had the sooner and freer
swing of it

you mean if it had killed me as it is killing you said i pierced
by the heartlessness of his expression oh abbot a judgment will
come upon you yet

he stared me in the face but without making a reply then pushing a
chair towards me he sat down himself and deliberately filled his
glass a second time

abbot for heaven's sake said i wringing my very hands in despair
what will tempt you to quit this horrid practice

nothing said he you have asked the question a month too late
look he continued pointing my attention again to his hand shaking
as it held the bottle as if under the palsy of age do you know what
that means

what does it mean said i so confounded by the sight and his stolid
merriment for he laughed again while exposing the fruit of his
degrading habit that i scarce knew what i said

it means said he that death is coming to make equitable division
betwixt ralph and alicia unless the devil after all should carry
them off before me in which case you can build an hospital with your
money

he swallowed the draught and then leaning on the table buried his
face between his hands

the sarcasm was not lost upon me and the idea that he was about to
become the victim of a passion from which he might be wrested by a
sacrifice on my part greatly excited my feelings

i will do any thing said i what shall i do to save you oh
abbot can you not refrain from this dreadful indulgence what shall i
do

he leaped upon his feet and eyed me with a look full of wildness

pay my debts he cried pay my debts and make me independent and
i i'll try

and what said i trembling with fear what sum will pay your debts

twenty thousand perhaps said he

twenty thousand what twenty thousand dollars cried i lost in
confusion

you won't then said the reprobate

not a cent cried i in a fury how came you to owe such a sum do
you think i will believe you how could you incur such a debt what
have you been doing

gambling drinking and so forth and so forth twenty times over

he snatched up the bottle and locking it in the buffet deposited the
key in his pocket then seizing upon his hat and stepping to where i
stood transfixed with grief and indignation he said you won't
take the bargain then

not a dollar not a dime not a cent said i

not even to save my life father

not a dollar not a dime not a cent i reiterated incapable of
saying another word

farewell then said he and good luck to you it is a declaration of
war and now i'll keep no terms with you

then giving me a look that froze my blood it was so furiously hostile
and vindictive he struck his hands together rushed from the house
and i saw him no more for nearly a fortnight i saw him no more as i
said but coming home the following evening from the club i found my
strong-box broken open and rifled of the money that i left in it

the sum was indeed but small but the robbery had been perpetrated by
my own son and the reader if he be a father will judge what effect
this discovery produced upon my mind in good truth i felt now that
i was the most wretched of human beings and was reduced nearly to
distraction

but this blow was but a buffet with the hand compared with the
thunder-bolt that fate was preparing to launch against my bosom i
cursed my miserable lot yet it wanted one more stroke of misfortune to
sever the chain with which avarice still bound me to my condition




 chapter v


the fate of the firstborn


on the eleventh day after the flight of abbot whom all my inquiries
failed to discover as i was walking towards the exchange torn by
my domestic woes and by a threatened convulsion in stocks which
concerned me very nearly i met one of my companions of the club who
noting my disturbed countenance drew me aside and told me he was
sorry i had got my foot into the fire but the club had last night
taken the matter into consideration and agreed to stand by me if it
were possible

all this was heathen greek to me and i told my friend i was in no
trouble i knew of and wanted no countenance from anybody

i am very glad to hear it said he but what are you doing with so
much paper in the market that's no good sign you'll allow

i started aghast and he proceeded to inform me that he had himself
seen two of my notes for considerable amounts and had heard of others
and finally that he had just parted with the president an intimate
friend of his of a bank not a furlong off who had asked divers
questions as to the state of my affairs and admitted there was paper
of mine at that moment in the bank

i was seized with consternation assured him all such notes must be
forgeries and running with him to the bank demanded to see any paper
they had with my name to it they produced two different notes for
large amounts which i instantly declared to be counterfeit and then
ran in search of others

the hubbub created by this declaration was great but the tumult in my
mind was greater a horrid suspicion as to the author of the forgeries
entered my soul and i became so deadly sick as to be unable to
prosecute the inquisition further my friend deposited me in a coach
and i was carried to my home but in a condition more dead than alive
my suspicions were in a few hours dreadfully confirmed by my friend
who returned with the intelligence which he had acquired the forger
was discovered and arrested it was the elder brother ralph skinner

words cannot paint the agony with which i flew to the magistrate's
office and beheld the unfortunate youth in the hands of justice
but what was my horror to discover the extent and multiplicity of
his frauds the number of forgeries he had committed in his parent's
name was indeed enormous and it seems he had committed them with the
intention of flying for many of his guilty gains were found secreted
on his person but even after so much had been recovered the residue
to be refunded was appalling the thought of making restitution drove
me almost to a phrensy while the idea of seeing him carried to jail
to meet the doom of a felon was equally distracting my misery was
read on my face and some one present perhaps with a motive of
humanity cried out

why persecute the young man here is his father who acknowledges the
notes to be genuine

ah said the magistrate does he so why then we have had much
foolish trouble for nothing

i looked at the amount of the forgeries a list of which some one put
into my hands

it is false i cried i will not pay a cent

i cast my eyes upon ralph he reached over a table behind which he
stood and waved his hand to and fro as if had he been nigh enough
he would have buffeted me on the face his look was that of a demon
and he spat the foam from his lips as if to testify the extremity of
hatred

let him go i cried i will pay it all

you can undoubtedly do so if you will said the magistrate who had
marked the malice that beamed from the visage of the young man but do
not dream that that will discharge the prisoner from arrest or from
the necessity of answering the felony of which he now stands accused
before a court and jury the extent of the forgeries and the temper
displayed by the accused are such that he must and shall abide the
fruits of his delinquency he stands committed officer remove him

i heard no more my brain spun round and round and i was again carried
insensible to my miserable dwelling




 chapter vi


the catastrophe of a tragedy often performed on the great stage of life


it may be supposed that the misery now weighing me to the earth was
as much as could be imposed upon me but i was destined to find and
that before the night was over that misery is only comparative and
that there is no affliction so positively great that greater may not
be experienced in the dead of the night when my woes had at last
been drowned in slumber i was roused by feeling a hand pressing upon
my bosom and starting up i saw for there was a taper burning on a
table hard by a man standing over me holding a pillow in his hand
which the moment i caught sight of him he thrust into my face and
there endeavoured to hold it as if to suffocate me

the horror of death endowed me with a strength not my own and the
ruffian held the pillow with a feeble and trembling arm i dashed it
aside leaped up in the bed and beheld in the countenance of the
murderer the features of the long missing and abandoned son abbot
skinner

his face was white and chalky with livid stains around the eyes and
mouth the former of which were staring out of their orbits in a manner
ghastly to behold while his lips were drawn asunder and away from his
teeth as in the face of a mummy he looked as if horror-struck at
the act he was attempting and yet there was something devilish and
determined in his air that increased my terror to ecstasy i sprang
from the bed threw myself on the floor and grasping his knees
besought him to spare my life there seemed indeed occasion for all my
supplications his bloated and altered visage the neglected appearance
of his garments and person and a thousand other signs showed that the
whole period of his absence had been passed in excessive toping and
the murderous and unnatural act which he meditated manifested to what a
pitch of phrensy he had brought himself by the indulgence as i grasped
his knees he put his hand into his bosom and drew out a poniard a
weapon i had never before known him to carry at the sight of which i
considered myself a dead man but the love of life still prevailing i
leaped up and ran to a corner of the room where i mingled adjurations
and entreaties with loud screams for assistance he stood as if rooted
to the spot for a moment then dropping his horrid weapon he advanced
a few paces clasped his hands together fell upon his knees and burst
into tears and all the while without having uttered a single word but
now my cries still continuing he exclaimed but with a most wild and
disturbed look father i won't hurt you and pray don't hurt me

by this time the housekeeper barbara having been alarmed by my
outcries came into the chamber and her presence relieving me of the
immediate fear of death i gave vent to the horror that his unnatural
attempt on my life justly excited and thus made the woman acquainted
with his baseness

the poor old creature who had always loved him was greatly affected
especially when in reply to my reproaches he began to talk
incoherently admitting the fact one instant attempting to justify
it by preferring some strange and incoherent complaint and the next
assuring me in the most piteous manner that he would do me no harm
to barbara's upbraidings he replied with a like inconsistency and when
she reproached him for meditating violence at such a moment while i
was mourning the baseness of his brother he paid little attention to
what she said seeming not only ignorant of ralph's delinquency but
apparently indifferent to it

for this reason i began to fear his brain was touched of which
indeed i had soon the most fatal proof for barbara having led him
to his chamber came back assuring me that he was going mad that
his mind was already in a ferment and in a word that that horrible
distraction which sooner or later overtakes the confirmed drinker
was lighting the torch in his brain that could only go out with life
itself a physician was sent for our fears were but too just and
before dawn the miserable youth was raving distracted

the day that followed was one of distraction not only to the wretched
abbot but to myself and i remember it as a confused dream the
only thing that dwells on my recollection apart from the outcries
in abbot's chamber and the tumult in my own heart is that some one
who owed me a sum of money due that day came and paid it into my
hands with great punctiliousness and that i received and wrote the
acquittance for it with as much accuracy as if nothing were the matter
though my thoughts were far from the subject before me

at eleven o'clock at night a messenger came to me from the prison
and his news was indeed frightful the wretched ralph had just been
discovered with his throat cut from ear to ear having made way with
himself in despair

a few moments after i was summoned to the death-bed of his brother

i shall never forget the horror of that young man's dissolution he
lay at times the picture of terror gazing upon the walls along
which in his imagination crept myriads of loathsome reptiles with
now some frightful monster and now a fire-lipped demon stealing out
of the shadows and preparing to dart upon him as their prey now he
would whine and weep as if asking forgiveness for some act of wrong
done to the being man is most constant to wrong the loving the
feeble the confiding and anon seized by a tempest of passion the
cause of which could only be imagined he would start up fight foam
at the mouth and fall back in convulsions once he sat up in bed and
looking like a corpse began to sing a bacchanalian song on another
occasion after lying for many minutes in apparent stupefaction he
leaped out of bed before he could be prevented and uttering a yell
that was heard in the street endeavoured to throw himself from the
window

but the last raving act of all was the most horrid he rose upon his
knees with a strength that could not be resisted caught up his pillow
thrust it down upon the bed with both hands and there held it with
a grim countenance and a chuckling laugh none understood the act but
myself no other could read the devilish thoughts then at work in his
bosom it was the scene enacted in the chamber of his parent he was
repeating the deed of murder he was exulting in imagination over a
successful parricide

in this thought he expired for while still pressing upon the pillow
with a giant's strength he suddenly fell on his face and when turned
over was a corpse he gave but a single gasp and was no more

the horror of the spectacle drove me from the chamber and i ran to
my own to fall down and die when the blessed thought entered my
mind that the wo on my spirit the anguish the distraction were
but a dream that my very existence as the miser and broken-hearted
father was a phantasm rather than a reality since it was a borrowed
existence and that it was in my power to exchange it as i had done
other modes of being for a better i was sheppard lee not abram
skinner and this was but a voluntary episode in my existence which i
was at liberty to terminate

the thought was rapture i resolved to sally out and fasten upon the
first body i could find being certain i could be in none so miserable
as i had been in that i now inhabited nay the idea was so agreeable
the execution of it seemed to promise such certain release from a load
of wretchedness that i resolved to attempt it without even waiting for
morning

i seized upon my hat and cloak and for fear i might stumble into some
poor man's body as i had done in the case of dawkins's i opened my
strong-box and clapped into my pockets all the money it contained
designing to take precautionary measures to transfer it along with my
spirit to the new tenement i seized upon the loaned money that had
been repaid that day together with a small sum that had been in the
box before and had there been a million in the coffer i should have
nabbed it all without much question of the right i actually possessed
in it the whole sum was small not exceeding four hundred dollars all
being in bank-bills i should have been glad of more but was too eager
to exchange my vile casing with its miseries for a better to think
of waiting till bank-hours next day

taking possession therefore of this sum and a dozen silver spoons
that had been left in pledge a few days before i hastened to put my
plan into execution i slipped down stairs let myself out of the door
as softly as if i had been an intruder and set out in a night of
february to search for a new body




 chapter vii


in which it is shown that a man may be more useful after death than
while living



the reflection that i possessed the power already thrice successfully
exercised to transfer my spirit whenever i willed it from one
man's body to another and so get rid of any afflictions that might
beset me was highly agreeable and under the present circumstances
consolatory but there was one drawback to my satisfaction and that
was a discovery which i now made that men's bodies were not to be
had every day at a moment's warning this was the more provoking
as i knew there was no lack of them in the world between eighty and
ninety thousand men women and children having given up the ghost in
the natural way that very day whose corses would be on the morrow
consigned to miserable holes in the earth where they could and would
be of no service to any person or persons whatever the young doctors
only excepted

and here i cannot help observing that it is an extremely absurd
practice thus to dispose of to squander and throw away as i may call
it the hosts of human bodies that are annually falling dead upon our
hands whereas with the least management in the world they might be
converted into objects of great usefulness and value

according to the computation of philosophers the population of the
world may be reckoned in round numbers at just one thousand millions
of which number the annual mortality at the low rate of three in
a hundred is thirty millions and that without counting the extra
million or two knocked on the head in the wars let us see what benefit
might be derived from a judicious disposition of this mountain of
mortality i say mountain for it is plain such a number of bodies
heaped together would make a chimborazo the great mass of mankind
might be made to subserve the purpose for which nature designed them
namely to enrich the soil from which they draw their sustenance
according to the economical chinese method each of these bodies could
be converted into five tons of excellent manure and the whole number
would therefore produce just one hundred and fifty millions of tons
of which one hundred and fifty thousand being their due proportion
would fall to the share of the united states of america enabling
our farmers in the course of ten or twelve years to double the
value of their lands this therefore would be a highly profitable
way of disposing of the mass of mankind such a disposition of their
bodies would prove especially advantageous among american cultivators
in divers districts as a remedy against bad agriculture and as
the only means of handing down their fields in good order to their
descendants such a disposition of bodies should be made upon every
field of victory so that dead heroes might be made to repair some
of the mischiefs inflicted by live ones the english farmers it is
well known made good use of the bones left on the field of waterloo
and though they would have done much better had they carried off the
flesh with them they did enough to show that war may be reckoned a
good as well as an evil and a great battle looked upon as a public
blessing a similar disposition to continue the subject of their
mortal flesh might be with great propriety required in this land
of all politicians and office-holders from the vice-president down to
the county collector who being all patriots would doubtless consent
to a measure that would make them of some use to their country as for
the president we would have him reserved for a nobler purpose we
would have him boiled down to soap according to the plan recommended
by the french chymists to be used by his successor in scouring the
constitution and the minds of the people

in this manner i repeat the great bulk of human bodies could be
profitably appropriated but other methods should be taken with
particular classes of men who might claim a more distinguished and
canonical disposition of their bodies the rich and tender would esteem
it a cruelty to be disposed of in the same way with the multitude i
would advise therefore that their bodies should be converted into
adipocire or spermaceti to be made into candles to be burnt at the
tops of the lamp-posts whereby those who never shone in life might
scintillate as the lights of the public for a week or two after their
bones might be made into rings and whistles for infant democrats to
cut their teeth on

the french and italian philosophers as i have learned from the
newspapers have made sundry strange and as i think useful
discoveries in relation to the practicability of converting the human
body into different mineral substances one man changes his neighbour's
bones into fine glass a second turns the blood into iron while a
third more successful still transforms the whole body into stone if
these things be true and i have no reason to doubt them seeing that
i found them as i said before in the newspapers they offer us new
modes of appropriation applicable to the bodies of other interesting
classes lovers might thus be converted into jewels which although
false could be worn with less fear of losing them than happens with
living inamoratos or in case of extreme grief on the part of the
survivers into looking-glasses where the mourners would find a solace
in the contemplation of their own features the second process namely
the conversion of blood into iron would be peculiarly applicable in
the case of soldiers too distinguished to be cast into corn-fields
and indeed nothing could be more natural than that those whose blood
we buy with gold should pay us back our change in iron the last
discovery could be turned to equal profit and would do away with the
necessity of employing statuaries in all cases where their services are
now required but i would confine the process of petrifaction to those
in whom nature had indicated its propriety by beginning the process
herself none could with greater justice claim to have their bodies
turned into stone than those whose hearts were of the same material
and i should propose accordingly that such a transformation of bodies
should be made only in the case of tyrants heroes duns and critics

but this subject though often reflected on i have had no leisure to
digest properly for which reason begging the reader's pardon for the
digression i shall now leave it and resume my story




 chapter viii


sheppard lee's search for a body an uncommon incident


i was provoked i say to think there were so many millions of dead
bodies thrown away every year for which i in the greatest of my
difficulties should be none the better such was the extremity
to which i was reduced that i should have been content to change
conditions with a beggar

it was a night in february the day had been uncommonly fine with a
soft southern air puffing through the streets the frost was oozing
from the pavement and the flags i beg their pardon the bricks were
floating in the yellow mud so that one walked as if upon a foundation
of puddings such had been the state of things in the day such also as
late as at nine o'clock p m

but it was now eleven the wind had chopped round to the northwest and
northeast and perhaps some half a dozen other points beside for it
seemed to blow in all directions and the thermometer was galloping
downward towards zero a savage snow-storm had just set in and with
such sharp and piercing gusts of wind and such fierce rattling of
hail that had not my mind been in a ferment i should have hesitated
to expose myself to its fury but i reflected that i was flying from wo
and terror and the hope of diving into some body that might introduce
me to a life of sunshine rendered me insensible to the rigours of the
tempest

having stumbled about in the snow for a while i began to inquire of
myself whither i was going and the answer or rather the want of an
answer somewhat confounded me where was i to look for a dead body
at such a time of night it occurred to me i had better refer to a
newspaper and see what persons had lately died in town and were yet
unburied i stepped accordingly into a barber's shop that happened
to be open and snatched up an evening paper the first paragraph i
laid my eyes on contained an account of the forgeries of my son ralph
skinner it was headed unheard-of depravity and it blazoned in
italics and capitals the crime the unnatural crime of committing
frauds in the name of a father

the shock with which i beheld the fatal publication renewed my horror
and sharpened my desire to end it i threw down the paper without
consulting the column of obituaries and ran towards the hospital
where it appeared to me i should certainly find one or more bodies
which the doctors had no longer occasion for but my visit was at
a highly unseasonable hour and the porter being knocked out of a
comfortable nap got up in an ill humour whose cow's dead now i
heard him grumble from his lodge i wonder people can't break their
necks by daylight

but my neck was not broken and he listened to my eager
inquiry whether there were no dead bodies in the house with rage
and indignation

i tell you what mister said he we takes no mad people in here
except they comes the regular way

and with that he shut the door in my face leaving me to wonder at his
want of civility

but the air was growing more frigid every moment and the hour was
waxing later and later i ran to the alms-house not doubting as that
was a more democratic establishment that i should be there received
with greater respect but good-breeding is not a whit more native to a
leather shirt than to a silk stocking my cerberus here was cut from
the same flint as the other his civility had been learned in the same
school and his english studied from the same grammar

i tell you what uncle barebones said he without waiting to be
questioned we takes no paupers here except they comes with an order

and so saying he slapped to the door with an energy that dislodged
from the roof of his den a full hundred weight or more of snow which
fell in my face and had wellnigh smothered me

the case began to look desperate but the difficulty of finding what i
wanted only rendered my wits more active i resolved to run to one of
the medical schools make my way into its anatomical repositories and
help myself to the best body i could find for indeed i was in such a
rage of desire to be released from my present tenement that i did not
design to stand upon trifles

i set out accordingly with this object in view but fate willed i
should seek my fortune in another quarter

the storm had by this time begun to rage with uncommon violence
the winds were blowing like so many buglers and trumpeters on a
militia-day and the snow that had already fallen was whisked up
every moment from the ground and driven back again into the air to
mingle in contention with that which was falling the atmosphere was
thickened or rather wholly displaced by the whirling particles so
that in a short time the wayfarer could neither see nor breathe in
the white chaos around him it was in truth a savage inclement
night the watchman betook him to his box to snooze away the hours in
comfort the lamps went out being of a spirit still more economical
than their founders and thinking with great justice that the streets
which could do with them could do equally well without them the dogs
were no longer heard yelping at the corners and the pigs the only
spectres of philadelphia that run squeaking and gibbering up and down
the streets in the night to vanish at early cock-crowing provided the
hog-catchers are in commission were one by one retreating to their
secret strongholds leaving the street to solitude the snow-storm and
me

i plodded on as well as i could and with such effect that after a
quarter hour's trudging i knew not well whither i stopped at last
i knew as little where instead of being in the heart of the city as
i supposed i found myself somewhere in the suburbs wedged fast in a
snow-drift one single lamp and one single wick of that single lamp
had escaped the puffs of the tempest it shone from aloft through the
rack of snow like a fire-fly in a fog dividing its faint beam betwixt
my frozen visage and a low open shed hard by the only objects beside
itself that were visible

i perceived that i was lost and being more than half dead with cold i
dragged myself into the shed to shelter me from the fury of the storm
and lament the ill fate that attended my efforts

as i stepped into the wretched hole i stumbled over a man lying coiled
up on the ground and so exposed to the air that his legs were already
heaped over with snow there was just light enough to discern a black
jug lying broken at his side from which arose the odour of corn-juice
but by no means of the true monongahela savour

i was struck by the fellow's appearance he had evidently been lying
there all the evening the stumble i had made over him did not disturb
him in the least and my hand chancing to touch his face i found it
could as marble i perceived he was dead a discovery that filled me
with uncommon joy for my eagerness to change my condition was such
that i only saw in him a body to be taken possession of without
reading in the broken jug and the miserable corner in which its victim
had breathed his last the newer wretchedness and degradation upon
which i was rushing such is the short-sightedness of discontent such
the folly of the man who deems himself the unluckiest of his species

with a trembling hand i thrust into the pockets of the corse the money
and the silver spoons i had brought with me being so far prudent that
i was resolved not to trust the transfer of such valuables to my new
body to accident this being accomplished i uttered the wish that had
thrice served my turn before

i wished however in vain i muttered the charm a dozen times over
but with no more effect than if i had pronounced it to the lamp-post
the body lay unmoved and i remained unchanged

i became horribly disconcerted a fear seized me that my good angel if
i had ever had one had deserted me or that the devil if it was from
him i derived my power of passing from body to body had suddenly left
me in the lurch in a word that i had consumed all my privileges of
transformation and was chained to the body of abram skinner for life

i beat my breast in despair and then changing from that to wrath i
began to belabour the ribs of the dead man with all the strength of my
foot as if he were answerable for my disappointment perhaps indeed
the reader will think that he was for at the third kick the corpse
became animated and to my astonishment rose upon its feet saying in
accents tolerably articulate though somewhat thick and tumultuous
i say charlie odd rabbit it none on your jokes now and none on
your takin of folks up cause how folks is not half so drunk as you
suppose and so good night and let's have no more words about it and
i'll consider you werry much of a gentleman

with these words the corpse picked up that fragment of the jug that had
the handle to it leaving the others as well as his hat behind him
and staggering out of the shed he began to walk away i was petrified
he was stalking off with my money and a dozen of mrs smith's silver
spoons

you villain said i running after him give me back my property

i'm a free man said the sot i'm no man's property and so
charlie don't go for to disturb me for i knows my way home as well as
anybody

but the four hundred dollars and the silver spoons said i seizing
him by the shoulders and endeavouring to empty the pockets i had but a
moment before filled if you resist you rogue i'll put you in jail

i won't go to jail for no charlie in the liberty said the man of
the jug who to the last moment seemed to have no other idea than
that he had fallen into the hands of a guardian of the night and was
in danger of being introduced to warmer quarters than those he was
leaving he spoke with the indignation of a freeborn republican who
felt his rights invaded and was resolute to defend them and lifting
up the fragment of his jug he suddenly bestowed it upon my head with
such good-will that i was felled to the earth he took advantage of my
downfall to decamp carrying with him the treasure with which i had so
bountifully freighted him i pursued him as well as i could calling
upon the watch for assistance and shouting murder and robbery at the
top of my voice but all was in vain the watch were asleep or i had
wandered beyond their jurisdiction and after a ten minutes chase i
found myself more bewildered than before and the robber vanished with
his plunder




 chapter ix


in which the author makes the acquaintance of a philanthropist


i should have cursed my simplicity in mistaking a drunkard for a dead
man but i had other evils to distress me besides chagrin i was lost
in a snow-storm fainting with fatigue shivering with cold and afar
from assistance there not being a single house in sight it was in
vain that i sought to recover my way i plunged from one snow-bank into
another and i believe i should have actually perished had not succour
arrived at a moment when i had given over all hopes of receiving it

i had just sunk down into a huge drift on the roadside where i lay
groaning unable to extricate myself when a man driving by in a chair
hearing my lamentations drew up and demanded in a most benevolent
voice what was the matter

who art thou friend said he and what are thy distresses if thou
art in affliction peradventure there is one nigh at hand who will
succour thee

i am said i the most miserable wretch on the earth

heaven be praised said the stranger with great devoutness of
accent for in that case i will give thee help and the night shall
not pass away in vain yea verily i will do my best to assist thee
for it is both good and pleasant a comeliness to the eye and a
refreshment to the spirit to do good deeds among those who are truly
wretched

and besides said i i am sticking fast in the snow and am
perishing with cold

be of good heart and hold still for a moment and i will come to thy
assistance

and with that honest broadbrim for such i knew by his speech he must
be descended from the chair and helped me out of the drift all which
he accomplished with zeal and alacrity showing not more humanity as
i thought than satisfaction at finding such a legitimate object for
its display he brushed the snow from my clothes and perceiving i was
shivering with cold for i had lost my cloak some minutes before he
transferred one of his own outer garments of which i believe he had
two or three to my shoulders plying me all the time with questions
as to how i came into such a difficulty and what other griefs i might
have to afflict me and assuring me i should have his assistance

hast thou no house to cover thy nakedness he cried verily i will
find thee a place wherein thou shalt shelter thyself from snow and
from cold art thou suffering from lack of food verily there is a
crust of bread and the leg of a chicken yet left in my basket of cold
bits and thou shalt have them with something further hereafter hast
thou no family or friends verily there are many humane persons of my
acquaintance who will like myself consider themselves as thy brothers
and sisters art thou oppressed with years as well as poverty verily
then thou hast a stronger claim to pity and it shall be accorded thee

he heaped question upon question and assurance upon assurance with
such haste and fervour that it was some minutes before i could speak
i took advantage of his first pause to detail the latest and at that
moment the most oppressive of my griefs

i have been robbed i cried of four hundred dollars and a dozen
silver spoons by a rascal i found lying drunk under a shed but i'll
have the villain if it costs me the half of his plunder and 

be not awroth with the poor man said my deliverer it was a
wickedness in him to rob thee but thou shouldst reflect how wickedness
comes of misery and how misery of the inclemency of the season be
merciful to the wicked man as well as to the miserable for thereby
thou showest mercy to him who is doubly miserable but how didst thou
come by four hundred dollars and a dozen silver spoons thou canst not
be so poor as to prove an object of charity

no said i i am no beggar but i won't be robbed for nothing

verily i say unto thee again be not awroth with the poor man thou
shouldst reflect if thou wert robbed how far thou wast thyself the
cause of the evil for having four hundred dollars about thee thou
mightst have relieved the poor creature's wants in which case thou
wouldst have prevented both a loss and a crime the one on thy part
the other on his talk not therefore of persecuting the poor man
hunt him up if thou canst administer secretly to his wants and give
him virtuous counsel and then peradventure he will sin no more

i was struck by the tone and maxims of my deliverer they expressed an
ardour of benevolence an enthusiasm of philanthropy such as i had
never dreamed of before i could not see his face the night being
so thick and tempestuous but there was a complacency a bustling
self-satisfaction in his voice that convinced me he was not only a
good but a happy man i regarded him with as much envy as respect
and a comparison which i could not avoid mentally making betwixt his
condition and my own drew from me a loud groan

art thou hurt said the good samaritan i will help thee into my
wheeled convenience here and take thee to thy home

no said i i will never go near that wretched house again

what is it that makes it wretched said the quaker

you will know if you are of philadelphia i replied when i tell
you my name i am the miserable abram skinner

what abram skinner the money-lender said my friend with a severe
voice friend abram i have heard of thy domestic calamities and
verily i have heard of those of many others who laid them all at
thy doors as the author and cause thereof thou art indeed the most
wretched of men but if thou thinkest so thyself then is there a hope
thou mayst be yet restored to happiness thou hast made money but
what good hast thou done with it thou hast accumulated thy hundreds
and thy thousands and thy tens of thousands but how many of thy
fellow-creatures hast thou given cause to rejoice in thy prosperity
truly i have heard much said of thy wealth and thy avarice friend
abram but verily not a word of thy kind-heartedness and charity and
know that goodness and charity are the only securities against the
ills both sore and manifold that spring from groaning coffers i say
to thee friend abram hast thou ever given a dollar in alms to the
poor or acquitted a single penny of obligation to the hard-run of thy
customers

my conscience smote me not however that i felt any great remorse
for not having thrown away my money in the way the quaker meant but
his words brought a new idea into my mind it was misery on the one
hand and the hope of arriving at happiness on the other which had
spurred me from transformation to transformation each change had
however been productive of greater discontent than the other and the
woes with which i was oppressed in my three borrowed bodies had been
even greater than those that afflicted me in my own proper original
casing it was plain that i had not exercised a just discretion in the
selection of bodies since i had taken those of men whose modes of
existence did not dispose to happiness what mode of existence then was
most likely to secure the content i sought such i inferred from the
quaker's discourse as would call into operation the love of goodness
and of man such as would cause to be cultivated the kindly virtues
unknown to the selfish such as would lead to the practice of charity
and general philanthropy i was grieved therefore that i had entered
so many bodies for nothing my conscience accused me of a blunder and
i longed to enter upon an existence of virtue not that i had any great
regard for virtue itself but because i valued my own happiness had my
deliverer chanced to break his neck while discoursing to me i should
have reanimated his corse to try my hand at benevolence as for being
good and charitable in the body i then occupied i felt that it was
impossible the impulse pointed to another existence

the quaker's indignation soon abated he looked upon my silence as the
effect of remorse and the idea of converting me into an alms-giver and
a friend of the poor like himself took possession of his imagination
and warmed his spirit by such a conversion his philanthropic desires
would be doubly gratified it would make me happy and as i was
a rich man some hundreds of others also he helped me into the
chair and driving slowly towards the city attempted the good work
by describing the misery so prevalent in the suburbs and dilating
with uncommon enthusiasm upon the delight with which every act of
benevolence would be recorded in my own bosom

it seems that he was returning from a mission of charity in one of
the remotest districts where he had relieved the necessities of
divers unhappy wretches and he gave me to understand it was his
purpose to make one more charitable visitation before returning home
notwithstanding the lateness of the hour and the fury of the tempest
and this visit he felt the more urged to make since it would afford a
practical illustration of his remarks and show how doubly charity was
blessed both to the giver and receiver

thou shalt see said he even with thine own eyes what power he
that hath money hath over the afflictions of his race what power to
dry the tear of the mourning and to check the wicked deeds of the
vicious he that i will now relieve is what thou didst foolishly call
thyself to wit the most miserable of men for he is both a beggar and
a convicted felon having but a few days since been discharged from the
penitentiary where he had served out his three years for i believe
the third time in his life

surely said i he is then a reprobate entirely unworthy pity

on the contrary said the philanthropist he is for that reason the
more to be pitied since all regard him with distrust and abhorrence
and refuse him the relief without which he must again become a
criminal the very boys say to him get up thou old jail-bird and
men and women hoot at him in the streets poverty made him a criminal
and scorn has hardened his heart yet is he a man with a soul and
verily thou shalt see how that soul can be melted by the breath of
compassion in this little hovel we shall find him said the quaker
drawing up before a miserable frame building which was of a most
lonely aspect and in a terrible state of dilapidation the windows
being without shutters and glasses and even the door itself half torn
from its hinges

it is a little tenement that belongeth to me said my friend and
here i told him he might shelter him until i could come in person and
relieve him a negro-man whom i permitted to live here for a while
did very ungratefully that is to say very thoughtlessly destroy
the window-shutters and other loose work for fire-wood i having
forgotten to supply him with that needful article and he poor man
being too bashful to acquaint me with his wants verily i do design to
render it more comfortable but in these hard times one cannot find
more money than sufficeth to fill the mouths of the hungry descend
friend abram and let us enter i see the poor man hath a fire shining
through the door this will warm thy frozen limbs while the sound
of his grateful acknowledgments will do the same good office for thy
spirit




 chapter x


containing an affecting adventure with a victim of the law


my benevolent friend leaving his horse standing at the door led the
way into the hovel the interior of which was still more ruinous than
the outside it consisted of but a single room below with a garret
above a meager fire which furnished the only light was burning on
the hearth to supply which the planks had been torn from the floor
leaving the earth below almost bare there was not a single article
of furniture visible save an old deal table without leaves a broken
chair and a tattered scrap of carpet lying near the fire which seemed
to have served as both bed and blanket to the wretched tenant

how is this said the friend in surprise verily i did direct my
man abel to carry divers small comforts hither which have vanished as
well as the poor man john smith

john smith it seems was the name of the beneficiary and that
convinced me he was a rogue i ventured to hint to our common friend
that john smith having disposed of those small comforts he spoke of
to the best advantage was now engaged seeking others in some of our
neighbours houses and that the wisest thing we could do in such a
case would be to take our departure

verily said my deliverer with suavity it is not possible john can
do the wicked things thou thinkest of for first it is but three days
since he left the penitentiary and secondly i sent him by my helper
and friend abel snipe sufficient eatables to supply him a week so
that he could have no inducement to do a wicked thing still it doth
surprise me that he is absent nevertheless we will tarry a little
while lest peradventure he should return and be in trouble with none
to relieve him it wants yet ten minutes to midnight continued the
benevolent man drawing out a handsome gold watch and five of these
at least we can devote to the poor creature

i was about to remonstrate a second time when a step was heard
approaching at a distance in the street

peradventure it is john himself said my friend and peradventure it
will be better thou shouldst step aside into yonder dark corner for an
instant that thou mayst witness without restraining by thy presence
the feelings of virtue that remain in the spirit even when tainted and
hardened by depravity

i crept away as i was directed to a corner where i might easily
remain unobserved the room being illumined only by the fire and that
consisting of little besides embers and ashes from this place i saw
mr john smith as he entered which he declined doing until after he
had peeped suspiciously into the apartment and been summoned by the
voice of his benefactor

he was as ill-looking a dog as i had ever laid eyes on and his
appearance was in strange contrast with that of his benevolent patron
the latter was a tall and rawboned man of fifty with an uncommonly
prepossessing visage rather lantern-jawed perhaps but handsome and
good-natured the other was a slouch of a fellow short of stature
but full of fat and brawn with bow legs gibbon arms and a hang-dog
visage he sidled up to the fire hesitatingly and indeed with an air
of shame and humility while the philanthropist laying his watch upon
the table extended his hand towards him

be of good heart friend john he said i come not to reproach thee
for thy misdeeds but to counsel thee how thou shalt amend them and
restore thyself again to the society of the virtuous

es sir grumbled john smith dodging his head in humble
acknowledgment rubbing his hands for warmth over the fire and
casting a sidelong look at his benefactor werry good of you sir
shall ever be beholden werry hard times for one what's been in the
penitentiary takes away all one's repurtation and lord bless us
sir a man's but a ruined man when a man hasn't no repurtation

and with that worthy john drew his sleeve over his nose which
convinced me he was not so much of a rascal as i thought him

john thou hast been but as a sinner and a foolish man

es sir said john with another rub of his sleeve at his nose but
hard times makes hard work of a poor man always hoped to mend and be
wirtuous but lord bless us mr longstraw beg pardon can't think of
making so free to say friend to such a great gentleman one can't be
wirtuous with nothing to live on

verily thou speakest in a measure the truth said my friend
and i intend thou shalt now be put in some way of earning an honest
livelihood

es sir said john and sure i shall be werry much beholden

but it is not my intention to record the conversation of the worthy
pair i am writing a history of myself and not of other people and
i therefore think it proper to pursue no discourses in which i did
not myself bear a part it is sufficient to say that my deliverer
said a thousand excellent things in the way of counsel which the
other received very well and many indicative of a disposition to be
charitable which mr john smith received still better and in the end
to relieve the pressing wants of the sufferer which mr john smith
feelingly represented drew forth a pocketbook and took therefrom a
silver dollar at the sight of which i thought mr john smith looked
a little disappointed nay it struck me that the appearance of the
pocketbook ancient and ill-looking as it was had captivated his
imagination in a greater degree than the coin i had before observed
him steal several affectionate looks towards the gold watch lying on
the table which now however the sight of the well-thumbed wallet
seemed to have driven from his thoughts entirely nevertheless he
received the silver dollar with many thanks and with still more the
assurance that the philanthropist would procure him employment on the
morrow and mr longstraw's eyes as he turned to beckon me from the
corner began to twinkle with the delight of self-approbation

i was myself beginning to feel a sentiment of pleasure and to picture
to my mind the unfortunate felon converted by a few words of counsel
and still fewer dollars of charity into an honest and worthy member of
society when oh horror of horrors the repenting convict suddenly
snatched up a brand from the fire and discharged it with a violence
that would have felled an ox full upon the head of his patron

the sparks flew from the brand over the whole room and my friend
dropped upon the floor on his face followed by the striker who
seizing upon his cravat twisted it tightly round the unfortunate man's
throat thus completing by strangulation the murder more than half
accomplished by the below

the whole affair was the work of an instant and had i possessed
the will or courage to interfere i could not have done so in time
to arrest the mischief but in truth i had not the power to stir
horror and astonishment chained me to the corner where i stood as if
transformed to stone unable even to vent my feelings in a cry i was
seized with a terrible apprehension on my own account for i could
not doubt that the wretch who would thus murder a benefactor for a
few dollars would have as little hesitation to despatch me who had
witnessed the deed i feared every moment lest the villain should
direct his eye to the corner in which i stood separated from him only
a few yards but he was too busy with his horrid work to regard me
and terrified as i was i looked on in safety while my deliverer was
murdered before my eyes

how long mr john smith was at his dreadful work i cannot say but i
saw him after a while relax his grasp from his victim's throat and
fall to rummaging his pockets then leaping up he seized upon the
watch and clapped it into his bosom saying with a most devilish
chuckle and grin

damn them ere old fellers what gives a man a dollar and preaches
about wirtue i reckon old slabsides there's none on your people will
hang me for the smash much beholden to you for leaving the horse and
chair it makes all safer

with these words the wretch slipped out of the hovel and a moment
after i heard the smothered roll of the vehicle as it swept from the
door


 chapter xi


in which the plot thickens and the tragedy grows deeper


i supposed that mr john smith had taken himself away with as much
speed as was consistent with the strength of his horse and the safety
of his bones and i recovered from the fears i had entertained on my
own account i crept up to the philanthropist to give him assistance
if such could be now rendered but it was too late he was already
dead mr john smith had not taken his degrees without proper study
in his profession and i must say that his practice on the present
occasion did not go far to confirm me in the love of benevolence

nevertheless the appearance of the defunct threw my mind into a
ferment i had been hunting a body and now i had one before me i had
come to believe that if i wished for happiness i must get possession
of one whose occupant had previously been happy and i had seen enough
of the deceased to know that he had been an uncommonly comfortable and
contented personage

the end of all this was a resolution which i instantly made to
take advantage of the poor man's misfortune and convert his body
to my own purposes i had seen him for the first time that night i
did not remember ever to have heard his name mentioned before and i
consequently knew nothing of him beyond what i had just learned where
he lived who were his connexions what his property c c were
all questions to which i was to find answers thereafter it appeared
to me that a philanthropist of his spirit and age the latter of which
i judged to be about fifty could not but be very well known and that
all i should have to do after reanimating his body would be to seek
the assistance of the first person i should find and so be conducted
at once to the gentleman's house after which all would go well enough
but in truth i took but little time for reflection or perhaps i
should not have been in such a hurry to attempt a transformation a
little prudence might have led me to inquire into the consequences of
the change inferred from the condition of the body suppose his scull
should prove to be broken who was to stand the woes of trepanning i
do say it would have been wiser had i thought of that but unluckily
i did not i was in too great a hurry to think of any thing save the
transformation itself and the result was that i had a lesson on the
demerits of leaping before looking which i think will be of service to
me for the remainder of my life as it might be to the reader could
the reader be brought to believe that that experience is good for any
thing which costs nothing

my resolution was quickened by a step which i heard approaching along
the street it is a watchman thought i to myself i will jump into
the body and run out for assistance

i turned to the defunct

friend longstraw said i or whatever your name is if you are
really dead i wish to occupy your body

that moment i lost all consciousness the reader may infer the transfer
of spirit was accomplished

and so it was i came to my senses a few moments after just in time
to find myself tumbling into a hole in the earth beneath the floor of
the hovel with mr john smith hard by dragging to the same depository
the mortal frame i had just deserted i perceived at once the horrible
dilemma in which i was placed i was on the point of being buried and
what was worse of being buried alive

i conjure and beseech thee friend john smith i cried but cried no
more the villain had just reached the pit dragging the body of the
late abram skinner he was startled at my voice but it only quickened
him in his labours he snatched up the corse and cast it down upon me
as one would a millstone and the weight though that was not very
considerable and the shock together jarred the life more than half
out of me

what old slabsides said he ar'n't you past grumbling

with that the bloody-minded miscreant seized upon a fragment of plank
and began to belabour me with all his strength

i had entered the philanthropist's body only to be murdered i uttered
a direful scream but that was only a waste of the breath which mr
john smith was determined to waste for me he redoubled his blows with
a vigour that showed he was in earnest nor did he cease until his work
was completed in a word he murdered me and so effectually that it
is a wonder i am alive to tell it he assassinated me and even began
to bury me by tumbling earth down from the floor when as my good
fate would have it the scene was brought to a climax by the sudden
entrance of a watchman who running up to the villain served him the
same turn he had served me by laying a leaded mace over his head and
so knocking him out of his senses

it seems for i scorn to keep the reader in suspense by indulging in
mystery that this faithful fellow having made a shorter nap than
was warranted by the state of the night had taken a stroll into the
air to look about him that he had passed the hovel and seeing the
chair standing at the door had looked through a crack and perceived
mr longstraw with whose person and benevolent character he was
acquainted and myself that is my late self warming ourselves by the
convict's fire and that after pursuing his beat for a while he was
about to return by another way when to his surprise he lighted upon
the vehicle at more than a square's distance from the house and the
horse being tied to a post it was evident he had not strayed thither
this awaking a suspicion that all was not right he determined to pay
a second visit to the hovel and was on the way thither when i set up
the scream mentioned before then quickening his pace he arrived in
time to witness the awful spectacle of mr john smith thrusting the two
bodies into the pit which operation the courageous watchman brought to
a close by knocking the operator on the head as i have related

what had brought mr john smith back again and why he should have
troubled himself to conceal the victim of his murderous cupidity must
be conjectured as well as the amazement with which doubtless he
found he had two bodies to bury instead of one he perhaps reflected
that the visit of his patron was known to other persons who upon
finding his body would readily conjecture who was the murderer and
therefore judged it proper to conceal the evidence of assassination
and leave the fate of his benefactor in entire mystery

as it happened his return had wellnigh proved fatal to me and it
was any thing but happy for himself it caused him to take up his
lodgings for a fourth time in the penitentiary and there he is sawing
stone i believe to this day unless pardoned out by the governor of
pennsylvania according to the practice among governors in general
the visitation was however thus far advantageous to me that it
caused me to be conducted to the dwelling of mr longstraw with all
due expedition and care whereas had it not happened i might have
remained lying on the floor of my miserable tenement until frozen to
death for the night was uncommonly bitter

as for my late body it found its way to abram skinner's mansion
whence having been handsomely coffined it was carried to the grave
which but for me it would have filled three months before




book v


containing the adventures of a good samaritan



 chapter i


the philanthropist's family


if my first introduction to the life of the philanthropic zachariah
longstraw for that was his name was attended with circumstances of
fear and danger i did not thereby escape those other evils which as
i hinted before might have been anticipated had i reflected a moment
on the situation of his body it was covered with bruises from head to
foot and there was scarce a sound bone left in it so that as i may
say i had in reanimating it only exchanged anguish of spirit for
anguish of body and which of these is the more intolerable i never
could satisfactorily determine philosophers indeed contend for the
superior poignancy of the former but i must confess a leaning to the
other side of the question what is the pain of a broken heart to that
of the toothache the poets speak of vipers in the bosom what are
they compared to a bug in the ear be this however as it may it is
certain i had a most dreadful time of it in mr longstraw's body and
it would have been much worse had not the blows i had received on the
head kept me for a long time in a delirium and therefore in a measure
unconscious of my sufferings the truth is the body which i so rashly
entered was in such a dilapidated condition so bruised and mangled
that it was next to an impossibility to restore its vital powers and
it was more than two weeks after lying all that time in a state of
insensibility more dead than alive before i came to my senses and
remembered what had befallen me and it was not until four more had
elapsed that i was finally able to leave my chamber and snuff the
early breezes of spring

as soon as i began to take notice of what was passing about me i
perceived that i lay in a good though plainly-furnished chamber and
that besides the physicians and other persons who occasionally bustled
around me there were two individuals so constantly in attendance
and so careful and affectionate in all their deportment that i did
not doubt they were members of my new family indeed i had no sooner
looked upon their faces and heard their voices than i felt a glow of
satisfaction within my spirit which convinced me they were my very
dear and faithful friends and that i loved them exceedingly

they were both young men the one perhaps of twenty-five the other
six or seven years older both were decked in quaker garments the
elder being uncommonly plain in his appearance wearing smallclothes
shoe-buckles and a hat with a brim full five inches wide which he
seldom laid aside these gave him a patriarchal appearance highly
striking in one of his youth which was much increased by an uncommon
air of gravity and benevolence beaming from his somewhat swarthy and
hollow visage

the younger had no such sanctimonious appearance there was a janty
look even in the cut of his straight coat he had a handsome face and
seemed conscious of it he swung about the room at times with a strut
that excited his own admiration and any three moments out of five he
might be seen before the looking-glass surveying his teeth inspecting
the sweep of his shoulders and brushing up his hair with his fingers
his plain coat was set at naught by a vest and trousers of the most
fashionable cut and pattern he had a gold guard-chain worn abroad
and his watch which in all likelihood was gold also was stuck in
his vest-pocket in the manner approved of by bucks and men of the
world instead of being deposited according to the system of the wise
in a fob over the epigastrium and to crown his list of vanities he
had in his shirt a breastpin which he took care to keep constantly
visible containing jewels of seven or eight different colours it
was manifest the young gentleman if a quaker as his coat showed him
to be was quite a free one and indeed the first words i heard him
utter which were also the first that i distinguished after rousing
from my long sleep of insensibility set the matter beyond question i
saw him peer into my face very curiously and directly heard him call
out to his companion i say snipe by jingo uncle zack's beginning
to look like a man in his senses

these words imparted a sensation of pleasure to my breast but i felt
impelled to censure the young man for the freedom of his expressions
my tongue however seemed to have lost its function and while i was
vainly attempting to articulate a reprimand the other rushed up and
giving me an earnest stare seized upon one of my hands which he fell
to mumbling and munching in a highly enthusiastic manner crying out
with inexpressible joy and fervour blessed be the day and does thee
open thee eyes again verily this shall be a day of rejoicing and
not to me only the loving abel snipe but to thousands does thee
feel better zachariah my friend and patron verily the poor man
that has mourned for thee shall be now as one that rejoices for thee
shall again speak to him the words of tenderness and open the hand of
alms-giving yea verily and the afflicted shall mourn no more

these words were even more agreeable than those uttered by the junior
and i experienced a feeling of displeasure when the latter suddenly
cut them short by exclaiming come snipe none of thee confounded
nonsense i reckon uncle zack has had enough philanthropy for the
season and don't thee go to humbug him into it any more thee has made
thee own fortune and should be content

verily friend jonathan said the fervent abel snipe addressing the
junior but still tugging at my hand thee does not seem to rejoice
at thee uncle's recovery as thee should but thee jokes and thee jests
sha'n't make my spirit rejoice the less

verily said jonathan so it seems but if thee tugs at uncle zack
in that way and talks so loud thee will do his business

verily said abel 

and verily said jonathan interrupting him thee will say it is
thee business to do his business which is very true but not in
the sense of murder so let us hold our tongues and do thou uncle
zachariah he added addressing me keep thyself quiet and take this
dose of physic

it was unspeakable how much my spirit was warmed within me by this
friendly contest between the two young men and by their looks of
affection i longed to embrace them both but had not the strength
and indeed it was three or four days more before i felt myself able
or was allowed by the physicians to indulge in conversation

at the expiration of that period i found myself growing stronger the
twenty thousand different pangs that had besieged my body from the
crown of my head to the sole of my foot whenever i attempted to move
were less racking and poignant and waking from a slumber that had
been more agreeable than usual and finding no one near me save the
ever faithful abel snipe i could no longer resist the impulse to speak
to him

abel snipe said i

blessed be thee kind voice that it speaks again said abel snipe
devouring my hand as before and blubbering as he devoured

thy name is abel snipe said i

verily and surely it is abel snipe and no other said he i hope
thee don't forget me

why really said i i can't exactly say friend abel seeing that
there has a confusion come over my brain but art thou certain i am no
longer abram skinner

at this question abel snipe's eyes jumped half out of his head and
they regarded me with wo and horror i saw he thought my wits were
unsettled and i hastened to remove the impression

don't be alarmed friend abel but of a verity i think i was killed
and buried

yea said abel yea verily the vile ungrateful malicious john
smith did smite thee over the head with a club so that the bone was
broken and thee was as one that was dead but oh the villain we have
him fast in jail and oh the unnatural rascal we'll hang him

verily said i feeling uncommon concern at the idea we will do no
such wicked deed but we will admonish the poor man of the wickedness
of his ways and relieving his wants discharge him from bondage

yea said abel snipe with an air of contrition so will we do as
becometh the merciful man and christian but verily the flesh did
quarrel with the spirit and the old adam cried out to me blood for
blood and the thing that is flesh said vengeance on the wicked man
that smote the friend of the afflicted but now thy goodness reproves
me and teaches me better things wherefore i say be not hard with the
miserable man for such is the wicked and such is john smith who is
now mourning over his foolish acts in the county prison yea verily
we will be exceeding lenient and so forth and so forth

i do not think it needful to repeat all the wise and humane things
said by abel snipe they convinced me he was the most benevolent of
beings and warmed a similar spirit that was now burning in my breast
and which burnt on until it became at last a general conflagration of
philanthropy yea the transformation was complete i found within
me on the sudden a raging desire to augment the happiness of my
fellow-creatures and wondered that i had ever experienced any other
passion the generous abel discoursed to me of the thousands i that
is my prototype the true zachariah had rescued from want and
affliction and of the thousands whom i was yet to relieve my brain
took fire at the thought and i exulted in a sense of my virtue i
perceived in imagination the tear of distress chased away by that
of gratitude i heard the sob of sorrow succeeded by the sigh of
happiness and the prayer of beseeching changed to the prayer of praise
and thanksgiving a gentle warmth flowed from my bosom through the
uttermost bounds of my frame and i felt that i was a happy man yea
reader yea and verily i was at last happy my only affliction was
that the battered condition of my body prevented my sallying out at
once and practising the noble art of charity the tears sprang into my
eyes when abel recounted the numbers of the miserable who had besieged
my doors during my two weeks of insensibility crying for assistance

why didst thou not relieve them abel snipe i exclaimed

verily said abel turning his eyes to heaven with a look of fervent
rapture i did relieve the sorrowing and destitute even to the
uttermost penny that was in my pocket blessed be the deed for i have
not now a cent that i can call my own as for thine zachariah it
became me not to dispense it without thy spoken authority the more
especially as thy nephew jonathan did hint and vehemently insist
that thou hadst bestowed too much already for thy good and his

these words filled me with concern and displeasure

surely said i the young man jonathan is not averse to deeds of
charity

verily said abel clasping his hands and looking as if he would
have wept the excellent and beloved youth doth value money more than
the good which money may produce and of that good he esteemeth chiefly
the portion that falleth to his own lot of a surety i do fear he hath
an eagerness and hankering a fleshly appetite and an exceeding strong
desire after the things of the world he delighteth in the vanity of
fine clothes and his discourse is of women and the charms thereof
he hath bought the picture of a french dancing-woman and hung it in
his chamber swearing for he hath a contempt for affirmation that
it is a good likeness of the maiden ellen wild and yesterday i did
perceive him squeaking at a heathenish wind-instrument called a flute
and thereupon he did avow an intention to try his hand at that more
paganish thing of strings called a fiddle and oh what grieved me
above all and caused the spirit within me to cry avaunt and get thee
away jonathan he did offer me a ticket of the cost of one dollar
to procure me admission into the place of sin and vanity called the
theatre swearing by jingo and by gemini there was great fun
there and offering to lend me a coat hat and trousers so that the
wicked should not know me yea verily the young man is as a young
lion that roameth up and down as a sheep that wandereth from the
pinfold into the forbidden meadows and as for charity peradventure
thee will not believe me but he averred the only charity he believed
in was that which began at home

these confessions of the faithful abel in relation to the young man
jonathan caused my spirit to wax sorrowful within me but it is
fitting before pursuing such conversations further that i should
inform the reader who the faithful abel and the young man jonathan
were

the latter as abel himself informed me was my or if the reader
will my prototype's nephew the only and now orphan son of a
sister who had married as the phrase is out of meeting and dying
destitute left her boy to the charge of the benevolent zachariah
who being himself childless adopted him as his son and heir and had
treated him as such from his childhood up the great wish of zachariah
was to make the adopted son a philanthropist like himself in which
however he was destined to disappointment for jonathan was of a wild
and worldly turn fond of frolic and amusement and extremely averse to
squander in works of charity the possessions he designed applying in
future years to his own benefit nevertheless he was greatly beloved
by his uncle and i who was imbued with that uncle's spirit and
destined to love and abhor what he had loved and abhorred whether i
would or not soon began to regard him as one of the two apples of my
eyes




 chapter ii


some account of the worthy abel snipe


the faithful abel snipe it seems his history was told me by
jonathan was a man whom zachariah some years before while playing
the howard in a neighbouring sovereignty had found plunged in deep
distress and making shoes in the penitentiary to this condition he
had been reduced by sheer goodness for being an amateur in that
virtuous art of which zachariah was a professor and having no means
of his own to relieve the woes of the wretched he had borrowed from
the hoards of his employers the president and directors of a certain
stock-company in whose office he had a petty appointment and thus
perforce made charitable an institution that was chartered to be
uncharitable he committed the fault however of borrowing without
the previous ceremony of asking either because he was of so innocent
a temper as to think such a proceeding unnecessary or because he knew
beforehand that the request would not be granted and the consequence
was that the president and directors as aforesaid did very
mercilessly hand him over to the prosecuting attorney the prosecuting
attorney to a grand jury the grand jury to a petit jury the petit
jury to a penitentiary and the penitentiary to the devil or such
at least would have been the ending of the unfortunate amateur had
not the philanthropist who always ordered his shoes for charity's
sake at the prison been struck with the uncommon excellence of a pair
constructed by abel's hands

he sought out the faithful maker for sure a man must be faithful to
make a good pair of shoes in a penitentiary was melted by his tale
of wo even as the wax through which abel was then drawing a bunch of
ends was melted by the breath thereof and shedding tears to find the
poor creature's virtue so shabbily rewarded ran to the prosecutors
with a petition which he induced them to sign transmitted it to the
governor with a most eloquent essay on the divine character of mercy
and in less than a week walked abel snipe out of prison a pardoned
man

the charity of the professor did not end with abel's liberation
enraptured with the fervour of his gratitude touched by the
artlessness of his character and moved by the destitution to which a
pardon in the winter-time exposed him he carried him to his own land
and house fed clothed and employed him upon a new pair of shoes
and discovering that he had talents for a nobler business advanced
him in time to the rank of accountant or secretary collector of
rents dispenser of secret charities and in general factotum and
fiduciary at large such a servant was needed by the humane zachariah
his philanthropy left him no time to attend to his own affairs and his
nephew jonathan had fallen in love and become incompetent to their
management

never was experiment more happy for subject and object abel snipe
was made an honest and useful man and zachariah longstraw obtained a
friend and servant without price the gratitude of abel was equal to
his ability humility fidelity and religion were the least of his
virtues he became a philanthropist like his master he managed his
affairs with such skill that zachariah had always pennies at hand
for the unfortunate which it seems had not always happened before
and what was equally charming the zealous abel dived into every
lane alley and gutter to discover new objects of charity for his
patron to crown all he felt moved in the spirit to profess the faith
so greatly adorned by his protector and after due preparation and
probation appeared in the garb of peace and humility and even went so
far as to hold forth once at meeting

in a word abel snipe was a jewel of the first water who supplied
the place of the idle jonathan in all matters of business and almost
in the affections of his kinsman if not equally beloved he was more
highly esteemed and his shining worth consoled the philanthropist for
many of the derelictions of his nephew he became the confidant the
coadjutor and the adviser of zachariah and zachariah never found
occasion to lament the be nevolence that had redounded so much to his
own advantage




 chapter iii


in which the young man jonathan argues several cases of conscience
which are recommended to be brought before yearly meeting



my nephew jonathan had no great love for poor abel and he did not tell
me his story without passing sundry sarcasms on him as well as myself
for bestowing so much confidence on the poor unfortunate man i rebuked
the youth for his freedom and uncharitableness and remembering what
abel had told me of his own idle and trifling course of life i felt
impelled by the new spirit of virtue that possessed me to take him
to task which i did in the following manner and it is wondrous how
completely and how soon for i was yet lying on my back groaning with
my unhealed wounds and bruises my spirit assumed and acted upon all
that was peculiar in the nature of zachariah longstraw

nevvy jonathan said i the uncharitableness of thy spirit afflicts
me trouble not thyself to censure the worthy abel snipe but think
how thou shalt amend thine own crying faults it has been said to me
jonathan my son and verily i fear it is true that thou squeakest
upon flutes and that thou makest profane noises with fiddles and
furthermore that thou runnest after and dost buy the vanity of
pictures and triest thy hand at painting the same

i do said jonathan and i find nothing against them in the
scripture

verily said i but dost thou find nothing against them in thine own
spirit

not a whit said jonathan my heart says love them and my head
approves the counsel where's the harm in these things i know thee
don't say they are in themselves sinful

verily no said i but they are indirectly so for being wholly
useless the time bestowed upon them is time lost and wasted and that
nevvy jonathan i think thee will allow to be sinful

not i said jonathan stoutly i don't believe the wasting of time
to be any such heinous matter as thee supposes had it been so man
would not have been made to waste a third of his existence in slumber
but granting this for the sake of argument i deny thy premises
uncle zachariah the time bestowed upon these things is not wasted
heaven has given to nine men out of ten a capacity to enjoy both music
and painting it has done more it has set an example of both before
our eyes and thus laid the foundation of the divine arts in nature
what is the world around us but a great concert-hall echoing with the
music of bird and beast of wind water and foliage what but a great
gallery of pictures painted by the hand of providence nature is a
painter nature is a musician and her sons can do nothing better
than follow her example but were nature neither it is not the less
evident that these arts are lawful and sinless they can be proved so
uncle zachariah upon thine own system of philanthropy for they add
to the happiness of our existence and they do so without corrupting
our morals or injuring our neighbours i say uncle quoth jonathan
who had pronounced this defence with much enthusiasm and now concluded
with a grin of triumph i have thee there dead as a herring

verily said i more pleased than offended at the young man's
ingenuity for my spirit yearned over him the more at every word thee
has a talent for argument which i would thee would cultivate for then
thee could get into the assembly and finally perhaps into congress
and do much good to thy fellow-men by reforming divers crying abuses

verily said he the first thing i should reform would be thy
philanthropy

don't be funny nevvy said i for i have not done with thee thee
was dancing last night in the house of the vain man ebenezer wild

i was said jonathan i was shaking my legs and i can't see the
harm of it for the flies do the same thing all day long

verily thee should remember that a reasonable being that hath a
brain should rather exercise that than his heels

i grant thee said jonathan but thee knows brains are not so
abundant as heels and thee should expect the mass of people to conduct
according to their endowments

jonathan said i if thee thinks to make me laugh thee is mistaken
of a verity i will not be rigid with thee but verily i must speak to
thee of what i hold thy faults thou hast a vain and eager hankering
after the society of giddy women

i have said jonathan with great fervour heaven made women to be
loved and i love them especially ellen wild

sure said i i have heard that name

sure said jonathan it would be odd if thee had not for thee knows
her well thine old friend ebenezer's daughter

a giddy girl jonathan i fear me a giddy girl

as giddy as the dev that is as giddy as a goose said jonathan

what said i thee meant something worse verily i have heard thee
uses bad language jonathan

by jingo said the youth indignantly there is no end to the
slanders people will say of one i use bad language by jingo

why thee is at it now said i let thy yea be yea and thy nay nay
for all beyond is profanity or folly but thee will allow jonathan
that when thee is among the people of the world thee uses the language
thereof forgetting the language of simplicity and sobriety which
would best become thy lips

ay there i plead guilty and with good reason too said jonathan
when i was a boy thee had thoughts of making me a merchant and thee
compelled me to study french and german now when i meet a frenchman
or a german unacquainted with the english tongue in what language does
thee suppose i address him

why french or german to be sure

verily i do said the youth and when i get among the people of the
world i speak to them in the language of the world for poor ignorant
creatures they don't understand quaker moreover uncle does thee
know ellen wild is of opinion we friends don't speak good grammar now
she and i spent a whole hour the other evening trying to parse thee
is thee does thee loves and so on and we could not work
them according to murray i say uncle does thee know of any command
in scripture to speak bad grammar

no said i but it is not forbidden and the phrases mentioned thou
knowest have crept into our speech as corruptions and are only used
for conversational purposes

truly said jonathan and the language of the world is used for
conversational purposes also i say uncle zachariah that now's a
clincher

i won't quarrel with thee on this account jonathan but how comes it
thou wert seen in that wicked place the theatre

by jingo said he snipe has been blabbing there too

what said i does thou strive to conceal it

yea said jonathan for when we do our good deeds we should do them
in secret uncle zachariah i went to the theatre in charity

thee did said i charmed more than i can express at the thought of
the young man's virtue

yes uncle said the youth and great need have the actors of
charity for a poorer set of fellows i think i never saw got together
and here the rogue fell a laughing in my face and so thee need not
distress thyself for i sha'n't go there again until they get a better
company but uncle zachariah thee has exhorted me enough for one
time and it is my turn now so do thou be conformable and answer my
questions for i can tell thee i have a fault to find with thee
according to thine own system of philanthropy it is thy duty to make
thy fellow-creatures happy now i ask thee whether thou dost not
think it thy duty to make me thy loving nephew happy as well as a
stranger

verily said i i do

why then said jonathan there is a short way of doing it uncle
zachariah i want to be married ellen and i have talked the matter
over and she says she'll have me now uncle thee did once talk of
giving me a counting-house and ten or twenty thousand dollars as the
case might be to begin a commission business and mr wild talked
of doing as much in the way of dowry to ellen and now i say uncle
zachariah as the shipwrecked sailor did when he prayed among the
breakers if thee means to help me now's the time

what said i have i so much property

thee is joking said the youth thee is a rich man and thee knows
thee can afford it but thee must do it soon or it may be too late
for i can tell thee folks begin to talk of thy philanthropy and say
thou art flinging away so much money that presently thou wilt have
nothing left to give me mr wild is of this mind and he has hinted
some things to me very plainly in a word uncle if thee does not
permit me to marry ellen soon he will break the match and so if thee
will make me a happy man 

i will said i with uncommon fervour thee shall marry the maiden
and i will straightway see what i can do for thee verily what is
wealth but the dross of the earth unless used to purchase happiness
for those that are worthy

at these words jonathan leaped for joy seized my hand and kissed it
vowed i was his dear old dad for all i was only his uncle and ran
from the room doubtless to impart the happy tidings to his mistress




 chapter iv


containing little or nothing save apostrophes exhortations and
quarrels



how happy was i to think i had conferred happiness upon another how
agreeable my sensations how delightful the approbation of my own
heart how much i rejoiced that my soul had at last found a habitation
equal to its wishes an abode of peace a dwelling of content if i am
zachariah longstraw said i to myself i will show myself worthy of
the name i will spend his money in the great cause of philanthropy i
will make the afflicted smile i will win the blessings of the poor
i will do more good than even zachariah longstraw himself yea of a
surety i will devote myself to a life of virtue

while i was making these virtuous resolutions the faithful abel snipe
came to my bedside and told me there were divers suffering creatures
widows with nine small children widowers with fourteen sick old
women and starving old men in great need of relief and so affecting
was the picture he drew of their griefs that the tears rolled from my
eyes and i bade him if there was any money he could honestly lay his
hands on carry comfort to them all

verily said he i have just collected the quarter's rent of the
house in market-street and it will be enough and more

relieve the poor afflicted creatures then and hark thee abel
snipe does thee consider me a rich man if so let me know where i
can find twenty thousand dollars to set up the young man jonathan in
business and marry him to the maiden ellen wild

alas said abel snipe of a verity the young man is in a hurry and
alas for of a verity if thee takes away at this time such a great
sum from thee possessions thee will cut off the right hand of thee
charity

and thereupon the benevolent creature after showing me which it was
easy to do that with the mere revenue of the sum demanded if kept
in our own hands we could carry smiles and rejoicing into at least a
hundred families every year exhorted me not to forget that i was the
friend of the afflicted nor to faint in the good work of philanthropy
jonathan was a very young man he said only twenty-five happy in
his youth happy in his affections happy in the certain prospect
he enjoyed of sooner or later arriving at the fullest felicity
why should he not then consent like us to forego for a while his
selfish desires contribute his portion to the wants of the poor
and by labouring a few years in their cause approve himself worthy
of fortune how much better that he should endure a fancied ill than
that a hundred afflicted families should be given up to actual want he
contended that the young man's request was untimely and selfish and
that i would only harden his heart while breaking a thousand others
if i granted it in short he said so many things and painted so many
affecting pictures of the miseries of my fellow-creatures and the
beauties of charity that my mind was quite changed on the subject and
i perceived it was my duty to resist the young man's wishes

this change on the morrow being the first day that i was able to sit
up i explained to jonathan exhorting him with a feeling enthusiasm
to tear all narrow selfish feelings from his heart and embark with
me like a virtuous youth in the great enterprise of philanthropy
he fell into a passion told me my philanthropy was a fudge and abel
snipe a rogue and hypocrite vowed i had a greater regard for knaves
and paupers than for my own flesh and blood and was flinging away my
money only to encourage vice and beggary it was in vain i sought to
pacify the indignant youth an evil spirit seized upon him he did
nothing for three days but scold reproach and complain he abused
the faithful abel to his face calling him a fox viper cormorant
harpy and i know not what beside all which abel endured with patience
and resignation for he was of a meek and humble spirit nay not
content with this he proceeded on the third day to greater lengths
and did very intemperately fall upon the said abel snipe tweaking
him by the nose and ears until the poor man yelled with pain and
even endeavoured to kick him out of the house after which being
censured for the same and i siding with abel as justice demanded in
the controversy his resentment grew to such a pitch that he left the
house declaring he would live with me no longer but leave me to ruin
myself at my leisure

this was an occurrence that caused me much pain for verily i had an
exceeding great love for the young man and i perceived that he was
treating me with ingratitude i was however greatly comforted by the
increased zeal and affection of the ever-faithful abel who coming to
me with tears in his eyes declared that he could not bear the thought
of being a cause of dissension between me and my nephew and therefore
besought me that i would discard him from my presence when i could
again live happily with my jonathan

i resisted while duly appreciating the good man's friendship and
fortunately there needed no such sacrifice on my part for on the
eleventh day jonathan returned of his own accord and confessing his
folly and entreating abel's forgiveness as well as mine was restored
again to favour his return itself was grateful to my feelings but
the reader may judge how great was my rapture when jonathan avowed
a change in his sentiments on the subject of philanthropy and
declared that the spirit at last moved him to think of his suffering
fellow-creatures he entreated to be conducted to the abodes of
affliction and there the conversion was completed he became a changed
man and in a few days was almost as zealous an alms-giver as myself i
took him to my arms and said 

now jonathan thee is a man in whom i no longer fear the seductions
of the flesh thee shall marry the maid ellen and be set up in
business

nay said jonathan not so i am yet but as a youth in years and
the time sufficeth for all things let not the whirl of business and
the joy of the honey-moon disturb the virtue that is yet young and
frail in my bosom of a verity ellen wild will wait till the fall and
if she don't and my heart should be broken verily i shall then be
better enabled to sympathize with the wretched

such was the lofty though new-born virtue of my jonathan

but of that as well as our works of benevolence i shall speak in the
following chapters




 chapter v


which is short and moral and can therefore be skipped


i have already said that the mere presence of the philanthropic
feeling now infused into my spirit filled me with happiness even
while i lay upon my back aching with wounds and bruises it may be
inferred therefore that my soul was ecstasy itself when restored at
last to health and strength i stalked into the air dispensing charity
with both hands

of a verity it was at least for a time and i will say that
during the first month of my new existence i experienced a thousand
agreeable sensations such as had never occurred to me in my whole life
before and here let me observe that if what i have to add shall
show that there are offsets of inconvenience and tribulation even
to the satisfaction of the benevolent i do not design to throw any
discredit on the virtue of benevolence itself which i truly regard
as one of the divinest of endowments angelic in its nature and
blessed in its effects when practised with discretion and amiable
if not lovely even in its folly i believe indeed that if heaven
looks with peculiar indulgence on the errors of any man it is in
the case of him who has the softest judgment for the errors and the
readiest reparation for the miseries of his fellows what i wish to
be understood is that man is an unthankful animal and of such rare
inconsistency of temper that he seldom foregoes an opportunity to
punish the virtue which he so loudly applauds

i was now a philanthropist and i will say which i think i may do
without shame the merit being less attributable to me than to that
worthy deceased personage whose body i inhabited that a truer
purer or more zealous one never walked the earth i should fill a
book as big as a family bible were i to record all the good things
i did or attempted while a tenant in zachariah longstraw's body
all my feelings and desires were swallowed up in one great passion
of philanthropy universal benevolence was the maxim i engraved upon
my heart i had no thought but to relieve the distresses meliorate
the condition and advance the happiness of my species my generosity
extended equally to individuals and communities i toiled alike in the
service of the beggar and the million putting bread into the mouth of
the one and infusing moral principles into the breasts of the others
in a word i was as i have called myself already a philanthropist
and if my virtue was somewhat excessive in degree it proceeded from
the sincerest promptings of spirit




 chapter vi


an inconvenience of being in another man's body when called upon to
give evidence as to one's own exit


it may be supposed that the treatment i for of a verity i myself
came in for some share of the hard usage that killed the true
zachariah had received from the base and brutal john smith must
have cooled my regard for him if it did not affect my feelings of
philanthropy in general i confess that i did regard that personage
with sentiments of disgust and indignation but nevertheless i was
very loath to appear against him when summoned as i was soon after
leaving my sick-bed to give evidence on the charges preferred against
him these were two in number and afforded matter for as many separate
endictments in the first and verily i was startled when i heard
it john smith was charged with the murder of abram skinner in the
second with an assault with intent to kill upon myself that is my
second self zachariah longstraw and also with robbery

now if the reader will reflect a moment upon the relation in which i
stood to these charges he will allow that the necessity of testifying
on them reduced me to a quandary in the first place i knew very well
that mr john smith rogue and assassin as he was had not killed
abram skinner but that i had finished that unhappy gentleman myself
and i knew also in the second that my admitting this fact would
without doing mr john smith any good produce a decided inconvenience
to myself not that there was any fear i should be arraigned for
murder but because nobody would believe me i remembered how my
telling the truth to my friend john darling the deputy attorney in
regard to my first transformation had caused him to believe me mad
and i foresaw that telling the truth on the present occasion would
reduce me to the same predicament and perhaps the friends mad-house
into the bargain

there was the same difficulty in relation to the second charge
accompanied by another still greater for whereas john smith was
there only accused of assault with intent to kill he had in reality
committed a murder which if i had affirmed as i must have done had i
affirmed any thing at all i should have been a living contradiction of
my own testimony and thus considered madder than ever

the truth is i was in a dilemma out of which the truth could not
extract me and the more i thought the matter over the greater was
my embarrassment a feeling of integrity within me for zachariah
longstraw was a man of conscience urged me to speak the truth while
common sense showed me how much worse than useless truth would be in
such an extraordinary conjuncture

i received a visit from the prosecuting attorney who very naturally
expected a clear and satisfactory account of mr john smith's doings on
the night of the murder and the difficulty i had with him that is
the attorney gave me a foretaste of what i was to expect when summoned
into the witness's box in court i remember that the gentleman after
plying me with many questions to which he got that sort of replies
invidiously termed quaker answers flew into a huff and threatened
me with what would be the consequence if i should prove backward in
court and sure enough his prediction was verified for not giving a
straight answer to any one question when the trial came on i received
divers reprimands from the court and was finally committed for a
contempt to prison where i lay two or three days until called into
court again to give evidence on the second endictment mr john smith
having been found not guilty on the first this was owing in part
i presume to the testimony of several surgeons who deposed that
there were no marks of violence upon abram skinner's body although
the evidence of the watchman who had seen him alive through the
window and afterward found john smith burying his dead body in the
same hole with myself went rather hard with him i say the acquittal
was perhaps owing in part to the testimony of the surgeons though
much of it might be attributed to the marvellous humanity that reigns
in the criminal courts of the city of brotherly love to the great
benefit and encouragement of that proscribed and injured class of men
namely murderers

i made little better work of the second attempt at witnessing but
as i have matters of much greater importance to demand my attention
and the reader can easily infer what i did and what i did not affirm
i must beg to despatch the second trial by relating that i was packed
off a second time to prison for contempt but that the evidence of the
watchman and my late wounds and bruises were esteemed sufficient
to secure the prisoner's conviction and accordingly john smith was
convicted and accommodated with lodgings in the penitentiary for the
fourth time

my own incarceration was of no long duration my contumacy as it
was called was considered extraordinary but it was generally
thought to be owing to a mistaken humanity and a perverted quixotic
conscientiousness such as are common enough among persons of the
persuasion i then belonged to this and perhaps the circumstance that
i was yet in feeble health for the trial as i said took place soon
after i left my bed caused me to be treated with lenity and in a few
days i was liberated

all this i beg the reader to understand happened before the
reconciliation with my nephew jonathan and of course before i had
well begun my career of philanthropy of that career of some of my
deeds of goodness and of the consequences they produced i shall now
speak




 chapter vii


the sorrows of a philanthropist


my benevolence was of a two-fold character being both theoretic and
practical in the latter sense is to be regarded the relief which i
granted with my own hands to such suffering persons as i could lay them
on and there was no way in which i did not personally relieve some one
wretch or other by the former i understand a thousand schemes which
i devised and framed to enlist the sympathies of communities and so
relieve the afflicted in a mass besides a thousand others which were
designed to bestow upon the poor and vicious that virtuous knowledge
and those virtuous principles which are better than alms of gold and
silver i instituted some half a dozen charitable societies to supply
fuel clothing food and employment to the suffering poor as well as
others to exhort them to economy industry prudence fortitude and
so forth i formed societies even among themselves classing divers
isolated creatures into bands who wrought in common and disposed of
their wares either in a shop kept for the purpose or at fairs i
established schools to keep the children of the poor out of mischief
and one in particular i supported solely from my own that is to say
zachariah longstraw's pocket

i bestowed much of my regards upon the poor wretches in prison doing
all that i was permitted to effect a reformation in their habits and
feelings and i took uncommon pains to scatter light and sentiments of
a civilized character among the worthy representatives of the green
island who make up so large a portion of our suffering population

and let it not be supposed that i neglected that other class of poor
creatures called negroes whom although allowed the name and most
of the privileges of freemen their white brethren refuse to take to
their bosoms merely because they have black faces woolly heads and
an ill savour of body for myself verily if they were not comely in
my sight nor agreeable to my nostrils i said heaven hath made them
so and although my nephew jonathan insisted that heaven had done the
same thing with other animals and that upon my principles men should
be as affectionate with pigs and badgers as they were with cats and
lap-dogs i perceived that they were my brethern and that it became me
to conquer the prejudices lying only in my eyes and nostrils i girded
my loins to the work and verily i prevailed over the weakness of the
old adam of a verity i was the african's friend

but oh the wickedness of the world and the ingratitude thereof the
heart of man is even as the soil of the earth which the more it is
stirred up by cultivation the more barren and worthless it becomes it
is as the fields of the ancient dominion where if a man soweth barley
and corn he shall reap a harvest of jamestown weed poke-berries and
scrub pines it is as the bulldog that one feedeth with beef and other
wholesome viands who the moment he has done his dinner snaps for
his dessert at the feeder's heel it is as the tender flowers which
in the winter-time a man taketh from the cold to warm by night
in his chamber and which smother him with foul air before morning
verily it was my lot to find even as my nephew jonathan had once
foolishly contended that even philanthropy is not secure from the
sting of unthankfulness that benevolence is in one sense the great
parent of ingratitude since it begets it for a period of full seven
months for so long did i remain in zachariah's body after recoving my
health i laboured to do good to my fellows and verily i laboured
with might and main yet had i toiled with the same energy to injure
and oppress i almost doubt whether i should have been rewarded with
more manifold outpourings of wrath and fury verily as i said before
the world is a wicked world and i begin to doubt whether man can make
it better

one of the first mishaps that befell me was of the following nature
stepping one morning into the mayor's office which was a favourite
haunt with me seeing that misery doth there greatly abound i fell
upon a man whom the magistrate was about to commit to jail for being
drunk and beating his wife and children he being unable to pay the
fine imposed upon him and to find surety for his future good behaviour

the spirit stirred within me as i beheld the contrite looks of the
culprit and i said to myself while he lies in jail his poor wife
and his infants may perish with hunger i paid the fine and though
the mayor did very broadly hint to me that a little punishment would do
the man good and his wife too seeing that he was a barbarous fellow
i offered myself for his security and thus sent him back to his
rejoicing family i said to myself this very night will i witness
the happiness i have created i went accordingly to the man's house
where i found the wicked fellow raving with drink and beating his
wife as before his children screaming with terror and the neighbours
crying out for a constable i did but say a word of reprehension to
him when the brutish ingrate leaving his rib fell foul of myself
mauling me cruelly and i believe he would have beaten me to death had
i not been rescued by the timely appearance of a constable thee sees
the end of thy humanity said the mayor when i entered his office
the next morning that my black eye and bruised visage might testify
against the ungrateful man thee will not object to my committing the
fellow now

nay said i it is drunkenness that has made the poor man mad
therefore lock him up in prison until his madness hath departed

i will said the mayor and thee will have the goodness to pay over
to the clerk the hundred dollars in which thee bound thyself that the
rascal should keep the peace

verily said i it is not just i should pay the money for the
beating was upon my own body

truly said the mayor and so it was and therefore it is the harder
that thee should have to pay it but pay it thee must the man having
broken the peace as much in beating thee as if it had been any other
citizen of the commonwealth

and so much satisfaction i had for befriending the sot the charity
which did more harm than good even to the man's poor family since it
exposed them a second time to his fury costing me without counting
the fine paid on the first day a sore beating and one hundred dollars

my next misadventure was the being cheated in a very aggravated way by
a poor man to whom i loaned money without exacting bond or voucher
the same being loaned to re-establish him in a gainful business which
had been interrupted by an unfortunate accident for having prospered
in his business and i requiring that he should now repay the money
that i might devote it to the service of others he very impudently
averred that he had never had any thing of me except advice and a good
word of recommendation here and there swore that he never paid away or
received a cent without giving or taking a receipt defied me to prove
my claim and concluded his baseness by threatening to kick me out of
his workshop

these instances of ingratitude were followed by others of a still
deeper die and so numerous that i can mention only a few of them

walking one day to that infant school which i had established to
keep children out of mischief while their hard-working parents were
at their daily labours i perceived the urchins standing at the door
pelting the passers-by with mud reproving them for this misconduct
the graceless vagabonds did speedily turn their battery upon myself
and not content to plaster and bespatter me with mud-balls from head
to foot they fell upon me and being very numerous did actually roll
me about in a gutter where was a deep slough so that i had nearly
perished with suffocation being sorely bruised into the bargain to
crown all having expelled from my school the ringleaders in this
marvellous outbreaking of precocious ingratitude i was visited by
their parents all of them abusing me for my tyrannical usage of their
children although of a truth the tyranny was all on the side of the
juveniles and impudently demanding that i should pay them for their
boys time at the rate of twenty-five cents a week each for as many
weeks as i had had them at school of a surety some people are very
unreasonable

it was also my misfortune to offend divers tailors and shopkeepers
by benevolently taking part in the efforts of their poor unfortunate
needle-women to obtain better wages and one day in the streets these
angry men did hustle me and tear a tail from my coat but i consoled
myself for this violence by thinking of the gratitude of the poor
creatures i was defending when making my way the following evening
to their place of assembly i was set upon by the whole crew for that
i did hint that as their difficulties did chiefly proceed from their
numbers there being more hands at the business of sewing than were
required they would greatly benefit themselves and the community
too by going two thirds of them at least into service there being
ever a great want of domestics in our respectable families i say i
did but hint this reasonable and undeniable truth together with a
friendly remark upon the exposed state of their morals when there
arose such a storm among them as was never perhaps witnessed by any
other human being hear the old hunks said one he wants to make
niggur servants of us us that is freeborn american girls yes
ladies said another and he is insinivating we are no better nor we
should be turn the old rip out said a third and turn him out
cried the other three hundred and fifty there present of a verity
they did assail me with both tongue and nail testifying such vigour of
spirit and strength of arm that were i a philanthropist now which
i fortunately am not and were i moved to consult their interests as
before i should endeavour to form them into a regiment of soldiers
not doubting that they would at any moment prevail over twice their
numbers of male fighting men of a verity i say they did violently
pull me about thrusting me at last from the apartment and their
ingratitude was a sore wound to my spirit




 chapter viii


the same subject continued


another evil that befell me about the same time was equally
afflicting a negro-man that had fled from bondage in a neighbouring
state being sharply hunted and about to be captured by the person
that called him his property i carried him to my house and there
concealed him for three days and mights until his master had departed
for said i of a surety slavery is a bitter pill and one that
cures neither the rheumatism nor the ague and therefore why should
my brother pompey be compelled to swallow it my brother pompey
having eaten drunk and slept at my expense for the three days
mentioned disappeared on the morning of the fourth before daylight
carrying with him twenty-seven pounds of silver in spoons teapots
and other vessels the three watches belonging to myself my nephew
and abel snipe as well as jonathan's best coat and trousers verily
i was confounded at the fellow's ingratitude and the loss of my
valuables all of which however though broken up it was my good
fortune to recover together with the three watches the thief himself
being taken was clapped into jail for a while and then surrendered
to his master and carried back to bondage and this stirring up the
choler of the free africans in town they did naught but cry out upon
me as the author of his misfortune surrounding my house with a mob
and proceeding to the length of even burning it down at least the
house taking fire and manifestly by the act of an incendiary it was
charged by my friends upon these raging foolish people though i was
never able to prove it upon any one in particular as my good fortune
would have it abel snipe had taken out a policy of ensurance so that
i recovered the money from the company but not without going to law
the company averring that my humanity rendered me careless

i caused another dwelling to be built and in building it received
another strong and inconvenient proof not merely of man's ingratitude
but of his natural hostility to the charity which benefits his
neighbours i bought my marble out of the prison in order to encourage
industry among the prisoners and thus lighten the load of taxation on
the community at large this being known the marble-cutters fell into
wrath denounced me as the friend of villany and the enemy of honest
industry and being joined by the shoemakers who had put me down in
their character-book as a patron to none but prison-workmen and by
divers other mechanics that had some grudge of the same kind they
seized upon me as i stood surveying my rising mansion and bedaubed
me from head to foot with thick whitewash painting in great black
letters on the broad of my back the following words namely the
rogue's friend which caused me after i had escaped from their hands
to be hooted at by boys and men along the street and to be bitten by a
great cur-dog that was amazed at my appearance

another misfortune still more distressing befell me one day as i
walked among the western suburbs seeking whom i might relieve i
espied a company of men surrounding a ring made with stakes and ropes
in which two wretched creatures were stripping off their garments with
the intention to do battle upon one another with their fists these
were gentlemen of the fancy as it is called though imagination can
paint nothing of a more grossly animal and brutish character afar
from all that is fanciful than that very class that calls itself of
the fancy i was shocked that the poor creatures should in their
ignorance agree to maul and beat one another for the amusement of
a mob and i was concerned that a mob containing so many rational
beings should be willing to harry on two such silly fellows to harm
each other for their pastime i stepped among them therefore and
addressed them exhorting them to peace and harmony and this producing
but little effect on them i upbraided them with breaking the laws
both human and divine and assured them i would go hunt up the police
to prevent the mischief they meditated alas how ungratefully they
used me there was a man at a distance who was heating a great pot of
tar to pay the bottom of a canal-boat and just a moment before a
carter had stopped to look on the affray leaving on the roadside his
cart on which among other articles of domestic furniture was an old
feather-bed lying on the top of all the devil had surely brought
these things upon the ground that his sinful children the gentlemen
of the fancy might be at no loss how to testify their hatred of
humanity the very combatants themselves were the first to seize me
and cry out tar and feather the old bother'em douse down the bed
and dab the pot off the fire and daub him well they cried all the
while that their wretched companions drowning the cries i made for
assistance with savage yells of rage and merriment covered me from
head to foot with the nasty pitch and then tearing the bed to pieces
emptied its contents over my reeking body then having feathered me
all over and so transformed me that i looked more like an ostrich than
a human being they tied me to a post where i was forced to remain
looking upon the fight that immediately ensued between the champions a
horrid sight it was but i was so devoured with shame and indignation
that i should have cared little had they dashed each other's brains
out so much i endured for exhorting men to live together in peace and
amity

the very beasts seemed to conspire to treat me with ingratitude
my first effort in their cause was an attempt i made one day on
the tow-path near the water-works to protect a poor broken-down
barge-horse which the driver was cruelly beating my interference
cost me a dip in the basin the man who was both savage and strong
pitching me in headlong and what i deemed still more provoking a
kick from the horse who let fly at me with his heels merely because
mine as they were tripped into the air came in contact with his
hind-quarters so that i was both lamed and half drowned for my charity

in the same way i was scratched half to death and much more savagely
than i had been before by the needle-women by a cat that i took out
of a dog's mouth without counting upon a nip that i had from the cur
also and to end this small catalogue of animal ingratitude i may
say that within a fortnight after i was served in the same way by a
rat that i strove to liberate from the fangs of my own gray tabby for
while tabby was clawing at my fingers the rat took me by the thumb
and between them i was near perishing with lockjaw the weather being
uncommonly hot and the time midsummer

there were a thousand other mischances of a like nature which befell
me but which i have not leisure to describe nor even to enumerate
some few of them however i think proper to record but to save
space i will clap them into a short list along with those already
mentioned where they may be examined at a glance and where in that
glance the reader may perceive what are sometimes the rewards of
philanthropy

 i beaten by a drunkard whom i had taken out of
 prison and bailed to keep the peace

 ii mulcted out of surety-money because
 my gentleman broke the peace by beating me

 iii driven and almost kicked out of a man's
 workshop because i asked payment of a loan
 made without bond or voucher

 iv my nose pulled by a merchant to whom i
 had out of charity to the latter who was
 unfortunate recommended a customer who
 swindled him

 v rolled in the mud by the boys of my own
 charity-school whom i had exhorted not to daub
 the passers-by

 vi abused by their parents for not paying them
 cents per week for the time i had the boys
 at school

 vii hustled by tailors slop-shopkeepers and
 others for taking part with the needle-women
 in a strike

 viii scolded scratched and tumbled down
 stairs by the needle-women for advising them
 to go into domestic service and take care of
 their morals

 ix robbed by a fugitive slave whom i had
 concealed three days and nights in my house
 from his master

 x house burnt down by the free blacks or so
 it was suspected for putting the thief as
 aforesaid into jail so that his master got him

 xi whitewashed and libelled on my own back by
 the stonecutters for buying wrought marble out
 of the prison

 xii tarred and feathered by a gang of the
 fancy whom i exhorted at the ring to peace and
 amity

 xiii scalded at my own house which i had
 converted at a season of suffering into a
 gratis soup-house and with my own soup by a
 beggar because there was too little meat and
 too much salt in it

 xiv soused in the canal by a boat-driver for
 rebuking his cruelty to an old barge-horse

 xv kicked by the horse for taking his part

 xvi scratched by a cat for taking her out of
 a dog's mouth item bitten by the dog

 xvii bitten by a rat which i rescued from a
 cat item scratched by the cat

 xviii gored by a cow for helping her calf out
 of the mire item the calf splashed me all
 over with mud

 xix beaten about the ears with a half-skinned
 eel by a fishwoman whom i reproved for
 skinning it alive


such were some of the unhappy circumstances that rewarded a seven
months life of philanthropy but there were others to follow still
more discouraging and afflicting




chapter ix


containing a difficulty


it is a common belief among those who are more religious than wise
that a man never catches a cold going to church of a wet sunday or
being baptized in midwinter i am myself of opinion the belief of
such good people to the contrary notwithstanding that many devout
persons by wading to church in the slush or washing out their sins
in snow-water have gone to heaven much sooner than they expected in
the same way and on the same principle of distrusting all miraculous
interposition of heaven in cases where human reason is sufficient
for our protection i have my doubts in the truth of another maxim
of great acceptation in the world namely that a man never grows
poor by giving i believe indeed that the charity of a discreet and
truly conscientious man never injures his fortune but may in many
instances actually tend to its increase since the love of benevolence
may stimulate him to new labours of acquisition that he may have the
greater means of doing good but i am also of opinion and i think it
may be demonstrated by a good accountant that a man who has a revenue
of a thousand a year and bestows fifteen hundred in charity will in
due course of time find himself as poor as his pensioners when a man
hath a goose with golden eggs whatever he may do with the eggs he
should take great care of the goose

the reader may infer from these remarks that my philanthropy was as
little profitable to my pocket as it proved to my person and such
indeed was the truth i am of opinion i should myself in a very few
years have consumed the whole estate of zachariah longstraw ample as
it was in works of charity how much faster it went with my nephew and
my friend abel to assist me may be imagined my nephew became a very
dragon of charity and dispensed my money upon such objects of pity as
he could find for he soon began to practise the profession upon what
abel called his own hook with a zeal little short of fury so that
to supply his demands i was sometimes obliged even to stint myself
had abel snipe been equally profuse there is no saying how soon i
might have found myself at the end of my estate but abel snipe was a
jewel his charity was great but his conscientiousness was greater he
had ever a watchful eye to my good and his solicitude to husband and
improve my means kept his benevolence within the bounds of discretion

but notwithstanding all his care abel perceived that our philanthropy
was beginning to eat holes into my possessions and coming to me one
day with a long face he assured me that unless some means were
devised to increase my income we should soon find ourselves driven to
resort to the capital

verily and of a truth said i not a whit frighted at this
communication and why should that chill us in the good work abel
snipe of a surety all that i possess is it not the property of the
poor

verily said abel verily and yea but if we betake us to the
capital verily it will happen that sooner or later it shall be
consumed and nothing left to us wherewithal to befriend the afflicted
i say to thee zachariah thy wealth is as thou sayest the property
of the poor and it becomes thee as a true and faithful servant
thereof to see that it be not wasted but on the contrary husbanded
with care and foresight and put out to profit so that the single
talent may become two and peradventure three whereby the poor as
aforesaid shall be twice and it may be thrice benefited

thou speakest the words of sense and seriousness said i struck by
the new view of the case but how shall this happy object be effected
what shall we do abel snipe to make the one talent three and thereby
increase our means of doing good

thee nephew jonathan said abel snipe with a look of devout joy is
now a changed man a man of seriousness and virtue a scorner of vain
things and a giver of alms a man whom we can trust i say to thee
zachariah thee shall establish thee nephew in a gainful business and
he shall make money thee shall give him what is thee property for
his capital remaining theeself but as a sleeping partner and thus
it shall happen that thee capital shall be turned over three times a
year producing on each occasion dividends three times as great as
now accrue from thy investments and thus zachariah and verily it
is pleasant to think upon where thee now has a thousand dollars of
revenue thee shall then have nine and where thee now relieves nine
afflicted persons thee shall there-upon relieve nine times nine which
is eighty-one

i need not assure the reader that this proposition of abel's fastened
mightily upon my imagination and that i was eager to embrace it and
jonathan coming in at the moment i repeated the conversation to him
assuring him that if he thought himself able with abel's assistance
to undertake such a business he should have my money to begin upon
instanter and marry the maiden ellen into the bargain

nay verily said jonathan i will not marry and i will not do
this thing whereof thee speaks uncle zachariah thee may think me
light of mind thus to speak of ellen wild who is much lighter but
of a surety i find the spirit moves me to regard her as one not to be
regarded any longer in the matter of the money-making i say let abel
snipe be thy merchant or whatsoever it may be thee has determined on
for abel snipe is a good business man and he knows how to make money
he shall have my advice and assistance as far as may be in my power
but truly my thoughts now run in the paths of the unfortunate and
thither let my footsteps follow also

to this proposal the faithful abel with tears in his eyes for he
was moved that jonathan should express such confidence in him at
last demurred averring that it would be better and more seemly
for jonathan himself to undertake the affair he abel snipe giving
help and counsel according to his humble ability jonathan objected
as before and again declared that abel and abel alone was as he
expressed it the man for my money in short the two young men
now the best friends in the world contested the matter each arguing
so warmly in favour of the other that it was plain the thing could
never be determined without my casting vote which i seeing that
jonathan was positive and bent upon a life of virtue gave in abel's
favour and it was resolved accordingly that abel should be made the
money-maker




 chapter x


in what manner mr zachariah longstraw determined to improve his
fortune


and now the question occurring to me i demanded into what kind of
business we should enter

that said jonathan is a question more easily made than answered
seeing that there are so many ways of making money in this wicked
world that an honest man can scarce tell which to choose among them
and then proceeded with great gravity to indicate divers callings
which he pronounced the most gainful in the world and all or any of
which he thought abel could easily turn his hand to

the first he advised was quackery the making and vending of nostrums
to cure all manner of diseases including corns and the toothache
which was a business that had the merit of requiring no previous study
or education a tinker or cobbler being just as fit to follow it as
a man that had read paracelsus and which besides as was evident
from the speed with which its professors in general stepped from the
kitchen-pot to the carriage was the quickest way of making a fortune
that could be imagined i should have thought the young man was joking
for he had that vice in him to the last had it not been for the
fervour with which he pointed out the advantages of the vocation a
great recommendation he averred was that it required no capital
beyond a few hundred dollars to be laid out in bottles and logwood
or some other colouring material pump-water he said was cheap and
as for the other sovereign ingredient it was furnished by the buyer
himself yes said jonathan faith is furnished by the buyer who
pays us for the privilege of swallowing it we sell men their own
conceits bottled up with green red and brown water and thereby we
make them their own doctors who then can say the calling of the quack
is not honest nay even philanthropic he is a public benefactor a
friend even of physicians for he frees them from the painful necessity
of killing by making men their own executioners

and thus he went on until i cut him short by averring that the whole
business was little better than wholesale cheating and murder he then
recommended we should make abel a tailor solemnly declaring that
next to quackery tailoring which was a quackery of another sort was
the most profitable trade that could be followed the mere gain from
cabbaging considering that an ingenious tailor got at least one inch
of cloth out of every armhole without counting the nails cribbed from
other parts of a coat being immense and his profits seeing that he
lost nothing by a bad customer that he did not charge to a good one as
certain and immutable as the laws of the medes and persians

in short my nephew jonathan was in the mood for expatiating on the
merits of all money-making vocations in which i should follow him
were i not urged by the exigencies arising from limited time and space
to adhere to my story he made divers recommendations none of which i
thought of weight and upon abel who had heard him with gravity and
attention i was at last forced to call for advice and assistance it
was his opinion and he advised accordingly that all the money i could
raise should be thrown into the stock-market where being applied to
purchase and sale in the usual way he had no doubt it could be made
to yield a revenue of at least twenty per cent and perhaps twice as
much and this proposal strange as it may seem to the reader after
the experience abram skinner had given me in such matters i did after
sundry doubts and hesitations finally agree to

verily said i this is a gainful business friend abel but of a
surety neither honest nor humane seeing that it is practised at the
expense of the ignorant and often the needy

verily no said abel snipe with fervour it shall be at the
expense of the rich and niggardly the man that is a miser and
uncharitable the broker and the gambler the bull and the bear our
dealings shall not be with the poor and ignorant man that dabbleth
in stocks but him will we charitably pluck from the grasp of the
covetous and thus protect while drawing from the covetous man those
alms of benevolence which he would never himself apply to the use of
the afflicted

verily said i pleased with the idea if we can make the covetous
man charitable it will be a good thing and if we can protect the
foolish ignorant person from his grasp it will be still better but
of a surety abel snipe this business will be as gambling

yea and verily said abel snipe it is as gambling when a gambler
follows it but in the hands of an honest man it is an honest
profession is not money bagged up in stocks and other investments as
merchandise and as merchandise shall it not be lawfully bought and
sold

and moreover said jonathan with equal earnestness if it be no
better than cheating and swindling this same buying and selling are
we not embarking in it out of charity verily uncle zachariah in
such a case as this the end sanctifies the means behold what is the
crying evil arising from money that is chartered in stocks whether it
be in banks rail-roads loans or otherwise this is money that is
not taxed for charitable purposes it is money appropriated solely to
the purposes of gain why is it that a private man should be taxed to
support the poor and a bank that has greater facilities for making
money be not taxed for the purpose at all verily uncle zachariah
we will do what the commonwealth should be doing we will impose a tax
upon the gains of chartered money and distribute the proceeds among
the needy

to make short work of the matter i will not pursue our debate further
but merely state that i was soon brought to consider abel snipe's
scheme the best honestest and most philanthropic in the world and
to agree that he should open an office as a stock-broker turning a
penny or two in that way while making much more by buying and selling
on his own account to this i was brought in a great measure by
the representations and arguments of jonathan among which i esteem
as still worthy of consideration that which stands above expressed
in his own words i am still of opinion that a tax and a round one
should be imposed upon the profits of all banks and other money-making
corporations the same to be specifically appropriated to hospitals
and other charitable foundations and perhaps also to public schools
in this way evil might be made productive of good and our avarice
rendered the parent of benevolence and knowledge of a verity my
philanthropy is not yet got out of me

the aforementioned arrangement was made at an early period of my new
existence that is to say at the close of spring and the faithful
abel soon began to render a good account of his stewardship by handing
me over divers handsome sums of money the profits of his speculations
which jonathan and myself disbursed with rival enthusiasm the
experiment was continued in a prosperous manner until the month of
september when there happened a catastrophe not less unexpected than
calamitous




 chapter xi


in which a catastrophe begins


the various mischances and afflictions as narrated in the preceding
chapter which rewarded my virtue had begun to affect my mind with
sundry pangs of melancholy and misgiving i perceived that the world
was ungrateful and i had my doubts whether it was a whit the better
for my goodness these doubts and this persuasion were confirmed by
the experience of each succeeding day and by the month of september
as aforesaid i found myself becoming just as miserable a man as i
had ever been before and perhaps more so being pierced not merely
with the ingratitude of those i had befriended but convinced that the
unworthiness of man was a thing man was determined to persevere in

it was at the moment of my greatest distress that the catastrophe
alluded to before happened and this was nothing less than the
sudden bankruptcy of abel snipe whereby i was reduced in a moment
from affluence to destitution and what made the calamity still more
painful was a conviction forced upon me by my own reflections as
well as the representations of others that the failure could not have
happened without a fraudulent design on the part of the fiduciary
it is true this worthy gentleman was the first to inform me of his
mishap which he did with tears in his eyes and with divers outbreaks
of self-accusation and despair he declared that his imprudence had
ruined me his benefactor and implored me his benefactor to knock
him on the head with a poker i had begun to embrace in my agitation
but how he had effected such a catastrophe i could not bring him
clearly to explain the only answers i could get from him were
speculation speculation bad speculation ruined my benefactor
might as well have murdered thee and so on and having given vent to
some dozen or more of such frantic interjections he ran out of the
house

enter jonathan the very next moment the sight of him renewed my grief
he poor youth was ruined as well as myself yet not wholly for
as good luck would have it i had a week or two before after long
cogitation on the subject resolved to marry him to the maid ellen
wild and so secure his happiness more certainly than it appeared
to me it could be secured by a life of philanthropy to effect this
desirable purpose i bestowed upon him the only property which i had
not thought fit to put into abel snipe's hands being the new house i
was then building promising also to add a sum of money as soon as it
could be conveniently withdrawn from the concern he received the gift
and the promise with much joy and gratitude but betrayed surprising
indifference on the score of matrimony saying that he was in no great
hurry and in fact giving me to understand that there was a difference
between him and the maiden

jonathan said i as soon as i saw him thee is a ruined young man
abel has broken

all to smash said jonathan i know all about it horrible pickle
we're in but i say uncle if thee can borrow twenty thousand dollars
we can save friend abel yet

does thee say so said i is it true

verily said jonathan i have looked over the demands and twenty
thousand dollars by nine o'clock to-morrow will make all straight but
where will thee get twenty thousand dollars

where said i fairly dancing for joy it was but two days since
that thy friend ebenezer wild did offer me exactly the sum of twenty
thousand dollars for the new house as it stood not knowing i had
conveyed it to thee until i told him the same as a reason why i could
not take such a handsome offer

well said jonathan opening his eyes what then

surely said i if he would give twenty thousand then he will give
twenty thousand now and so jonathan 

and so said jonathan thee wants me to sell the house does thee
and give thee back the money uncle zachariah thee should be a little
more reasonable thee must remember that the house is mine and as
it seems to be all i am ever to get why uncle thee must excuse me
but i have no notion of parting with it

if jonathan had picked up the poker and served me the turn abel snipe
had so piteously entreated me to serve him that is knocked me on the
head i could not have been more shocked and horror-struck than i was
by these words

what jonathan said i does thee refuse to save me from ruin me
who have been a father to thee and given thee all that thou hast

no said jonathan coolly i am not so bad as that but as this
house is all i have i can't think of running too much risk with it
suppose thee borrows that twenty thousand dollars that ebenezer wild
has so handy he is thy friend as well as mine or suppose thee tries
some of thy other friends thee has often loaned to them and not often
borrowed sure thee has many friends who can spare money better than i
can

oh thou ungrateful young man said i

don't go to call me hard names said the perfidious and unfeeling
youth for if thee comes to that uncle zachariah i can tell thee
thee is the ungrateful man though not a young one haven't i been
as a son to thee for eighteen long years haven't i humoured all thy
foolish old notions even to the point of giving alms talking about
virtue and philanthropy and so on haven't i given up ellen wild to
please thee and hasn't thee after all my pains choused me out of
the portion i had a right to expect of thee except a poor beggarly
unfinished house only worth twenty thousand dollars yes thee
has uncle zachariah thee can't deny it don't thee talk to me of
ingratitude

thou art a viper said i

if i am said jonathan in a huff i won't stay to be trodden on

and with that the heartless creature tossing up his head like an
emperor stalked out of the house leaving me petrified by the enormity
of his baseness




 chapter xii


in which the catastrophe is continued


i was indeed so shocked so overwhelmed by ingratitude coming
from such a quarter that it was some time before i could recover
myself sufficiently to think of the steps necessary to be taken for
my preservation i remembered however that he even he my thrice
unfeeling nephew had recommended me to borrow of my friends what would
be enough to retrieve my affairs from ruin i ran from the house not
doubting that i could easily raise the sum fifty paces distant was my
new house that is jonathan's my old friend ebenezer the father of
the maid ellen was standing before it looking up to the carpenters
who were nailing the shingles on the roof

ebenezer said i thee is my friend does thee know i am on the
brink of ruin

very sorry said ebenezer all the town-talk looked for nothing
better perhaps thee will sell the house pho i forgot thee gave it
to jonathan

ebenezer wild said i if thee is my friend lend me that twenty
thousand dollars it will save me from ruin

really mr longstraw said ebenezer wild who was no quaker though
his father had been before him i am surprised a reasonable man
should make such a request i have told you twenty times you would ruin
yourself by your cursed philanthropy can't consent to be ruined with
you pity you mr longstraw awfully swindled wonder you could trust
such a knave as abel snipe sorry to hear matters look so black for
jonathan thought better of him quite unnatural to be defrauded by
one's own flesh and blood

what ebenezer meant by his concluding remarks i did not at that
moment understand but i comprehended them well enough when i had run
to five or six other friends rich men like him all of whom treated
my request to borrow with as little respect while all wound up their
commonplace condolings by assuring me first that abel snipe had
swindled me and secondly that there was much reason to believe my
nephew jonathan had done the same thing

reader this is a very wicked world we live in my philanthropy did not
make me as philanthropy often does selfish with my friends i felt as
much pleasure in obliging one who happened to be in a difficulty with
a loan of any sum within my reach as in relieving actual distress of
twelve different persons whom i now sought in my dilemma i had in this
manner at different times obliged no less than eleven of not one
of whom could i now borrow a dollar every man pitied my misfortune
every one inveighed with becoming severity against the villany of those
by whom i was ruined but every one was astonished that a reasonable
man like me should expect another reasonable man to part with his
money in short it was evident that my friends loved borrowing better
than lending and i left the door of the twelfth with the agreeable
conviction on my spirit that human nature was of the nature of a
stone i being the only man of the thousand million in the world that
had actually a heart in my bosom

this consideration was racking enough but it made a small part of my
distress every man had charged my friend honest abel snipe with
having swindled me as ebenezer wild had charged before and every one
in like manner swore that my nephew jonathan had borne a part in the
nefarious transaction this seemed to me incredible enough but when
i remembered jonathan's late behaviour his unexpected defection his
hard unfeeling nay his treacherous selfishness i felt prepared to
believe almost any wickedness that might be said of him

i ran to abel's office resolved to sift the affair to the bottom the
work was already done to my hands i found the office full of people
some of whom were officers of the police who had seized upon books and
papers and awful to be said the body of abel snipe and all raging
with vociferation and confusion except the latter worthy who looked
as if astounded out of his senses it's a clear case of swindling
cried a dozen voices as i entered a design to defraud fraud from
beginning to end flagrant scandalous scoundrelly swindling  nay
worse than swindling it is a conspiracy jonathan has confessed
it been going on this three months jonathan has confessed it

jonathan had confessed it confessed what why confessed as every one
gave me to understand and confessed in the hands of justice for it
seems he had been arrested that he and abel snipe had entered into a
conspiracy to defraud me of my property which had been carried on from
the moment that the latter was established in business and was now
completed by a long-designed bankruptcy

let the reader imagine my feelings at this disclosure of ingratitude
and villany so monstrous

my best friend a man whom i had wrested from the extremity of poverty
and disgrace and my only relative a youth whom i had adopted and
reared as my son who was my heir at law and the living partner as
i may say in all my possessions had leagued together feloniously to
deprive me of what i never denied them the privilege to share to rob
to fleece to reduce me to beggary

words cannot paint my grief i crept away from the scene of confusion
ashamed of my manhood ashamed even of my philanthropy i reached the
door of my house it was just dusk a poor man standing at the door
implored my charity for a miserable creature as he called himself go
to the devil said i

you are zachariah longstraw said another man tapping me on the
shoulder i am said i supposing he was a beggar like the other
and you may go to the devil too

very much obliged to you said the man but you're my prisoner and
so come along if you please and with that he took me by the arm and
began to march me down the street




 chapter xiii


the dănouement of the drama


why i was arrested and at whose instance i knew not i was too
downcast and spirit-broken to inquire i had doubtless divers small
debts due to persons with whom i was accustomed to deal and it seemed
to me natural enough as all men were ungrateful rascals that all
such persons now that i was known to be penniless should fall upon
me without shame or mercy demanding their dues i say i thought such
a consummation was natural enough and i asked no questions of my
captor i let my head drop upon my bosom and without resisting or
remonstrating and looking neither to the right nor the left suffered
him to conduct me whither he would

our progress was rapid our journey short in a few moments i found
myself led into a house and ushered into a lighted apartment

i looked up to see into what alderman's hands i had fallen the reader
may judge of my surprise amounting almost to consternation when i
beheld myself in an elegant saloon brilliantly lighted and surrounded
by a dozen or more gayly-dressed people of both sexes among whom was
my friend ebenezer wild and two or three others whose countenances
seemed familiar but whom in my surprise and confusion i did not
immediately recognise

a maiden beautiful as the morning and smiling as if her little heart
was dancing out of her eyes ran from the throng and seized me by the
hands crying 

now uncle zachariah thee shall pay me what thee owes me or be
turned over to some other creditor

i looked upon her in astonishment and began to fancy i was in a dream

what said my friend ebenezer don't you know my little ellen and
thereupon he added other expressions but what they were i retain no
remembrance of my wits being utterly amazed and confounded

to make my confusion still greater the door suddenly opened and in
rushed my nephew jonathan dressed like a dandy of the first water
in a blue cloth coat with shining buttons white trousers and satin
waistcoat and exclaiming bravo and victoria as if a very demon
of joy and exultation possessed him as soon as he beheld me he ran
forward snatched one of my hands from the maiden and dropping on his
knees cried with a comical look of contrition 

forgive me all my sins uncle zachariah and i'll behave better for
the future

oh thou ungrateful wretch said i how canst thou look me in the
face having ruined me

don't say so cried ellen wild you don't know how jonathan has
saved you

the deuse he don't said jonathan jumping up why then we've got
the play all wrong i say uncle don't look so solemn and wrathful
you are no more ruined than i am and you are out of the clutches of
the harpy

haven't i been swindled said i

unutterably said jonathan but as the swindler has been swindled
also there's no great harm done uncle zachariah a'n't you satisfied
abel snipe is a rascal

i am said i but what shall i say of thee

that i have broken the spell the villain cast over your senses said
jonathan and so saved you from the ruin your confidence invited him
to attempt uncle zachariah you think i am as bad as abel now listen
to my story i knew that abel snipe was a rogue and hypocrite but
could not make you believe it i saw that he was daily fleecing you
of sums of money under pretence of giving to the poor that he was
artfully goading and inflaming your benevolence into a passion nay
into a monomania for uncle everybody said you were mad for his
own base purposes and that sooner or later he would strip you of
every thing this i could not make you believe i resolved you should
see it i turned hypocrite myself and began to fleece you ten times
harder than abel the rogue was alarmed he perceived i was ousting him
from his employment that i had greater facilities for cheating having
more of your affection than himself his alarm added to another
feeling which you shall hear all about brought him into the trap from
which cautiousness at first secured him i convinced him i was as great
a rogue as himself and he then agreed with me yes uncle formally
agreed to join in a plan to strip you of fortune we arranged the
whole scheme from beginning to end the business the speculations the
bankruptcy abel was to play sir smash his reputation could stand it
the sums received from you were to be handed over to me and accounted
for as lost in bad speculations to make which appear straight his
books were filled with fictitious sales and purchases very ingeniously
got up after the grand crash we were to make a division of the
plunder he being content honest man to receive one fourth of which
he considered himself secure enough as long as i had any value for
good name or fear of the penitentiary now you may wonder how such a
cautious rogue could be so easily gulled here stands the fairy said
jonathan pointing to the maid ellen who dazzled the eyes of his
wisdom yes uncle would you believe it the impudent the audacious
fellow had the vanity to think he had found favour in her eyes at a
time when i had lost favour in those of her father you must know we
had a coolness that is father wild and i it was about you that
confounded philanthropy but we'll say nothing of that i used to
communicate with ellen by letter and abel was often my ganymede now
you must know ellen is a coquette 

fy jonathan said the damsel it was all that vicious abel's
presumption and folly because i was glad to see him and treated him
well just because he brought me letters oh the monster i soon saw
what was running in his head

yes said jonathan ellen's a much smarter girl than people suppose
her

oh you great quaker bear said the maiden

well continued jonathan she boasted her conquest and then i saw
i had the ogre by the nose it was this put me upon turning swindler
i had a talk with father wild who approved my plan and ellen agreed
to cultivate abel's good opinion as far as a smile or two we affected
to quarrel i began to coquet with another abusing poor ellen to abel
as hard as i could until he was persuaded the breach between us was
incurable ellen gave him a smile her papa became condescending in a
word the rascal thought nothing was wanting to make him the happiest
man in the world save the one full fourth of his patron's estate and
as much more as he could cheat me of here was the rock upon which abel
split and split he has he is now safe the moment matters came to
a crisis which was this afternoon i ran to a magistrate my friend
jones there pointing to an elderly gentleman who had entered with
him and made confession of our roguery deposed the whole matter
accused myself and abel of conspiracy to defraud and so forth and so
forth and was admitted to the honourable privileges of evidence for
the commonwealth and allowed to walk about on bail while my rascally
colleague takes up his lodgings in prison there's the whole story i
have exposed snipe's rogueries and secured his conviction and what
is equally agreeable i have saved your property here uncle you
called me a viper i only wanted to make you believe i could be
ungrateful as well as others by-the-way that was a plan of father
wild's to have your friends refuse to assist you they were let into
the secret and i recommended you to apply to them here uncle you'll
see what a viper i am he continued a little impetuously here are
the deeds for the house here is a roll of bank-notes i cheated you
of to play the philanthropist you will be surprised at the amount
but i did spend some i confess for there are wretches who deserve
our charity and here and here and here you have the property out of
which abel and i conspired to cheat you at least the chief part of
it the rest we will soon get possession of having laid the villain in
limbo here uncle zachariah take them and be as philanthropic as you
please we have no fear of you now your familiar is tied up take your
property and much good may it do you as for me i am content to take
ellen that is if you have no objection

this was a turn of circumstances that confounded me more than ever
and verily i knew not whether i was standing on my head or feet i
stood staring jonathan in the face without saying a word until the
youth was seized with the idea that the surprise of the thing had
turned my wits at which being alarmed he took me again by the hand
and said with the tears in his eyes 

oh my dear uncle do consider it is nothing more than a joke and
that i never meant to offend thee

no said i thee did not therefore thee shall have it all and thee
shall marry the maiden

and with that being seized with uncommon generosity or perhaps not
well knowing what i did i put into his hands the conveyance of the
house the bank-bills and other papers which he had given me but a
moment before and turned to leave the house

stay uncle i am just going to be married said he and stay
zachariah said a dozen others when some one suddenly calling
out let him go he is afraid of being turned out of meeting if he
witnesses the ceremony i was suffered to obey the impulses of the
spirit within me and walk out of the house which i did without
exactly knowing what i was doing

to tell the honest truth as indeed i have been trying to do all
along i was in a kind of maze and bewilderment of mind which the
first shock of ruin had produced and which jonathan's story rather
increased than diminished the effect of this was divided in my brain
with the impression of the various proofs of ingratitude and baseness
to which the day had given birth the latter however being greatly
preponderant of one feeling only i had entire consciousness and that
was a hearty disgust of philanthropy coupled with a sense of shame at
having been so basely cheated as i seemed to have been on all sides i
had been cheated out of my senses as the saying is and the only cure
for me was to be cheated into them again which was not an agreeable
reflection the whole affair being a reproach on my good sense

on the whole i felt very melancholy and lugubrious and began to
have my thoughts of leaving zachariah longstraw's body at the first
convenient opportunity the great difficulty was however to find a
tenement in which i might promise myself content the disappointment i
had experienced in my present adventure having filled me with doubts
as to the reality of any human happiness at least said i to myself
i will henceforth look before i leap i will cast mine eyes about me
i will gird up my loins and look abroad into the human family and
peradventure i shall find some man whose body is worth reanimating
yea verily i will next time be certain i am not putting my soul as
the pickpocket did his hand into a sack of fish-hooks

with this resolution on my mind i walked towards my house and was just
about to pass the door when an adventure befell me which knocked the
aforesaid resolution entirely on the head but before i relate it my
conscience impels me to make one remark which i beg the reader if he
be a man of fortune and blood to peruse without excusing himself on
the score of its dulness




 chapter xiv


a remark in which the author appears as a politician and abuses both
parties


there are other persons besides zachariah the philanthropist who
have experienced the ingratitude of the poor and truth to say if
we can believe the accounts of those who profess to have the best
means of judging there is more of it among that class of beings in
the united states than in any other christian land if it be so let
not the reader wonder at its existence it springs like a thousand
other evils of a worse because of a political complexion from that
constitution of society which notwithstanding its being in opposition
to all the interests of the land and the character of our institutions
is founded in and perpetuated by the folly of the richer classes it
lies not in the natural enmity supposed to exist between the rich
and the poor but in the unnatural hatred provoked in the bosoms of
the one by the offensive pride and arrogance of the other the poor
man in america feels himself in a political view as he really is
the equal of the millionaire but this very consciousness of equality
adds double bitterness to the sense of actual inferiority which the
richer and more fortunate usually do their best as far as manners
and deportment are concerned to keep alive why should the folly of
a feudal aristocracy prevail under the shadow of a purely democratic
government it is to the stupid pride the insensate effort at pomp and
ostentation the unconcealed contempt of labour the determination
manifested in a thousand ways and always as unfeelingly as absurdly
to keep the base mechanical aware of the gulf between him and his
betters in a word to the puerile vanity and stolid pride of the
genteel and refined that we owe the exasperation of those classes in
whose hands lie the reins of power and who will use them for good or
bad purposes according as they are kept in a good or bad humour it
is to these things we trace besides the general demoralization ever
resulting from passions long encouraged besides the unwilling and
unthankful reception of benefits coming from the hands of the detested
all those political evils which demagoguism agrarianism mobocracism
and all other isms of a vulgar stamp have brought upon the land
there is pride in the poor as well as the rich the wise man and the
patriot will take care not to offend it

reader if thou art a rich man and despisest thy neighbour remember
that he has a thousand friends of his class where thou hast one of
thine and that he can beat thee at the elections if thou art a
gentleman remember that thy cobbler is another or thinks himself
so which is all the same thing in america at all events remember
this namely that the poor man will find no fault with thy wealth
if thou findest none with his poverty




 chapter xv


an uncommon adventure that befell the author


i said that just as i arrived at the door of my dwelling an adventure
befell me and truly it was such an extraordinary one as has happened
to no other individual in the land since the days of the unfortunate
william morgan as i passed towards the door a man whose countenance i
could not see for it was more than two hours after nightfall and who
seemed to have been lying in wait on the stoop suddenly started up
exclaiming in accents highly nasal and somewhat dolorous

well i guess if there's no offence there's no mistake i rather
estimate that you're mr zachariah longstraw

well friend and what is that thy business said i in no amiable
tone

well not above more than's partickilar said the stranger but
i've heern tell much on your goodness and i'm in rather a bit of the
darnedest pickle jist now with a sick wife and nine small children
the oldest only six years old that ever you heerd tell on and so i
rather estimated 

thee may estimate theeself to the devil said i how can the oldest
child of nine be only six years old

oh darn it said the fellow there was three on em twins but if
you'll jest step round to my wife she'll tell you all about it always
heern you was a great andyfist or what-d-ye-call-it

then thee has heard a great lie said i and so thee may go about
thee business for i'll give thee nothing

well now do tell said the man with a tone of surprise that
conveyed a part of the emotion to myself particularly when by way
of pointing his discourse with the broadest note of admiration he
suddenly clapped a foot to my heels and laid me sprawling on the broad
of my back

my astonishment and wrath may well be imagined but they were nothing
to the terror that beset me when recovering a little from the
stunning effects of the fall i opened my mouth to cry aloud and found
it instantly stuffed full of handkerchiefs or some such soft material
which the pretended beggar took that opportunity to gag me with the
next moment i felt myself whipped up from the ground and borne aloft
like a corpse on the shoulders of two men who trudged along at a
rapid pace and apparently with the greatest unconcern possible for
some of the people in the street hearing my groans which were the only
sounds i could make and demanding what was the matter were answered
by my cool captors oh nothing more than's partickilar only a poor
mad gentleman that broke hospital guess he won't do it again raving
mad and hollers a gag out i say sam hold fast to his legs and
don't let him jump for i rather estimate if he gets loose he'll kill
some on these here people

the villain i had begun to hope my moans and struggles which i made
for the purpose as loud and furious as i could having no other way of
calling for help would cause some of the persons collected to arrest
the rogues and inquire into the matter a little more closely but no
sooner had the villain expressed his fears of the mischief i might do
than all inquiries ceased and a horrible scraping and rattling of feet
told me that assistance and curiosity had scampered off together

in three minutes more i found myself clapped into a little covered
or rather boxed wagon such as is used by travelling tinmen and
held fast by one of the rogues while the other seized upon the reins
and whipping up a little nag that was geared to it we began to roll
through the streets at a round gait and with such a rattle of wheels
and patty-pans that there was little hope of making myself heard had
i possessed the voice even of an oyster-man my companion took this
opportunity to secure my wrists in a pair of wooden handcuffs and
to lock my feet in a sort of stocks secured against the side of the
wagon then overhauling the handkerchiefs and arranging them more to
his liking though not a whit more to mine he opened his mouth and
spoke saying

now uncle longlegs i estimate we'll be comfortable so keep easy
or if you will grunt just grunt in tune and see what sort of a
bass you'll make to old hundred

with that the rascal after pitching his voice so as to accommodate
mine as much as possible began to sing a song of which all that i
recollect is that it related the joys of a travelling tinman tricks
rogueries and all that it began somewhat in the following fashion 

 when i was a driving along down east
 i met old deacon dobbs on his beast
 the beast was fat and the man was thin 
 i'll cheat deacon dobbs says i to the skin 

that it was as long and soporific as a state constitution or a
governor's message that it was actually sung to a psalm-tune or
something like it and that during the eleventh twelfth thirteenth
and half of the fourteenth stanza the little wagon rolled leisurely
over a long and hollow-sounding bridge which i had no doubt was one of
the wooden rialtos of the schuylkill having passed which the driver
whipped up and away we went at a speed of at least six miles an hour




 chapter xvi


in which sheppard lee takes a journey and discovers the secret object
of his captors


verily reader the thing was to me as an amazement and a marvel and
the wonder thereof filled my spirit with anguish and perturbation
but if i was dismayed at my seizure and abduction at my involuntary
journey prolonged through the space of a whole night how much greater
was my alarm to find it continued for five days and nights longer
during which i was never allowed to speak or breathe the fresh air
except when my captors halted to rest and eat which they did at
irregular intervals and always in solitary places among woods and
thickets it was in vain that i demanded by what authority they treated
me with such violence what purpose they had in view and whither
they were conducting me the rogues assured me they were very honest
fellows who made their living according to law and had no design to
harm me and as to what they designed doing with me that they said
i should know all in good time recommending me in the meanwhile
to take things patiently i studied their appearance well they were
common-looking personages with a vulgar shrewdness of visage and
would have been readily taken for yankee pedlers of the nutmeg and
side-saddle order that is of the inferior branch of that adventurous
class as indeed they were there was nothing of the cut-throat about
them whatever and i soon ceased to feel any apprehension of their
doing me a personal injury but what did the villains mean what was
their object in carrying me off what did they design doing with me
to these questions which i asked myself and them in vain i had on
the sixth day of my captivity an answer and verily it was one that
filled me with horror and astonishment oh the wickedness of man
the covetousness the depravity the audacity the enterprise and
originality thereof

during the first three days of my captivity my roguish captors had
taken great pains to conceal me from and to prevent any noises i might
make from being heard by any persons they met on the road on the
fourth day they relaxed somewhat from their severity on the fifth they
unbound my arms and on the sixth they even removed the gag from my
mouth assuring me however that it should be replaced if i attempted
any outcries and giving me moreover to understand that i was now
in a land where outcries would be of no service to me whatever and
indeed i had soon the most mournful proof that in this particular
they spoke nothing but the truth

the evening before i heard while passing by a farmhouse a great
sawing of fiddles and strumming of banjoes with a shuffling of feet
as of people engaged in a dance while a voice which i knew by its
undoubted congo tang could be none but a negro's sang in concert
with the fiddles 

 ole vaginnee nebber ti ah
 kick'm up juba a leetle high ah 

or something to that effect and while i was marvelling what could
make a negro in pennsylvania chant the praises of virginia having
rolled a little further on i heard far in the distance while our
little nag stopped to drink from a brook the sound of many voices
which i knew also were those of negroes they were labourers husking
corn in the light of the moon and singing as they laboured and
verily there was something uncommonly agreeable in the tones now
swelling now dying in the distance as many or fewer voices joined
in the song there was a pleasing wildness in the music but it was
to me still more enchanting as showing the light-heartedness of the
singers verily said i forgetting my woes in a sudden impulse of
philanthropy the negro that is free is a happy being not doubting
that i was still in pennsylvania

but oh how grievously this conceit was dispersed on the following
morning i was roused out of sleep by the sound of voices and clanking
of chains and looking from the door of my prison which my conductors
had left open to give me air i spied just at the tail of the cart a
long train of negroes men women and children of whom some of the
males were chained together the children riding for the most part in
covered wagons while two white men on horseback armed with great
whips and pistols rode before and behind keeping the whole procession
in order

what said i filled with virtuous indignation and thrusting my head
from the cart so as to address the foremost rider what does thee
mean friend are these people slaves or freemen and why dost thou
conduct them thus in chains through the free state of pennsylvania

pennsylvanee cried the man with a stare i reckon we're fifty
miles south of mason's and dixon's and fast enough in old virginnee

virginia said i seized with dismay before i could add any thing
farther one of my captors jumping from the front of the cart where
he had been riding with the other clapped to the door of the box
swearing at me for an old fool who could not keep myself out of
mischief

hillo stranger i heard the horseman cry to my jailer what white
man's that you've got locked up thaw

oh darn it was the answer it's an old fellow of the north jist
as mad as the dickens

friend cried i from my prison seized with a sudden hope of escape
the man tells thee a fib if thee is an honest man and a lover of the
law i charge thee to give me help for these men are villains who
have dragged me from my home contrary to law and now have me fastened
up by the legs

i say strange-aw by hooky cried the horseman in very emphatic
tones addressing himself to my captor as i saw through a crack while
his companion rode up to his assistance what's the meaning of all
this he-aw what aw you doing toting a white man off in this style
like a wild baw

what a wild baw was i could not conveniently comprehend but i saw
that i had lighted on a friend who had the power to deliver me from
thraldom

my name said i is zachariah longstraw and i can reward thee for
thy trouble

you hear him said my jailer with all imaginable coolness well
now darn it if i must tell it is zachariah longstraw the famous
zachariah longstraw you understand and here he nodded and winked at
the questioner with great significancy but as it appeared all in
vain

never heard of the man in my life said my friend and i've followed
niggur-driving ever since i could hold a two-year-old bo pig

what cried my jailer never heard of zachariah longstraw the
famous abolitionist

abolitionist cried the two horsemen together and they cried it
with a yell that made my hair stand on end can't say ever heard the
name but reckon he's one of them aw new-yorkers and yankees what
sends cendiary things down he-aw i say strange-aw is it a true
right up-and-down no-mistake abolitionist

darn it i think you'd say so if you had ever read the papers

jist open the box then and if i don't take the scalp off him call me
a black man

you won't do no sitch thing meaning no offence said my jailer
didn't go to the expense to fetch him so far for nothing and don't
mean him for the virginnee market bound down to louisianee stranger
that's the best market for abolitionists seen a public advertisement
offering fifty thousand dollars for fellers not half so bad i rather
estimate we'll get full price for our venture

with that my jailers whipped up and succeeded in putting a proper
distance betwixt them and that ferocious person who had such a desire
to rob me of my scalp




 chapter xvii


containing other secrets but not so important


reader if thou art an abolitionist and verily i hope thou art
not thou wilt conceive the mingled wo and astonishment with which
i listened to these words of the chief kidnapper whose christian
name by-the-way was joshua though as for his surname i must
confess i never heard it and appreciate even to the cold creeping
of the flesh the terrible situation in which i was placed i was an
abolitionist or at least my captors chose so to consider me and
they were now carrying me down south to sell me on speculation for
this they had kidnapped me for this they had fastened me up by the
legs like a wild baw for this but it is vain to accumulate phrases
expressive of their villany and my distresses what mattered it to my
captors if after all i was no abolitionist for of a verity
though opposed in principle to the whole institution of slavery my
mind had been so fully occupied with other philanthropic considerations
that i had had no time to play the liberator it was all one to my
captors the genius which could convert a hemlock-knot into a shoulder
of bacon a bundle of elder twigs into good havana cigars and bags of
carpet-rags into bologna sausages could be at no fault when the demand
was only to transform a peaceable follower of george fox into a roaring
lion of abolition i felt that they had got me into a quandary more
dreadful than any that had ever before afflicted my spirit i knew we
were already far south of mason's and dixon's

the moment my vile kidnappers slackened their speed a little having
ridden hard to escape the negro-drivers i called a parley in the
course of which two circumstances were brought to light which greatly
increased the afflictions of my spirit i began by remonstrating with
the villains upon the wickedness cruelty and injustice of their
proceedings to which joshua made answer that times was hard that
a poor man was put to a hard shift to get a living that for his
part he was an honest man who turned his hand to any honest matter 
that he knew what was lawful and what was not that he was agin all
abolition which was anti-constitutional and clear for keeping the
peace betwixt the north and south and twenty other things of a like
nature of which the most important was a declaration that the good
people of some parish or other in louisiana had offered a reward of
fifty thousand dollars for either of two individuals whose names i have
forgotten though they were very famous abolitionists and although
joshua to settle the matter at once showed me their names in the
advertisement which he had cut from a newspaper

friend said i i don't see that these foolish people have offered
any reward for me

well darn it i know it said joshua but i rather estimate they'll
give half price for you and that will pay us right smart for the
venture for you see what they want is an abolitionist and i rather
estimate they're not over and above partickilar as to who he may be
now i have heern tell of a heap of incendiary papers you sent down
south to free the niggurs 

i never did any such thing

oh well said joshua it's all one them there sugar-growing
fellers will think so and so it's all right and there's them runaway
niggurs you phil'delphy quakers are always hiding away from their
masters i rather estimate we'll make a good venture out of you

what said i will you sell my life for money

no said the vile joshua it's a mere trade in flesh and
blood wouldn't take a man's life on no consideration

friend thee shall have money if thee will permit me to escape

well said joshua with an indifferent drawl i estimate not abel
snipe told me you was cleaned out as clear as a gourd-shell

abel snipe said i is thee a friend of that villain abel snipe

a sorter said joshua or rather sam is him and abel was friends
together at sing 

oh blast your jaw said sam speaking for almost the first time on
the whole journey for he had been until then uncommonly glum and
taciturn where's the difference where it was says abel snipe to
me says he if you want's an abolitionist there's my old friend
zachariah he's your true go and so d'ye see that's what made us
snap you for we was thinking of snapping another

oh the wretch the base ungrateful hypocritical wretch

come blast it said sam don't abuse a man's friends

fellow said i hast thou no human feeling in that breast of thine
wilt thou sell me to violent men and madmen who will wrongfully take
my life

think what thou doest hast thou no conscience thou art selling a
fellow-being hast thou no fear of death and judgment of the devil and
the world of torment

oh hold your gab said the ruffian as for selling fellow-critters
why that was once a reggelar business of mine for d'ye see i was
a body-snatcher and i reckon i was more skeared once snapping up a
dead body than ever i shall be lifting a live one you must know i
was snatching for the doctors over there in jarsey for d'ye see
i'm a jarseyman myself i reckon it was some fourteen months ago it
was summer what the devil-be-cursed the doctor wanted with a body in
summer i don't know but it was none on my business so we went me
and tim stokes and the doctor to an old burying-ground where they had
just earthed a youngster that the doctor said would suit him well
d'ye see when we came to the grave up jumps a blasted devil as big
as a cow or it might ha been a ghost and set up a cry so we takes
to our heels but the doctor said twas a man's cry and no ghost's
and so d'ye see blast it we was for going back again after having a
confab when what should we do but find a poor devil of a feller lying
dead by a hole under a beech-tree the doctor said he would do better
nor the other and so blast it d'ye see we nabbed him

of a surety said i eagerly it was the beech-tree at the
owl-roost and that was the body of poor sheppard lee

well they did call him summat of that like and they made a great
fuss about him in the papers but i'm hanged if i wasn't skeared after
that out of all body-snatching

friend said i can thee tell me what the doctor did with that body

why cut him up blast him and made a raw-head-and-bloody-bones of
him the doctor was so cussed partickilar he wouldn't let us even
knock the teeth out though that was no great loss for jarseymen
hasn't no great shakes in the tooth way

alas what an ending for poor sheppard lee his body subjected to
the knife of an anatomist his bones scraped boiled bleached hung
together on wires and set up in a museum while his spirit was
wandering about from body to body enduring more afflictions in each
than it had ever mourned even in that unlucky original dwelling it
was so glad to leave i am not of a sentimental turn and i cannot
say that as zachariah longstraw i felt any peculiar sorrow for the
woes of sheppard lee nevertheless i did not hear this account of the
brutal way in which his body had been stolen and anatomized without
some touch of indignation and grief which perhaps i should have
expressed had not there arisen before the brutal samuel had quite
finished his remarks on jerseymen's teeth an occasion to exercise
those feelings on my own immediate behalf

this was produced by the vile joshua who had then the reins telling
a brace of horsemen whom we met that he had the great abolitionist
the celebrated zachariah longstraw in his cart and was carrying him
to be lynched in louisiana a confession that threw the strangers into
transports of satisfaction one of them swearing he would accompany my
captors to the mississippi or to the end of the earth for the mere
purpose of seeing me get my deservings




 chapter xviii


in which the author approaches a climax in his adventures


and now arose a train of incidents by which i was taught three things
namely first the manner in which my merchants designed giving a value
to their merchandise not inherent and intrinsic to it for of a truth
my abolition principles as i said before had never been carried to
the point of notoriety or even notice secondly the love with which
a southron regards those pious philanthropists who will have him good
and virtuous against his own will and thirdly the religious respect
for law and order which is so prominent a feature in the american
character

to make me valuable it was necessary i should be made famous and this
was easily accomplished in a land where men make up their opinions for
themselves according as they are instructed it was only necessary
to assure some half dozen or more independent sovereigns that i was
famous to ensure their making me so and this my kidnappers did they
told everybody they met that they had secured zachariah longstraw the
famous abolitionist the very life and soul of northern incendiarism
whom they were carrying to louisiana to be lynched according to law
and as the circumstance would of course get into every patriotic
newspaper along the way it was certain i should be made famous enough
before i got there and they thus enjoy the advantage of advertising
their commodity without paying a cent to the printer

it was astonishing and to none more than myself to witness the
suddenness with which i was exalted from obscurity to distinction and
the readiness with which every living soul upon being told my name
character and reputation remembered all about me and my misdeeds
yes cried one worthy personage shaking at me a fist minus two
fingers and a half i have heerd of him often enough he lives in
new-york and he sells sendary pictures packed up between the soles
of niggur shoes yes cried another who had but one eye i have
read all about him he lives in boston keeps a niggur school and
prints sendary papers a hundred thousand at a time to set niggurs
insurrecting in short they remembered not only all that the unworthy
joshua told them to my disparagement but a thousand things that the
imagination of one suggested to the credulity of another it was in
vain that i endeavoured to say any thing in denial or defence ridicule
and revilement threats and execrations were my only answers it
was clear that by the time we reached the mississippi i should be
the most important personage in america and that if my value as an
article of merchandise was to be determined by the distinction i won on
the road my friends joshua and samuel would make their fortunes by
the speculation but it was not my fate to travel beyond the bounds of
the ancient dominion

it happened that on this day an election was held in the district
through which we were travelling to return a representative to
congress in lieu of one who had fought his way into the shoes of a
chargăš all the world that is all the district was therefore in
arms and men and boys americans and irishmen were making their way
to the polls as fast and comfortably as two-mile-an-hour hard-trotting
horses could carry them and thither also as it appeared or in that
direction we were ourselves bending our course as we advanced
therefore we found ourselves gliding into a current of human
bodies honest republicans moving onward to the polls all of whom
were ready to add their approval to my claims or those the kidnappers
made for me to the honour of lynchdom the word was passed from one
to another that the yankee cart contained the famous abolitionist
zachariah longstraw they pressed around to look at and revile me to
discourse with the kidnappers on my demerits and to express their
delight that such a renowned member of the incendiary gang as they
called that class of conscientious people should at last be on the
road to justice

and thus i was rolled along attended by sundry groups which grew fast
into crowds consisting of persons who rejoiced over my capture and
painted to my ears in words uncommonly rough and ferocious the fate
that awaited me when arrived at my place of destination

that place as it chanced was nearer than i either expected or
desired as the crowd thickened the sounds of wrath and triumph
increased becoming more terrible to my auditories a new idea came
into the minds of the sovereigns a villain seven feet and a half
high mounted on a horse just half that altitude who had a great
knife-scar across his nose and cheek and a dozen similar seams on his
hands rode up to the cart and giving me a diabolical look cried out
whaw what aw the use of carrying the crittur so faw i say vawginnee
is the place for lynching atter all i say gentlemen and vawginians
i go for lynching right off-hand old vawginnee for evvaw

loud and terrible was the roar of voices with which the throng
testified their approbation of the barbarian's proposal it was agreed
i ought to be and should be lynched on the spot the kidnappers
appealed to the justice of virginians requesting them not to invade
the sacred rights of private property they could not think of
giving up their prisoner for nothing they meant him solely for the
louisiana market but things were coming to a crisis and that my
conductors perceived they whipped up to escape the throng but in
vain the further they went the more they became involved in the
crowd having now arrived at the village where the favourite candidate
was stumping among his constituents and promising them worlds of
reform retrenchment and public virtue provided they would send him
to congress i could hear from my box my friend joshua having taken
care to lock me up at the first sign of danger as we entered the
village the distant cries of hampden jones for ever mingled with
those nearer ones of my persecutors lynch the abolitionist and the
loudly-expressed remonstrances of my friends against invasion of their
rights coupled with threats to have the law of any one who robbed them
of their property

but threats and appeals were alike wasted on the independent freemen
of that district joined by the voters and others already assembled at
the polls who at the cry of lynch the abolitionist had deserted
their orator to join in the nobler sport of lynching they increased
in wrath and enthusiasm and stopping the cart and breaking open my
prison-house they dragged me into the light of day one man calling
for a pistol another a knife a third a rope and a fourth a cord
of good dry wood and a coal of fire to burn the villain alive
such a horrible clamour never before afflicted my ears or soul i saw
that abolitionist or not it was all over with me and so saw honest
joshua and samuel whose only solace for this unlucky interruption to
their speculation was a call some one generously made to take up a
subscription for their benefit seeing that it was beneath the dignity
of the chivalry of virginia to cheat even a yankee of what was justly
his due




 chapter xix


containing a specimen of eloquence with some account of the dangers of
lynchdom


at this moment the orator and candidate of the day stalking up in
high dudgeon to find what superior attraction had robbed him of his
audience laid eyes upon me i thought i had seen him before and
verily i had he was that identical gentleman the master of the
fugitive slave whom i had concealed in my house in philadelphia and
then clapped into prison for robbing me whence his master recovered
him there was no mistaking the gentleman he was a young man of
twenty-six or seven six feet high and one foot wide long-limbed with
small feet and huge hands a great shock of indian-looking hair vast
solemn black eyes a mouth wide and square and a brow that might have
suited a patriarch it was so wide and lofty and wrinkled he was
evidently a man destined to shake the walls of the capitol and cause
stenographers to groan the tully shone in his eye the demosthenes
moved on his lip there was genius even in the shape of his nose

i recollect the man said he with a voice that might have come from
the bowels of a double-bass it was so deep rolling and sonorous
he hid my boy pompey his name is longshanks he is a quaker a
philanthropist an abolitionist

hampden jones for ever cried the delighted sovereigns we'll hang
him meaning me however and not the orator over the poll-window
and then vote for hampden jones the friend of the law the friend of
the constitution the friend of the south

stay friends said hampden jones and his voice stilled the tumult
i have a word to say on the subject of abolition

hampden jones for ever cried the republicans and hampden jones
stepped up on the head of a barrel and stretched forth his right arm
he stretched forth his left also and then clinching both fists and
pursing his brows together until the balls beneath them looked like
rolling grape-shot he said 

gentlemen fellow-freemen of virginia the bulwarks of a nation's
liberties are the virtues of her children compared with these what is
wealth what is grandeur what even are power and glory these riches
and greatness power and renown are the possessions of the old world
yet what have they availed her look around that ancient hemisphere
and tell me where among its blood-stained battle-fields where
under its polluted palaces where in its haunts of the despot and the
slave you can find the love of liberty the love of law the love of
order the love of justice that give permanence to the institutions
they adorn and like the laurel crown of the cesars guard from
the thunderbolt the temples they bind in the wreath of honour look
for them in the old world but look in vain the mighty colossus of
christendom once vital with virtue lifts its decrepit bulk beyond
the verge of the atlantic a vast and mournful monument of decay
age and the shocks of the elements the wash of the tempest and the
lightning-stroke have ploughed its marble forehead with wrinkles
mosses hang from its brows and the dust of its own ruin dust animated
only by insects and reptiles the offspring of corruption moulders
over its buried feet the virtues that once distinguished that almost
deified the immortal colossus have fled from the old to find their
home in the new world i look for them only in the bosoms of americans

here the orator who had pronounced this sublime exordium with
prodigious earnestness and effect paused while the welkin rung with
the shouts of rapture its complimentary close was so well fitted to
inspire as for me i felt a doleful skepticism as to the justness of
the compliment having the very best reason to distrust that love of
liberty law order and justice which was about to consign me to
ropes and flames without asking the permission of a judge and jury
moreover i could not exactly see how mr hampden jones's remarks
on the old and new world had any thing to do with the subject of
abolition which he had risen to discuss and indeed this difficulty
seemed to have beset others as well as myself several crying out with
great enthusiasm let's have something on abolition and then to the
lynching while others exclaimed let's have the lynching first and
the speech afterward

abolition my fellow-citizens said the orator it is my intention
to address you on the subject of abolition but first let me apply
what i have already said i have said and i repeat that the love of
liberty of law of order of justice belongs peculiarly to the free
sons of america let me counsel let me advise let me entreat you to
have this noble truth in remembrance on this present occasion beware
lest in what you now intend to do you give occasion to the enemies of
freedom to doubt your virtue to suspect the reality of your love of
law order and justice to stigmatize you as friends only of riot and
outrage

these words filled me with joyful astonishment i began to believe
the youthful tully was about to interfere in my favour to rebuke
the violence of his adherents and so save them from the sin of
blood-guiltiness

so also thought the indignant sovereigns themselves and many
elevating their voices demanded furiously if he meant to protect the
bloody abolitionist

by no means said mr hampden jones with great emphasis what i
have to advise is that if we are to do execution upon the wretch
we shall proceed about it in an orderly and dignified way resolve
ourselves into a great and solemn tribunal and so adjudge him to death
with a regularity and decorum which shall excite the admiration and win
the approbation of the whole world

hampden jones for ever cried the sovereigns and so it appeared that
all the benefit i was to derive from his interference was only to be
despatched in an orderly manner




 chapter xx


in which sheppard lee reaches the darkest period of his existence


seeing this i became horribly frightened indeed so much so that
i was incapable of observing properly what ensued i have a faint
recollection that mr hampden jones resumed his discourse and harangued
those who would listen on the subject he had promised to discuss and
i remember that his auditors echoed every tenth word with tremendous
shouts but what i remember better than all was a spectacle that soon
attracted my attention being nothing less than the apparition of
five or six stout negroes climbing up a tree hard by dragging a rope
after them and tying it round a branch all which they executed with
uncommon spirit and zeal shaking their fists at me all the time and
calling me a cussed bobolitionist

what was to become of me now had i entered the body of the most
generous and humane of men only to be hanged a cold sweat broke over
me my knees knocked together the men who held me held me faster my
judges the members of the great and solemn tribunal began to decide
upon my fate with the regularity and decorum advised by their orator
which were to win the approbation and admiration of the whole world 
that is to say by each man marching up to the orator's barrel where
stood a committee appointed to receive the votes pronouncing his name
and voting to hang the incendiary

all this while i believe i was endeavouring to say something in my
defence but i have not the slightest recollection of what it was
matters were coming i may say had come to a crisis and my life
hung upon a thread when suddenly a negro who had been among the
most active and zealous of the volunteers on the tree fell from a
high branch to the ground and besides breaking his own neck as i
understood by the cry that was set up crushed two or three white men
that stood below

this produced a great hubbub and those who had stationed themselves
about me as guards ran forward to see what mischief had been done as
they ran one way i betook me to my heels and ran another i rushed
into the nearest house but being instantly pursued and ousted i fled
into a garden from which i was as quickly chased by men and dogs the
first screaming and the second howling and barking so that the uproar
they made was inexpressible

fear lent me wings but i was surrounded and run whithersoever
i might i always found myself brought up by some party or other
presenting itself in front the exercise while it inflamed my own
terrors only exasperated the rage of my persecutors and i was
persuaded they would tear me to pieces the moment they caught me judge
of my feelings then when i found myself hemmed in on all sides in a
little field on the skirts of the village with a party close at my
elbow on which i had stumbled without seeing it until roused by its
cries

i looked up and saw that it consisted of about a dozen negroes who
were carrying the body of their companion the unlucky volunteer who
had broken his neck falling from the tree but which body they now
threw upon the ground and with loud screams of he-ah mossa john
and he-ah mossa dickey began to scamper after me with all their
might

there was but one resource left me and that let the reader determine
hereafter of how deplorable a character i made a successful dodge
followed by a dash right through the screaming africans who perhaps
hesitated to lay a rough hand on one of my colour and reaching
the body of their companion cried half to myself and half to the
insensible clay it is better to be a slave than a dead man and
the scourge whatever romantic persons may say to the contrary is
preferable at any time to the halter if thou art dead my sable
brother yield my spirit a refuge in thy useless body

that was the last i remember of the adventure for i had no sooner
uttered the words than i fell into a trance




book vi


containing a history and a moral


 chapter i

in which sheppard lee finds every thing black about him


when i opened my eyes i found that i was lying in a hovel very mean
of appearance yet with a certain neatness and cleanliness about it
that prevented it from looking squalid it is true that the floor
which was of planks was somewhat awry and dilapidated that the little
window which with the door furnished or was meant to furnish its
only light was rather bountifully bedecked with old hats and scraps
of brown paper and that the walls of ill-plastered logs displayed
divers gleaming chinks and vistas through them of the sunny prospects
without nevertheless the place did not look amiss for a poor man
and in my experience as a philanthropist i had seen hundreds much
more miserable

an old woman sat at the fireplace nodding over a stew the fumes of
which were both savoury and agreeable the old woman was however as
black as the outside of her stew-pan in other words a negress and
this circumstance striking upon the chords of association i began to
remember what had lately befallen me a terrible suspicion flashed
into my mind had i not but before i could ask myself the question
my hand which i had raised to scratch my head came into contact with
a mop of elastic wool such as never grew upon the scalp of a white
man i started up in bed and looked at my hands and arms they were of
the hue of ebony or to speak more strictly of smoked mahogany i
saw a fragment of looking-glass hanging on the wall within my reach
i snatched it down and took a survey of my physiognomy miserable
me my face was as black as my arms and indeed somewhat more
so presenting a sable globe broken only by two red lips of immense
magnitude and a brace of eyes as white and as wide as plain china
saucers or peeled turnips

whaw dah cried the old woman roused by the noise i made whaw dat
you nigga tom what you doin dah lorra bless us if a nigga break a
neck can't a nigga hold-a still

alas and had my fate brought me to this grievous pass was there no
other situation in life sufficiently wretched but that i must take
up my lot in the body of a miserable negro slave how idle had been
all my past discontent how foolish the persuasion i had indulged
five different times that i was on each occasion the most unhappy
of men i had forgotten the state of the bondman the condition of
the expatriated african now i was at last to learn in reality
what it was to be the victim of fortune what to be the exemplar of
wretchedness the true repository of all the griefs that can afflict
a human being already i felt in imagination the blow of the
task-master on my back the fetter on my limb the iron in my soul and
when the old woman made a step towards me perhaps to discover why i
made no reply to her questions i was so prepossessed with the idea of
whips and lashes that i made a dodge under the bedclothes as if to
escape a thwack

golly matty is de nigga mad cried the jezebel i say you nigga
tom what you doin how you neck feel now

my neck thought i recollecting that it had been broken and
wondering in what way it had been mended i clapped my hands to it
it was very stiff and sore while i felt at it the old woman told me
some great doctor had twisted a great kink out of it but i bestowed
little notice on what she said my mind ran upon other matters i could
think of nothing but cowhides and cat-o-nine-tails that were to
welcome me to bondage

aunty said i why i addressed the old lady thus i know not but i
have observed that negroes always address their seniors by the titles
of uncle and aunt and i suppose the instinct was on me am i a
slave

what a fool nigga to ax a question said she what you gwying to be
den but old massa jodge's nigga-boy tom what you git up faw ha
 i was making an attempt to rise 

massa docta say you stay a-bed what you git up faw ha

i intend to run away said i and truly that was the notion then
uppermost in my mind and it is very likely i should have made a bolt
for the door that moment had i not discovered an uncommon weakness in
my lower limbs which prevented my getting out of bed

whaw what a fool cried the beldam regarding me with surprise and
contempt what you do when you run away ha who'll hab you who'll
feed you who'll take care of you who'll own a good-fo-nothin
runaway nigga i say ha kick him bout h'yah kick him bout dah
poor despise nigga wid no massa jist as despise as any free nigga you
run away ha what den continued my sable monitress warming into
eloquence as she spoke take up constable clap him in jail salt him
down cowskin dat all no sell him low price send mississippi what
den work in de cotton-field pull at de cane dat all no cussed
overseer wid a long whip cut h'yah cut dah cut high cut low whip
all day cuff all night take all de skin off oh dey do whip to de
debbil in de mississippi and as the old lady concluded to give more
effect to her expressions she fell to rubbing her back and dodging her
head from side to side until i had the liveliest idea in the world of
that very castigation of which i stood in such horror




 chapter ii


in which sheppard lee is introduced to his master


just at this moment to make my anguish more complete in stepped a
tall and dignified person bearing a huge walking-stick with which i
was so certain he would proceed to maul me that i made a second dive
under the bedclothes loudly beseeching him for mercy

to my surprise however instead of beating me he spoke to the old
woman whom he called aunt phoebe and who in return entitled him
massa jodge asked if i was not light-headed said that it was a
great pity i had so hard a time of it that i was very much hurt
that he would be sorry to lose me and so on and in fine expressed
what he said in accents so humane and gentle that i was encouraged
to steal a peep at him seeing which he sat down on a stool felt my
pulse and giving me quite a good-natured look asked me if i felt in
much pain

i was astonished that he should treat me thus if my master but
surveying him more intently i perceived there was little in his
appearance to justify any fears of cruelty he was an aged man with
a head of silver that gave him an uncommonly venerable air and
though his visage was grave it expressed a native good-humour and
amiableness my terrors fled before his soothing accents and benevolent
looks but being still confused i was unable to reply in proper terms
to his questions so that when he asked me as he soon did what i
meant by crying for mercy i made answer oh lord sir i was afraid
you was going to beat me at which he laughed and said my conscience
was growing tenderer than common adding that there was no doubt i
deserved a trouncing as did every other boy on his estate for a set
of greater scoundrels than his was not to be found in all virginia and
if they had their deserts they would get a round dozen apiece every
day

he then began to ask me particularly about my ailments and i judged
from his questions and certain occasional remarks which he let fall
that i had been lying insensible for several days that my neck had
been put out of place or dislocated and reduced again by some
practitioner of uncommon skill and here lest the reader should think
such a circumstance improbable i beg leave to say that i have lately
seen an account of a similar operation performed by an english surgeon
on the neck of a fox-hunting squire and as the story appeared in the
newspapers there can be no doubt of its truth

while the gentleman my master was thus asking me of my pains and
betraying an interest in my welfare that softened my heart towards him
there came into the hovel a young lady of a very sweet countenance
followed by two or three younger girls and a little boy all of whom
seemed glad to see me the little boy in particular shaking me by the
hand while his youthful sisters for all were my master's children
began to drag from a basket and display before my eyes the legs of
a roasted chicken a little tart a jelly and divers other dainty
viands which they had brought with them as they said for poor sick
tom and insisted upon seeing him eat on the spot as for the young
lady the eldest sister she smiled on them and on me for i was not
backward to accept and dispose of the savoury gifts but told me i
must not be imprudent nor eat too much and i would soon be well
what thought i does a slave ever eat too much

it is astonishing what a revolution was effected in my feelings by the
gentle deportment of my master and the kindly act of his children
i looked upon them and myself with entirely new eyes i felt a sort
of affection for them steal through my spirit and i wondered why i
had ever thought of them with fear i took a particular liking to the
little boy who by-the-by was a namesake of mine he being massa
tommy and i plain tom and i had an unaccountable longing come over me
to take him on my back and go galloping on all-fours over the grass at
the door i had no more thoughts of running away to avoid the dreadful
lash and the shame of bonds and my master and his children presently
leaving the hovel having first charged me to keep myself quiet and
easy i fell sound asleep and dreamed i lay a whole day on my back on
a clay-bank eating johnny-cake and fried bacon




 chapter iii


an old woman's cure for a disease extremely prevalent both in the
coloured and uncoloured creation


the next day i was visited again by my master and by other members of
his family whom i had not seen before and of whom i shall say nothing
now having occasion to mention them hereafter the children brought me
goodies as before and little tommy told me to make haste and get
well for there were none of the other boys meaning negroes who
knew how to gallop the cock-horse half so well as i in short i was
treated like a human being and fed like a king and began to grow
wondrous content with my situation the doctor also came and having
fingered about my neck for a while declared my case to be the most
marvellous one ever known and concluded by telling me i was well
enough to get up and that i might do so whenever i chose

now this was a matter of which i was as well satisfied as he could be
being quite certain i never was better in my life but i felt amazing
delight in lolling a-bed doing nothing except feeding on the good
things with which my master's children so liberally supplied me and
i believe had they left the matter to be decided by my own will i
should have been lying on that bed luxuriating in happy laziness to
this day it is certain i fabricated falsehoods without number for
the mere purpose of keeping my bed for whenever my master who came
to inquire about me at least once a day ventured to hint i was well
enough to get up if i would but choose to think so i felt myself
unaccountably impelled to declare with sighs and groans that i could
scarce move a limb and that i suffered endless pangs all which was
false for i was strong as a horse and without any pain whatever

well well my venerable master used to say i know you are cheating
me you rascal but that's the way with you all a negro will be a
negro and sure i have the laziest set of scoundrels on my estate
that ever ate up a good-natured master

unhappily for so i then thought it old aunt phoebe who had been
appointed to nurse me and who was very conscientious about her
master's interest in all cases where her own was not involved was
by no means so easily imposed upon as the old gentleman and on the
seventh day after i opened my eyes she dispelled a pleasing revery in
which i was indulging by bidding me arise and begone i began to plead
my pains can't play possum with me said she good-for-nothin
nigga not worth you cawn and not deigning to employ any other
argument she took a broomstick to me and fairly beat me out of the
hovel i thought it was very odd i should get my first beating of a
fellow-slave and i was somewhat incensed at the old woman for her
cruelty but by-and-by when i had taken a seat in the sunshine
snuffed the fresh autumn air and looked about me a little i fell into
a better humour with her and if that were possible with myself




 chapter iv


some account of ridgewood hill and the author's occupations


my master's lands lay on and near the potomac and his house was
built on a hill which bore his own name and gave name also to the
estate that is ridgewood hill it overlooked that wide and beautiful
river being separated from it only by a lawn which in the centre was
hollow and ran down to the river in a ravine while its flanks or
extremities sloping but gently in their whole course suddenly fell
down to the shore in wooded bluffs that looked very bold and romantic
from the water in the hollow of the lawn was a little brook that
rose from a spring further up the hill and found its way to the river
through the ravine where it made many pretty little pools and cascades
among the bushes while a creek that was wide but shallow swept in
from the river above and went winding away among the hills behind

my master's house was ancient and i must say not in so good repair
as it might have been but there were so many beautiful trees about
it that one would not think of its defects the more especially as it
appeared only the more venerable for them it looked handsome enough
from the river and even from the negro-huts which were nearer the
creek it had an agreeable appearance particularly when the children
were playing together on the lawn which they did and sometimes white
and black together nearly all day long they were thus engaged in
their sports when aunt phoebe drove me from the hovel and i remember
how soon my indignation at the unceremonious ejection was pacified by
looking on the happy creatures thus enjoying themselves on the grass
while my master and his eldest daughter sat on the porch regarding
them with smiles

how greatly i had changed within a few short days instead of being
moved by the sight of juvenile independence and happiness to think of
my own bitter state of servitude i was filled with a foolish glee and
little tommy running up to me with shouts of joy down i dropped on my
hands and knees and taking him on my back began to trot and gallop
and rear and curvet over the lawn to the infinite gratification of
himself his little sisters and the children of my own colour all of
whom rewarded my efforts of horseship with screams of approbation now
the reader will be surprised to hear it but i tom the slave i never
remember to have heard myself called any thing but tom enjoyed this
foolish sport just as much as tommy the rider to whom i felt i think
some such feelings of affection i know not how i got them but feel
them i did as a father experiences while playing the courser to his
own child nay i was thrown into such good-humour and felt so content
with myself that when my master came to me and bade me take care
lest i should hurt myself by my exertions i told him in the fervour
of my heart i was doing very well and that i was as strong as ever i
had been which caused him to laugh and say i was growing marvellous
honest of a sudden

about this time the field-hands returned from their daily labour and
having despatched their evening meal they came the women and children
with them under the trees before the door with banjoes fiddles and
clacking-bones that is a sort of castanets made of the ribs of an
ox and began to sing and dance as was their custom always every fair
evening for my master greatly delighted as he said to see the poor
devils enjoy themselves in which the poor devils were ever ready to
oblige him they had no sooner begun the diversion than i was seized
with an unaccountable desire to join them which i did dancing with
all my might and singing and clapping my hands the merriest and
happiest of them all and this sort of amusement i may as well now
inform the reader we were in the habit of repeating so long as the
mildness of the weather permitted




 chapter v


in which the author further describes his situation and philosophizes
on the state of slavery


having thus shown myself to be perfectly cured of my broken neck it
followed that as a slave i was now compelled to go into the fields
and labour this i did at first very reluctantly but by-and-by i
discovered there was but little toil expected of me or indeed of
any other bondman for the overseer was a good-natured man like his
employer and lazy like ourselves i do not know how it may be with the
slaves on other estates but i must confess that so far as mere labour
went there was less done by and less looked for from my master's
hands than i have ever known to be the case with the white labourers
of new-jersey my master owned extensive tracts of land from which
although now greatly empoverished and almost exhausted he might have
drawn a princely revenue had he exacted of his slaves the degree of
labour always demanded of able-bodied hirelings in a free state but
such was not the custom of virginia or such at least was not the
custom of my master he was of a happy easy temper neglectful of his
interest and though often nay i may say incessantly grumbling at
the flagrant laziness of all who called him master and at the yearly
depreciation of his lands he was content enough if the gains of the
year counterbalanced the expenses and as but a slight degree of toil
was required to effect this happy object it was commonly rendered and
without repugnance on the part of his slaves his great consolation
and he was always pronouncing it to himself and to us was that his
hands were the greatest set of scoundrels in the world which if
unutterable laziness be scoundrelism was true he was pretty generally
beloved by them which i suppose was because he was so good-natured
though many used to tell me they loved him because he was their
right-born master that is put over them by birth and not by
purchase for he lived upon the land occupied by his fathers before
him and his slaves were the descendants of those who had served them

the reader who has seen with what horror and fear i began the life
of a slave may ask if after i found myself restored to health and
strength i sought no opportunity to give my master the slip and make
a bold push for freedom i did not a change had come over the spirit
of my dream i found myself for the first time in my life content
or very nearly so with my condition free from cares far removed
from disquiet and if not actually in love with my lot so far from
being dissatisfied that i had not the least desire to exchange it for
another

methinks i see the reader throw up his hands at this crying what
content with slavery i assure him now i ponder the matter over
that i am as much surprised as himself and that i consider my being
content with a state of bondage a very singular and unaccountable
circumstance nevertheless such was the fact i was no longer sheppard
lee zachariah longstraw nor anybody else except simply tom thomas
or tommy the slave i forgot that i once had been a freeman or to
speak more strictly i did not remember it the act of remembering
involving an effort of mind which it did not comport with my new habits
of laziness and indifference to make though perhaps i might have
done so had i chosen i had ceased to remember all my previous states
of existence i could not have been an african had i troubled myself
with thoughts of any thing but the present

perhaps this defect of memory will account for my being satisfied
with my new condition i had no recollection of the sweets of liberty
to compare and contrast with the disgusts of servitude perhaps my
mind was stupified sunk beneath the ordinary level of the human
understanding and therefore incapable of realizing the evils of my
condition or perhaps after all considering the circumstances of my
lot with reference to those of my mind and nature such evils did not
in reality exist the reader may settle the difficulty for himself
which he can do when he has read a little more of my history in
the meanwhile the fact is true i was satisfied with my lot i was
satisfied even with myself the first time i looked at my new face
i was shocked at what i considered its ugliness but having peeped at
it a dozen times or more my ideas began to alter and by-and-by i
thought it quite beautiful i used to look at myself in aunt phoebe's
glass by the hour and i well remember the satisfaction with which i
listened to the following rebuke of my vanity from her namely all
you pritty young niggurs with handsome faces is good for nothin not
wuth so much as you cawn in short i was something of a coxcomb and
nothing could equal the pride and happiness of my heart when of a
sabbath morning dressed in one of my master's old coats well brushed
up a bran-new rabbit-fur hat the gift of little tommy a ruffled
shirt and a white neckcloth with a pair of leather gloves swinging in
one hand and a peeled beechen wand by way of cane in the other i went
stalking over the fields to church in the little village near to which
my master resided

i say again i cannot account for my being so contented with bondage
it may be however that there is nothing necessarily adverse to
happiness in slavery itself unaccompanied by other evils and that
when the slave is ground by no oppression and goaded by no cruelty he
is not apt to repine or moralize upon his condition nor to seek for
those torments of sentiment which imagination associates with the idea
of slavery in the abstract

of one thing at least i can be very certain i never had so easy and
idle a time of it in my whole life my little master tommy had grown
very fond of me it is strange anybody should be fond of a slave but
it is true it appears i was what they call a mere field-hand that
is a labourer and quite unfit for domestic service nevertheless to
please tommy i was taken from the tobacco-fields and without being
appointed to any peculiar duty about the house was allowed to do what
i pleased provided i made myself sufficiently agreeable to young
master so i made him tops kites wind-mills corn-stalk fiddles and
little shingle ships with paper sails gave him a trot every now and
then on my back and had in return a due share of his oranges and
gingerbread

in this way my time passed along more agreeably than i can describe my
little master it is true used to fall into a passion and thump me now
and then but that i held to be prime fun particularly as provided
i chose to blubber a little and pretend to be hurt the little rogue
would relent and give me all the goodies he could beg borrow or
steal to make up with me as he called it

little tommy and his sisters four in number were the children of my
master by a second wife who had died two years before the oldest was
the young lady of whom i have already spoken and she was i believe
not above seventeen her name was isabella and she was uncommonly
handsome a young gentleman of the neighbourhood named andrews was
paying court to her indeed she had a great many admirers and there
was much company came to see her

my master's oldest son the only child left by his first wife lived
on a plantation beyond the creek being already married and having
children his name was george like his father and the slaves used
to distinguish them as massa cunnel jodge and massa maja jodge
for all the gentlemen in those parts were either colonels or majors
the major's seat being at so short a distance and the plantation he
cultivated a part of the colonel's great estate of ridgewood hill
we used to regard him as belonging still to our master's family and
the slaves on both plantations considered themselves as forming but
a single community nevertheless we of the south side had a sort
of contempt for those of the north for massa maja though a good
master was by no means so easy as his father he exacted more work
and when he rode into the fields on our side as he often did he used
to swear at us for lazy loons and declare he would some day or other
turn over a new leaf with us




 chapter vi

recollections of slavery


i must again repeat what i have said namely that i was contented with
my servile condition and that i was so far from looking back with
regret to my past life of freedom that i ceased at last to remember
it altogether i was troubled with no sense of degradation afflicted
with no consciousness of oppression and instead of looking upon my
master as a tyrant who had robbed me of my rights i regarded him as a
great and powerful friend whose protection and kindness i was bound to
requite with a loyal affection and with so much of the labour of my
hands as was necessary to my own subsistence what would have been my
feelings had my master been really a cruel and tyrannical man i will
not pretend to say but doubtless they would have been the opposite of
those i have confessed

the above remarks apply equally to my fellow-bondmen of whom there
were young and old and men and women together more than a hundred
on the two estates the exact number i never knew but i remember
there were above twenty able-bodied men or full hands as they were
called when all were mustered together there were many especially
among the women who were great grumblers but that was their nature
such a thing as serious discontent was i am persuaded entirely
unknown the labours of the plantation were light the indulgences
granted frequent and many there was scarce a slave on the estate
who if he laboured at all did not labour more for himself than his
master for all had their little lots or gardens the produce of which
was entirely their own and which they were free to sell to whomsoever
they listed and hard merchants they were sometimes even to my master
when he would buy of them as he often did i remember one day seeing
old aunt phoebe to whom he had sent to buy some chickens fall into a
passion and refuse to let the messenger have any because her master
had forgotten to send the money go tell old massa jodge said she
with great ire i no old fool to be cheated out of my money and i
don't vally his promise to pay not dat snapping her fingers he
owe me two ninepence already and the old gentleman was compelled to
send her the cash before she complied with his wishes

the truth is my master was in some respects a greater slave than
his bondmen and all the tyranny i ever witnessed on the estate was
exercised by them and at his expense for there was a general
conspiracy on the part of all to cheat him as far as was practicable
out of their services while they were all the time great sticklers
for their own rights and privileges he was as i have said before
universally beloved but his good-nature was abused a thousand times a
day

there existed no substantial causes for dissatisfaction and there was
therefore the best reason for content singing and dancing were more
practised than hard work in a word my master's slaves were an idle
worthless set but as happy as the day was long i may say the same
of myself i certainly was a very merry and joyous personage and my
companions who envied me for being the favourite of young master used
to call me giggling tom

but there is an end to the mirth of the slave as well as the joy of
the master a cloud at last came betwixt me and the sun a new thought
awoke in my bosom bringing with it a revolution of feeling which
extended to the breasts of all my companions it was but a small cause
to produce such great effects but an ounce of gunpowder may be made to
blow up an army and a drop of venom from the lip of a dog may cause
the destruction of a whole herd





 chapter vii


a scene on the banks of the potomac with the humours of an african
improvisatore


beneath the bluff and at the mouth of the creek which divided the two
plantations was a wharf or landing where our fishing-boats for we
had a good fishery hard by used to discharge their cargoes and where
also small shallops coming with supplies to the plantation put out
their freight here one day some seven or eight of the hands were
engaged removing a cargo of timber which had just been discharged by
a small vessel my master having bought it for the express purpose of
repairing the negro-houses and building a new one for a fellow that
was to be married for it seems his crops of corn and tobacco had
turned out unusually well and when that happened the slaves were the
first who received the benefit

hither i strolled having nothing better to do to take a position
on the side of the bluff where i could both bask in the sunshine
which was very agreeable for it was now the end of october though
fine weather and overlook the hands working which was still more
agreeable for i had uncommon satisfaction to look at others labouring
while i myself was doing nothing

having selected a place to my liking i lay down on the warm clay
enjoying myself while the others intermitted their labour to abuse
me crying cuss lazy nigga gigglin tom dah why you no come down
work having employed themselves at which for a time they resumed
their labours and i turning over on my back and taking a twig that
grew nigh betwixt my teeth began to think to myself what an agreeable
thing it was to be a slave and have nothing to do

by-and-by hearing a great chattering and laughing among the men below
i looked down and beheld one of them diverting himself with a ludicrous
sport frequently practised by slaves to whom the lash is unknown he
was frisking and dodging about pretty much as aunt phoebe had done
when endeavouring to show me how the whip was handled in mississippi
and like her he rubbed his back now here now there now with the
right now with the left hand now ducking to the earth now jumping
into the air as though some lusty overseer were plying him whip in
hand with all his might the wonder of the thing was however that
governor for that was the fellow's name had in his hand a pamphlet
or sheet of printed paper the contents of which he was endeavouring
both to convey to his companions and to illustrate by those ridiculous
antics the contents of the paper were varied for varied also was the
representation

dah you go nigga he cried leaping as if from a blow slap on'e
leg hit right on'e shin yah yah yah chah chah ch-ch-ch-ch-ah
chah chah massa oh de dam overseeah dat de way he whip a nigga
then pausing a moment and turning a leaf of the book he fell to
leaping again crying what dat dat you rose what you been
doin stealin sugah

 jump you nigga gal
 hab a hard massa
 so much you git for stealin sugah
 so much for lickin lassa

dem hard massa licky de gals

 ole vaginnee nebber ti-ah
 what e debbil's de use ob floggin like fia-ah

then came another scene yah yah yah what dat massa maja kickin
de pawson i say whaw pawson jim you jim pawson he-ah you git'em
and then another lorra-gorry what he-ah he-ah a nigga tied up in a
gum 

 oh de possum up de gum-tree
 coony in de hollow
 two white men whip a nigga
 how de nigga holla

jump nigga jump yah yah yah did you ebber see de debbil jump
nigga jump two white men whip a nigga gib a nigga fay-ah play

 when de white man comes to sticky sticky
 lorra-gorr he licky licky

gib a nigga fay-ah play

and so he went on describing and acting what he affected to read
to the infinite delight of his companions who ceasing their work
crowded round him to snatch a peep at the paper which i observed no
one got a good look at without jumping back immediately rubbing his
sides and launching into other antics in rivalry with governor




 chapter viii


the author descends among the slaves and suddenly becomes a man of
figure and an interpreter of new doctrines


i was moved with curiosity to know what they had laid their hands
on and i descended the bank to solve the mystery the paper had
passed from the hands of governor to those of a fellow named jim or
parson jim as we usually called him for he was fond of praying and
preaching which he had been allowed to do until detected in a piece
of roguery a few weeks before by master major who besides putting a
check on his clerical propensities for the future saluted him with
two or three kicks well laid on on the spot it was to this personage
and his punishment that governor alluded when he cried what he-ah
massa maja kickin de pawson as mentioned above although a great
rogue he was a prime favourite among the negroes who had a great
respect for his learning for he could read print and was even thought
to have some idea of writing this fellow was employed on the present
occasion at the ox-cart and as it is no part of a slave's system to
do the work of others he had been sitting apart singing a psalm while
the others were loading his cart and apart he had remained until
a call was made upon him to explain so much of the paper being the
printed portion as governor could not the paper it is here proper
to observe had been found by governor among the boards and scantling
though how it got there no one knew nor was it ever discovered it
was a pamphlet or magazine i know not which and the name i have
unfortunately forgotten containing besides a deal of strange matter
about slavery some half a dozen or more wood-cuts representing
negroes in chains under the lash exposed in the market for sale and
i know not what other situations and it was these which had afforded
the delighted governor so much matter for mimicry and merriment
there was one cut on the first page serving as a frontispiece it
represented a negro kneeling in chains and raising his fettered hands
in beseeching to a white man who was lashing him with a whip beneath
it was a legend which being or being deemed explanatory of the
picture and at the same time the initial sentence of the book parson
jim was essaying to read and thus it was he proceeded 

t-h-e the dat's de f-a-t-e fat de fat o-f ob de
fat ob t-h-e de de fat ob de s-l-a-v-e slave de fat ob
de slave my gorry what's dat brederen i can't say as how i
misprehends dat

yah yah yah roared governor plain as de nose on you face de
fat ob de slave what he mean heh why gorry you dumb nigga he
mean massa dah is whippin de fat out ob de nigger dem hard massa
dat-ah heh whip de fat out

lorra-gorry massa don't like you whippy
don't sell gubbe'nor down a mississippi

let me read it said i

you read you nigga whar you larn to read cried my friends it
was a question i could not well answer for as i said before the
memory of my past existence had quite faded from my mind nevertheless
i had a feeling in me as if i could read and taking the book from
the parson i succeeded in deciphering the legend the fate of the
slave

whaw dat said governor de chain and de cowhide does de book say
dat's de luck for nigga don't b'leeb m dem lie massa cunnel
nebber lick a nigga in m life

the reading of that little sentence seemed i know not why to have
cast a sudden damper on the spirits of all present until that moment
there had been much shouting laughing and mimicking of the pains of
men undergoing flagellation every picture had been examined commented
on and illustrated with glee it associated only the idea of some idle
vagabond or other winning his deserts a new face a new interpretation
was given to the matter by the words i had read the chain and scourge
appeared no longer as the punishment of an individual they were to be
regarded as the doom of the race the laughing and mimicry ceased and
i beheld around me nothing but blank faces it was manifest however
that the feeling was rather indignation than anxiety and that my
friends looked upon the ominous words as a libel upon their masters and
themselves

what for book say dat cried governor who from being the merriest
had now become the angriest of all who ebber hear of chain a nigga
escept nigga runaway or nigga gwyin down gin will to mississippi
who ebber hear of lash a nigga escept nigga sassbox nigga thief
nigga drunk nigga break hoss leg

brudders said parson jim this here is a thing what is portant to
hear on for blessed be gorra-matty there is white men what writes
books what is friends of the vaginnee niggur

all cuss bobbolitionist said governor with sovereign
contempt don't b'leeb in m who says chain nigga in vaginnee who
says cowhide nigga in vaginnee de fate ob de slave cuss lie an't
i slave hah who chains gubbe'nor who licks gubbe'nor little book
big lie

and little book big lie echoed all in extreme wrath the parson
took things more coolly he rolled his eyes hitched up his collar
stroked his chin and suggesting the propriety of reading a little
farther proposed that brudder tom who had an uncommon good hidear
of that ar sort of print should hunt out the root of the matter and
lamented that it was a sort of print he could not well get along
with without his spectacles




 chapter ix


what it was the negroes had discovered among the scantling


thus called upon i made a second essay and succeeded though not
without pain in deciphering enough of the text to give me a notion of
the object for which the tract had been written it was entitled an
address to the owners of slaves and could not therefore be classed
among those incendiary publications which certain over-zealous
philanthropists are accused of sending among slaves themselves to
inflame them into insurrection and murder no such imputation could be
cast upon the writer his object was of a more humane and christian
character it was to convince the master he was a robber and villain
and by this pleasing mode of argument induce him to liberate his
bond-men the only ill consequence that might be produced was that the
book might provided it fell into their hands convince the bondmen
of the same thing but that was a result for which the writer was not
responsible he addressed himself only to the master it began with the
following pithy questions and answers or something very like them 
for i cannot pretend to recollect them to the letter

why scourgest thou this man and why dost thou hold him in bonds is
he a murderer a house-burner a ravisher a blasphemer a thief no
what then is the crime for which thou art punishing him so bitterly he
is a negro and my slave

then followed a demand how he became and by what right the master
claimed him as a slave to which the master replied by right of
purchase exhibiting at the same time a bill of sale at this the
querist expressed great indignation and calling the master a robber
cheat and usurper bade him show as the only title a christian would
sanction a bill of sale signed by the negro's maker who alone had
the right to dispose of man's liberty and he concluded the paragraph
by averring that the claim was fraudulent that the slave was
unjustly treacherously unrighteously held in bonds and that he was
or of right should be as free as the master himself

here i paused for breath my companions looked at me with eyes staring
out of their heads astonishment suspicion and fear were depicted in
their countenances a new idea had entered their brains all opened
their mouths but governor was the only one who could speak and he
stuttered and stammered in his eagerness so much that i could scarcely
understand him

wh-wh-wh-wh-what dat he cried hab a right to fr-fr-fr-freedom
case gorra-matty no s-s-s-sell me why den wh-wh-wh-who's slave
gorra-matty no trade in niggurs i say you pawson jim wh-wh-wh-what
you say dat doctrine the parson was dumb-founded the difficulty
was solved by an old negro who rolled his quid of tobacco and his eyes
together and said

whaw de debbil's de difference massa cunnel no buy us we born
him slave ebbery nigga he-ah

unluckily the very next paragraph was opened by the quotation from the
declaration of independence that all men were born free and equal
which was asserted to be true of all men negroes as well as others
from which it followed that the master's claim to the slave born in
thraldom was as fraudulent as in the case of one obtained by purchase

whaw dat said governor decoration of independence say dat
gen'ral jodge washington him make dat and gen'ral tommie jefferson
him put hand to it all men born free and equal a nigga is a man
who says no to dat how come massa cunnel to be massa den

that question had never before been asked on ridgewood hill but all
now asked it and all for the first time in their lives began to
think of their master as a foe and usurper the strangely-expressed
idea in the pamphlet namely that none but their maker could
rightfully sell them to bondage and that other in relation to natural
freedom and equality had captivated their imaginations and made an
impression on their minds not readily to be forgotten black looks
passed from one to another and angry expressions were uttered and i
know not where the excitement that was fast awaking would have ended
had not our master himself suddenly made his appearance descending the
bluff

for the first time in their lives the slaves beheld his approach with
terror and all darting upon the timber began to labour with a zeal
and bustling eagerness which they had never shown before but first
the pamphlet was snatched out of my hands and concealed in a hollow of
the bank our uncommon industry for even parson jim and myself were
seized with a fit of zeal and gave our labour with the rest somewhat
surprised the venerable old man but as the timber was destined to
contribute to our own comforts he attributed it to a selfish motive
and chiding us good-humouredly and with a laugh said that's the
way with you you rogues you can work well enough when it is for
yourselves

dat's all de tanks we gits muttered governor hard by wonder if we
ha'n't a better right to work than massa jodge to make us




 chapter x


the effect of the pamphlet on its reader and hearers


we had seen the last day of content on ridgewood hill that little
scrap of paper thrown among us perhaps by accident or as i have
sometimes thought dropped by the fiend of darkness himself had
conjured up a thousand of his imps who one after another took
up their dwelling in our breasts until their name was legion my
fellow-slaves cared little now for singing and dancing their only
desire in the intervals of labour was to assemble together below the
bluff and dive deeper into the mysteries of the pamphlet and as i
was the only one who could explain them and was ready enough to do
so i often neglected my little friend tommy to preside over their
convocations

nor were these meetings confined to the original finders of the
precious document the news had been whispered from man to man and
the sensation spread over the whole estate so that those who lived
with the major were as eager to escape from their labours and listen to
the new revelation as ourselves nay so great was the curiosity among
them that many who could not come when i was present to expound the
secrets of the book would betake themselves to the bluff to indulge a
look at it and guess out its contents as they could from the pictures
and by-and-by the news having spread to a distance we had visiters
also from the gangs of other plantations

it was perhaps a week or more before the composition was read through
and understood by us all and in that time it had wrought a revolution
in our feelings as surprising as it was fearful and now lest the
reader should doubt that the great effects i am about to record should
have really arisen from so slight a cause as a little book i think it
proper to tell him more fully than i have done what that little book
contained

it was as i have said an address to the owners of slaves and its
object purported to be to awaken their minds to the cruelty injustice
and wickedness of slavery this was sought to be effected in the
first place by numerous cuts representing all the cruelties and
indignities that negro slaves had suffered or could suffer either in
reality or in the imaginations of the philanthropists some of these
were horrible many shocking and all disgusting and some of them
i think were copied out of fox's book of martyrs though of that i
am not certain the moral turpitude and illegality of the institution
were shown or attempted to be shown now by arguments that were
handled like daggers and broad-axes and now by savage denunciations
of the enslaver and oppressor who were proved to be murderers
blasphemers tyrants devils and i know not what beside the vengeance
of heaven was invoked upon their heads coupled with predictions of
the retribution that would sooner or later fall upon them these being
borne out by monitory allusions to the servile wars of rome syria
egypt sicily st domingo c c it was threatened that heaven would
repeat the plagues of egypt in america to punish the task-masters of
the ethiopian as it had punished those of the israelite and that
in addition the horrors of hayti would be enacted a second time and
within our own borders it was contended that the negro was in organic
and mental structure the white man's equal if not his superior and
that there was a peculiar injustice in subjecting to bondage his
race which had been or so the writer averred in the earlier days of
the world the sole possessors of knowledge and civilization and there
were many triumphant references to hannibal queen sheba cleopatra
and the pharaohs all of whom were proved to have been woolly-headed
and as bright in spirit as they were black in visage in short the
book was full of strange things and among others of insurrection and
murder though it is but charitable to suppose that the writer did not
know it

there was scarce a word in it that did not contribute to increase the
evil spirit which its first paragraph had excited among my companions
it taught them to look on themselves as the victims of avarice the
play-things of cruelty the foot-balls of oppression the most injured
people in the world and the original greatness of their race which
was an idea they received with uncommon pleasure and its reviving
grandeur in the liberated hayti convinced them they possessed the
power to redress their wrongs and raise themselves into a mighty
nation

with the sense of injury came a thirst for revenge my companions began
to talk of violence and dream of blood a week before there was not one
of them who would not have risked his life to save his master's the
scene was now changed my master walked daily though without knowing
it among volcanoes all looked upon him askant and muttered curses
as he passed a kinder-hearted man and easier master never lived
and it may seem incredible that he should be hated without any real
cause imaginary causes are however always the most efficacious in
exciting jealousy and hatred in affairs of the affections slaves and
the members of political factions are equally unreasonable the only
difference in the effect is that the one cannot while the other can
and does change his masters when his whim changes

that fatal book infected my own spirit as deeply as it did those of
the others and made me as sour and discontented as they i began to
have sentimental notions about liberty and equality the dignity of
man the nobleness of freedom and so-forth and a stupid ambition a
vague notion that i was born to be a king or president or some such
great personage filled my imagination and made me a willing listener
to and sharer in the schemes of violence and desperation which my
fellow-slaves soon began to frame it is wonderful that among the many
thoughts that now crowded my brain no memory of my original condition
arose to teach me the folly of my desires but and i repeat it again
the past was dead with me i lived only for the present

a little incident that soon befell me will show the reader how
completely my feelings were identified with my condition and how
deeply the lessons of that unlucky pamphlet had sunk into my spirit
my little playmate master tommy who was not above six years old
being of an irascible temper sometimes quarrelled with me on which
occasions as i mentioned before he used to beat me a liberty i
rather encouraged than otherwise since i gained by it though my
master strictly forbade the youth to take it now as soon as my
head began to fill with the direful and magnificent conceptions of a
malecontent and conspirator i waxed weary of child's play and master
tommy who falling into a passion with me for that reason proceeded
on a certain occasion to pommel my ribs with a fist about equal in
weight to the paw of a gadfly i was incensed i may say enraged at
the poor child and repaid the violence by shaking him almost to death
indeed i felt for a while as if i could have killed him and i know
not whether i might not have done it for the devil had on the sudden
got into my spirit had not his father discovered what i was doing
and run to his assistance

i then pretended that i had shaken him in sport and thus escaped
a drubbing of which i was at first in danger the threat of this
however sank deeply into my mind and i ever after felt a deep hatred
of both father and son this may well be called a blind malice for
neither had given me any real cause for it




 chapter xi


the hatching of a conspiracy


in the meanwhile the devil was doing his work among the others and
disaffection grew into wrath and fury that were not so perfectly
concealed but that my master or rather his eldest son who was of a
more observant disposition began to suspect that mischief was brewing
and in a short time it was reported among us that our master had
marked some of us as being dangerous and was resolved to sell us to a
mississippi trader who was then in the county this was reported by a
spy a house-servant who professed to have overheard the conversation
and who reported besides that our master and his son were furbishing
up their fire-arms and laying in terrible supply of balls and powder

now whether this account was true or not i never knew and i suppose i
never shall until i am in my grave it was enough however to drive
us to a phrensy those in particular who had been indicated as the
intended victims of the mississippi trader and the more especially
as those men had wives and children from whom they were told they
were to be parted one of these was the blacksmith of the estate
who being a resolute and fierce-tempered fellow instantly began to
convert all the old horseshoes and iron hoops about his shop into a
kind of blades or spear-heads which we fastened upon poles and hid
away in secret places there were among us three or four men who had
muskets with which they used to shoot wild fowl on the river there
being great abundance at this season these weapons were also put into
requisition besides which we stored away butcher-knives and bludgeons
old scythe-blades and sickles beaten straight until we could boast
quite an armory and here i may observe that the faster these weapons
increased upon our hands the more deadly became our resolutions the
more fierce and malignant our desires until having at last what we
thought a sufficiency for our purpose we gave a loose to our passions
and determined upon a plan of proceedings that may well be called
infernal

i believe that when we began to collect these offensive weapons
we had but vague ideas of mischief thinking rather of defending
ourselves from some meditated outrage on the part of our master than
of beginning an assault upon him ourselves but now the armory being
complete and several cunning fellows who had been spying out among
the surrounding plantations bringing us word that the gangs so they
sometimes call the whole number of hands on a farm of most of them
were ready to strike with us for freedom another having brought us
word that a great outbreaking had already taken place south of james
river which however was not true a third reminding us that we were
more numerous than our masters and a fourth bidding us remember that
the negroes had once as the little book told us been the masters of
all the white men in the world and might be again i say these things
being represented to us as we were handling our arms and thinking what
execution we could do with them we shook hands together and kissing
the little pamphlet for which we had conceived a high regard as we
had seen white men kiss the book in courts of law we swore we would
exterminate all the white men in virginia beginning with our master
and his family




 chapter xii


how the spoils of victory were intended to be divided


the chief men in the conspiracy were by all consent the fellow called
governor of whom i have said so much before parson jim who although
a little in the background at first had soon taken a foremost stand
and was indeed the first to propose murder myself not that i was
really very active or fiery in the matter but because i had become
prominent as the reader of the little book cesar the blacksmith
and a fellow named zip or scipio who was the chief fiddler and
banjo-player and had been therefore in great favour with the family
until he lost it by some misconduct

the parson having uttered the diabolical proposal i mentioned before
and seeing it well received got up to make a speech to inflame our
courage there was in his oration a good deal of preaching with a
considerable sprinkling of scraps from the bible such as he had picked
up in the course of his clerical career what he chiefly harped on was
that greatness of the negro nation spoken of before and he discoursed
so energetically of the great kings and generals the great faroes and
cannibals as he called them who had distinguished the race in olden
time that all became ambitious to figure with similar dignity in story

what you speak faw pawson said governor interrupting him and
looking round with the air of a lord i be king hah and hab my
sarvants to wait on me

what you say dah gub'nor cried zip the fiddler with equal spirit
you be king i be president

i be emp'ror like dat ah nigga in high-ty said another

i be constable cried a fourth

you be cuss you no go for de best man cried governor in a heat
i be constable myself and i lick any nigga i like who say me no
hah i smash him brain out dem nigga governor was a tyrant already
and all began to be more or less afraid of him i'll be de great man
and i shall hab my choice ob de women what you say dat i sall hab
missa isabella faw my wife who say me no dah

berry well cried scipio i hab missa edie that is miss edith
the next in age who was however not yet thirteen and therefore but
a poor little child

brudder zip said jim the parson i speak fust dah the labourer is
wordy ob his hiah i shall put my hand to de plough and i shall hab
missa edie for my wife arter me if you please brudder zip

hold you jaw zip said king governor to the fiddler who was ready
to knock the parson down you shall hab massa maja's wife and you
shall cut his head off fust as faw de oder niggas he-ah what faw use
ob quar'lin we shall have wifes enough when we kills white massas
gorry we shall hab pick

and thus my companions apportioned among themselves in prospective
the wives and daughters of their intended victims and thus doubtless
they would have apportioned them in reality had the bloody enterprise
been allowed the success its projectors anticipated i remember that my
blood suddenly froze within my veins when the conspiracy had reached
this point and the idea of seeing those innocent helpless maidens
made the prey of brutal murderers was so shocking to my spirit that i
lost speech and could scarce support myself on my feet

while i stood thus confused among them the conspirators determined
upon a plan of action by which as far as i understood it the houses
of my master and his son the two being previously murdered were to
be set on fire at the same moment on the following night and at the
sight of the flames the slaves on several neighbouring plantations were
to fall upon their masters in like manner after which the gangs from
all the burnt estates were to meet at a common rendezvous and march
in a body against the neighbouring village the sacking of which they
joyously looked forward to as the first step in a career of conquest
and triumph in other words of murder and rapine

who would have thought that a little book framed by a philanthropist
for the humane purpose of turning his neighbour from the error of his
way should have lighted a torch in his dwelling only to be quenched
by blood i am myself a witness that the pamphlet was not one of those
incendiary publications of which so much is said as being designed
for the eyes of slaves themselves to exasperate them to revolt by no
means it was addressed to the master and of course was only designed
for him why the pictures were put in it however i cannot imagine
since it may be supposed the master could understand the argument and
exhortation of the writer well enough without them perhaps they were
intended to divert his children

the book however whatever may have been the object for which it was
written had the effect to make a hundred men who were previously
contented with their lot in life and perhaps as happy as any other men
ordained to a life of labour the victims of dissatisfaction and range
the enemies of those they had once loved and in fine the contrivers
and authors of their own destruction




 chapter xiii


the attack of the insurgents upon the mansion at ridgewood hill


i said that when the conspiracy reached the crisis mentioned before
i was suddenly seized with terror i began to think with what kindness
i had been treated by those i had leagued to destroy and the baseness
and ingratitude of the whole design struck me with such force that
i was two or three times on the point of going to my master and
revealing it to him while he had yet the power to escape but my fears
of him and of my fellow-ruffians deterred me i thought he looked
fierce and stern and as for my companions i conceited that they were
watching me dogging my every step prepared to kill me the moment i
attempted to play them false it was unfortunate that my rudeness to
master tommy had caused me to be banished the house for although my
master did not beat me he was persuaded my violence in that case was
not altogether jocose and therefore punished me by sending me to the
fields hence i had no opportunity to see him in private unless i had
sought it which would have exposed me to observation

the night came and it came to me bringing such gloom and horror that
my agitation was observed by governor and others who railed at me for
a coward and threatened to take my life if i did not behave more like
a man this only increased my alarm and truly my disorder of mind
became so great that i was in a species of stupid distraction when the
moment for action arrived for which reason i retain but a confused
recollection of the first events and cannot therefore give a clear
relation of them

i remember that there was some confusion produced by an unexpected act
on the part of our master who it was generally supposed designed
crossing the creek to visit the major having ordered his carriage and
the ferry-boat to be got ready and it was resolved to kill him while
crossing the creek on his return after which we were to fire a volley
of guns as a signal to the major's gang and then assault and burn our
master's dwelling instead of departing however when the night came
he remained at home shut up with the overseer and young mr andrews
his daughter's lover and it was reported that they had barred up the
doors and windows and were sitting at a table covered with loaded
pistols thus making it manifest that they suspected our intentions
and were resolved to defend themselves to the last

for my part i have never believed that our master suspected his
danger at all he perceived indeed that an ill spirit had got among
his people but neither he nor any of his family really believed that
mischief was intended had they done so he would undoubtedly have
procured assistance or at least removed his children the windows were
barred indeed and perhaps earlier than usual which may have been
accidental and as for the fire-arms on the table i believe they were
only fowling-pieces which my master mr andrews and the overseer
who was a great fowler and therefore much favoured by my master who
was a veteran sportsman were getting ready to shoot wild ducks with in
the morning

my companions however were persuaded that our victims were on their
guard and the hour drawing nigh at which they had appointed to strike
the first blow and give the signal to the neighbouring gangs they
were at a loss not knowing what to do for they were afraid to attack
the house while three resolute men armed with pistols stood ready to
receive them in this conjuncture it was proposed by governor who
from having been a fellow notorious for nothing save monkey tricks and
waggery was now become a devil incarnate he was so bold cunning and
eager for blood to fire the pile of timber where it stood near the
quarters or negro-huts the burning of which would serve the double
purpose of drawing our intended victims from the house and giving the
signal to the neighbouring estates

the proposal was instantly adopted and in a few moments the pile of
dry resinous wood was in a flame burning with prodigious violence
and casting a bright light over the whole mansion the lawn and even
the neighbouring river at the same moment and just as we were about
to raise the treacherous alarm we heard a sudden firing of guns and
shouting beyond the creek at the major's house which made us suppose
the negroes there had anticipated us in the rising

emulous not to be outdone our own party now set up a horrid alarm of
fire accompanied with screams and yells that might have roused the
dead and ran to the mansion door as if to demand assistance of their
master

never shall i forget the scene that ensued i stood rooted to the
ground not twenty steps from the house when the door was thrown
open and my master rushed out followed by andrews and the overseer
they had scarce put foot on the porch before six or seven guns being
all that the conspirators could muster and which the owners held in
readiness were discharged at them and then they were set upon by
others with the spears the light of the fire illuminated the porch
so that objects were plainly distinguishable yet so violent was the
rush of assailants so wild the tumult so brief the contest that i
can scarce say i really witnessed the particulars of the tragedy i
beheld indeed my master's gray hairs for he was of towering stature
floating an instant over the heads of the assailants but the next
moment they had vanished and i saw but a single white man struggling
in the hall against a mass of foes and crying out to miss isabella
by name to escape with the children vain counsel vain sacrifice
of safety to humanity the faithful overseer for it was he who made
this heroic effort to save his master's children his master and young
andrews lying dead or mortally wounded on the porch was cut down on
the spot and the shrieks of the children as they fled some into the
open air by a back door and others to the upper chambers and the
savage yells of triumph with which they were pursued told how vainly
he had devoted himself to save them




 chapter xiv

the tragical occurrences that followed


while i stood thus observing the horrors i had been instrumental in
provoking as incapable of putting a stop to as of assisting in them
i saw two of the children little tommy and his youngest sister lucy
a girl of seven or eight years running wildly over the lawn several
of my ruffian companions pursuing them the girl was snatched up by old
aunt phoebe who with other women had come among us wringing her
hands and beseeching us not to kill their young misses and was thus
saved as for the boy he caught sight of me and sprang into my arms
entreating me not to let them kill him and he would never hurt me
again in all his life and would give me all his money

poor child i would have defended him at that moment with my life for
my heart bled for what had already been done but he was snatched out
of my hands and i saw no more of him i heard afterward however that
he was not hurt having been saved by the women who had protected in
like manner his two little sisters jane and lucy as for the others
that is isabella and edith i witnessed their fate with my own eyes
and it was the suddenness and horror of it that by unmanning me
entirely prevented my giving aid to the boy when he was torn from my
arms

the fire had by this time spread from the timber to an adjacent cabin
and a light equal to that of noon though red as blood itself was
shed over the whole mansion on the roof of which was a little cupola
or observatory open to the weather where was room for five or six
persons to sit together and enjoy the prospect of the river and
surrounding hills and on either side of this cupola was a platform
though without a balustrade on which was space for as many more

the observatory being strongly illuminated by the flames and my
eyes being turned thitherward by a furious yell which was suddenly
set up around me i beheld my master's daughter isabella rush into
it that is into the observatory from the staircase below hotly
pursued as was evident from what followed she bore in her arms or
rather dragged after her for the child was in a swoon her sister
edith who was but small of stature and light and as she reached this
forlorn place of refuge she threw down the trapdoor that covered its
entrance and endeavoured to keep it down with her foot there was
something inexpressibly fearful in her appearance independent of the
dreadfulness of her situation separated only by a narrow plank from
ruffians maddened by rage and carnage from whom death itself was a
boon too merciful to be expected and from whom she was to guard not
only herself but the feeble unconscious being hanging on her neck
her hair was all dishevelled her dress torn and disordered and her
face as white as snow yet there was a wild energy and fierceness
breathing from every feature and she looked like a lioness defending
to the last her young from the hunters from whom she yet knows there
is no escape

the trapdoor shook under her foot and was at last thrown violently
up and up with screams of triumph darted the infuriated governor
followed by jim and others to grasp their prey their prey had fled
without uttering a word or scream she sprang from the cupola to the
platform at its side and then with a fearlessness only derived from
desperation and still bearing her insensible sister she stepped upon
the roof which was high and steep and ran along it to its extremity

even the ferocious governor was for a moment daunted at the boldness of
the act and afraid to follow until the parson well worthy he of the
name set him the example by leaping on the shingles and pursuing the
unhappy girl to her last refuge he approached he stretched forth his
arm to seize her but he was not destined to lay an impure touch on the
devoted and heroic creature i saw her lay her lips once on those of
the poor edith the next instant the frail figure of the little sister
was hurled from her arms to be dashed to pieces on the stones below
in another the hapless isabella herself had followed her having
thrown herself headlong from the height to escape by death a fate
otherwise inevitable

of what followed i have but a faint and disordered recollection i
remember that the fall of the two maidens caused loud cries of horror
from the men and of lamentation from the women and i remember also
that these were renewed almost immediately after but mingled with the
sound of fire-arms discharged by a party of foes and the voices of
white men among which i distinguished that of my master's son the
major calling upon one another to give no quarter to the miscreants
a party of armed horsemen had in fact ridden among us and were now
dealing death on all hands from pistols and sabres from one of the
latter weapons i myself received a severe cut and was at the same time
struck down by the hoofs of a horse and left insensible




 chapter xv


the results of the insurrection with a truly strange and fatal
catastrophe that befell the author


when i recovered my senses i found myself a prisoner bound hand
and foot and lying with six or seven of my late companions in a
cart in which groaning with pain for most of us were wounded and
anticipating a direful end to our dreams of conquest and revenge we
were trundled to the village and there deposited in the county jail
to repent at leisure the rashness and enormity of our enterprise

the power of that little pamphlet of which i have said so much to
produce an effect for which we must charitably suppose it was not
intended was shown in the numbers of wretches by whom the prison
was crowded for it had been used to inflame the passions of the
negroes on several different estates all of whom had agreed to rise
in insurrection although as it providentially happened the revolt
extended to the length of murder only on ridgewood hill the conspiracy
was detected i believe confessed by a slave on a plantation adjacent
to that of my master's son who being informed of it and assisted
by a party that brought the news proceeded to seize the ringleaders
in his own gang some of whom attempting to make their escape were
fired on and this was the cause of the volley which we had heard
and supposed was fired by our fellow-conspirators beyond the creek
the major then crossed over to his father's estate but too late to
avert the tragedy which i have related his father his eldest sister
and her lover were already dead as for the younger edith she was
taken up alive but cruelly mangled and she expired in a few hours
the faithful and devoted overseer i have the happiness to believe
ultimately escaped with his life for although covered with wounds
and at first reported dead he revived sufficiently to make deposition
to the facts of the assault and murder as far as he was cognizant of
them and i heard he was expected to recover

of those who perished the father the children and the gallant
friend there was not one who was not a fortnight before respected
and beloved by those who slew them and at their death-hour they were
as guiltless of wrong and as deserving of affection and gratitude
as they ever had been how therefore they came to be hated and why
they were killed i am unable to divine all that i know is that we
who loved them read a book which fell in our way and from that moment
knew them only as enemies objects on whom we had a right to glut our
fiercest passions

as for ourselves my deluded companions at least their fate can be
easily imagined some were killed at the scene of murder among others
the chief leader governor who was shot on the roof of the house
parson jim was wounded on the same place and rolling from the roof
was horribly crushed by the fall but lingered in unspeakable agonies
for several days and then died scipio the fiddler was taken alive
tried condemned and executed with many others whose participation in
the crime left them no hope of mercy

with these i was myself put upon trial and adjudged to death for
although it was made apparent that i had not lifted my hand against any
one it was proved that i was more than privy to the plot that i had
been instrumental in fomenting it and the known favour with which i
had been treated added the double die of ingratitude to my offence i
was therefore condemned and bade to expect no mercy nor did i expect
it for the fatal day appointed for the execution having arrived a
rope was put round my neck and i was led to the gibbet

and now i am about to relate what will greatly surprise the reader i
was not only found guilty and condemned i was hanged escape was
impossible and i perceived it the anguish of my mind for in anguish
it may be supposed i looked forward to my fate was increased by the
consciousness so long slumbering that flashed on it as i was driven
to the fatal tree that i was in reality not tom the slave but
sheppard lee the freeman and that i possessed a power of evading
the halter or any other inconvenience provided i were allowed but
one opportunity to exercise it but where was i now to look for a
dead body it is true there were bodies enough by-and-by when my
accomplices were tucked up around me but what advantage could i derive
from entering any one of them since my fate must be equally certain to
be hanged

my distress i repeat was uncommonly great and in the midst of it i
was executed which put an end to the quandary




 chapter xvi


in which it is related what became of the author after being hanged


here it would seem that my history should find its natural close
but i hope to convince the world that a man may live to record his own
death and burial i say burial for from all i have heard i judge
that i was buried as well as hanged and that i lay in the earth in a
coarse deal coffin from two o'clock in the afternoon of a november
day until nine at night when certain young doctors of the village
who were desirous to show their skill in anatomy came to the place of
execution and dug up the three best bodies of which as my good luck
would have it my own was one zip the fiddler's being another while
the third was that of a young fellow named sam notorious for nothing
so much as a great passion he had for butting with his head against
brick walls or even stone ones provided they were smooth enough

the young anatomists previous to hacking us resolved to try some
galvanic experiments on us having procured a battery for that purpose
and they invited a dozen or more respectable gentlemen to be present
and witness the effects of that extraordinary fluid galvanism on our
lifeless bodies

the first essayed was that of the unfortunate scipio who being well
charged began to the admiration of all present to raise first one
arm and then the other then to twist the fingers of his left hand in
a peculiar way as if turning a screw inclining his head the while
towards his left shoulder and then to saw the air sweeping his right
hand to and fro across his breast with great briskness and energy
the fingers of his left titillating at the air all the while so as to
present the lively spectacle of a man playing the fiddle and indeed
it was judged so natural was every motion that had the party been
provided with a fiddle and bow to put into his hands they would have
played such a jig as would have set all present dancing

the next experiment tried was upon the body of sam whose muscles
were speedily excited to exercise themselves in the way to which they
had been most accustomed though not in one so agreeable to the chief
operator for in this case the lifeless corse suddenly lifting up its
head bestowed it with a jerk of propulsion equal in force to the but
of a battering-ram full against the stomach of the operator whereby
he was tumbled head over heels and all the breath beaten out of his
body

the reader may suppose as it was proved to be the virtue of galvanism
to set the dead muscles doing those acts to which the living ones had
been longest habituated that i upon being charged could do nothing
less than throw myself upon my hands and knees and go galloping about
the table as i had been used to do over the lawn when master tommy
was mounted upon my back

such however was not the fact the first thing i did upon feeling the
magical fluid penetrate my nerves was to open my eyes and snap them
twice or thrice the second to utter a horrible groan which greatly
disconcerted the spectators and the third to start bolt upright on
my feet and ask them what the devil they were after in a word i
was suddenly resuscitated and to the great horror of all present
doctors and lookers-on who fetching a yell that caused me to think
i had got among condemned spirits in purgatory fled from the room
exclaiming that i was the devil and no niggur what was particularly
lamentable though i was far from so esteeming it one of them a
young gentleman who had come to the exhibition out of curiosity being
invited by one of the doctors was so overcome with terror that before
he reached the door of the room he fell down in a fit and being
neglected by the others none of whom stopped to give him help expired
on the spot

as for me the cause of all the alarm i believe i was ten times
more frightened than any of the spectators especially when i came
to recollect that i had just been hanged and that i would in all
probability be hanged again unless i now succeeded in making my
escape as for the cause of my resuscitation and the events that
accompanied it i was then entirely ignorant of them and indeed
i must confess i learned them afterward out of the newspapers i
knew however that i had been hanged and that i had been by some
extraordinary means or other brought to life again and i perceived
that if i did not make my escape without delay i should certainly be
recaptured by the returning doctors

i ran towards the door and then for the first time beheld that
unfortunate spectator who had fallen dead as i mentioned before and
lay upon the floor with his face turned up i recollected him on the
instant as being a young gentleman whom i had once or twice seen at
my late master's house all that i knew of him was that his name was
megrim that he was reputed to be very wealthy and a great genius or
as some said eccentric and that he was admired by the ladies and
doubtless because he was a genius

as i looked him in the face i heard in the distance the uproar of
voices which had succeeded the flight of the doctors suddenly
burst out afresh with the sound of returning footsteps and a
loud bully-like voice which i thought very much like that of the
under-turnkey at the prison a man whom i had learned to fear cried
out let me see your devil for may i be cussed up hill and down
hill if i ever seed a bigger one than myself

horrible as was the voice i was not dismayed i saw at my feet a city
of refuge into which my enemies could not pursue me my escape was
within my own power

master said i touching my head for i had no hat to the corpse
if it is all the same to you i beg you'll let me take possession of
your body

as i pronounced the words the translation was effected and that so
rapidly that just as i drew my first breath in the body of mr megrim
it was knocked out of me by the fall of my old one which i not
having taken the precaution to stand a little to one side fell down
like a thunderbolt upon me bruising me very considerably about the
precordia

in this state being half suffocated and somewhat frightened i was
picked up and carried away by my new friends and put to bed where
having swallowed an anodyne i fell directly sound asleep

and here before proceeding farther i will say that the doctors and
their friends were greatly surprised to discover my late body lying
dead having expected to find it as animated as when they left it but
by-and-by having reflected that the galvanism or artificial life
infused into its nerves had been naturally exhausted at last whereupon
it as naturally followed that the body should return to its lifeless
condition they began to aver that the most surprising part of the
business was that it had kept me alive so long and enabled me after
groaning and speaking as i had actually done to walk so far from the
table on which i had been lying

on the whole the phenomenon was considered curious and wonderful
and an account of it having been drawn up by the doctors and headed
extraordinary case of the effects of galvanism on a dead body it was
printed for the benefit of scientific men throughout the world in a
medical journal where i doubt not it may be found at this day





book vii

which is intended as a pendant to book i and contains the history of
a young gentleman of fortune





 chapter i


containing an inkling of the life and habits of mr arthur megrim


having been carried from the scene of my late transformation as i
mentioned before physicked put to bed and allowed to sleep off
my troubles i awoke late on the following morning feeling very
comfortable notwithstanding the bruises on my ribs and with an
uncommonly agreeable though lazy sense of the enjoyment of lying
a-bed indeed this was my only feeling i woke to a consciousness
though a vague one of the change in my condition and this together
with what i saw around me when i had succeeded after some effort in
getting my eyes a little opened it may be supposed would have filled
me with surprise and excited in me a great curiosity to inquire into
matters relating to mr arthur megrim

such however was not the case i looked upon the elegantly-adorned
chamber in which i lay and the sumptuous robes of my bed with as much
indifference as if i had been accustomed to them all my life and as
for the happy destiny that now seemed opening upon me i scarce thought
on it at all

nor can i say that i felt in any way elated at my fortunate escape
from the hangman and the anatomists i remembered that affair with a
drowsy indifference as being a matter of no further consequence to me
and as for mr arthur megrim's friends and kinsmen his interests and
relations in life i thought to myself with a yawn i shall know them
all in good time

i was content to take things as they might come and eschew labours of
mind as well as efforts of body curiosity i felt was a tumultuous
passion and i therefore resolved to avoid it in this mood i turned
over on the other side and took a second nap

from this i was roused after a time by some one tugging at my
shoulder who proved upon examination to be a very elegant-looking
mulatto-boy that is a boy of twenty-five years or thereabouts who
signified in language as genteel as his person that it was exactly
half past eleven o'clock and therefore time for me to get up

augh well said i taking about thirty seconds to gape out each
word it seemed such tiresome work to articulate what do you want

want you to get up sah missie ann says it does you no good to sleep
so long

augh who is missie ann

lar bless us said the gentleman turning up the white of his eye
missie ann is massa's sister

who is massa

you massa massa arthur

augh well and who are you

paminondas massa coat very nicely brushed very fine day will do
you good sah to get up and taste the air regular indian summer sah

you may go to the devil

yes sah

with that i turned over for another nap which i should undoubtedly
have taken had i not been interrupted just as i was falling asleep
by the entrance of a lady of a somewhat starched and venerable
appearance though not more than six or seven years older than myself
i being perhaps twenty-five or six

a'n't you ashamed of yourself arthur said she do tell me do you
intend to lie a-bed for ever

augh pshaw said i pray madam be so good as to inform me who you
are and augh what you want in my chamber

come said the lady don't be ridiculous and fall into any of
your hyppoes again don't pretend you don't know your own sister ann
megrim

i won't said i but augh sister if you have no objection i
should like augh to sleep till dinner is ready

dinner screamed my sister ann megrim don't suppose you will ever
be able to eat a dinner again you know the doctor says it is your hard
eating and your laziness together that have destroyed your digestive
apparatus and that if you don't adhere to the bran bread and hickory
ashes tea you'll never be cured in the world

what said i am i sick

undoubtedly said my sister ann your digestive apparatus is all
destroyed and your nerves too did not you faint last night when they
were galvanizing the bodies have you not lost all muscular power so
that you do nothing but lie on a bed or sofa all day long oh really
brother arthur megrim i am ashamed of you a man like you a young man
and a rich man a man of family and genius a gentleman and a scholar
a man who might make himself governor of the state or president of
the nation or any thing yet to be nothing at all except the laziest
man in virginia a man with no digestive apparatus a poor nervous
hyppo oh it is too bad do get up and stir yourself mount your
horse or go out in the carriage exercise you know is the only thing
to restore strength to the digestive apparatus

sister ann said i the more you speak of my digestive apparatus
the more augh the more i am convinced you don't know what you are
talking about i am resolved to get up and eat my dinner 

of bran bread and hickory ashes said my sister

of canvass-back ducks and terapins said i at which miss ann megrim
expressed terror and aversion and endeavoured to convince me that such
indulgence would be punished by a horrible indigestion as had been the
case a thousand times before

but cogent as were her arguments i had or felt one still stronger
on my side being a savage appetite which was waking within that very
digestive apparatus she held in such disesteem and which became the
more eager the more she besought me to resist it

the discussion was so far advantageous that it set me wide awake and
by-and-by the zealous epaminondas having made his second appearance
i succeeded with his assistance in getting on my clothes and
descending to the dining-room where to the great horror and grief
of my affectionate relative i demolished two ducks and a half being
the true canvass-backs or white-backs as they call them in that
country and a full grown tortoise of the genus emys and species
palustris and in this operation i may say i found the first
excitement of pleasure which i had yet known in my new body and
displayed an energy of application of which i did not before know that
i was capable nor am i certain that any ill consequences followed the
meal i felt indeed a strong propensity to throw myself on a sofa and
recruit after the labours of eating but this miss megrim resisted
insisting i should get into my carriage for it seems i had one and a
very handsome one too and drive about to avoid a surfeit

in this i consented to gratify her wishes whereby i gratified one of
my own for i fell sound asleep within five minutes after starting and
so remained until the excursion was over

then being as hungry as ever and not knowing what else to do i
picked my teeth over a newspaper and nodded at a novel until supper
was got ready which disregarding miss megrim's exhortations as
before i attacked with the good-will i had carried to my dinner
eating on this occasion two terapins and a half and one whole duck of
the genus anas and species vallisneria

the only ill consequences were that i dreamed of the devil and his
imps all night and that i awoke in a crusty humour next morning


footnote i had these learned names of a scientific doctor in the
village and i have see them also in the newspapers




 chapter ii


the happy condition in which sheppard lee is at last placed


if there be among my readers any person so discontented with his lot
that he would be glad to exchange conditions with another i think had
he been acquainted with mr arthur megrim he would have desired an
exchange with him above all other persons in the world for mr megrim
possessed all those requisites which are thought to ensure happiness to
a human being he was young rich and independent of a good family
he boasted the chivalrous blood of the megrims of a sound body
and serene temper and with no appetite for those excesses which ruin
the reputation while they debase the minds and destroy the peace of
youth his years as i have mentioned already were twenty-five or six
his revenues were far above his wants and enabled him to support his
town-house which was the most elegant one in the village where he
lived remote from the care and trouble of his plantations and as for
independence that was manifestly complete he being a bachelor and
the sole surviver of his family excepting only his sister miss ann
megrim who managed his household and thus took from his mind the only
care that could otherwise have disturbed it

what then in the whole world had mr megrim to trouble him nothing
on earth and for that reason to speak paradoxically he was more
troubled than any one else on earth labour pain and care the
evils which men are so apt to censure providence for entailing upon
the race i have had experience enough to know are essential to the
true enjoyment of life serving like salt pepper mustard and
other condiments and spices which are by themselves ungrateful to
the palate to give a relish to the dish that is insipid and cloying
without them who enjoys health who is so sensible of the rapture of
being well as he who has just been relieved from sickness who can
appreciate the delightful luxury of repose so well as the labourer
released from his daily toil who in fine tastes of the bliss of
happiness like him who is introduced to it after a probation of
suffering the surest way to cure a boy of a love of cakes and comfils
is to put him apprentice to a confectioner the truth is that the
sweets of life enjoyed by themselves are just as disgusting as the
bitters and can only be properly relished when alternated or mingled
with the latter

but as this is philosophy and the reader will skip it i will pursue
the subject no further but jump at once from the principle to the
practical illustration as seen in my history while a resident in the
body of mr arthur megrim

i was on the sudden a rich young man with nothing on earth to
trouble me i had lands and houses rich plantations a nation or two
of negroes herds of sheep and cattle with mills fisheries and some
half dozen or more gold-mines which last and it may be considered
out of virginia a wondrous evidence of my wealth were decidedly the
least valuable of all my possessions with all these things i was made
acquainted by my sister ann or otherwise it is highly probable i
should have known nothing about them for during the whole period of my
seventh existence i confined myself to my property in the village not
having the least curiosity to visit my plantations which as everybody
told me were in good hands

in the village itself i had every thing about me to secure happiness a
fine house abundance of servants the whole under the management of
the best of housekeepers my sister ann with horses and carriages for
which however i cared but little thinking it laborious to ride and
as tedious to be driven and above all friends without number who
treated me with a respect amounting to veneration for it must be
remembered i was the richest man in the county and with a degree of
affection little short of idolatry but whom however i thought very
troublesome tiresome people seeing that they visited me too often
and wearied me to death with long conversations about every thing

among them all there was but one for whom i felt any friendship and
he was a young doctor named tibbikens for whom my sister ann had a
great respect and who had been retained by her to assist in taking
care of my digestive apparatus that same digestive apparatus of mine
being a hobby on which my sister lavished more thought and anxiety than
i believe she did upon her own soul not meaning to reflect upon her
religion however for she was a member of the presbyterian church and
quite devout about the time of communion the cause of her solicitude
as she gave me frequent opportunity to know by her allusion to the
fact was her having been once afflicted in her own person with a
disorder of the digestive apparatus which it had been the good fortune
of doctor tibbikens to cure by a regimen of bran bread and hickory
ashes water and hence her affection for the doctor and the remedy i
liked the doctor myself because he had the same solicitude about my
health without troubling me with advice except when i asked it or
finding much fault when i did not follow it because his conversation
was agreeable except when he was in a scientific humour and did not
require any efforts on my part to keep it up because he liked terapins
and white-backs as well as myself and was of opinion they were
wholesome provided one ate them in moderation and in fine because
he took pains to help me to amusement and was of great assistance in
dissipating somewhat of that tedium which was the first evil with which
i was afflicted in the body of mr arthur megrim i believe the doctor
had a strong fancy for my sister but she used to declare she could
never think of marrying and thus being drawn from what she felt to
be the chief duty of her existence namely the care of my digestive
apparatus




 chapter iii


the employments of a young gentleman of fortune


and now having mentioned tedium of existence as being an evil to
which i soon felt myself subject i will say that it was one i found
more oppressive than the reader can readily imagine i had nothing
in the world to do and as it happened my disposition did not lead
me to seek any thing i was in a word the very man my sister had
so reproachfully called me in our first conversation that is the
laziest man in all virginia and upon reflection i can think of
no person in the world who would bear a comparison with me in that
particular except myself none but himself can be his parallel as
somebody or other says i don't know who a sentiment that is supposed
to be absurd inasmuch as it involves an impossibility but which
becomes good sense when applied to me in my original condition in
the body in which i was first introduced to life i certainly had a
great aversion to all troublesome employments whether of business or
amusement being supposed by many persons to be then what as many
considered me now to wit the laziest man in my state whether i was
lazier as sheppard lee the jerseyman or arthur megrim the virginian
i am not able to say in both cases indolence was at the bottom of
all my troubles there was this difference however between the two
conditions that whereas i had felt in one the evils of laziness to a
poor man i was now to discover in the other what were its evils to a
man of fortune

my chief employments in the body of mr arthur megrim were eating and
sleeping and i certainly should have done nothing else had i been
allowed to follow my own humours eating and sleeping therefore
consumed the greater portion of my time but it could not consume all
nor could the residue be filled up by the occasional excursions in my
curricle and the still more unfrequent strolls through the village
into which i was driven by my affectionate sister or cajoled by her
coadjutor the doctor in their zealous care of my digestive apparatus
as for visits and visitations i abhorred them all whether they
related to the bustling young gentlemen of the neighbourhood or the
loquacious ladies old and young who cultivated the friendship of my
sister

employ myself however as i might there always remained a portion
of each day which i could not get rid of either in bed or at the
table on such occasions i was devoured by ennui and thought that even
existence was an infliction that it was hard work to live according
to my sister's account i was a scholar and a genius in which case i
ought to have found employment enough of an intellectual nature either
in books or the reflections of my own mind i certainly had a very
large and fine library in my house and there was scarce a week passed
by in which i did not receive a huge bundle of the newest publications
from a book-seller who had long had it in charge thus to supply me
of these i usually read the title-pages and then turned them over to
my sister or which was more common lent them to my neighbours who
male and female together came flocking to borrow the day after and
sometimes the day before the arrival of each package taking good care
to rob me of those that were most interesting the truth is if i ever
had had the power of reading i had now lost it books only set me
nodding

as for exercising my mind in reflections of its own that was even more
laborious than reading and i contracted a dislike to it particularly
as my mind wore itself out every night in dreaming that being a result
of the goodly suppers i used to eat it is true that i one day fell
into a sudden ferment and being inspired actually seized upon pen and
paper and wrote a poem in blank verse forty lines long with which i
was so pleased that i read it to tibbikens and my sister both of whom
were in raptures with it the former carrying it off to the editor of
the village paper who printed it with such a eulogium upon its merits
as made me believe byron was a fool to me while all the young ladies
immediately paid my sister ann a visit that they might tell me how
they admired the beautiful piece and lament that i wrote so seldom i
forget what the poem was about but i remember i was so delighted with
the praise bestowed on it that i resolved to write another which
however i did not do having unfortunately begun it in rhyme which
was difficult and my fit of inspiration and energy having left me
before i got through with my next dinner it was my writing verses i
suppose that caused me to be called a genius but it seems i was too
lazy to be inspired more than once or twice a year

i relapsed into ennui and truly i became more tired of it before it
was done with me than was ever a labourer of his hod or mattock




 chapter iv


some account of the inconveniences of having a digestive apparatus


but ennui was not the worst of the evils that clouded my happy lot
some touches of that diabolical disorder the curse of the rich man
which as my sister so often gave me to know had threatened the peace
of mr arthur megrim several times before now began to assail my own
serenity and threw gall and ratsbane over my dinners i had slighted
her warnings and despised her advice and now i was to pay the price
of indiscretion in a word that very digestive apparatus on which she
read me a lecture at least thrice a day began to grumble refuse to do
duty and strike though unlike the industrious artisans who were
in all quarters setting it the example it struck not for high wages
of which it had had a surfeit but for low ones in which however its
master was scarce able to oblige it having an uncommonly good appetite
most of the time and even when he had not not well knowing how to
dispose of his time unless at the table

my faithful sister who had been so constant to predict was the first
to detect the coming evil and step by step she pointed it out to my
unwilling observation

arthur said she one morning as we sat at breakfast your eyelid is
winking

augh  said i yes it is winking

it is a sign said she your digestive apparatus is getting out of
order

augh said i hang the digestive apparatus for i was tired of
hearing it mentioned

arthur said she the next day you are beginning to look yellow and
bilious

yes said i on which she declared that the alkalis of my biliary
fluids she had studied the whole theory and nomenclature of dyspepsy
out of a book the doctor lent her were beginning to fail to coalesce
in the natural chymical way with the acids of the chymous mass and
that no better argument could be desired to prove that my digestive
apparatus was getting out of order and she concluded by recommending
me to regulate my diet and fall back upon bran bread and hickory ashes

in short my dear sister assailed me with a pertinacity equal to the
disease itself so that i came in a short time to consider her as one
of its worst symptoms

to add to my woes dr tibbikens began to go over to her opinion to
talk of my digestive apparatus and to drop hints in relation to bran
bread and hickory ashes which would decidedly have robbed him of my
friendship had i not at last found myself unable to do without him

to make a long story short i will omit a detailed history of my
tribulations during the winter and skip at once to the following
spring at the opening of which i found myself young rich and
independent as i was the bond-slave and victim of a malady to which
the woes of age and penury are as the sting of moschetoes to the teeth
of raging tigers

reader i have in the course of this history related to thee many
miseries which it was my lot on different occasions to encounter
and some of them of a truly cruel and insupportable character could
i however give thee a just conception of the ills i was now doomed
to suffer which of a certainty i cannot do unless thou art at this
moment the victim of a similar infliction i am convinced thou wouldst
agree with me that i had now stumbled upon a grief that concentrated
in itself all others of which human nature is capable

dost thou know what it is to have thy stomach stuffed like an
ostrich's with old iron hoops and brickbats or feeling as if it were
to have it now drowned in vinegar now scorched as with hot potatoes
thy head filled with achings dizziness and streaks of lightning thy
heart transformed into the heels of a hornpipe-dancer and plying thy
ribs lungs and diaphragm with the energy of an artiste in the last
agony

if thou dost then thou wilt know that bodily distress of which the
above miseries form but a small portion is the least of the evils of
dyspepsy that its most horrible symptoms develop themselves in the
mind what care those devils falsely called blue for they are as
black as midnight or the bile which engenders them for the youth
the wealth the independence the gentility of a man whose digestive
apparatus is out of order the less cause he may have in reality to
be dissatisfied with his lot the more cause they will find him the
greater and more legitimate his claims to be a happy man the more
fierce and determined their efforts to make him a miserable one

the serenity of my mind gave way before the attacks of these monsters
sleeping and waking by day and by night they assailed me with equal
pertinacity and fury if i slept it was only to be tormented by demon
and caco-demon to be ridden double by incubus and succuba under whose
bestriding limbs i felt like a shetland pony carrying two elephants my
dreams indeed so varied and terrific were the images with which they
afflicted me i can compare to nothing but the horrors or last delirium
of a toper hanging drowning and tumbling down church-steeples were
the common and least frightful of the fancies that crowded my sleeping
brain now i was blown up in a steamboat or run over by a railroad
car now i was sticking fast in a burning chimney scorching and
smothering and now head downwards in a hollow tree with a bear
below snapping at my nose now i was plastered up in a thick wall with
masons hard at work running the superstructure up higher and now i was
enclosed in a huge apple-dumpling boiling in a pot over a hot fire
one while i was crushed by a boa constrictor another perishing by
inches in the mouth of a bengal tiger and again i was in the hands
of dr tibbikens and his scientific coadjutors of the village who
were dissecting me alive in short there was no end to the torments
i endured in slumber and nothing could equal them except those that
beset me while awake

a miserable melancholy seized upon my spirits in which those very
qualifications which everybody envied me the possession of were
regarded with disgust as serving only the purpose of adding to my
tortures what cared i for youth when it opened only a longer vista of
living wretchedness what to me was the wealth which i could not enjoy
which had been given me only to tantalize and as for independence
the idea was a mockery the servitude of a galley-slave was freedom
unlimited license compared with my subjection to dyspepsy and for
the truth must be confessed the doctor to whom i was at last obliged
to submit nolens volens




 chapter v


the same subject continued with an account of several surprising
transformations


whether dr tibbikens treated me secundum artem or not i cannot
say but true it is that instead of getting better i grew gradually
worse until my melancholy became a confirmed hypochondriasis and
fancies gloomy and dire wild and strange seized upon my brain and
conjured up new afflictions

getting up early one morning i found to my horror that i had been
in my sleep converted into a coffee-pot a transformation which i
thought so much more extraordinary than any other i had ever undergone
that i sent for my sister ann and imparted to her the singular secret

oh said she bursting into tears it is all on account of your
unfortunate digestive apparatus but oh brother arthur don't let
such notions get into your head a coffee-pot indeed that's too
ridiculous

i was quite incensed at her skepticism but still more so at the
conduct of dr tibbikens who being sent for hearing of my
misfortune and seeing me stand in the middle of the floor with my
left arm akimbo like a crooked handle and the right stretched out
in the manner of a spout seized me by the shoulders and marched me
towards a great hickory fire that was blazing on the hearth

what do you mean tibbikens said i

to warm you said he i like my coffee hot and so i intend to
boil you over again on that very fire

at these words i started trembled and awoke as from a dream assuring
him i had made a great mistake and was no more of a coffee-pot than
he was an assurance that doubtless prevented my undergoing an ordeal
which i was neither saint nor fire-king enough to endure with impunity
indeed i was quite ashamed of having permitted such a delusion to
enter my brain

the next day however a still more afflicting change came over me for
having tried to read a book in which i was interrupted by a great dog
barking in the street i was seized with a rage of a most unaccountable
nature and falling on my hands and feet i responded to the animal's
cries and barked in like manner being quite certain that i was as
much of a dog as he nay my servant epaminondas coming in i seized
him by the leg and would have worried him had he not run roaring out
of the chamber and my sister ann coming to the door i flew at her
with such ferocity that she was fain to escape down stairs the doctor
was again sent for and popping suddenly into the chamber he rushed
upon me with a great horsewhip he had snatched up along the way and
fell to belabouring me without mercy crying out all the while get
out you rascal get out

villain said i jumping on my hind legs and dancing about to avoid
his lashes what do you mean

to whip you down stairs you cur said he flourishing his weapon
again

on which i assured him as earnestly as i could that i was no cur
whatever and indeed i was quite cured of the fancy

my next conceit was the morning being cold and my fire having gone
out that i was an icicle which fancy was dispelled by the doctor
saluting me with a bucket of water on pretence of melting me and i
was doubtless melted all the sooner for being drenched in water exactly
at the freezing-point

after this i experienced divers other transformations being now
a chicken now a loaded cannon now a clock now a hamper of
crockery-ware and a thousand things besides all which conceits the
doctor cured without much difficulty and with as little consideration
for the roughness of his remedies being a chicken he attempted to
wring my neck calling me a dunghill rooster fit only for the pot he
discharged the cannon from my fancies by clapping a red-hot poker to
my nose and the crate of crockery he broke to pieces by casting it on
the floor to the infinite injury of my bones the clock at first gave
him some trouble until pronouncing it to have a screw out of order
he seized upon one of my front teeth with a pair of pincers and by a
single wrench dissipated the delusion for ever




 chapter vi


an account of the woes of an emperor of france which have never before
appeared in history


in short for i do not design particularizing my transformations
further there was no conceit entered my brain which dr tibbikens
did not cure by a conceit until one morning by some mysterious
revelation the nature and means of which can only be guessed at i
found that i had been elected the emperor of france and announced my
intention to set sail for my government immediately in the first ship
of the line which the american executive could put at my disposal

this fancy quite disconcerted dr tibbikens and i heard him say to
my sister he is a gone case now quite mad i assure you which
expression so much offended me that i ordered him from my presence
and told him that were it not for my respect for the american
government whose subject he was i would have his head for his
impertinence

but wo betide the day the doctor returned to me in less than an hour
bringing with him every physician in the village who having looked
at me a moment went into another apartment where they argued hotly
together for another hour at the expiration of this they returned led
by tibbikens who to my great satisfaction now fell on his knees
and begged my imperial majesty's pardon for presuming to request that
i would allow myself to be dressed in my imperial majesty's robe of
state which robe of state although i was surprised at its plainness
for it was of a coarse linen texture without gold lace or jewels
and of a very strange shape closed in front and open in the rear i
immediately consented to put on so pleased was i with the homage of
the doctor

if i was surprised at the appearance of the imperial garment much more
was i astonished when having slipped my arms into its sleeves i found
them that is my arms suddenly pinioned buried sewed up as it
were among the folds of the robe so that when it was tied behind me
as it immediately was i was as well secured as when i was tied up for
execution on a former occasion alas the disappointment to my pride
i understood the whole matter in a moment my imperial robe of state
was nothing less nor more than a strait waistcoat constructed upon the
spur of the moment but still on scientific principles

and now being entirely at the mercy of the deceitful tibbikens i was
seized upon with a strong hand my head shaved and thrust into a sack
of pounded ice from which it was not taken until after a six days
congelation and then only to be transferred to a nightcap of spanish
flies exceedingly comfortable on the first application but which
within a few hours i had every reason to pronounce the most execrable
covering in existence and what made it still more intolerable i never
complained of it that tibbikens did not assure me it was the imperial
coronet of france and then exclaim in the words of some old play
uneasy lies the head that wears a crown

and then i was physicked and starved phlebotomized soused in cold
water and scalded in hot rubbed down with rough blanket cloths and
hair-brushes as stiff as wool-cards scorched with mustard plasters
bombarded by an electrical machine and in general attacked by every
weapon of art which the zeal of my tormentors could bring into play
against me

in this way if i was not cured of my disease i was at least brought
into subjection i ceased complaining which i did at first and with
becoming indignation of the traitorous and sacrilegious violence done
to my anointed body for such i at first considered it the arguments
of my persecutors however to prove the contrary were irresistible
being chiefly syllogisms of which the major proposition was calomel
and jalap the minor mustard plasters and blisters and the conclusion
cold water phlebotomy and flax-seed tea the same arguments varied
categorically according to circumstances convinced me that if my
imperial elevation or the notion thereof was not sheer insanity on my
own part my doctors thought so which was the same thing in effect
and i therefore took good care when bewailing my hard fate not to
charge it as i at first did to the democratic wrath and jealousy of
my tormentors




 chapter vii


in which sheppard lee is convinced that all is not gold which glistens


this conversion of mine to their own opinion or if the reader
will so have it my return to rationality had a favourable effect
on my doctors they removed very circumspectly indeed the strait
jacket from my arms and then seeing i made no attempt to tear them
to pieces but was on the contrary very quiet and submissive and
that instead of claiming to be charlemagne the second of france i
was content to be mr arthur megrim of virginia they were so well
satisfied of the cure they had effected that they agreed to free me of
their company and so left me in the sole charge of tibbikens and my
affectionate sister

in this manner i was cured of hypochondriasis for although i felt
ever and anon a strong propensity to confess myself a joint-stool
a greek demigod or some such other fanciful creature i retained so
lively a recollection of the penalties i had already paid for indulging
in such vagaries that i put a curb on my imagination and resolved
for the future to be nothing but plain mr megrim a gentleman with a
disordered digestive apparatus

i was cured of my hypochondriasis i may say also of my
dyspepsy being kept by tibbikens and my sister in such a starved
condition that it was impossible i should ever more complain of
indigestion but i was not yet cured of my melancholy nothing but
canvass-backs and terapins could cure that and these alas were never
more to bless my lips tibbikens had pronounced their fate and with
them mine thenceforth and for ever my diet was to be looked for in
those next to my digestive apparatus chief favourites of my sister
bran bread and hickory ashes my stomach he solemnly assured me would
never be able to sustain any thing else

i say therefore i was melancholy and great reason had i to be so
condemned to live a life of ascetic denial with the means in my hand
to purchase all the luxuries in the world and which was worse an
eternal desire to enjoy them

to banish this melancholy alas never to be banished and perhaps to
give me a little appetite for my bran bread and ashes for which i
never could contract a relish the friendly tibbikens again seduced me
into the open air and my carriage and carried me about to different
places in which he thought i might find amusement in this way he had
conducted my prototype the true arthur megrim before me whenever
indolence and the luxuries of the table brought him too near to
dyspepsy and it was this uncommon kindness of the physician in
dragging the unfortunate gentleman to witness the galvanic experiments
on the bodies of the executed felons which had helped him so suddenly
out of his own dr tibbikens was not indeed very choice whither he
carried me lugging me along with equal alacrity to a horse-race a
barbacue or to the bedsides of his patients

all his efforts however were vain the memory of what i had suffered
with the anticipation of what i was yet to endure with doubtless
the addition of the ills for the time being preyed upon my spirit
i followed him mechanically and in a sort of torpor incapable of
enjoying myself incapable almost of noting what passed before me
i was tired of the life of the young and affluent mr megrim and i
should have been glad to exchange his body for some one's else but
unluckily my mind was so weighed down with indolence melancholy and
stupefaction that i really did not think of so natural a means of
ending my troubles

in this condition greatly to the concern of my friendly physician
i remained until towards the end of march when an incident happened
which gave an impulse to my spirit greater than it had ever before
experienced




 chapter viii


in which the author stumbles upon an old acquaintance


the doctor being accustomed to lead or drive me whithersoever he would
and i half the time following without question i found myself led
one day to a house in the town where was a remarkable exhibition or
show as our people called it which had for two days kept the whole
village in an uproar so great however was the abstraction and
indifference of my mind to all objects ordinary and extraordinary
alike that i had paid not the least attention to the accounts of the
matter which my sister and other persons and especially the faithful
epaminondas had during these two days poured into my ears hence
when i entered the exhibition-room i was ignorant of its nature and
indeed indifferent as to making myself better acquainted with it

tibbikens however appeared to be unusually delighted and saying
now megrim my lad you shall see a wonderful proof of the strides
that science is making led me through a crowd of the villagers
old and young and male and female who were present up to a large
table where truly enough in glass cases placed upon the same was a
spectacle quite remarkable though i must confess it did not make so
strong an impression upon me as tibbikens expected

it consisted of an infinite variety of fragments from the bodies of
animals and human beings imitations as i supposed at first in wax
or some other suitable substance and done to the life but tibbikens
assured me they were real specimens taken from animal bodies and
converted by scientific processes known only to the exhibiter into
the substances we now saw some being stony and harder than flint some
again only a little indurated while others retained their natural
softness elasticity and other peculiarities of texture there were
a dozen or more human feet as many hands three heads one of which
was a woman's with long hair and another a child's a calf's head
a dog's leg the ear of a pig the nose of a horse an ox's liver and
heart a rat a snake and a catfish and dozens of other things that i
cannot now remember all of which were surprisingly natural to behold
especially the head of the woman with the long hair which looked as
if it had just been cut off or rather not cut off at all for there
was no appearance of death about it whatever the lips and cheeks being
quite ruddy and the eyes open and bright though fixed

so much for science said tibbikens look at that boy's head it
don't look so well as the others but who would believe it was solid
stone sir it is stone and silicious stone too for last night i
did myself knock fire out of its nose with the back of my knife and
that's the cause of the nick there on the nostril well now there's
the man's head its texture is ligneous or to speak more strictly
imperfectly carbonaceous though the doctor calls it calcareous but
the wonder of all is the woman's head look at that that sir is
neither silicious nor carbonaceous but fleshy i say sir fleshy
it remains in its natural condition the skin is soft and resilient
you see the naturalness of the colour of the lips and above all
of the eyes and yet sir that head that flesh is indestructible
unless indeed by fire and strong acids or alkalis it is embalmed
sir embalmed according to the new process of this doctor with the
unpronounceable dutch name and i can tell you sir that the man
is a chymist such as was never heard of before davy lavoisier
berzelius sir i presume to say they are fools to him and will be
as soon forgotten as their stupid uncivilized system how little
they knew of the true science of chymistry they stopped short at the
elements our doctor here converts one element into another

tibbikens spoke with an air of consequence and some little oratorical
emphasis for he was surrounded by spectators who listened to what
he said with reverence as for me the little interest excited in my
bosom by the novelty of the exhibition had begun to wear away and i
was sinking again into apathy the faster perhaps for the doctor's
conversation of which i had a sufficiency every day and i suppose i
should in a few moments have lost all consciousness of what was going
on around me when suddenly a buzz began and a murmuring of voices
saying here comes the doctor now we shall have the grand show
at the same moment a grinding organ began its lugubrious grunting
and squeaking and the master of the exhibition stalking up to the
table and making his patrons a sweeping semicircular bow cried in a
rumbling bass voice and in accents strongly foreigh 

zhentlemens and leddees i peg you will excuse me for keep you
waiting vat you see here zhentlemens and leddees is very
strange pieces of de poddies human and animal shanged py a process
of philosophie very astonish misty and unknown to de multitude some
hard shtone some shtone not so hard and some not shtone at all but i
shall show you de representation vich is de triumph of art de vonder
of science de excellence of philosophie for zhentlemens and leddees
i am no mountepank and showmans put a man of de science a friend of
de species human and a zhentleman of de medical profession and vat i
make dese tings for is not for show nor for pastime nor for de money
but for de utilitie of de vorld

surely thought i to myself i have heard that voice before

i looked into the man's face as soon as the spectators had cleared away
a little for i was too indifferent to put myself to any trouble and
i said to myself nay i said aloud to tibbikens surely i have seen
that man before

where said tibbikens

in jersey i replied hastily for i could not forget the tall
frame the hollow jaws the solemn eyes and the ever-grinning mouth
of feuerteufel the german doctor who had made himself so famous in
my native village and who was one of the last persons i remembered to
have seen upon that day when i bade farewell to my original body

come said tibbikens looking alarmed at my last words you don't
pretend to say you were ever out of virginia in your whole life

augh oh said i recollecting myself i wonder what i was talking
about what augh what is the man's name

feuerteufel said tibbikens




 chapter ix


containing an account of the wonderful discoveries of the german doctor


i was not then mistaken it was feuerteufel himself only he had
learned a little more english this was the first and only one of my
original acquaintances whom i had laid eyes on since my departure from
new-jersey nearly two years before i felt some interest therefore
in the man but it was accompanied with a feeling of dislike and even
apprehension the truth is i never liked the german doctor though
why i never could tell but what was he doing what could be his
object going about the country with petrified legs arms and heads
i had scarce asked myself the question before it was answered by the
gentleman himself who had been speaking though i know not what all
the time i was talking with tibbikens and while i was cogitating
afterward

he had worked himself into a fit of eloquence warming with enthusiasm
as he dwelt upon the grandeur and usefulness of his discovery he made
antic gestures with hands head and shoulders he rolled and snapped
his eyes in the most extraordinary manner in the world and as for his
mouth there is no describing the grimaces and contortions which it
made over every particularly bright idea or felicitous word

zhentlemens said he i have discover de great art to preserve de

 chapter x


containing a more wonderful discovery on the part of sheppard lee with
perhaps the most surprising adventure that ever befell him


having thus completed his lecture or oration of which i must confess
i had begun to grow tired the german doctor suddenly stepped to a
great round box like a watchman's box that stood at the further end
of the room and unlocking the folding leaves of which it was composed
swung them round with a jerk exhibiting an inner case evidently
of glass but entirely covered over with a thick curtain this he
proceeded to remove by tugging at a string which hoisted it to the
ceiling and as it ascended there was disclosed to the eyes of the
wondering spectators a human figure within the case clad loosely in a
sort of roman garment and for all the world looking entirely like a
living being except that the eyes were fixed in a set unnatural stare
and the attitude was a little stiff and awkward

a murmur with twenty or more faint shrieks from the females present
attested the admiration with which the spectators caught sight of this
wonderful triumph of skill and science but i heavens and earth
what were my feelings what was my astonishment when i beheld in
that lifeless mummy my own lost body the mortal tenement in which i
had first drawn the breath and experienced the woes of life the
body of sheppard lee the jerseyman this then was its fate not to
be anatomized and degraded into a skeleton as the vile samuel the
kidnapper had told me but converted into a mummy by a new process for
the especial benefit of science and the world and dr feuerteufel
the man for whom i had always cherished an instinctive dislike and
horror was the worthy personage who had stolen it what time i had
myself interrupted his designs upon the body of the farmer's boy in
the old graveyard near the owl-roost i looked upon my face that is
the face of the mummy and a thousand recollections of my original home
and condition burst upon my mind the tears started into my eyes with
them what had i gained by forsaking the lot to which providence had
assigned me in a moment the woes of higginson of dawkins skinner
longstraw tom the slave and megrim the dyspeptic rushed over my
memory contrasted with those lesser ones of sheppard lee which i had
so falsely considered as rendering me the most miserable man in the
world

what other notions may have crowded my brain what feeling may have
entered my bosom i am now unable to describe the sight of my body
thus restored to me and in the midst of my sorrow and affliction
inviting me as it were back to my proper home threw me into an
indescribable ferment i stretched out my arms i uttered a cry and
then rushing forward to the astonishment of all present i struck my
foot against the glass case with a fury that shivered it to atoms or
at least the portion of it serving as a door which being dislodged
by the violence of the blow fell upon the floor and was dashed to
pieces the next instant disregarding the cries of surprise and fear
which the act occasioned i seized upon the cold and rigid hand of the
mummy murmuring let me live again in my own body and never no
never more in another's

happiness of happiness although while i uttered the words a boding
fear was on my mind lest the long period the body had lain inanimate
and more especially the mummifying process to which it had been
subjected might have rendered it unfit for further habitation i had
scarce breathed the wish before i found myself in that very body
descending from the box which had so long been its prison and stepping
over the mortal frame of mr arthur megrim now lying dead on the floor

indescribable was the terror produced among the spectators by this
double catastrophe the death of their townsman and the revival of the
mummy the women fell down in fits and the men took to their heels
and a little boy who was frightened into a paroxysm of devotion
dropped on his knees and began fervently to exclaim

 now i lay me down to sleep
 i pray the lord my soul to keep

in short the agitation was truly inexpressible and fear distracted
all but on no countenance was this passion mingled with a due degree
of amazement more strikingly depicted than on that of the german
doctor who thus compelled to witness the object of a thousand cares
the greatest and most perfect result of his wonderful discovery
slipping off its pedestal and out of his hands as by a stroke of
enchantment stared upon me with eyes nose and mouth speechless
rooted to the floor and apparently converted into a mummy himself as
i stepped past him however hurrying to the door with a vague idea
that the sooner i reached it the better his lips were unlocked and
his feelings found vent in a horrible exclamation der tyfel which
i believe means the devil der tyfel i have empalm him too well

then making a dart at me he cried in tones of distraction stop my
mummy mine gott which has cost me so much expense stop my mummy

i saw that he designed seizing me and being myself as much overcome
with fear as the others i made a bolt for the door knocking down my
friend tibbikens and half a dozen other retreating spectators as i left
it darted into the air and in a moment was flying out of the village
on the wings of the wind

i had a double cause for terror for first before i had got twenty
steps from the exhibition-room for my roman garments were in the way
of my legs and i did not run so fast as i managed to do afterward
i heard certain furious voices cry from the room it is all a cheat
the mummy was a living man let us lynch him and the doctor and
secondly i could also hear close at my heels the voice of the doctor
himself who had escaped close behind me eagerly vociferating stop
my mummy and i will pay twenty dollare stop my mummy by both which
noises it was made apparent that i was in danger of being lynched or
subjected to a second process of mummification

nerved therefore by my fears i gathered the skirts of my toga about my
arms and fled with all my might blessing my stars that i had at last
recovered that mortal tenement which with all its troubles i was now
convinced was the best for my purposes in the whole world




book viii

containing the conclusion of the history




 chapter i


sheppard lee flies from the german doctor and finds himself again in
new-jersey


the faster i fled the faster it seemed to me i was followed by the
german doctor who i have always believed was driven crazy by the
sudden loss of his beloved mummy and who i had therefore the greatest
reason to fear would if he succeeded in retaking me be content with
nothing short of clapping me again into his glass case were it even
a needful preliminary as in truth it must have been to kill and
embalm me over again and indeed i think the reader will allow that
the fact of his following me three days and three nights still calling
me a mummy charging everybody he met to stop me and persisting to
claim me as his property even after i had got among my own friends
was a proof not only of insanity but of a desperate determination to
rob me of life and liberty

of this determination on his part i was myself so strongly persuaded
and in consequence so overcome by terror that i am inclined to think
i was for a time nearly as mad as himself and i fled from before him
with a speed which the reader can only conceive when i tell him that
i ran from the scene of my transformation on the banks of the potomac
to my native village in new-jersey a distance which i estimate at full
one hundred and eighty miles in the short space of three days and
three nights during which period i rested but once and that on the
second night when being very faint and weary i lay down on the earth
and slept two hours

this may be justly esteemed a truly wonderful exploit and it exceeds
that of the great daniel boone of kentucky of whom it is related that
he ran before a band of wild indians the same distance or thereabouts
in four days time but it must be remembered that i was fleeing from
a raging madman whose speed was so nearly equal to my own that if i
chanced but to flag a little in my exertions at any time i was sure to
see him make his appearance on the rear or to hear his voice screaming
on the winds to stop his mummy indeed i ran with such haste that
i took no note of the road upon which i travelled and to this day i
am ignorant how i succeeded in passing the three great rivers the
potomac the chesapeake and the delaware which lay in my route and
which i must have crossed in some way or other and for the same
reason i am ignorant in what manner i sustained existence during those
three days having not the slightest recollection of eating a single
meal on the whole journey

all that i can remember of the journey is that i ran i knew not
whither but with an instinctive turning of my face towards the north
that i was closely followed by the german doctor and that about
sundown on the third day i found myself to my unspeakable joy
rushing through the owl-roost swamp across the meadow and by that
identical beech-tree where i had first lost my body in full view of
my own house the sight of that once happy home of my childhood filled
me with rapture i rushed towards it hailed by a shout from old jim
jumble my negro-man backed by another from his wife dinah that might
have waked the dead they were so loud and uproarious and found myself
in the arms of my dear but long-neglected sister prudence who with
her husband alderwood and her three young children was standing on
the porch

then being wholly overcome by exhaustion of body and mind and having
endured such fatigues and sufferings from hunger and thirst without
speaking of terror as have seldom oppressed a poor feeble human
being i fell into a swoon from which i awoke only to be assailed by
a violent fever and delirium the direct consequences of my superhuman
exertions that kept me a-bed in a condition between life and death
for more than two weeks

during all this period i recollect being tormented by the hateful
visage of the german doctor who having followed me like a bloodhound
daily forced himself into my chamber claimed me as his property and
would doubtless have carried me off had it not been for my sister my
brother-in-law and the faithful jim jumble the first of whom watched
at my bedside like an angel while the two others opposed themselves
to the enemy and drove him from the room his persecutions indeed
affected me to a degree i cannot express and were the cause that at
the end of the two weeks as above mentioned i suddenly fell into a
lethargy or trance the crisis of my disease in which i lay two days
and then awoke in my full senses free from fever and convalescent

how great was my satisfaction then to behold myself surrounded by my
friends and in my own house how much greater to know i was no longer
to be persecuted by the odious german doctor who my brother-in-law
gave me to understand in reply to my anxious questions had not only
given over all designs on my person but had actually departed from the
neighbourhood and from the state of new-jersey satisfied doubtless
that i was a living man and no longer a mummy




 chapter ii


what had happened at watermelon hill during the author's absence


this intelligence was balm to my spirit and medicine to my body and
the consequence was that i recovered so rapidly as to be able to leave
my bed in less than a week and receive the visits and congratulations
of many old friends who seemed really glad of my return and recovery
though i have no doubt they were moved as much by curiosity to learn
where i had been and what adventures had befallen me during the long
period of my exile in which however i did not think it advisable to
gratify them

and now it was that i discovered that many changes personally
interesting to myself had happened during my absence when i first
got upon my porch and looked about me i almost doubted whether i
was really on the forty-acre my house had been carefully reparied
both within and without a new and substantial stable with other
outbuildings had been erected new fences had been put up around my
fields and orchards cattle were lowing on my meadows and horses
whinnying in the stable to be let loose with them upon the early
grass in a word the forty-acre now looked more prosperous and
flourishing than it had ever before looked mean and empoverished it
looked almost as well as it had done in the days of my father

how was all this change brought about i demanded of my
brother-in-law who with my sister had accompanied or indeed
rather led me to the porch

by the magic of money industry and a little common sense said
alderwood who although a plain and bluff man was a sensible one and
a most excellent farmer you must know my dear sheppard said he
that when we found you were so far gone 

how said i in surprise how did you know i had gone far i thought
the general opinion was that i was murdered

oh yes said my sister nodding at her husband it was just as you
say

with that alderwood smiled and nodded back again saying

prue is right when we discovered your condition that is when we
found you had been murdered as you say and that there was no one to
look to the poor forty-acre except the sheriff and the mortgagee it
was agreed between your sister and myself that i should take the matter
in hand for we were loath the property should go into the possession
of strangers besides prudence insisted upon being near you 

that is said prudence near to where we supposed the murderers must
have concealed your body

exactly so said alderwood for this reason i left my own farm
in the hands of my young brother robert came down hither bag and
baggage applied a little of my loose cash for i believe i have been
somewhat more prosperous than you to stopping the mouth of your
mortgagee building fences banking meadows spreading marl and so on
and the consequence is that we are getting the forty-acre into good
condition again so that in a few years it will pay the debts and
perhaps begin to make the fortune of its owner

i grasped my brother-in-law's hand i was moved by his kindness and
remembering how after quarrelling with him as related in the first
book of this history i had refused a reconciliation and rejected his
offers of assistance his friendship and generosity appeared still more
worthy of my gratitude

poh said he interrupting my thanks and professions of regard but
looking well pleased that i should be disposed to make them i was
persuaded you would come to some day that is i mean come back

that is said prudence we always had a notion you were not really
dead and that we should see you again some time alive and happy

i trust said i you will long see me so for i am now a changed
i hope a wiser man disposed to make the best of the lot to which
heaven has assigned me and to sigh no longer with envy at the supposed
superior advantages of others i think brother alderwood i shall
now be contented with my condition humble and even toilsome as it
may be i have seen enough of the miseries of my fellows those even
whom i most envied during the two years of my absence to teach me
that every man has his share of them that there is nothing peculiarly
wretched in my own lot and that i can be happy or not just as i
may choose to make myself for this reason i shall now bid adieu to
indolence and discontent the vile mother and viler daughter together
and do as my father did before me that is cultivate these few acres
which my folly has left me with my own hands nor will i rest from my
labours until i have discharged every claim against it your own my
dear alderwood first of all though i am sensible i can never repay
the debt of kindness i owe you and this is really your intention
demanded alderwood looking prodigiously gratified your possessions
are now limited indeed yet you have enough with a little industry
and care to render you independent for life and if you will really
apply yourself to the farm 

i will said i if labour and perseverance can do it i will attain
the independence you speak of i will remove every encumbrance on the
forty-acre and then trust to pass such a life as modest wishes and a
contented temper can secure me

you may begin to pass it immediately then said alderwood for the
forty-acre is already clear of every encumbrance yes he continued
seeing me look surprised i tell you nothing but the truth aikin
jones your old friend and overseer 

he is a villain said i and he defrauded me

so it is pretty commonly supposed but as we have no legal proof
of his dishonesty the less we say of it the better he has gone to
settle his accounts at a tribunal where craft and policy can avail him
nothing he died eight months ago and they say who know best in great
agony and fear of spirit now whether he was moved by old feelings of
friendship or was struck with remorse at seeing the condition to which
he had reduced you 

what condition said i

oh said my sister the ruin of your affairs nothing more and
alderwood nodded his head by way of assent to the explanation

in short said he mr aikin jones whatever may have been his
motive thought fit to bequeath you a legacy 

what said i how could he leave a legacy to a man universally
considered dead

oh said my sister he never would believe that there were a good
many people had their doubts on that subject

yes said alderwood and mr aikin jones was one of them and so
finding himself dying and being seized perhaps with compunction for
the wrongs he had done you he left you a legacy no great matter
indeed considering how much of your estate he died possessed of it
sufficed however to pay off your mortgage principal and interest
and to improve and stock the forty-acre just as you now see it so you
see my dear sheppard you are not so badly off as you supposed your
farm is small yet your father drew from it a fortune and i believe a
good farmer might do the same thing a second time but you are not very
learned in agricultural matters i will remain with you a while at
least until your health is re-established and be your teacher when
you find yourself competent to the management of the farm i will bid
you farewell assured that you will lead a happier life than you ever
knew before

this intelligence with regard to my little homestead was highly
agreeable to me nor was i less pleased with my brother-in-law's
resolution to remain with me for a time while i acquired a knowledge
of agriculture and confirmed myself in new habits of industrious and
active application




 chapter iii


containing the substance of a singular debate betwixt the author and
his brother with a philosophic defence of the author's credibility


and now having arrived at the close of my adventurous career i have
but a few additions to make to my story before concluding it entirely

i took an early opportunity to impart to my brother-in-law a faithful
account of my adventures as well as a resolution which i had already
formed to commit them to writing and publish them for the benefit of
the world for i was persuaded they contained a moral which might prove
of service to many persons who like myself had fallen into the error
of supposing they were assigned to a harsher lot than their fellows

this resolution alderwood opposed with all his might being concerned
lest such an enterprise as writing a book should divert my mind from
the labours of the farm and indeed seduce me again into habits of
idleness besides he was afraid the strangeness of my adventures
would cause them to be received with incredulity whereby i might
suffer in reputation and be looked upon only as a dreamer and teller
of falsehoods his chief reasons however i doubt not were the two
first mentioned for he was anxious i should now think of nothing but
my farm his dislike to my design was in truth so great that having
exhausted all the arguments he could muster in the vain design to
overcome it he had resort to a new mode of opposition an expedient
highly ingenious but not a little ridiculous he endeavoured to
shake my own faith in my story to convince me that i had imagined
all i have related and that in a word i had never encountered any
adventures at all i protest i am diverted to this day when i think of
the mingled anxiety and address which he displayed on the occasion he
assured me and that quite plumply that during the whole two years
to speak strictly it was only twenty months of my wanderings i had
never once been off the forty-acre farm that i had never been in any
body besides my own and that the whole source of the notion on my
part lay in a hallucination of mind which had suddenly attacked me
filling me with ridiculous conceits of various transformations such
as never had happened and never could happen to any human being
and this absurd account he persisted in as long as he could with any
decency giving me repeated hints that my mother had died insane
and that it was not therefore strange i should have been a little
odd once in my life i showed him the place where i had been digging
under the beech-tree where by-the-way i was weak enough afterward
to make jim jumble sink a pit twelve feet deep to satisfy myself that
captain kid's money really did not lie there which place however
he averred was as great a proof of the truth of his story as of mine
for said he none but a madman would dig for captain kid's money
i led him to the willow-bushes and the old worm fence in the marsh
where i had found squire higginson's body which he allowed i might
have done but protested that other persons had found it also and that
instead of going home alive in squire higginson's barouche it had
been carried to philadelphia in a coffin and as for higginson's being
clapped into prison for my murder it was i he said who had been
confined on suspicion of having been concerned in his until as he
said it was found that i was out of my wits and that higginson had
died of an apoplexy

i then referred to a circumstance that had happened during my late
sickness as affording the fullest confirmation of my story the
circumstance was this while still lying tormented with fever but at
a moment when my mind was sound and lucid jim jumble put a newspaper
into my hand in which by a singular coincidence appeared an account
of my late transformation in virginia with an allusion to the fate
of zachariah longstraw by which i learned for the first time what
had become of his body after i left it from the article which
strangely and yet naturally enough was headed outrageous humbug
and fatal consequence thereof it seemed to be universally believed
that dr feuerteufel's mummy was no mummy at all but a living man as
i myself had heard it called in the village with whom he had leagued
in a conspiracy to hoax and swindle the good people of the south out
of their money and that the imposture had been detected by mr arthur
megrim who proceeding to force the glass box was knocked down by
the pretended dead man and so unfortunately killed the mummy and
his accomplice the doctor making their escape in the confusion the
editor of the paper after noticing a second account by which it
was asserted that the unfortunate megrim though overturned by the
pretended mummy in his flight had received no injury from him but on
the contrary had died of sheer fright and horror being of a nervous
hypochondriacal turn and acknowledging that this account was more
probable inveighed warmly against the villany and audacity of the
swindlers who he said were more legitimate objects on whom to wreak
the vengeance of lynchdom than the people of that district had found in
zachariah longstraw the philanthropist and here the editor reminded
his readers of the fate of that excellent and distinguished individual
who had died in the lynchers hands the preceding autumn against the
ringleaders of whom his nephew mr jonathan truelove had so vainly
attempted to establish legal proceedings

to this account i say i referred as containing an argument of my
truth not to be resisted but unfortunately the paper had by some
means or other vanished and alderwood said my story went for nothing
without it that paper i have always thought he had himself got
possession of and secreted but had i even retained and shown it to
him i doubt whether it would have affected him in the least for he
was one of those skeptical men who believed a thing none the sooner for
finding it in a newspaper

in a word there is no expressing the obstinacy of my brother in
rejecting my story nor the adroitness with which he met such proofs
as i could give him of the truth of it the last instance of it
which i shall relate was his taking the part of the german doctor
feuerteufel who he declared had not only never made a mummy of me
but had not laid claim to me as his property though he himself that
is my brother-in-law had been present at least a dozen times when
the german doctor did so in my sick-chamber from which alderwood was
so instrumental in expelling him he even insisted that this man
having made a second and last visit to our village to hunt plants and
reptiles had been employed and at his own instance too to cure me
of that very malady he so ridiculously would have me believe i had
been afflicted with and that it was to him under heaven i owed my
restoration to health nay he even went the length of showing me what
he called the doctor's bill and true enough it was a bill with a
receipt in full upon it but the amount being prodigiously great i saw
at once into the whole affair which was nothing less than a masked
contract betwixt my brother-in-law and the doctor whereby the latter
secretly covenanted in consideration of the large sum received from
the former to persecute me no longer with his claims and perhaps to
leave the country altogether

besides all this my brother attacked me by demanding by what means
it was that i had transferred my spirit so often and so easily from
one body to another and this being a question on which the reader
may require satisfaction as well as my brother i must allow that it
presents a difficulty and a very great one all that i can say to
this is first that i did transfer my spirit from body to body
and no less than seven different times secondly that these seven
translations of spirit indicated in me the possession of a peculiar
power to make them and thirdly that the existence of such a peculiar
power however wonderful it may appear is not beyond the bounds of
philosophic probability

no man can be so ignorant or skeptical as to deny that there are
several different faculties of a most marvellous nature with which a
few individuals in the world are mysteriously endowed while the great
mass of men are entirely without them and to the number of these
supernatural endowments there is scarce a year passes by without adding
a new one what can be or ought to be considered a more surprising
faculty than that of ventriloquism the art of throwing the voice
into places and things afar from the operator of taking as it were
the lungs glottis c from his body and clapping them into a chest
log stone wall or other inanimate substance or into the body of
another and how few are there in the world who possess the power of
doing so one man thumps his chin with his fingers and draws from it
pure and agreeable musical tones and another whistles a melody in
parts while men in general might thump and whistle till their teeth
fell out without producing any music worth listening to what can be
more wonderful than the faculty recently developed by the advocates and
practitioners of a new system of medicine who by shaking a bottle in
a peculiar way give to its contents a medical virtue which did not
exist before and which another man the patient for example might
shake till doomsday without imparting

the natural bonesetter is one instance of the possession of a faculty
both rare and astonishing and so is any old woman who can pow-wow the
fire out of a burn not to multiply inferior instances however i will
ask the reader if any faculty can be deemed more incredible than that
of the magnetizer who by flourishing his digits about your body
now cures your rheumatism and now sets you sound asleep unless it
be that of the magnetized slumberer who reads a sealed letter laid
on his epigastrium sees through millstones and men's bodies and
renders oraculous responses to any question that may be proposed him
even though it be upon subjects of which while awake he is entirely
ignorant

in fine granting all these things to be true and who shall dare to
doubt them why should it not be granted that an individual should
possess the power of transferring his spirit from body to body at
will a power but little more extraordinary if indeed it be more
extraordinary than the other faculties which are admitted to have
actual existence

to me it seems that the thing is natural enough though still i
grant extremely wonderful many persons are thought to possess the
ventriloquial and even the magnetic power without being conscious of
the endowment accident having been in all cases the cause of their
being made acquainted with its existence in the same way it is not
improbable that other persons besides myself may possess the faculty
of reanimating dead bodies without suspecting it for i can scarce
believe the faculty should be confined entirely to myself




 chapter iv


being the last chapter of all


i never could succeed in convincing my brother-in-law of the truth of
my relation or rather for i have always thought his incredulity
was assumed for the purpose mentioned i never could overcome his
opposition to the design i formed of writing and committing it to the
press for this reason i ceased talking of it more and even affected
to believe the foolish story he had told me of my having conceived
my adventures in a mere fit of delirium this i did not so much out
of compliment to him as from a desire to have him believe i would
let nothing divert me from the business of my farm which indeed i
immediately addressed myself to in such good earnest as secured his
hearty approval and zealous congratulations

in secret however and in the intervals of toil i employed myself
recording my adventures while their impression was still strong on my
memory and now having happily brought them to a conclusion i commit
them to the world confident that if they surprise nobody else they
will cause some astonishment to my brother alderwood

it is now some time since i have been deprived of his and my sister's
company at watermelon hill they having retired to their own farm as
soon as my brother was well convinced i was capable of managing my own
affairs my only society now consists of honest jim jumble his wife
dinah and my sister's oldest son sheppard lee alderwood for he was
named after me a lad of fourteen years but uncommonly shrewd and
sensible for whom i have contracted a strong affection and to whom
if i should die unmarried as is quite probable i design bequeathing
my little patrimony

jim jumble is as independent and saucy as ever but i can bear with his
humours he is so faithful industrious and as i may add so happy
to see his master once more prospering in the world he and dinah are
singing all day long

my estate is small and it may be that it will never increase i am
however content with it and content is the secret of all enjoyment i
am not ashamed to labour in my fields on the contrary i have learned
to be grateful to providence that it ordained me to a lot of toil
wherein i find the truest source of health self-approbation and
happiness my only trouble is an occasional stiffness and sluggishness
of joints and muscles which jim jumble tells me is all owing to my
being naturally a lazy man but which i myself suppose was caused by
my remaining so long a mummy to counterbalance this evil however i
find in myself an astonishing hardiness of constitution particularly
in resisting quinsies catarrhs and defluxions on the breast to which
i was formerly very liable and this immunity i know not how to account
for unless by supposing that my body was hardened by the process of
mummifying and that it still continues to be water-proof

at all events be my body what it may hardy or frail stiff or supple
i am satisfied with it and shall never again seek to exchange it for
another

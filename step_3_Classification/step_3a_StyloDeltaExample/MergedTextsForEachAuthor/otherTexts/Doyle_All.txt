in choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable mental
qualities of my friend sherlock holmes i have endeavoured as far as
possible to select those which presented the minimum of
sensationalism while offering a fair field for his talents it is
however unfortunately impossible entirely to separate the sensational
from the criminal and a chronicler is left in the dilemma that he must
either sacrifice details which are essential to his statement and so
give a false impression of the problem or he must use matter which
chance and not choice has provided him with with this short preface
i shall turn to my notes of what proved to be a strange though a
peculiarly terrible chain of events

it was a blazing hot day in august baker street was like an oven and
the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of the house across
the road was painful to the eye it was hard to believe that these
were the same walls which loomed so gloomily through the fogs of
winter our blinds were half-drawn and holmes lay curled upon the
sofa reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the
morning post for myself my term of service in india had trained me
to stand heat better than cold and a thermometer at ninety was no
hardship but the morning paper was uninteresting parliament had
risen everybody was out of town and i yearned for the glades of the
new forest or the shingle of southsea a depleted bank account had
caused me to postpone my holiday and as to my companion neither the
country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him he
loved to lie in the very center of five millions of people with his
filaments stretching out and running through them responsive to every
little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime appreciation of nature
found no place among his many gifts and his only change was when he
turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town to track down his
brother of the country

finding that holmes was too absorbed for conversation i had tossed aside
the barren paper and leaning back in my chair i fell into a brown
study suddenly my companion's voice broke in upon my thoughts

you are right watson said he it does seem a most preposterous
way of settling a dispute

most preposterous i exclaimed and then suddenly realizing how he
had echoed the inmost thought of my soul i sat up in my chair and
stared at him in blank amazement

what is this holmes i cried this is beyond anything which i
could have imagined

he laughed heartily at my perplexity

you remember said he that some little time ago when i read you the
passage in one of poe's sketches in which a close reasoner follows the
unspoken thoughts of his companion you were inclined to treat the
matter as a mere tour-de-force of the author on my remarking that i
was constantly in the habit of doing the same thing you expressed
incredulity

oh no

perhaps not with your tongue my dear watson but certainly with your
eyebrows so when i saw you throw down your paper and enter upon a
train of thought i was very happy to have the opportunity of reading
it off and eventually of breaking into it as a proof that i had been
in rapport with you

but i was still far from satisfied in the example which you read to
me said i the reasoner drew his conclusions from the actions of the
man whom he observed if i remember right he stumbled over a heap of
stones looked up at the stars and so on but i have been seated
quietly in my chair and what clues can i have given you

you do yourself an injustice the features are given to man as the
means by which he shall express his emotions and yours are faithful
servants

do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my
features

your features and especially your eyes perhaps you cannot yourself
recall how your reverie commenced

no i cannot

then i will tell you after throwing down your paper which was the
action which drew my attention to you you sat for half a minute with a
vacant expression then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly
framed picture of general gordon and i saw by the alteration in your
face that a train of thought had been started but it did not lead
very far your eyes flashed across to the unframed portrait of henry
ward beecher which stands upon the top of your books then you glanced
up at the wall and of course your meaning was obvious you were
thinking that if the portrait were framed it would just cover that bare
space and correspond with gordon's picture there

you have followed me wonderfully i exclaimed

so far i could hardly have gone astray but now your thoughts went
back to beecher and you looked hard across as if you were studying the
character in his features then your eyes ceased to pucker but you
continued to look across and your face was thoughtful you were
recalling the incidents of beecher's career i was well aware that you
could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on
behalf of the north at the time of the civil war for i remember your
expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was
received by the more turbulent of our people you felt so strongly
about it that i knew you could not think of beecher without thinking of
that also when a moment later i saw your eyes wander away from the
picture i suspected that your mind had now turned to the civil war
and when i observed that your lips set your eyes sparkled and your
hands clenched i was positive that you were indeed thinking of the
gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle but
then again your face grew sadder you shook your head you were
dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life your
hand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your
lips which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of
settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind at
this point i agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to
find that all my deductions had been correct

absolutely said i and now that you have explained it i confess
that i am as amazed as before

it was very superficial my dear watson i assure you i should not
have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some incredulity
the other day but i have in my hands here a little problem which may
prove to be more difficult of solution than my small essay in thought
reading have you observed in the paper a short paragraph referring to
the remarkable contents of a packet sent through the post to miss
cushing of cross street croydon

no i saw nothing

ah then you must have overlooked it just toss it over to me here
it is under the financial column perhaps you would be good enough to
read it aloud

i picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the
paragraph indicated it was headed a gruesome packet

miss susan cushing living at cross street croydon has been made the
victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly revolting practical
joke unless some more sinister meaning should prove to be attached to
the incident at two o'clock yesterday afternoon a small packet
wrapped in brown paper was handed in by the postman a cardboard box
was inside which was filled with coarse salt on emptying this miss
cushing was horrified to find two human ears apparently quite freshly
severed the box had been sent by parcel post from belfast upon the
morning before there is no indication as to the sender and the
matter is the more mysterious as miss cushing who is a maiden lady of
fifty has led a most retired life and has so few acquaintances or
correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive anything
through the post some years ago however when she resided at penge
she let apartments in her house to three young medical students whom
she was obliged to get rid of on account of their noisy and irregular
habits the police are of opinion that this outrage may have been
perpetrated upon miss cushing by these youths who owed her a grudge
and who hoped to frighten her by sending her these relics of the
dissecting-rooms some probability is lent to the theory by the fact
that one of these students came from the north of ireland and to the
best of miss cushing's belief from belfast in the meantime the
matter is being actively investigated mr lestrade one of the very
smartest of our detective officers being in charge of the case

so much for the daily chronicle said holmes as i finished reading
now for our friend lestrade i had a note from him this morning in
which he says

i think that this case is very much in your line we have every hope
of clearing the matter up but we find a little difficulty in getting
anything to work upon we have of course wired to the belfast
post-office but a large number of parcels were handed in upon that
day and they have no means of identifying this particular one or of
remembering the sender the box is a half-pound box of honeydew
tobacco and does not help us in any way the medical student theory
still appears to me to be the most feasible but if you should have a
few hours to spare i should be very happy to see you out here i shall
be either at the house or in the police-station all day

what say you watson can you rise superior to the heat and run down
to croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals

i was longing for something to do

you shall have it then ring for our boots and tell them to order a
cab i'll be back in a moment when i have changed my dressing-gown and
filled my cigar-case

a shower of rain fell while we were in the train and the heat was far
less oppressive in croydon than in town holmes had sent on a wire so
that lestrade as wiry as dapper and as ferret-like as ever was
waiting for us at the station a walk of five minutes took us to cross
street where miss cushing resided

it was a very long street of two-story brick houses neat and prim
with whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned women gossiping
at the doors halfway down lestrade stopped and tapped at a door
which was opened by a small servant girl miss cushing was sitting in
the front room into which we were ushered she was a placid-faced
woman with large gentle eyes and grizzled hair curving down over her
temples on each side a worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a
basket of coloured silks stood upon a stool beside her

they are in the outhouse those dreadful things said she as lestrade
entered i wish that you would take them away altogether

so i shall miss cushing i only kept them here until my friend mr
holmes should have seen them in your presence

why in my presence sir

in case he wished to ask any questions

what is the use of asking me questions when i tell you i know nothing
whatever about it

quite so madam said holmes in his soothing way i have no doubt
that you have been annoyed more than enough already over this business

indeed i have sir i am a quiet woman and live a retired life it is
something new for me to see my name in the papers and to find the
police in my house i won't have those things in here mr lestrade
if you wish to see them you must go to the outhouse

it was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the house
lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box with a piece
of brown paper and some string there was a bench at the end of the
path and we all sat down while homes examined one by one the articles
which lestrade had handed to him

the string is exceedingly interesting he remarked holding it up to
the light and sniffing at it what do you make of this string
lestrade

it has been tarred

precisely it is a piece of tarred twine you have also no doubt
remarked that miss cushing has cut the cord with a scissors as can be
seen by the double fray on each side this is of importance

i cannot see the importance said lestrade

the importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact and that
this knot is of a peculiar character

it is very neatly tied i had already made a note of that effect
said lestrade complacently

so much for the string then said holmes smiling now for the box
wrapper brown paper with a distinct smell of coffee what did you
not observe it i think there can be no doubt of it address printed
in rather straggling characters miss s cushing cross street
croydon done with a broad-pointed pen probably a j and with very
inferior ink the word croydon has been originally spelled with an
i which has been changed to y the parcel was directed then by
a man the printing is distinctly masculine of limited education and
unacquainted with the town of croydon so far so good the box is a
yellow half-pound honeydew box with nothing distinctive save two
thumb marks at the left bottom corner it is filled with rough salt of
the quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser
commercial purposes and embedded in it are these very singular
enclosures

he took out the two ears as he spoke and laying a board across his
knee he examined them minutely while lestrade and i bending forward
on each side of him glanced alternately at these dreadful relics and
at the thoughtful eager face of our companion finally he returned
them to the box once more and sat for a while in deep meditation

you have observed of course said he at last that the ears are not
a pair

yes i have noticed that but if this were the practical joke of some
students from the dissecting-rooms it would be as easy for them to
send two odd ears as a pair

precisely but this is not a practical joke

you are sure of it

the presumption is strongly against it bodies in the
dissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid these ears bear
no signs of this they are fresh too they have been cut off with a
blunt instrument which would hardly happen if a student had done it
again carbolic or rectified spirits would be the preservatives which
would suggest themselves to the medical mind certainly not rough salt
i repeat that there is no practical joke here but that we are
investigating a serious crime

a vague thrill ran through me as i listened to my companion's words and
saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features this brutal
preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and inexplicable horror
in the background lestrade however shook his head like a man who is
only half convinced

there are objections to the joke theory no doubt said he but
there are much stronger reasons against the other we know that this
woman has led a most quiet and respectable life at penge and here for
the last twenty years she has hardly been away from her home for a
day during that time why on earth then should any criminal send her
the proofs of his guilt especially as unless she is a most consummate
actress she understands quite as little of the matter as we do

that is the problem which we have to solve holmes answered and for
my part i shall set about it by presuming that my reasoning is correct
and that a double murder has been committed one of these ears is a
woman's small finely formed and pierced for an earring the other
is a man's sun-burned discoloured and also pierced for an earring
these two people are presumably dead or we should have heard their
story before now to-day is friday the packet was posted on thursday
morning the tragedy then occurred on wednesday or tuesday or
earlier if the two people were murdered who but their murderer would
have sent this sign of his work to miss cushing we may take it that
the sender of the packet is the man whom we want but he must have some
strong reason for sending miss cushing this packet what reason then
it must have been to tell her that the deed was done or to pain her
perhaps but in that case she knows who it is does she know i
doubt it if she knew why should she call the police in she might
have buried the ears and no one would have been the wiser that is
what she would have done if she had wished to shield the criminal but
if she does not wish to shield him she would give his name there is a
tangle here which needs straightening out he had been talking in a
high quick voice staring blankly up over the garden fence but now he
sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house

i have a few questions to ask miss cushing said he

in that case i may leave you here said lestrade for i have another
small business on hand i think that i have nothing further to learn
from miss cushing you will find me at the police-station

we shall look in on our way to the train answered holmes a moment
later he and i were back in the front room where the impassive lady
was still quietly working away at her antimacassar she put it down on
her lap as we entered and looked at us with her frank searching blue
eyes

i am convinced sir she said that this matter is a mistake and
that the parcel was never meant for me at all i have said this
several times to the gentlemen from scotland yard but he simply laughs
at me i have not an enemy in the world as far as i know so why
should anyone play me such a trick

i am coming to be of the same opinion miss cushing said holmes
taking a seat beside her i think that it is more than probable  he
paused and i was surprised on glancing round to see that he was
staring with singular intentness at the lady's profile surprise and
satisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face
though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he
had become as demure as ever i stared hard myself at her flat
grizzled hair her trim cap her little gilt earrings her placid
features but i could see nothing which could account for my
companion's evident excitement

there were one or two questions 

oh i am weary of questions cried miss cushing impatiently

you have two sisters i believe

how could you know that

i observed the very instant that i entered the room that you have a
portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece one of whom is
undoubtedly yourself while the others are so exceedingly like you that
there could be no doubt of the relationship

yes you are quite right those are my sisters sarah and mary

and here at my elbow is another portrait taken at liverpool of your
younger sister in the company of a man who appears to be a steward by
his uniform i observe that she was unmarried at the time

you are very quick at observing

that is my trade

well you are quite right but she was married to mr browner a few
days afterwards he was on the south american line when that was
taken but he was so fond of her that he couldn't abide to leave her
for so long and he got into the liverpool and london boats

ah the conqueror perhaps

no the may day when last i heard jim came down here to see me
once that was before he broke the pledge but afterwards he would
always take drink when he was ashore and a little drink would send him
stark staring mad ah it was a bad day that ever he took a glass in
his hand again first he dropped me then he quarrelled with sarah
and now that mary has stopped writing we don't know how things are
going with them

it was evident that miss cushing had come upon a subject on which she
felt very deeply like most people who lead a lonely life she was shy
at first but ended by becoming extremely communicative she told us
many details about her brother-in-law the steward and then wandering
off on the subject of her former lodgers the medical students she
gave us a long account of their delinquencies with their names and
those of their hospitals holmes listened attentively to everything
throwing in a question from time to time

about your second sister sarah said he i wonder since you are
both maiden ladies that you do not keep house together

ah you don't know sarah's temper or you would wonder no more i tried
it when i came to croydon and we kept on until about two months ago
when we had to part i don't want to say a word against my own sister
but she was always meddlesome and hard to please was sarah

you say that she quarrelled with your liverpool relations

yes and they were the best of friends at one time why she went up
there to live in order to be near them and now she has no word hard
enough for jim browner the last six months that she was here she
would speak of nothing but his drinking and his ways he had caught
her meddling i suspect and given her a bit of his mind and that was
the start of it

thank you miss cushing said holmes rising and bowing your
sister sarah lives i think you said at new street wallington
good-bye and i am very sorry that you should have been troubled over a
case with which as you say you have nothing whatever to do

there was a cab passing as we came out and holmes hailed it

how far to wallington he asked

only about a mile sir

very good jump in watson we must strike while the iron is hot
simple as the case is there have been one or two very instructive
details in connection with it just pull up at a telegraph office as
you pass cabby

holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay back in
the cab with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the sun from his
face our drive pulled up at a house which was not unlike the one which
we had just quitted my companion ordered him to wait and had his
hand upon the knocker when the door opened and a grave young gentleman
in black with a very shiny hat appeared on the step

is miss cushing at home asked holmes

miss sarah cushing is extremely ill said he she has been
suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity as her
medical adviser i cannot possibly take the responsibility of allowing
anyone to see her i should recommend you to call again in ten days
he drew on his gloves closed the door and marched off down the street

well if we can't we can't said holmes cheerfully

perhaps she could not or would not have told you much

i did not wish her to tell me anything i only wanted to look at her
however i think that i have got all that i want drive us to some
decent hotel cabby where we may have some lunch and afterwards we
shall drop down upon friend lestrade at the police-station

we had a pleasant little meal together during which holmes would talk
about nothing but violins narrating with great exultation how he had
purchased his own stradivarius which was worth at least five hundred
guineas at a jew broker's in tottenham court road for fifty-five
shillings this led him to paganini and we sat for an hour over a
bottle of claret while he told me anecdote after anecdote of that
extraordinary man the afternoon was far advanced and the hot glare
had softened into a mellow glow before we found ourselves at the
police-station lestrade was waiting for us at the door

a telegram for you mr holmes said he

ha it is the answer he tore it open glanced his eyes over it
and crumpled it into his pocket that's all right said he

have you found out anything

i have found out everything

what lestrade stared at him in amazement you are joking

i was never more serious in my life a shocking crime has been
committed and i think i have now laid bare every detail of it

and the criminal

holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting cards
and threw it over to lestrade

that is the name he said you cannot effect an arrest until
to-morrow night at the earliest i should prefer that you do not
mention my name at all in connection with the case as i choose to be
only associated with those crimes which present some difficulty in
their solution come on watson we strode off together to the
station leaving lestrade still staring with a delighted face at the
card which holmes had thrown him


the case said sherlock holmes as we chatted over our cigars that
night in our rooms at baker street is one where as in the
investigations which you have chronicled under the names of a study in
scarlet and of the sign of four we have been compelled to reason
backward from effects to causes i have written to lestrade asking him
to supply us with the details which are now wanting and which he will
only get after he had secured his man that he may be safely trusted
to do for although he is absolutely devoid of reason he is as
tenacious as a bulldog when he once understands what he has to do and
indeed it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top at
scotland yard

your case is not complete then i asked

it is fairly complete in essentials we know who the author of the
revolting business is although one of the victims still escapes us
of course you have formed your own conclusions

i presume that this jim browner the steward of a liverpool boat is
the man whom you suspect

oh it is more than a suspicion

and yet i cannot see anything save very vague indications

on the contrary to my mind nothing could be more clear let me run
over the principal steps we approached the case you remember with
an absolutely blank mind which is always an advantage we had formed
no theories we were simply there to observe and to draw inferences
from our observations what did we see first a very placid and
respectable lady who seemed quite innocent of any secret and a
portrait which showed me that she had two younger sisters it
instantly flashed across my mind that the box might have been meant for
one of these i set the idea aside as one which could be disproved or
confirmed at our leisure then we went to the garden as you remember
and we saw the very singular contents of the little yellow box

the string was of the quality which is used by sail-makers aboard
ship and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our
investigation when i observed that the knot was one which is popular
with sailors that the parcel had been posted at a port and that the
male ear was pierced for an earring which is so much more common among
sailors than landsmen i was quite certain that all the actors in the
tragedy were to be found among our seafaring classes

when i came to examine the address of the packet i observed that it
was to miss s cushing now the oldest sister would of course be
miss cushing and although her initial was s it might belong to one
of the others as well in that case we should have to commence our
investigation from a fresh basis altogether i therefore went into the
house with the intention of clearing up this point i was about to
assure miss cushing that i was convinced that a mistake had been made
when you may remember that i came suddenly to a stop the fact was
that i had just seen something which filled me with surprise and at the
same time narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely

as a medical man you are aware watson that there is no part of the
body which varies so much as the human ear each ear is as a rule
quite distinctive and differs from all other ones in last year's
anthropological journal you will find two short monographs from my pen
upon the subject i had therefore examined the ears in the box with
the eyes of an expert and had carefully noted their anatomical
peculiarities imagine my surprise then when on looking at miss
cushing i perceived that her ear corresponded exactly with the female
ear which i had just inspected the matter was entirely beyond
coincidence there was the same shortening of the pinna the same
broad curve of the upper lobe the same convolution of the inner
cartilage in all essentials it was the same ear

in the first place her sister's name was sarah and her address had
until recently been the same so that it was quite obvious how the
mistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant then we heard
of this steward married to the third sister and learned that he had
at one time been so intimate with miss sarah that she had actually gone
up to liverpool to be near the browners but a quarrel had afterwards
divided them this quarrel had put a stop to all communications for
some months so that if browner had occasion to address a packet to
miss sarah he would undoubtedly have done so to her old address

and now the matter had begun to straighten itself out wonderfully we
had learned of the existence of this steward an impulsive man of
strong passions you remember that he threw up what must have been a
very superior berth in order to be nearer to his wife subject too to
occasional fits of hard drinking we had reason to believe that his
wife had been murdered and that a man presumably a seafaring man had
been murdered at the same time jealousy of course at once suggests
itself as the motive for the crime and why should these proofs of the
deed be sent to miss sarah cushing probably because during her
residence in liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events
which led to the tragedy you will observe that this line of boats
call at belfast dublin and waterford so that presuming that browner
had committed the deed and had embarked at once upon his steamer the
may day belfast would be the first place at which he could post his
terrible packet

a second solution was at this stage obviously possible and although i
thought it exceedingly unlikely i was determined to elucidate it
before going further an unsuccessful lover might have killed mr and
mrs browner and the male ear might have belonged to the husband
there were many grave objections to this theory but it was
conceivable i therefore sent off a telegram to my friend algar of
the liverpool force and asked him to find out if mrs browner were at
home and if browner had departed in the may day then we went on to
wallington to visit miss sarah

i was curious in the first place to see how far the family ear had
been reproduced in her then of course she might give us very
important information but i was not sanguine that she would she must
have heard of the business the day before since all croydon was
ringing with it and she alone could have understood for whom the
packet was meant if she had been willing to help justice she would
probably have communicated with the police already however it was
clearly our duty to see her so we went we found that the news of the
arrival of the packet for her illness dated from that time had such
an effect upon her as to bring on brain fever it was clearer than
ever that she understood its full significance but equally clear that
we should have to wait some time for any assistance from her

however we were really independent of her help our answers were
waiting for us at the police-station where i had directed algar to
send them nothing could be more conclusive mrs browner's house had
been closed for more than three days and the neighbours were of
opinion that she had gone south to see her relatives it had been
ascertained at the shipping offices that browner had left aboard of the
may day and i calculate that she is due in the thames tomorrow night
when he arrives he will be met by the obtuse but resolute lestrade and
i have no doubt that we shall have all our details filled in

sherlock holmes was not disappointed in his expectations two days
later he received a bulky envelope which contained a short note from
the detective and a typewritten document which covered several pages
of foolscap

lestrade has got him all right said holmes glancing up at me
perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says

my dear mr holmes

in accordance with the scheme which we had formed in order to test our
theories the we is rather fine watson is it not i went down
to the albert dock yesterday at pm and boarded the ss may day
belonging to the liverpool dublin and london steam packet company
on inquiry i found that there was a steward on board of the name of
james browner and that he had acted during the voyage in such an
extraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to relieve him
of his duties on descending to his berth i found him seated upon a
chest with his head sunk upon his hands rocking himself to and fro
he is a big powerful chap clean-shaven and very swarthy something
like aldrige who helped us in the bogus laundry affair he jumped up
when he heard my business and i had my whistle to my lips to call a
couple of river police who were round the corner but he seemed to
have no heart in him and he held out his hands quietly enough for the
darbies we brought him along to the cells and his box as well for
we thought there might be something incriminating but bar a big sharp
knife such as most sailors have we got nothing for our trouble
however we find that we shall want no more evidence for on being
brought before the inspector at the station he asked leave to make a
statement which was of course taken down just as he made it by our
shorthand man we had three copies typewritten one of which i
enclose the affair proves as i always thought it would to be an
extremely simple one but i am obliged to you for assisting me in my
investigation with kind regards

yours very truly
 g lestrade


hum the investigation really was a very simple one remarked
holmes but i don't think it struck him in that light when he first
called us in however let us see what jim browner has to say for
himself this is his statement as made before inspector montgomery at
the shadwell police station and it has the advantage of being
verbatim


have i anything to say yes i have a deal to say i have to make a
clean breast of it all you can hang me or you can leave me alone i
don't care a plug which you do i tell you i've not shut an eye in
sleep since i did it and i don't believe i ever will again until i get
past all waking sometimes it's his face but most generally it's
hers i'm never without one or the other before me he looks frowning
and black-like but she has a kind o surprise upon her face ay the
white lamb she might well be surprised when she read death on a face
that had seldom looked anything but love upon her before

but it was sarah's fault and may the curse of a broken man put a
blight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins it's not that i
want to clear myself i know that i went back to drink like the beast
that i was but she would have forgiven me she would have stuck as
close to me as a rope to a block if that woman had never darkened our
door for sarah cushing loved me that's the root of the business she
loved me until all her love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that
i thought more of my wife's footmark in the mud than i did of her whole
body and soul

there were three sisters altogether the old one was just a good
woman the second was a devil and the third was an angel sarah was
thirty-three and mary was twenty-nine when i married we were just as
happy as the day was long when we set up house together and in all
liverpool there was no better woman than my mary and then we asked
sarah up for a week and the week grew into a month and one thing led
to another until she was just one of ourselves

i was blue ribbon at that time and we were putting a little money
by and all was as bright as a new dollar my god whoever would have
thought that it could have come to this whoever would have dreamed it

i used to be home for the week-ends very often and sometimes if the
ship were held back for cargo i would have a whole week at a time and
in this way i saw a deal of my sister-in-law sarah she was a fine
tall woman black and quick and fierce with a proud way of carrying
her head and a glint from her eye like a spark from a flint but when
little mary was there i had never a thought of her and that i swear as
i hope for god's mercy

it had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with me or
to coax me out for a walk with her but i had never thought anything of
that but one evening my eyes were opened i had come up from the ship
and found my wife out but sarah at home where's mary i asked
oh she has gone to pay some accounts i was impatient and paced up
and down the room can't you be happy for five minutes without mary
jim says she it's a bad compliment to me that you can't be
contented with my society for so short a time that's all right my
lass said i putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way but she
had it in both hers in an instant and they burned as if they were in a
fever i looked into her eyes and i read it all there there was no
need for her to speak nor for me either i frowned and drew my hand
away then she stood by my side in silence for a bit and then put up
her hand and patted me on the shoulder steady old jim said she
and with a kind o mocking laugh she ran out of the room

well from that time sarah hated me with her whole heart and soul
and she is a woman who can hate too i was a fool to let her go on
biding with us a besotted fool but i never said a word to mary for i
knew it would grieve her things went on much as before but after a
time i began to find that there was a bit of a change in mary herself
she had always been so trusting and so innocent but now she became
queer and suspicious wanting to know where i had been and what i had
been doing and whom my letters were from and what i had in my
pockets and a thousand such follies day by day she grew queerer and
more irritable and we had ceaseless rows about nothing i was fairly
puzzled by it all sarah avoided me now but she and mary were just
inseparable i can see now how she was plotting and scheming and
poisoning my wife's mind against me but i was such a blind beetle that
i could not understand it at the time then i broke my blue ribbon and
began to drink again but i think i should not have done it if mary had
been the same as ever she had some reason to be disgusted with me now
and the gap between us began to be wider and wider and then this alec
fairbairn chipped in and things became a thousand times blacker

it was to see sarah that he came to my house first but soon it was
to see us for he was a man with winning ways and he made friends
wherever he went he was a dashing swaggering chap smart and curled
who had seen half the world and could talk of what he had seen he was
good company i won't deny it and he had wonderful polite ways with
him for a sailor man so that i think there must have been a time when
he knew more of the poop than the forecastle for a month he was in
and out of my house and never once did it cross my mind that harm
might come of his soft tricky ways and then at last something made
me suspect and from that day my peace was gone forever

it was only a little thing too i had come into the parlour
unexpected and as i walked in at the door i saw a light of welcome on
my wife's face but as she saw who it was it faded again and she
turned away with a look of disappointment that was enough for me
there was no one but alec fairbairn whose step she could have mistaken
for mine if i could have seen him then i should have killed him for
i have always been like a madman when my temper gets loose mary saw
the devil's light in my eyes and she ran forward with her hands on my
sleeve don't jim don't says she where's sarah i asked in
the kitchen says she sarah says i as i went in this man
fairbairn is never to darken my door again why not says she
because i order it oh says she if my friends are not good
enough for this house then i am not good enough for it either you
can do what you like says i but if fairbairn shows his face here
again i'll send you one of his ears for a keepsake she was
frightened by my face i think for she never answered a word and the
same evening she left my house

well i don't know now whether it was pure devilry on the part of
this woman or whether she thought that she could turn me against my
wife by encouraging her to misbehave anyway she took a house just
two streets off and let lodgings to sailors fairbairn used to stay
there and mary would go round to have tea with her sister and him
how often she went i don't know but i followed her one day and as i
broke in at the door fairbairn got away over the back garden wall like
the cowardly skunk that he was i swore to my wife that i would kill
her if i found her in his company again and i led her back with me
sobbing and trembling and as white as a piece of paper there was no
trace of love between us any longer i could see that she hated me and
feared me and when the thought of it drove me to drink then she
despised me as well

well sarah found that she could not make a living in liverpool so
she went back as i understand to live with her sister in croydon and
things jogged on much the same as ever at home and then came this
week and all the misery and ruin

it was in this way we had gone on the may day for a round voyage of
seven days but a hogshead got loose and started one of our plates so
that we had to put back into port for twelve hours i left the ship
and came home thinking what a surprise it would be for my wife and
hoping that maybe she would be glad to see me so soon the thought was
in my head as i turned into my own street and at that moment a cab
passed me and there she was sitting by the side of fairbairn the two
chatting and laughing with never a thought for me as i stood watching
them from the footpath

i tell you and i give you my word for it that from that moment i
was not my own master and it is all like a dim dream when i look back
on it i had been drinking hard of late and the two things together
fairly turned my brain there's something throbbing in my head now
like a docker's hammer but that morning i seemed to have all niagara
whizzing and buzzing in my ears

well i took to my heels and i ran after the cab i had a heavy oak
stick in my hand and i tell you i saw red from the first but as i ran
i got cunning too and hung back a little to see them without being
seen they pulled up soon at the railway station there was a good
crowd round the booking-office so i got quite close to them without
being seen they took tickets for new brighton so did i but i got
in three carriages behind them when we reached it they walked along
the parade and i was never more than a hundred yards from them at
last i saw them hire a boat and start for a row for it was a very hot
day and they thought no doubt that it would be cooler on the water

it was just as if they had been given into my hands there was a bit
of a haze and you could not see more than a few hundred yards i
hired a boat for myself and i pulled after them i could see the blur
of their craft but they were going nearly as fast as i and they must
have been a long mile from the shore before i caught them up the haze
was like a curtain all round us and there were we three in the middle
of it my god shall i ever forget their faces when they saw who was
in the boat that was closing in upon them she screamed out he swore
like a madman and jabbed at me with an oar for he must have seen death
in my eyes i got past it and got one in with my stick that crushed
his head like an egg i would have spared her perhaps for all my
madness but she threw her arms round him crying out to him and
calling him alec i struck again and she lay stretched beside him
i was like a wild beast then that had tasted blood if sarah had been
there by the lord she should have joined them i pulled out my
knife and well there i've said enough it gave me a kind of savage
joy when i thought how sarah would feel when she had such signs as
these of what her meddling had brought about then i tied the bodies
into the boat stove a plank and stood by until they had sunk i knew
very well that the owner would think that they had lost their bearings
in the haze and had drifted off out to sea i cleaned myself up got
back to land and joined my ship without a soul having a suspicion of
what had passed that night i made up the packet for sarah cushing
and next day i sent it from belfast

there you have the whole truth of it you can hang me or do what
you like with me but you cannot punish me as i have been punished
already i cannot shut my eyes but i see those two faces staring at
me staring at me as they stared when my boat broke through the haze
i killed them quick but they are killing me slow and if i have
another night of it i shall be either mad or dead before morning you
won't put me alone into a cell sir for pity's sake don't and may
you be treated in your day of agony as you treat me now


what is the meaning of it watson said holmes solemnly as he laid
down the paper what object is served by this circle of misery and
violence and fear it must tend to some end or else our universe is
ruled by chance which is unthinkable but what end there is the
great standing perennial problem to which human reason is as far from
an answer as ever



adventure i a scandal in bohemia

i

to sherlock holmes she is always the woman i have seldom heard
him mention her under any other name in his eyes she eclipses
and predominates the whole of her sex it was not that he felt
any emotion akin to love for irene adler all emotions and that
one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but
admirably balanced mind he was i take it the most perfect
reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a
lover he would have placed himself in a false position he never
spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer they
were admirable things for the observer excellent for drawing the
veil from men's motives and actions but for the trained reasoner
to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
might throw a doubt upon all his mental results grit in a
sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high-power
lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
nature such as his and yet there was but one woman to him and
that woman was the late irene adler of dubious and questionable
memory

i had seen little of holmes lately my marriage had drifted us
away from each other my own complete happiness and the
home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to
absorb all my attention while holmes who loathed every form of
society with his whole bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in
baker street buried among his old books and alternating from
week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the
drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature he was still
as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his
immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in
following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which
had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police from time
to time i heard some vague account of his doings of his summons
to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder of his clearing up
of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee
and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so
delicately and successfully for the reigning family of holland
beyond these signs of his activity however which i merely
shared with all the readers of the daily press i knew little of
my former friend and companion

one night it was on the twentieth of march i was
returning from a journey to a patient for i had now returned to
civil practice when my way led me through baker street as i
passed the well-remembered door which must always be associated
in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the
study in scarlet i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes
again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers
his rooms were brilliantly lit and even as i looked up i saw
his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against
the blind he was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head
sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who
knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their
own story he was at work again he had risen out of his
drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
problem i rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which
had formerly been in part my own

his manner was not effusive it seldom was but he was glad i
think to see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly
eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars
and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner then he
stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular
introspective fashion

wedlock suits you he remarked i think watson that you have
put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you

seven i answered

indeed i should have thought a little more just a trifle more
i fancy watson and in practice again i observe you did not
tell me that you intended to go into harness

then how do you know

i see it i deduce it how do i know that you have been getting
yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and
careless servant girl

my dear holmes said i this is too much you would certainly
have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true
that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful
mess but as i have changed my clothes i can't imagine how you
deduce it as to mary jane she is incorrigible and my wife has
given her notice but there again i fail to see how you work it
out

he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands
together

it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the
inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it
the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they
have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round
the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it
hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile
weather and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting
specimen of the london slavey as to your practice if a
gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black
mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge
on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
his stethoscope i must be dull indeed if i do not pronounce
him to be an active member of the medical profession

i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
process of deduction when i hear you give your reasons i
remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously
simple that i could easily do it myself though at each
successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you
explain your process and yet i believe that my eyes are as good
as yours

quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing
himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observe
the distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen
the steps which lead up from the hall to this room

frequently

how often

well some hundreds of times

then how many are there

how many i don't know

quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is
just my point now i know that there are seventeen steps
because i have both seen and observed by-the-way since you are
interested in these little problems and since you are good
enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you
may be interested in this he threw over a sheet of thick
pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table
it came by the last post said he read it aloud

the note was undated and without either signature or address

there will call upon you to-night at a quarter to eight
o'clock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a
matter of the very deepest moment your recent services to one of
the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may
safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which
can hardly be exaggerated this account of you we have from all
quarters received be in your chamber then at that hour and do
not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask

this is indeed a mystery i remarked what do you imagine that
it means

i have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorize before
one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit
theories instead of theories to suit facts but the note itself
what do you deduce from it

i carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was
written

the man who wrote it was presumably well to do i remarked
endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes such paper
could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly
strong and stiff

peculiar that is the very word said holmes it is not an
english paper at all hold it up to the light

i did so and saw a large e with a small g a p and a
large g with a small t woven into the texture of the paper

what do you make of that asked holmes

the name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather

not at all the g with the small t stands for
gesellschaft which is the german for company it is a
customary contraction like our co p of course stands for
papier now for the eg let us glance at our continental
gazetteer he took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves
eglow eglonitz here we are egria it is in a german-speaking
country in bohemia not far from carlsbad remarkable as being
the scene of the death of wallenstein and for its numerous
glass-factories and paper-mills ha ha my boy what do you
make of that his eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue
triumphant cloud from his cigarette

the paper was made in bohemia i said

precisely and the man who wrote the note is a german do you
note the peculiar construction of the sentence this account of
you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian
could not have written that it is the german who is so
uncourteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover
what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and
prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if
i am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts

as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and
grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the
bell holmes whistled

a pair by the sound said he yes he continued glancing
out of the window a nice little brougham and a pair of
beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece there's money in
this case watson if there is nothing else

i think that i had better go holmes

not a bit doctor stay where you are i am lost without my
boswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity
to miss it

but your client 

never mind him i may want your help and so may he here he
comes sit down in that armchair doctor and give us your best
attention

a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and
in the passage paused immediately outside the door then there
was a loud and authoritative tap

come in said holmes

a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six
inches in height with the chest and limbs of a hercules his
dress was rich with a richness which would in england be looked
upon as akin to bad taste heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed
across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat while
the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined
with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch
which consisted of a single flaming beryl boots which extended
halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with
rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence
which was suggested by his whole appearance he carried a
broad-brimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper
part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black
vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment
for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from the lower
part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character
with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive
of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy

you had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a
strongly marked german accent i told you that i would call he
looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to
address

pray take a seat said holmes this is my friend and
colleague dr watson who is occasionally good enough to help me
in my cases whom have i the honour to address

you may address me as the count von kramm a bohemian nobleman
i understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour
and discretion whom i may trust with a matter of the most
extreme importance if not i should much prefer to communicate
with you alone

i rose to go but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me
back into my chair it is both or none said he you may say
before this gentleman anything which you may say to me

the count shrugged his broad shoulders then i must begin said
he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years at
the end of that time the matter will be of no importance at
present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it
may have an influence upon european history

i promise said holmes

and i

you will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor the
august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to
you and i may confess at once that the title by which i have
just called myself is not exactly my own

i was aware of it said holmes dryly

the circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution
has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense
scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of
europe to speak plainly the matter implicates the great house
of ormstein hereditary kings of bohemia

i was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself
down in his armchair and closing his eyes

our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid
lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him
as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe
holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his
gigantic client

if your majesty would condescend to state your case he
remarked i should be better able to advise you

the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
uncontrollable agitation then with a gesture of desperation he
tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground you
are right he cried i am the king why should i attempt to
conceal it

why indeed murmured holmes your majesty had not spoken
before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich
sigismond von ormstein grand duke of cassel-felstein and
hereditary king of bohemia

but you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down
once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you
can understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in
my own person yet the matter was so delicate that i could not
confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power i
have come incognito from prague for the purpose of consulting
you

then pray consult said holmes shutting his eyes once more

the facts are briefly these some five years ago during a
lengthy visit to warsaw i made the acquaintance of the well-known
adventuress irene adler the name is no doubt familiar to you

kindly look her up in my index doctor murmured holmes without
opening his eyes for many years he had adopted a system of
docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it
was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not
at once furnish information in this case i found her biography
sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a
staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea
fishes

let me see said holmes hum born in new jersey in the year
 contralto hum la scala hum prima donna imperial opera
of warsaw yes retired from operatic stage ha living in
london quite so your majesty as i understand became entangled
with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and
is now desirous of getting those letters back

precisely so but how 

was there a secret marriage

none

no legal papers or certificates

none

then i fail to follow your majesty if this young person should
produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is
she to prove their authenticity

there is the writing

pooh pooh forgery

my private note-paper

stolen

my own seal

imitated

my photograph

bought

we were both in the photograph

oh dear that is very bad your majesty has indeed committed an
indiscretion

i was mad insane

you have compromised yourself seriously

i was only crown prince then i was young i am but thirty now

it must be recovered

we have tried and failed

your majesty must pay it must be bought

she will not sell

stolen then

five attempts have been made twice burglars in my pay ransacked
her house once we diverted her luggage when she travelled twice
she has been waylaid there has been no result

no sign of it

absolutely none

holmes laughed it is quite a pretty little problem said he

but a very serious one to me returned the king reproachfully

very indeed and what does she propose to do with the
photograph

to ruin me

but how

i am about to be married

so i have heard

to clotilde lothman von saxe-meningen second daughter of the
king of scandinavia you may know the strict principles of her
family she is herself the very soul of delicacy a shadow of a
doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end

and irene adler

threatens to send them the photograph and she will do it i
know that she will do it you do not know her but she has a soul
of steel she has the face of the most beautiful of women and
the mind of the most resolute of men rather than i should marry
another woman there are no lengths to which she would not
go none

you are sure that she has not sent it yet

i am sure

and why

because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
betrothal was publicly proclaimed that will be next monday

oh then we have three days yet said holmes with a yawn that
is very fortunate as i have one or two matters of importance to
look into just at present your majesty will of course stay in
london for the present

certainly you will find me at the langham under the name of the
count von kramm

then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress

pray do so i shall be all anxiety

then as to money

you have carte blanche

absolutely

i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
to have that photograph

and for present expenses

the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
and laid it on the table

there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in
notes he said

holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and
handed it to him

and mademoiselle's address he asked

is briony lodge serpentine avenue st john's wood

holmes took a note of it one other question said he was the
photograph a cabinet

it was

then good-night your majesty and i trust that we shall soon
have some good news for you and good-night watson he added
as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street if
you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three
o'clock i should like to chat this little matter over with you


ii

at three o'clock precisely i was at baker street but holmes had
not yet returned the landlady informed me that he had left the
house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning i sat down
beside the fire however with the intention of awaiting him
however long he might be i was already deeply interested in his
inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and
strange features which were associated with the two crimes which
i have already recorded still the nature of the case and the
exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own
indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my
friend had on hand there was something in his masterly grasp of
a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a
pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the
quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most
inextricable mysteries so accustomed was i to his invariable
success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to
enter into my head

it was close upon four before the door opened and a
drunken-looking groom ill-kempt and side-whiskered with an
inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room
accustomed as i was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of
disguises i had to look three times before i was certain that it
was indeed he with a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he
emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable as of old
putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in
front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes

well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again
until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the
chair

what is it

it's quite too funny i am sure you could never guess how i
employed my morning or what i ended by doing

i can't imagine i suppose that you have been watching the
habits and perhaps the house of miss irene adler

quite so but the sequel was rather unusual i will tell you
however i left the house a little after eight o'clock this
morning in the character of a groom out of work there is a
wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men be one of
them and you will know all that there is to know i soon found
briony lodge it is a bijou villa with a garden at the back but
built out in front right up to the road two stories chubb lock
to the door large sitting-room on the right side well
furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those
preposterous english window fasteners which a child could open
behind there was nothing remarkable save that the passage window
could be reached from the top of the coach-house i walked round
it and examined it closely from every point of view but without
noting anything else of interest

i then lounged down the street and found as i expected that
there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the
garden i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses
and received in exchange twopence a glass of half and half two
fills of shag tobacco and as much information as i could desire
about miss adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in
the neighbourhood in whom i was not in the least interested but
whose biographies i was compelled to listen to

and what of irene adler i asked

oh she has turned all the men's heads down in that part she is
the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet so say the
serpentine-mews to a man she lives quietly sings at concerts
drives out at five every day and returns at seven sharp for
dinner seldom goes out at other times except when she sings
has only one male visitor but a good deal of him he is dark
handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and
often twice he is a mr godfrey norton of the inner temple see
the advantages of a cabman as a confidant they had driven him
home a dozen times from serpentine-mews and knew all about him
when i had listened to all they had to tell i began to walk up
and down near briony lodge once more and to think over my plan
of campaign

this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the
matter he was a lawyer that sounded ominous what was the
relation between them and what the object of his repeated
visits was she his client his friend or his mistress if the
former she had probably transferred the photograph to his
keeping if the latter it was less likely on the issue of this
question depended whether i should continue my work at briony
lodge or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the
temple it was a delicate point and it widened the field of my
inquiry i fear that i bore you with these details but i have to
let you see my little difficulties if you are to understand the
situation

i am following you closely i answered

i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab
drove up to briony lodge and a gentleman sprang out he was a
remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustached evidently
the man of whom i had heard he appeared to be in a
great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the
maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly
at home

he was in the house about half an hour and i could catch
glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room pacing up and
down talking excitedly and waving his arms of her i could see
nothing presently he emerged looking even more flurried than
before as he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from
his pocket and looked at it earnestly drive like the devil he
shouted first to gross hankey's in regent street and then to
the church of st monica in the edgeware road half a guinea if
you do it in twenty minutes

away they went and i was just wondering whether i should not do
well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau
the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned and his tie under
his ear while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of
the buckles it hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall
door and into it i only caught a glimpse of her at the moment
but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might die for

the church of st monica john she cried and half a
sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes

this was quite too good to lose watson i was just balancing
whether i should run for it or whether i should perch behind her
landau when a cab came through the street the driver looked
twice at such a shabby fare but i jumped in before he could
object the church of st monica said i and half a sovereign
if you reach it in twenty minutes it was twenty-five minutes to
twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind

my cabby drove fast i don't think i ever drove faster but the
others were there before us the cab and the landau with their
steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived i paid
the man and hurried into the church there was not a soul there
save the two whom i had followed and a surpliced clergyman who
seemed to be expostulating with them they were all three
standing in a knot in front of the altar i lounged up the side
aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church
suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to
me and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards
me

thank god he cried you'll do come come

what then i asked

come man come only three minutes or it won't be legal

i was half-dragged up to the altar and before i knew where i was
i found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear
and vouching for things of which i knew nothing and generally
assisting in the secure tying up of irene adler spinster to
godfrey norton bachelor it was all done in an instant and
there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady
on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front it was
the most preposterous position in which i ever found myself in my
life and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just
now it seems that there had been some informality about their
license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them
without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance
saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in
search of a best man the bride gave me a sovereign and i mean
to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion

this is a very unexpected turn of affairs said i and what
then

well i found my plans very seriously menaced it looked as if
the pair might take an immediate departure and so necessitate
very prompt and energetic measures on my part at the church
door however they separated he driving back to the temple and
she to her own house i shall drive out in the park at five as
usual she said as she left him i heard no more they drove
away in different directions and i went off to make my own
arrangements

which are

some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the
bell i have been too busy to think of food and i am likely to
be busier still this evening by the way doctor i shall want
your co-operation

i shall be delighted

you don't mind breaking the law

not in the least

nor running a chance of arrest

not in a good cause

oh the cause is excellent

then i am your man

i was sure that i might rely on you

but what is it you wish

when mrs turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to
you now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that
our landlady had provided i must discuss it while i eat for i
have not much time it is nearly five now in two hours we must
be on the scene of action miss irene or madame rather returns
from her drive at seven we must be at briony lodge to meet her

and what then

you must leave that to me i have already arranged what is to
occur there is only one point on which i must insist you must
not interfere come what may you understand

i am to be neutral

to do nothing whatever there will probably be some small
unpleasantness do not join in it it will end in my being
conveyed into the house four or five minutes afterwards the
sitting-room window will open you are to station yourself close
to that open window

yes

you are to watch me for i will be visible to you

yes

and when i raise my hand so you will throw into the room what
i give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of
fire you quite follow me

entirely

it is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigar-shaped
roll from his pocket it is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket
fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting
your task is confined to that when you raise your cry of fire
it will be taken up by quite a number of people you may then
walk to the end of the street and i will rejoin you in ten
minutes i hope that i have made myself clear

i am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you
and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry
of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street

precisely

then you may entirely rely on me

that is excellent i think perhaps it is almost time that i
prepare for the new role i have to play

he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in
the character of an amiable and simple-minded nonconformist
clergyman his broad black hat his baggy trousers his white
tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and
benevolent curiosity were such as mr john hare alone could have
equalled it was not merely that holmes changed his costume his
expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every
fresh part that he assumed the stage lost a fine actor even as
science lost an acute reasoner when he became a specialist in
crime

it was a quarter past six when we left baker street and it still
wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in
serpentine avenue it was already dusk and the lamps were just
being lighted as we paced up and down in front of briony lodge
waiting for the coming of its occupant the house was just such
as i had pictured it from sherlock holmes succinct description
but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected on
the contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was
remarkably animated there was a group of shabbily dressed men
smoking and laughing in a corner a scissors-grinder with his
wheel two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl and
several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with
cigars in their mouths

you see remarked holmes as we paced to and fro in front of
the house this marriage rather simplifies matters the
photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now the chances are
that she would be as averse to its being seen by mr godfrey
norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his
princess now the question is where are we to find the
photograph

where indeed

it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her it is
cabinet size too large for easy concealment about a woman's
dress she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid
and searched two attempts of the sort have already been made we
may take it then that she does not carry it about with her

where then

her banker or her lawyer there is that double possibility but
i am inclined to think neither women are naturally secretive
and they like to do their own secreting why should she hand it
over to anyone else she could trust her own guardianship but
she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be
brought to bear upon a business man besides remember that she
had resolved to use it within a few days it must be where she
can lay her hands upon it it must be in her own house

but it has twice been burgled

pshaw they did not know how to look

but how will you look

i will not look

what then

i will get her to show me

but she will refuse

she will not be able to but i hear the rumble of wheels it is
her carriage now carry out my orders to the letter

as he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round
the curve of the avenue it was a smart little landau which
rattled up to the door of briony lodge as it pulled up one of
the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in
the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another
loafer who had rushed up with the same intention a fierce
quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who
took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissors-grinder
who was equally hot upon the other side a blow was struck and
in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was
the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who
struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks holmes
dashed into the crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached
her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood
running freely down his face at his fall the guardsmen took to
their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other while
a number of better-dressed people who had watched the scuffle
without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to
attend to the injured man irene adler as i will still call her
had hurried up the steps but she stood at the top with her
superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking
back into the street

is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked

he is dead cried several voices

no no there's life in him shouted another but he'll be
gone before you can get him to hospital

he's a brave fellow said a woman they would have had the
lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him they were a
gang and a rough one too ah he's breathing now

he can't lie in the street may we bring him in marm

surely bring him into the sitting-room there is a comfortable
sofa this way please

slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out
in the principal room while i still observed the proceedings
from my post by the window the lamps had been lit but the
blinds had not been drawn so that i could see holmes as he lay
upon the couch i do not know whether he was seized with
compunction at that moment for the part he was playing but i
know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life
than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i was
conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she waited
upon the injured man and yet it would be the blackest treachery
to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted
to me i hardened my heart and took the smoke-rocket from under
my ulster after all i thought we are not injuring her we are
but preventing her from injuring another

holmes had sat up upon the couch and i saw him motion like a man
who is in need of air a maid rushed across and threw open the
window at the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the
signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of fire the
word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of
spectators well dressed and ill gentlemen ostlers and
servant-maids joined in a general shriek of fire thick clouds
of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window i
caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice
of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm
slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner
of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my
friend's arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar
he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we
had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the
edgeware road

you did it very nicely doctor he remarked nothing could
have been better it is all right

you have the photograph

i know where it is

and how did you find out

she showed me as i told you she would

i am still in the dark

i do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing the matter
was perfectly simple you of course saw that everyone in the
street was an accomplice they were all engaged for the evening

i guessed as much

then when the row broke out i had a little moist red paint in
the palm of my hand i rushed forward fell down clapped my hand
to my face and became a piteous spectacle it is an old trick

that also i could fathom

then they carried me in she was bound to have me in what else
could she do and into her sitting-room which was the very room
which i suspected it lay between that and her bedroom and i was
determined to see which they laid me on a couch i motioned for
air they were compelled to open the window and you had your
chance

how did that help you

it was all-important when a woman thinks that her house is on
fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she
values most it is a perfectly overpowering impulse and i have
more than once taken advantage of it in the case of the
darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me and also in
the arnsworth castle business a married woman grabs at her baby
an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box now it was clear to
me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious
to her than what we are in quest of she would rush to secure it
the alarm of fire was admirably done the smoke and shouting were
enough to shake nerves of steel she responded beautifully the
photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the
right bell-pull she was there in an instant and i caught a
glimpse of it as she half-drew it out when i cried out that it
was a false alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed
from the room and i have not seen her since i rose and making
my excuses escaped from the house i hesitated whether to
attempt to secure the photograph at once but the coachman had
come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to
wait a little over-precipitance may ruin all

and now i asked

our quest is practically finished i shall call with the king
to-morrow and with you if you care to come with us we will be
shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady but it is
probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the
photograph it might be a satisfaction to his majesty to regain
it with his own hands

and when will you call

at eight in the morning she will not be up so that we shall
have a clear field besides we must be prompt for this marriage
may mean a complete change in her life and habits i must wire to
the king without delay

we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door he was
searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said

good-night mister sherlock holmes

there were several people on the pavement at the time but the
greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had
hurried by

i've heard that voice before said holmes staring down the
dimly lit street now i wonder who the deuce that could have
been


iii

i slept at baker street that night and we were engaged upon our
toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed
into the room

you have really got it he cried grasping sherlock holmes by
either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face

not yet

but you have hopes

i have hopes

then come i am all impatience to be gone

we must have a cab

no my brougham is waiting

then that will simplify matters we descended and started off
once more for briony lodge

irene adler is married remarked holmes

married when

yesterday

but to whom

to an english lawyer named norton

but she could not love him

i am in hopes that she does

and why in hopes

because it would spare your majesty all fear of future
annoyance if the lady loves her husband she does not love your
majesty if she does not love your majesty there is no reason
why she should interfere with your majesty's plan

it is true and yet well i wish she had been of my own
station what a queen she would have made he relapsed into a
moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in
serpentine avenue

the door of briony lodge was open and an elderly woman stood
upon the steps she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped
from the brougham

mr sherlock holmes i believe said she

i am mr holmes answered my companion looking at her with a
questioning and rather startled gaze

indeed my mistress told me that you were likely to call she
left this morning with her husband by the train from charing
cross for the continent

what sherlock holmes staggered back white with chagrin and
surprise do you mean that she has left england

never to return

and the papers asked the king hoarsely all is lost

we shall see he pushed past the servant and rushed into the
drawing-room followed by the king and myself the furniture was
scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and
open drawers as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before
her flight holmes rushed at the bell-pull tore back a small
sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a
photograph and a letter the photograph was of irene adler
herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to
sherlock holmes esq to be left till called for my friend
tore it open and we all three read it together it was dated at
midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way

my dear mr sherlock holmes you really did it very well you
took me in completely until after the alarm of fire i had not a
suspicion but then when i found how i had betrayed myself i
began to think i had been warned against you months ago i had
been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly
be you and your address had been given me yet with all this
you made me reveal what you wanted to know even after i became
suspicious i found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind
old clergyman but you know i have been trained as an actress
myself male costume is nothing new to me i often take advantage
of the freedom which it gives i sent john the coachman to
watch you ran up stairs got into my walking-clothes as i call
them and came down just as you departed

well i followed you to your door and so made sure that i was
really an object of interest to the celebrated mr sherlock
holmes then i rather imprudently wished you good-night and
started for the temple to see my husband

we both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by
so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when
you call to-morrow as to the photograph your client may rest in
peace i love and am loved by a better man than he the king may
do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
wronged i keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a
weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
take in the future i leave a photograph which he might care to
possess and i remain dear mr sherlock holmes

 very truly yours
 irene norton née adler

what a woman oh what a woman cried the king of bohemia when
we had all three read this epistle did i not tell you how quick
and resolute she was would she not have made an admirable queen
is it not a pity that she was not on my level

from what i have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a
very different level to your majesty said holmes coldly i am
sorry that i have not been able to bring your majesty's business
to a more successful conclusion

on the contrary my dear sir cried the king nothing could be
more successful i know that her word is inviolate the
photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire

i am glad to hear your majesty say so

i am immensely indebted to you pray tell me in what way i can
reward you this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from
his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand

your majesty has something which i should value even more
highly said holmes

you have but to name it

this photograph

the king stared at him in amazement

irene's photograph he cried certainly if you wish it

i thank your majesty then there is no more to be done in the
matter i have the honour to wish you a very good-morning he
bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the
king had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his
chambers

and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom
of bohemia and how the best plans of mr sherlock holmes were
beaten by a woman's wit he used to make merry over the
cleverness of women but i have not heard him do it of late and
when he speaks of irene adler or when he refers to her
photograph it is always under the honourable title of the woman



adventure ii the red-headed league

i had called upon my friend mr sherlock holmes one day in the
autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a
very stout florid-faced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair
with an apology for my intrusion i was about to withdraw when
holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door
behind me

you could not possibly have come at a better time my dear
watson he said cordially

i was afraid that you were engaged

so i am very much so

then i can wait in the next room

not at all this gentleman mr wilson has been my partner and
helper in many of my most successful cases and i have no
doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also

the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
greeting with a quick little questioning glance from his small
fat-encircled eyes

try the settee said holmes relapsing into his armchair and
putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in
judicial moods i know my dear watson that you share my love
of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum
routine of everyday life you have shown your relish for it by
the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you
will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish so many of my own
little adventures

your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me i
observed

you will remember that i remarked the other day just before we
went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary
sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary
combinations we must go to life itself which is always far more
daring than any effort of the imagination

a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting

you did doctor but none the less you must come round to my
view for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you
until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to
be right now mr jabez wilson here has been good enough to call
upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to
be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some
time you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique
things are very often connected not with the larger but with the
smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for
doubt whether any positive crime has been committed as far as i
have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present
case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is
certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to
perhaps mr wilson you would have the great kindness to
recommence your narrative i ask you not merely because my friend
dr watson has not heard the opening part but also because the
peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every
possible detail from your lips as a rule when i have heard some
slight indication of the course of events i am able to guide
myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my
memory in the present instance i am forced to admit that the
facts are to the best of my belief unique

the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the
inside pocket of his greatcoat as he glanced down the
advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper
flattened out upon his knee i took a good look at the man and
endeavoured after the fashion of my companion to read the
indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance

i did not gain very much however by my inspection our visitor
bore every mark of being an average commonplace british
tradesman obese pompous and slow he wore rather baggy grey
shepherd's check trousers a not over-clean black frock-coat
unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy
albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as
an ornament a frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a
wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him altogether
look as i would there was nothing remarkable about the man save
his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and
discontent upon his features

sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook
his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances
beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual
labour that he takes snuff that he is a freemason that he has
been in china and that he has done a considerable amount of
writing lately i can deduce nothing else

mr jabez wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger
upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion

how in the name of good-fortune did you know all that mr
holmes he asked how did you know for example that i did
manual labour it's as true as gospel for i began as a ship's
carpenter

your hands my dear sir your right hand is quite a size larger
than your left you have worked with it and the muscles are more
developed

well the snuff then and the freemasonry

i won't insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that
especially as rather against the strict rules of your order you
use an arc-and-compass breastpin

ah of course i forgot that but the writing

what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for
five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the
elbow where you rest it upon the desk

well but china

the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right
wrist could only have been done in china i have made a small
study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature
of the subject that trick of staining the fishes scales of a
delicate pink is quite peculiar to china when in addition i
see a chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain the matter
becomes even more simple

mr jabez wilson laughed heavily well i never said he i
thought at first that you had done something clever but i see
that there was nothing in it after all

i begin to think watson said holmes that i make a mistake
in explaining omne ignotum pro magnifico you know and my
poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if i
am so candid can you not find the advertisement mr wilson

yes i have got it now he answered with his thick red finger
planted halfway down the column here it is this is what began
it all you just read it for yourself sir

i took the paper from him and read as follows

to the red-headed league on account of the bequest of the late
ezekiah hopkins of lebanon pennsylvania u s a there is now
another vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a
salary of pounds a week for purely nominal services all
red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age
of twenty-one years are eligible apply in person on monday at
eleven o'clock to duncan ross at the offices of the league 
pope's court fleet street

what on earth does this mean i ejaculated after i had twice
read over the extraordinary announcement

holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when
in high spirits it is a little off the beaten track isn't it
said he and now mr wilson off you go at scratch and tell us
all about yourself your household and the effect which this
advertisement had upon your fortunes you will first make a note
doctor of the paper and the date

it is the morning chronicle of april just two months
ago

very good now mr wilson

well it is just as i have been telling you mr sherlock
holmes said jabez wilson mopping his forehead i have a small
pawnbroker's business at coburg square near the city it's not a
very large affair and of late years it has not done more than
just give me a living i used to be able to keep two assistants
but now i only keep one and i would have a job to pay him but
that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the
business

what is the name of this obliging youth asked sherlock holmes

his name is vincent spaulding and he's not such a youth
either it's hard to say his age i should not wish a smarter
assistant mr holmes and i know very well that he could better
himself and earn twice what i am able to give him but after
all if he is satisfied why should i put ideas in his head

why indeed you seem most fortunate in having an employé who
comes under the full market price it is not a common experience
among employers in this age i don't know that your assistant is
not as remarkable as your advertisement

oh he has his faults too said mr wilson never was such a
fellow for photography snapping away with a camera when he ought
to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar
like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures that is his
main fault but on the whole he's a good worker there's no vice
in him

he is still with you i presume

yes sir he and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple
cooking and keeps the place clean that's all i have in the
house for i am a widower and never had any family we live very
quietly sir the three of us and we keep a roof over our heads
and pay our debts if we do nothing more

the first thing that put us out was that advertisement
spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight
weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says

i wish to the lord mr wilson that i was a red-headed man

why that i asks

why says he here's another vacancy on the league of the
red-headed men it's worth quite a little fortune to any man who
gets it and i understand that there are more vacancies than
there are men so that the trustees are at their wits end what
to do with the money if my hair would only change colour here's
a nice little crib all ready for me to step into

why what is it then i asked you see mr holmes i am a
very stay-at-home man and as my business came to me instead of
my having to go to it i was often weeks on end without putting
my foot over the door-mat in that way i didn't know much of what
was going on outside and i was always glad of a bit of news

have you never heard of the league of the red-headed men he
asked with his eyes open

never

why i wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one
of the vacancies

and what are they worth i asked

oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight
and it need not interfere very much with one's other
occupations

well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears
for the business has not been over-good for some years and an
extra couple of hundred would have been very handy

tell me all about it said i

well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for
yourself that the league has a vacancy and there is the address
where you should apply for particulars as far as i can make out
the league was founded by an american millionaire ezekiah
hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways he was himself
red-headed and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men
so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous
fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the
interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of
that colour from all i hear it is splendid pay and very little to
do

but said i there would be millions of red-headed men who
would apply

not so many as you might think he answered you see it is
really confined to londoners and to grown men this american had
started from london when he was young and he wanted to do the
old town a good turn then again i have heard it is no use your
applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but
real bright blazing fiery red now if you cared to apply mr
wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would hardly be
worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a
few hundred pounds

now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves
that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that it seemed
to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter i
stood as good a chance as any man that i had ever met vincent
spaulding seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might
prove useful so i just ordered him to put up the shutters for
the day and to come right away with me he was very willing to
have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for
the address that was given us in the advertisement

i never hope to see such a sight as that again mr holmes from
north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in
his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement
fleet street was choked with red-headed folk and pope's court
looked like a coster's orange barrow i should not have thought
there were so many in the whole country as were brought together
by that single advertisement every shade of colour they
were straw lemon orange brick irish-setter liver clay
but as spaulding said there were not many who had the real
vivid flame-coloured tint when i saw how many were waiting i
would have given it up in despair but spaulding would not hear
of it how he did it i could not imagine but he pushed and
pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up
to the steps which led to the office there was a double stream
upon the stair some going up in hope and some coming back
dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found
ourselves in the office

your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked
holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge
pinch of snuff pray continue your very interesting statement

there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs
and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that
was even redder than mine he said a few words to each candidate
as he came up and then he always managed to find some fault in
them which would disqualify them getting a vacancy did not seem
to be such a very easy matter after all however when our turn
came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of
the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he
might have a private word with us

this is mr jabez wilson said my assistant and he is
willing to fill a vacancy in the league

and he is admirably suited for it the other answered he has
every requirement i cannot recall when i have seen anything so
fine he took a step backward cocked his head on one side and
gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful then suddenly he
plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my
success

it would be injustice to hesitate said he you will
however i am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution
with that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until i
yelled with the pain there is water in your eyes said he as
he released me i perceive that all is as it should be but we
have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and
once by paint i could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which
would disgust you with human nature he stepped over to the
window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the
vacancy was filled a groan of disappointment came up from below
and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there
was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the
manager

my name said he is mr duncan ross and i am myself one of
the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor are
you a married man mr wilson have you a family

i answered that i had not

his face fell immediately

dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed i am
sorry to hear you say that the fund was of course for the
propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their
maintenance it is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a
bachelor

my face lengthened at this mr holmes for i thought that i was
not to have the vacancy after all but after thinking it over for
a few minutes he said that it would be all right

in the case of another said he the objection might be
fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a
head of hair as yours when shall you be able to enter upon your
new duties

well it is a little awkward for i have a business already
said i

oh never mind about that mr wilson said vincent spaulding
i should be able to look after that for you

what would be the hours i asked

ten to two

now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening mr
holmes especially thursday and friday evening which is just
before pay-day so it would suit me very well to earn a little in
the mornings besides i knew that my assistant was a good man
and that he would see to anything that turned up

that would suit me very well said i and the pay

is pounds a week

and the work

is purely nominal

what do you call purely nominal

well you have to be in the office or at least in the
building the whole time if you leave you forfeit your whole
position forever the will is very clear upon that point you
don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office
during that time

it's only four hours a day and i should not think of leaving
said i

no excuse will avail said mr duncan ross neither sickness
nor business nor anything else there you must stay or you lose
your billet

and the work

is to copy out the encyclopaedia britannica there is the first
volume of it in that press you must find your own ink pens and
blotting-paper but we provide this table and chair will you be
ready to-morrow

certainly i answered

then good-bye mr jabez wilson and let me congratulate you
once more on the important position which you have been fortunate
enough to gain he bowed me out of the room and i went home with
my assistant hardly knowing what to say or do i was so pleased
at my own good fortune

well i thought over the matter all day and by evening i was in
low spirits again for i had quite persuaded myself that the
whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its
object might be i could not imagine it seemed altogether past
belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay
such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the
encyclopaedia britannica vincent spaulding did what he could to
cheer me up but by bedtime i had reasoned myself out of the
whole thing however in the morning i determined to have a look
at it anyhow so i bought a penny bottle of ink and with a
quill-pen and seven sheets of foolscap paper i started off for
pope's court

well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as
possible the table was set out ready for me and mr duncan ross
was there to see that i got fairly to work he started me off
upon the letter a and then he left me but he would drop in from
time to time to see that all was right with me at two o'clock he
bade me good-day complimented me upon the amount that i had
written and locked the door of the office after me

this went on day after day mr holmes and on saturday the
manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my
week's work it was the same next week and the same the week
after every morning i was there at ten and every afternoon i
left at two by degrees mr duncan ross took to coming in only
once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at
all still of course i never dared to leave the room for an
instant for i was not sure when he might come and the billet
was such a good one and suited me so well that i would not risk
the loss of it

eight weeks passed away like this and i had written about
abbots and archery and armour and architecture and attica and
hoped with diligence that i might get on to the b's before very
long it cost me something in foolscap and i had pretty nearly
filled a shelf with my writings and then suddenly the whole
business came to an end

to an end

yes sir and no later than this morning i went to my work as
usual at ten o'clock but the door was shut and locked with a
little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the
panel with a tack here it is and you can read for yourself

he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet
of note-paper it read in this fashion

 the red-headed league

 is

 dissolved

 october 

sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the
rueful face behind it until the comical side of the affair so
completely overtopped every other consideration that we both
burst out into a roar of laughter

i cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our
client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head if you can
do nothing better than laugh at me i can go elsewhere

no no cried holmes shoving him back into the chair from
which he had half risen i really wouldn't miss your case for
the world it is most refreshingly unusual but there is if you
will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it
pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the
door

i was staggered sir i did not know what to do then i called
at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything
about it finally i went to the landlord who is an accountant
living on the ground-floor and i asked him if he could tell me
what had become of the red-headed league he said that he had
never heard of any such body then i asked him who mr duncan
ross was he answered that the name was new to him

well said i the gentleman at no 

what the red-headed man

yes

oh said he his name was william morris he was a solicitor
and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new
premises were ready he moved out yesterday

where could i find him

oh at his new offices he did tell me the address yes 
king edward street near st paul's

i started off mr holmes but when i got to that address it was
a manufactory of artificial knee-caps and no one in it had ever
heard of either mr william morris or mr duncan ross

and what did you do then asked holmes

i went home to saxe-coburg square and i took the advice of my
assistant but he could not help me in any way he could only say
that if i waited i should hear by post but that was not quite
good enough mr holmes i did not wish to lose such a place
without a struggle so as i had heard that you were good enough
to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it i came right
away to you

and you did very wisely said holmes your case is an
exceedingly remarkable one and i shall be happy to look into it
from what you have told me i think that it is possible that
graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear

grave enough said mr jabez wilson why i have lost four
pound a week

as far as you are personally concerned remarked holmes i do
not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary
league on the contrary you are as i understand richer by some
 pounds to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have
gained on every subject which comes under the letter a you have
lost nothing by them

no sir but i want to find out about them and who they are
and what their object was in playing this prank if it was a
prank upon me it was a pretty expensive joke for them for it
cost them two and thirty pounds

we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you and first
one or two questions mr wilson this assistant of yours who
first called your attention to the advertisement how long had he
been with you

about a month then

how did he come

in answer to an advertisement

was he the only applicant

no i had a dozen

why did you pick him

because he was handy and would come cheap

at half-wages in fact

yes

what is he like this vincent spaulding

small stout-built very quick in his ways no hair on his face
though he's not short of thirty has a white splash of acid upon
his forehead

holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement i thought
as much said he have you ever observed that his ears are
pierced for earrings

yes sir he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he
was a lad

hum said holmes sinking back in deep thought he is still
with you

oh yes sir i have only just left him

and has your business been attended to in your absence

nothing to complain of sir there's never very much to do of a
morning

that will do mr wilson i shall be happy to give you an
opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two to-day is
saturday and i hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion

well watson said holmes when our visitor had left us what
do you make of it all

i make nothing of it i answered frankly it is a most
mysterious business

as a rule said holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less
mysterious it proves to be it is your commonplace featureless
crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is
the most difficult to identify but i must be prompt over this
matter

what are you going to do then i asked

to smoke he answered it is quite a three pipe problem and i
beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes he curled
himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his
hawk-like nose and there he sat with his eyes closed and his
black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird
i had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and
indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his
chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put
his pipe down upon the mantelpiece

sarasate plays at the st james's hall this afternoon he
remarked what do you think watson could your patients spare
you for a few hours

i have nothing to do to-day my practice is never very
absorbing

then put on your hat and come i am going through the city
first and we can have some lunch on the way i observe that
there is a good deal of german music on the programme which is
rather more to my taste than italian or french it is
introspective and i want to introspect come along

we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate and a short
walk took us to saxe-coburg square the scene of the singular
story which we had listened to in the morning it was a poky
little shabby-genteel place where four lines of dingy
two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in
enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded
laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and
uncongenial atmosphere three gilt balls and a brown board with
jabez wilson in white letters upon a corner house announced
the place where our red-headed client carried on his business
sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between
puckered lids then he walked slowly up the street and then down
again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses finally
he returned to the pawnbroker's and having thumped vigorously
upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up
to the door and knocked it was instantly opened by a
bright-looking clean-shaven young fellow who asked him to step
in

thank you said holmes i only wished to ask you how you would
go from here to the strand

third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly
closing the door

smart fellow that observed holmes as we walked away he is
in my judgment the fourth smartest man in london and for daring
i am not sure that he has not a claim to be third i have known
something of him before

evidently said i mr wilson's assistant counts for a good
deal in this mystery of the red-headed league i am sure that you
inquired your way merely in order that you might see him

not him

what then

the knees of his trousers

and what did you see

what i expected to see

why did you beat the pavement

my dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk we
are spies in an enemy's country we know something of saxe-coburg
square let us now explore the parts which lie behind it

the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the
corner from the retired saxe-coburg square presented as great a
contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back it was
one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city
to the north and west the roadway was blocked with the immense
stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward
while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of
pedestrians it was difficult to realise as we looked at the line
of fine shops and stately business premises that they really
abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
which we had just quitted

let me see said holmes standing at the corner and glancing
along the line i should like just to remember the order of the
houses here it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of
london there is mortimer's the tobacconist the little
newspaper shop the coburg branch of the city and suburban bank
the vegetarian restaurant and mcfarlane's carriage-building
depot that carries us right on to the other block and now
doctor we've done our work so it's time we had some play a
sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violin-land where
all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no
red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums

my friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a
very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit all
the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect
happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the
music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes
were as unlike those of holmes the sleuth-hound holmes the
relentless keen-witted ready-handed criminal agent as it was
possible to conceive in his singular character the dual nature
alternately asserted itself and his extreme exactness and
astuteness represented as i have often thought the reaction
against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally
predominated in him the swing of his nature took him from
extreme languor to devouring energy and as i knew well he was
never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been
lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his
black-letter editions then it was that the lust of the chase
would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning
power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were
unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a
man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals when i saw him
that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st james's hall i
felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set
himself to hunt down

you want to go home no doubt doctor he remarked as we
emerged

yes it would be as well

and i have some business to do which will take some hours this
business at coburg square is serious

why serious

a considerable crime is in contemplation i have every reason to
believe that we shall be in time to stop it but to-day being
saturday rather complicates matters i shall want your help
to-night

at what time

ten will be early enough

i shall be at baker street at ten

very well and i say doctor there may be some little danger
so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket he waved his
hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the
crowd

i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours but i was
always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings
with sherlock holmes here i had heard what he had heard i had
seen what he had seen and yet from his words it was evident that
he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to
happen while to me the whole business was still confused and
grotesque as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought
over it all from the extraordinary story of the red-headed
copier of the encyclopaedia down to the visit to saxe-coburg
square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me
what was this nocturnal expedition and why should i go armed
where were we going and what were we to do i had the hint from
holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a
formidable man a man who might play a deep game i tried to
puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside
until night should bring an explanation

it was a quarter-past nine when i started from home and made my
way across the park and so through oxford street to baker
street two hansoms were standing at the door and as i entered
the passage i heard the sound of voices from above on entering
his room i found holmes in animated conversation with two men
one of whom i recognised as peter jones the official police
agent while the other was a long thin sad-faced man with a
very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat

ha our party is complete said holmes buttoning up his
pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack
watson i think you know mr jones of scotland yard let me
introduce you to mr merryweather who is to be our companion in
to-night's adventure

we're hunting in couples again doctor you see said jones in
his consequential way our friend here is a wonderful man for
starting a chase all he wants is an old dog to help him to do
the running down

i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase
observed mr merryweather gloomily

you may place considerable confidence in mr holmes sir said
the police agent loftily he has his own little methods which
are if he won't mind my saying so just a little too theoretical
and fantastic but he has the makings of a detective in him it
is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of
the sholto murder and the agra treasure he has been more nearly
correct than the official force

oh if you say so mr jones it is all right said the
stranger with deference still i confess that i miss my rubber
it is the first saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that i
have not had my rubber

i think you will find said sherlock holmes that you will
play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet and
that the play will be more exciting for you mr merryweather
the stake will be some pounds and for you jones it will
be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands

john clay the murderer thief smasher and forger he's a
young man mr merryweather but he is at the head of his
profession and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on
any criminal in london he's a remarkable man is young john
clay his grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been
to eton and oxford his brain is as cunning as his fingers and
though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to
find the man himself he'll crack a crib in scotland one week
and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next
i've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him
yet

i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night
i've had one or two little turns also with mr john clay and i
agree with you that he is at the head of his profession it is
past ten however and quite time that we started if you two
will take the first hansom watson and i will follow in the
second

sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in
the afternoon we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit
streets until we emerged into farrington street

we are close there now my friend remarked this fellow
merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the
matter i thought it as well to have jones with us also he is
not a bad fellow though an absolute imbecile in his profession
he has one positive virtue he is as brave as a bulldog and as
tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone here we
are and they are waiting for us

we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had
found ourselves in the morning our cabs were dismissed and
following the guidance of mr merryweather we passed down a
narrow passage and through a side door which he opened for us
within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive
iron gate this also was opened and led down a flight of winding
stone steps which terminated at another formidable gate mr
merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us
down a dark earth-smelling passage and so after opening a
third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all
round with crates and massive boxes

you are not very vulnerable from above holmes remarked as he
held up the lantern and gazed about him

nor from below said mr merryweather striking his stick upon
the flags which lined the floor why dear me it sounds quite
hollow he remarked looking up in surprise

i must really ask you to be a little more quiet said holmes
severely you have already imperilled the whole success of our
expedition might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit
down upon one of those boxes and not to interfere

the solemn mr merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a
very injured expression upon his face while holmes fell upon his
knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens
began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones a few
seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again
and put his glass in his pocket

we have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can
hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed
then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their
work the longer time they will have for their escape we are at
present doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of
the city branch of one of the principal london banks mr
merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will explain to
you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of
london should take a considerable interest in this cellar at
present

it is our french gold whispered the director we have had
several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it

your french gold

yes we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources
and borrowed for that purpose napoleons from the bank of
france it has become known that we have never had occasion to
unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar the
crate upon which i sit contains napoleons packed between
layers of lead foil our reserve of bullion is much larger at
present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the
directors have had misgivings upon the subject

which were very well justified observed holmes and now it is
time that we arranged our little plans i expect that within an
hour matters will come to a head in the meantime mr
merryweather we must put the screen over that dark lantern

and sit in the dark

i am afraid so i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and
i thought that as we were a partie carrée you might have your
rubber after all but i see that the enemy's preparations have
gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light and
first of all we must choose our positions these are daring men
and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us
some harm unless we are careful i shall stand behind this crate
and do you conceal yourselves behind those then when i flash a
light upon them close in swiftly if they fire watson have no
compunction about shooting them down

i placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case
behind which i crouched holmes shot the slide across the front
of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness such an absolute
darkness as i have never before experienced the smell of hot
metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready
to flash out at a moment's notice to me with my nerves worked
up to a pitch of expectancy there was something depressing and
subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the
vault

they have but one retreat whispered holmes that is back
through the house into saxe-coburg square i hope that you have
done what i asked you jones

i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door

then we have stopped all the holes and now we must be silent
and wait

what a time it seemed from comparing notes afterwards it was but
an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must
have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us my limbs
were weary and stiff for i feared to change my position yet my
nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my
hearing was so acute that i could not only hear the gentle
breathing of my companions but i could distinguish the deeper
heavier in-breath of the bulky jones from the thin sighing note
of the bank director from my position i could look over the case
in the direction of the floor suddenly my eyes caught the glint
of a light

at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement then
it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then
without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand
appeared a white almost womanly hand which felt about in the
centre of the little area of light for a minute or more the
hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor then
it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark
again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between
the stones

its disappearance however was but momentary with a rending
tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon
its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed
the light of a lantern over the edge there peeped a clean-cut
boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand
on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulder-high and
waist-high until one knee rested upon the edge in another
instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after
him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face
and a shock of very red hair

it's all clear he whispered have you the chisel and the
bags great scott jump archie jump and i'll swing for it

sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the
collar the other dived down the hole and i heard the sound of
rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts the light flashed
upon the barrel of a revolver but holmes hunting crop came
down on the man's wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone
floor

it's no use john clay said holmes blandly you have no
chance at all

so i see the other answered with the utmost coolness i fancy
that my pal is all right though i see you have got his
coat-tails

there are three men waiting for him at the door said holmes

oh indeed you seem to have done the thing very completely i
must compliment you

and i you holmes answered your red-headed idea was very new
and effective

you'll see your pal again presently said jones he's quicker
at climbing down holes than i am just hold out while i fix the
derbies

i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands
remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists
you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my veins have
the goodness also when you address me always to say sir and
please

all right said jones with a stare and a snigger well would
you please sir march upstairs where we can get a cab to carry
your highness to the police-station

that is better said john clay serenely he made a sweeping bow
to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the
detective

really mr holmes said mr merryweather as we followed them
from the cellar i do not know how the bank can thank you or
repay you there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated
in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts
at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience

i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr
john clay said holmes i have been at some small expense over
this matter which i shall expect the bank to refund but beyond
that i am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in
many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of
the red-headed league


you see watson he explained in the early hours of the morning
as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street it
was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible
object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of
the league and the copying of the encyclopaedia must be to get
this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of
hours every day it was a curious way of managing it but
really it would be difficult to suggest a better the method was
no doubt suggested to clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his
accomplice's hair the pounds a week was a lure which must draw
him and what was it to them who were playing for thousands
they put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary
office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and
together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the
week from the time that i heard of the assistant having come for
half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive
for securing the situation

but how could you guess what the motive was

had there been women in the house i should have suspected a
mere vulgar intrigue that however was out of the question the
man's business was a small one and there was nothing in his
house which could account for such elaborate preparations and
such an expenditure as they were at it must then be something
out of the house what could it be i thought of the assistant's
fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the
cellar the cellar there was the end of this tangled clue then
i made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that i
had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in
london he was doing something in the cellar something which
took many hours a day for months on end what could it be once
more i could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel
to some other building

so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action i
surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick i was
ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind
it was not in front then i rang the bell and as i hoped the
assistant answered it we have had some skirmishes but we had
never set eyes upon each other before i hardly looked at his
face his knees were what i wished to see you must yourself have
remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were they spoke of
those hours of burrowing the only remaining point was what they
were burrowing for i walked round the corner saw the city and
suburban bank abutted on our friend's premises and felt that i
had solved my problem when you drove home after the concert i
called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank
directors with the result that you have seen

and how could you tell that they would make their attempt
to-night i asked

well when they closed their league offices that was a sign that
they cared no longer about mr jabez wilson's presence in other
words that they had completed their tunnel but it was essential
that they should use it soon as it might be discovered or the
bullion might be removed saturday would suit them better than
any other day as it would give them two days for their escape
for all these reasons i expected them to come to-night

you reasoned it out beautifully i exclaimed in unfeigned
admiration it is so long a chain and yet every link rings
true

it saved me from ennui he answered yawning alas i already
feel it closing in upon me my life is spent in one long effort
to escape from the commonplaces of existence these little
problems help me to do so

and you are a benefactor of the race said i

he shrugged his shoulders well perhaps after all it is of
some little use he remarked l'homme c'est rien l'oeuvre
c'est tout as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand



adventure iii a case of identity

my dear fellow said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side
of the fire in his lodgings at baker street life is infinitely
stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we
would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere
commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window
hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the
roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the
strange coincidences the plannings the cross-purposes the
wonderful chains of events working through generations and
leading to the most outré results it would make all fiction with
its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and
unprofitable

and yet i am not convinced of it i answered the cases which
come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and
vulgar enough we have in our police reports realism pushed to
its extreme limits and yet the result is it must be confessed
neither fascinating nor artistic

a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
realistic effect remarked holmes this is wanting in the
police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the
platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an
observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter depend
upon it there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace

i smiled and shook my head i can quite understand your thinking
so i said of course in your position of unofficial adviser
and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout
three continents you are brought in contact with all that is
strange and bizarre but here i picked up the morning paper
from the ground let us put it to a practical test here is the
first heading upon which i come a husband's cruelty to his
wife there is half a column of print but i know without
reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me there is of
course the other woman the drink the push the blow the
bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady the crudest of
writers could invent nothing more crude

indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument
said holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it this
is the dundas separation case and as it happens i was engaged
in clearing up some small points in connection with it the
husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the
conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of
winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling
them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely
to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller take a
pinch of snuff doctor and acknowledge that i have scored over
you in your example

he held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in
the centre of the lid its splendour was in such contrast to his
homely ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon
it

ah said he i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks
it is a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my
assistance in the case of the irene adler papers

and the ring i asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which
sparkled upon his finger

it was from the reigning family of holland though the matter in
which i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it
even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of
my little problems

and have you any on hand just now i asked with interest

some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of
interest they are important you understand without being
interesting indeed i have found that it is usually in
unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation
and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the
charm to an investigation the larger crimes are apt to be the
simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is
the motive in these cases save for one rather intricate matter
which has been referred to me from marseilles there is nothing
which presents any features of interest it is possible however
that i may have something better before very many minutes are
over for this is one of my clients or i am much mistaken

he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted
blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted london street
looking over his shoulder i saw that on the pavement opposite
there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck
and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was
tilted in a coquettish duchess of devonshire fashion over her
ear from under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous
hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated
backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove
buttons suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves
the bank she hurried across the road and we heard the sharp
clang of the bell

i have seen those symptoms before said holmes throwing his
cigarette into the fire oscillation upon the pavement always
means an affaire de coeur she would like advice but is not sure
that the matter is not too delicate for communication and yet
even here we may discriminate when a woman has been seriously
wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom
is a broken bell wire here we may take it that there is a love
matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or
grieved but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts

as he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons
entered to announce miss mary sutherland while the lady herself
loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed
merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat sherlock holmes welcomed
her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and
having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked
her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was
peculiar to him

do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a
little trying to do so much typewriting

i did at first she answered but now i know where the letters
are without looking then suddenly realising the full purport
of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear
and astonishment upon her broad good-humoured face you've
heard about me mr holmes she cried else how could you know
all that

never mind said holmes laughing it is my business to know
things perhaps i have trained myself to see what others
overlook if not why should you come to consult me

i came to you sir because i heard of you from mrs etherege
whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had
given him up for dead oh mr holmes i wish you would do as
much for me i'm not rich but still i have a hundred a year in
my own right besides the little that i make by the machine and
i would give it all to know what has become of mr hosmer angel

why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry asked
sherlock holmes with his finger-tips together and his eyes to
the ceiling

again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss
mary sutherland yes i did bang out of the house she said
for it made me angry to see the easy way in which mr
windibank that is my father took it all he would not go to
the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he
would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done
it made me mad and i just on with my things and came right away
to you

your father said holmes your stepfather surely since the
name is different

yes my stepfather i call him father though it sounds funny
too for he is only five years and two months older than myself

and your mother is alive

oh yes mother is alive and well i wasn't best pleased mr
holmes when she married again so soon after father's death and
a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself father
was a plumber in the tottenham court road and he left a tidy
business behind him which mother carried on with mr hardy the
foreman but when mr windibank came he made her sell the
business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines
they got pounds for the goodwill and interest which wasn't
near as much as father could have got if he had been alive

i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this
rambling and inconsequential narrative but on the contrary he
had listened with the greatest concentration of attention

your own little income he asked does it come out of the
business

oh no sir it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle
ned in auckland it is in new zealand stock paying per
cent two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but i can
only touch the interest

you interest me extremely said holmes and since you draw so
large a sum as a hundred a year with what you earn into the
bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in
every way i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely
upon an income of about pounds

i could do with much less than that mr holmes but you
understand that as long as i live at home i don't wish to be a
burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while
i am staying with them of course that is only just for the
time mr windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it
over to mother and i find that i can do pretty well with what i
earn at typewriting it brings me twopence a sheet and i can
often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day

you have made your position very clear to me said holmes
this is my friend dr watson before whom you can speak as
freely as before myself kindly tell us now all about your
connection with mr hosmer angel

a flush stole over miss sutherland's face and she picked
nervously at the fringe of her jacket i met him first at the
gasfitters ball she said they used to send father tickets
when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and
sent them to mother mr windibank did not wish us to go he
never did wish us to go anywhere he would get quite mad if i
wanted so much as to join a sunday-school treat but this time i
was set on going and i would go for what right had he to
prevent he said the folk were not fit for us to know when all
father's friends were to be there and he said that i had nothing
fit to wear when i had my purple plush that i had never so much
as taken out of the drawer at last when nothing else would do
he went off to france upon the business of the firm but we went
mother and i with mr hardy who used to be our foreman and it
was there i met mr hosmer angel

i suppose said holmes that when mr windibank came back from
france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball

oh well he was very good about it he laughed i remember and
shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying
anything to a woman for she would have her way

i see then at the gasfitters ball you met as i understand a
gentleman called mr hosmer angel

yes sir i met him that night and he called next day to ask if
we had got home all safe and after that we met him that is to
say mr holmes i met him twice for walks but after that father
came back again and mr hosmer angel could not come to the house
any more

no

well you know father didn't like anything of the sort he
wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it and he used to
say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle but
then as i used to say to mother a woman wants her own circle to
begin with and i had not got mine yet

but how about mr hosmer angel did he make no attempt to see
you

well father was going off to france again in a week and hosmer
wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each
other until he had gone we could write in the meantime and he
used to write every day i took the letters in in the morning so
there was no need for father to know

were you engaged to the gentleman at this time

oh yes mr holmes we were engaged after the first walk that
we took hosmer mr angel was a cashier in an office in
leadenhall street and 

what office

that's the worst of it mr holmes i don't know

where did he live then

he slept on the premises

and you don't know his address

no except that it was leadenhall street

where did you address your letters then

to the leadenhall street post office to be left till called
for he said that if they were sent to the office he would be
chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady
so i offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldn't
have that for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come
from me but when they were typewritten he always felt that the
machine had come between us that will just show you how fond he
was of me mr holmes and the little things that he would think
of

it was most suggestive said holmes it has long been an axiom
of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important
can you remember any other little things about mr hosmer angel

he was a very shy man mr holmes he would rather walk with me
in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to
be conspicuous very retiring and gentlemanly he was even his
voice was gentle he'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he
was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat
and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech he was always
well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were weak just
as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare

well and what happened when mr windibank your stepfather
returned to france

mr hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we
should marry before father came back he was in dreadful earnest
and made me swear with my hands on the testament that whatever
happened i would always be true to him mother said he was quite
right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion
mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder
of him than i was then when they talked of marrying within the
week i began to ask about father but they both said never to
mind about father but just to tell him afterwards and mother
said she would make it all right with him i didn't quite like
that mr holmes it seemed funny that i should ask his leave as
he was only a few years older than me but i didn't want to do
anything on the sly so i wrote to father at bordeaux where the
company has its french offices but the letter came back to me on
the very morning of the wedding

it missed him then

yes sir for he had started to england just before it arrived

ha that was unfortunate your wedding was arranged then for
the friday was it to be in church

yes sir but very quietly it was to be at st saviour's near
king's cross and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st
pancras hotel hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were
two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a
four-wheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the
street we got to the church first and when the four-wheeler
drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and
when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one
there the cabman said that he could not imagine what had become
of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes that was
last friday mr holmes and i have never seen or heard anything
since then to throw any light upon what became of him

it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said
holmes

oh no sir he was too good and kind to leave me so why all
the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened i was to
be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to
separate us i was always to remember that i was pledged to him
and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later it seemed
strange talk for a wedding-morning but what has happened since
gives a meaning to it

most certainly it does your own opinion is then that some
unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him

yes sir i believe that he foresaw some danger or else he
would not have talked so and then i think that what he foresaw
happened

but you have no notion as to what it could have been

none

one more question how did your mother take the matter

she was angry and said that i was never to speak of the matter
again

and your father did you tell him

yes and he seemed to think with me that something had
happened and that i should hear of hosmer again as he said
what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of
the church and then leaving me now if he had borrowed my
money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him
there might be some reason but hosmer was very independent about
money and never would look at a shilling of mine and yet what
could have happened and why could he not write oh it drives me
half-mad to think of it and i can't sleep a wink at night she
pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob
heavily into it

i shall glance into the case for you said holmes rising and
i have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result let the
weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind
dwell upon it further above all try to let mr hosmer angel
vanish from your memory as he has done from your life

then you don't think i'll see him again

i fear not

then what has happened to him

you will leave that question in my hands i should like an
accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can
spare

i advertised for him in last saturday's chronicle said she
here is the slip and here are four letters from him

thank you and your address

no lyon place camberwell

mr angel's address you never had i understand where is your
father's place of business

he travels for westhouse marbank the great claret importers
of fenchurch street

thank you you have made your statement very clearly you will
leave the papers here and remember the advice which i have given
you let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it
to affect your life

you are very kind mr holmes but i cannot do that i shall be
true to hosmer he shall find me ready when he comes back

for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was
something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which
compelled our respect she laid her little bundle of papers upon
the table and went her way with a promise to come again whenever
she might be summoned

sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips
still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him
and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling then he took down
from the rack the old and oily clay pipe which was to him as a
counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with
the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him and a look of
infinite languor in his face

quite an interesting study that maiden he observed i found
her more interesting than her little problem which by the way
is rather a trite one you will find parallel cases if you
consult my index in andover in and there was something of
the sort at the hague last year old as is the idea however
there were one or two details which were new to me but the
maiden herself was most instructive

you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite
invisible to me i remarked

not invisible but unnoticed watson you did not know where to
look and so you missed all that was important i can never bring
you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of
thumb-nails or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace
now what did you gather from that woman's appearance describe
it

well she had a slate-coloured broad-brimmed straw hat with a
feather of a brickish red her jacket was black with black beads
sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments her
dress was brown rather darker than coffee colour with a little
purple plush at the neck and sleeves her gloves were greyish and
were worn through at the right forefinger her boots i didn't
observe she had small round hanging gold earrings and a
general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar comfortable
easy-going way

sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled

pon my word watson you are coming along wonderfully you have
really done very well indeed it is true that you have missed
everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and
you have a quick eye for colour never trust to general
impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details my
first glance is always at a woman's sleeve in a man it is
perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser as you
observe this woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most
useful material for showing traces the double line a little
above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table
was beautifully defined the sewing-machine of the hand type
leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side
of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the
broadest part as this was i then glanced at her face and
observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose i
ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed
to surprise her

it surprised me

but surely it was obvious i was then much surprised and
interested on glancing down to observe that though the boots
which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were
really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap and
the other a plain one one was buttoned only in the two lower
buttons out of five and the other at the first third and
fifth now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly
dressed has come away from home with odd boots half-buttoned
it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry

and what else i asked keenly interested as i always was by
my friend's incisive reasoning

i noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving
home but after being fully dressed you observed that her right
glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see
that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink she had
written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep it must have been
this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger
all this is amusing though rather elementary but i must go back
to business watson would you mind reading me the advertised
description of mr hosmer angel

i held the little printed slip to the light

missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman
named hosmer angel about five ft seven in in height
strongly built sallow complexion black hair a little bald in
the centre bushy black side-whiskers and moustache tinted
glasses slight infirmity of speech was dressed when last seen
in black frock-coat faced with silk black waistcoat gold albert
chain and grey harris tweed trousers with brown gaiters over
elastic-sided boots known to have been employed in an office in
leadenhall street anybody bringing 

that will do said holmes as to the letters he continued
glancing over them they are very commonplace absolutely no
clue in them to mr angel save that he quotes balzac once there
is one remarkable point however which will no doubt strike
you

they are typewritten i remarked

not only that but the signature is typewritten look at the
neat little hosmer angel at the bottom there is a date you
see but no superscription except leadenhall street which is
rather vague the point about the signature is very suggestive in
fact we may call it conclusive

of what

my dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it
bears upon the case

i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able
to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were
instituted

no that was not the point however i shall write two letters
which should settle the matter one is to a firm in the city the
other is to the young lady's stepfather mr windibank asking
him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow
evening it is just as well that we should do business with the
male relatives and now doctor we can do nothing until the
answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem
upon the shelf for the interim

i had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers
of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that
he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy
demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had
been called upon to fathom once only had i known him to fail in
the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler
photograph but when i looked back to the weird business of the
sign of four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with
the study in scarlet i felt that it would be a strange tangle
indeed which he could not unravel

i left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the
conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would
find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up
to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary
sutherland

a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own
attention at the time and the whole of next day i was busy at
the bedside of the sufferer it was not until close upon six
o'clock that i found myself free and was able to spring into a
hansom and drive to baker street half afraid that i might be too
late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery i found
sherlock holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin
form curled up in the recesses of his armchair a formidable
array of bottles and test-tubes with the pungent cleanly smell
of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the
chemical work which was so dear to him

well have you solved it i asked as i entered

yes it was the bisulphate of baryta

no no the mystery i cried

oh that i thought of the salt that i have been working upon
there was never any mystery in the matter though as i said
yesterday some of the details are of interest the only drawback
is that there is no law i fear that can touch the scoundrel

who was he then and what was his object in deserting miss
sutherland

the question was hardly out of my mouth and holmes had not yet
opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the
passage and a tap at the door

this is the girl's stepfather mr james windibank said
holmes he has written to me to say that he would be here at
six come in

the man who entered was a sturdy middle-sized fellow some
thirty years of age clean-shaven and sallow-skinned with a
bland insinuating manner and a pair of wonderfully sharp and
penetrating grey eyes he shot a questioning glance at each of
us placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard and with a
slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair

good-evening mr james windibank said holmes i think that
this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an
appointment with me for six o'clock

yes sir i am afraid that i am a little late but i am not
quite my own master you know i am sorry that miss sutherland
has troubled you about this little matter for i think it is far
better not to wash linen of the sort in public it was quite
against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable
impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily
controlled when she has made up her mind on a point of course i
did not mind you so much as you are not connected with the
official police but it is not pleasant to have a family
misfortune like this noised abroad besides it is a useless
expense for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel

on the contrary said holmes quietly i have every reason to
believe that i will succeed in discovering mr hosmer angel

mr windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves i am
delighted to hear it he said

it is a curious thing remarked holmes that a typewriter has
really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting unless
they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike some
letters get more worn than others and some wear only on one
side now you remark in this note of yours mr windibank that
in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and
a slight defect in the tail of the r there are fourteen other
characteristics but those are the more obvious

we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office
and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor answered glancing
keenly at holmes with his bright little eyes

and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study
mr windibank holmes continued i think of writing another
little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its
relation to crime it is a subject to which i have devoted some
little attention i have here four letters which purport to come
from the missing man they are all typewritten in each case not
only are the e's slurred and the r's tailless but you will
observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen
other characteristics to which i have alluded are there as well

mr windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat i
cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk mr holmes
he said if you can catch the man catch him and let me know
when you have done it

certainly said holmes stepping over and turning the key in
the door i let you know then that i have caught him

what where shouted mr windibank turning white to his lips
and glancing about him like a rat in a trap

oh it won't do really it won't said holmes suavely there
is no possible getting out of it mr windibank it is quite too
transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that
it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question that's
right sit down and let us talk it over

our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a
glitter of moisture on his brow it it's not actionable he
stammered

i am very much afraid that it is not but between ourselves
windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a
petty way as ever came before me now let me just run over the
course of events and you will contradict me if i go wrong

the man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his
breast like one who is utterly crushed holmes stuck his feet up
on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands
in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed
than to us

the man married a woman very much older than himself for her
money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the
daughter as long as she lived with them it was a considerable
sum for people in their position and the loss of it would have
made a serious difference it was worth an effort to preserve it
the daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate
and warm-hearted in her ways so that it was evident that with
her fair personal advantages and her little income she would
not be allowed to remain single long now her marriage would
mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her
stepfather do to prevent it he takes the obvious course of
keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of
people of her own age but soon he found that that would not
answer forever she became restive insisted upon her rights and
finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain
ball what does her clever stepfather do then he conceives an
idea more creditable to his head than to his heart with the
connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself
covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with
a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice
into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the
girl's short sight he appears as mr hosmer angel and keeps off
other lovers by making love himself

it was only a joke at first groaned our visitor we never
thought that she would have been so carried away

very likely not however that may be the young lady was very
decidedly carried away and having quite made up her mind that
her stepfather was in france the suspicion of treachery never
for an instant entered her mind she was flattered by the
gentleman's attentions and the effect was increased by the
loudly expressed admiration of her mother then mr angel began
to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as
far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced there
were meetings and an engagement which would finally secure the
girl's affections from turning towards anyone else but the
deception could not be kept up forever these pretended journeys
to france were rather cumbrous the thing to do was clearly to
bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it
would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and
prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to
come hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a testament and
hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening
on the very morning of the wedding james windibank wished miss
sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel and so uncertain as to
his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not
listen to another man as far as the church door he brought her
and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished
away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a
four-wheeler and out at the other i think that was the chain of
events mr windibank

our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes
had been talking and he rose from his chair now with a cold
sneer upon his pale face

it may be so or it may not mr holmes said he but if you
are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is
you who are breaking the law now and not me i have done nothing
actionable from the first but as long as you keep that door
locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal
constraint

the law cannot as you say touch you said holmes unlocking
and throwing open the door yet there never was a man who
deserved punishment more if the young lady has a brother or a
friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders by jove
he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon
the man's face it is not part of my duties to my client but
here's a hunting crop handy and i think i shall just treat
myself to he took two swift steps to the whip but before he
could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs
the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see mr
james windibank running at the top of his speed down the road

there's a cold-blooded scoundrel said holmes laughing as he
threw himself down into his chair once more that fellow will
rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and
ends on a gallows the case has in some respects been not
entirely devoid of interest

i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning i
remarked

well of course it was obvious from the first that this mr
hosmer angel must have some strong object for his curious
conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really
profited by the incident as far as we could see was the
stepfather then the fact that the two men were never together
but that the one always appeared when the other was away was
suggestive so were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice
which both hinted at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers my
suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in
typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his
handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even
the smallest sample of it you see all these isolated facts
together with many minor ones all pointed in the same
direction

and how did you verify them

having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration i
knew the firm for which this man worked having taken the printed
description i eliminated everything from it which could be the
result of a disguise the whiskers the glasses the voice and i
sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me
whether it answered to the description of any of their
travellers i had already noticed the peculiarities of the
typewriter and i wrote to the man himself at his business
address asking him if he would come here as i expected his
reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but
characteristic defects the same post brought me a letter from
westhouse marbank of fenchurch street to say that the
description tallied in every respect with that of their employé
james windibank voilà tout

and miss sutherland

if i tell her she will not believe me you may remember the old
persian saying there is danger for him who taketh the tiger
cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman
there is as much sense in hafiz as in horace and as much
knowledge of the world



adventure iv the boscombe valley mystery

we were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and i when the
maid brought in a telegram it was from sherlock holmes and ran
in this way

have you a couple of days to spare have just been wired for from
the west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy
shall be glad if you will come with me air and scenery perfect
leave paddington by the 

what do you say dear said my wife looking across at me
will you go

i really don't know what to say i have a fairly long list at
present

oh anstruther would do your work for you you have been looking
a little pale lately i think that the change would do you good
and you are always so interested in mr sherlock holmes cases

i should be ungrateful if i were not seeing what i gained
through one of them i answered but if i am to go i must pack
at once for i have only half an hour

my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the
effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller my wants were
few and simple so that in less than the time stated i was in a
cab with my valise rattling away to paddington station sherlock
holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt
figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey
travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap

it is really very good of you to come watson said he it
makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on
whom i can thoroughly rely local aid is always either worthless
or else biassed if you will keep the two corner seats i shall
get the tickets

we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of
papers which holmes had brought with him among these he rummaged
and read with intervals of note-taking and of meditation until
we were past reading then he suddenly rolled them all into a
gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack

have you heard anything of the case he asked

not a word i have not seen a paper for some days

the london press has not had very full accounts i have just
been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
particulars it seems from what i gather to be one of those
simple cases which are so extremely difficult

that sounds a little paradoxical

but it is profoundly true singularity is almost invariably a
clue the more featureless and commonplace a crime is the more
difficult it is to bring it home in this case however they
have established a very serious case against the son of the
murdered man

it is a murder then

well it is conjectured to be so i shall take nothing for
granted until i have the opportunity of looking personally into
it i will explain the state of things to you as far as i have
been able to understand it in a very few words

boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross in
herefordshire the largest landed proprietor in that part is a
mr john turner who made his money in australia and returned
some years ago to the old country one of the farms which he
held that of hatherley was let to mr charles mccarthy who was
also an ex-australian the men had known each other in the
colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came to
settle down they should do so as near each other as possible
turner was apparently the richer man so mccarthy became his
tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect
equality as they were frequently together mccarthy had one son
a lad of eighteen and turner had an only daughter of the same
age but neither of them had wives living they appear to have
avoided the society of the neighbouring english families and to
have led retired lives though both the mccarthys were fond of
sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the
neighbourhood mccarthy kept two servants a man and a girl
turner had a considerable household some half-dozen at the
least that is as much as i have been able to gather about the
families now for the facts

on june rd that is on monday last mccarthy left his house at
hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the
boscombe pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out
of the stream which runs down the boscombe valley he had been
out with his serving-man in the morning at ross and he had told
the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of
importance to keep at three from that appointment he never came
back alive

from hatherley farm-house to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a
mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground one
was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was
william crowder a game-keeper in the employ of mr turner both
these witnesses depose that mr mccarthy was walking alone the
game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing mr
mccarthy pass he had seen his son mr james mccarthy going the
same way with a gun under his arm to the best of his belief the
father was actually in sight at the time and the son was
following him he thought no more of the matter until he heard in
the evening of the tragedy that had occurred

the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder
the game-keeper lost sight of them the boscombe pool is thickly
wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the
edge a girl of fourteen patience moran who is the daughter of
the lodge-keeper of the boscombe valley estate was in one of the
woods picking flowers she states that while she was there she
saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake mr
mccarthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a
violent quarrel she heard mr mccarthy the elder using very
strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his
hand as if to strike his father she was so frightened by their
violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached
home that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near
boscombe pool and that she was afraid that they were going to
fight she had hardly said the words when young mr mccarthy came
running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead
in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper he was
much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right
hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood on
following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the
grass beside the pool the head had been beaten in by repeated
blows of some heavy and blunt weapon the injuries were such as
might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's
gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the
body under these circumstances the young man was instantly
arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned
at the inquest on tuesday he was on wednesday brought before the
magistrates at ross who have referred the case to the next
assizes those are the main facts of the case as they came out
before the coroner and the police-court

i could hardly imagine a more damning case i remarked if
ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so
here

circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered holmes
thoughtfully it may seem to point very straight to one thing
but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it
pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something
entirely different it must be confessed however that the case
looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very
possible that he is indeed the culprit there are several people
in the neighbourhood however and among them miss turner the
daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his
innocence and who have retained lestrade whom you may recollect
in connection with the study in scarlet to work out the case in
his interest lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the
case to me and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are
flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly
digesting their breakfasts at home

i am afraid said i that the facts are 
so obvious that you
will find little credit to be gained out of this case

there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he
answered laughing besides we may chance to hit upon some
other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to
mr lestrade you know me too well to think that i am boasting
when i say that i shall either confirm or destroy his theory by
means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of
understanding to take the first example to hand i very clearly
perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand
side and yet i question whether mr lestrade would have noted
even so self-evident a thing as that

how on earth 

my dear fellow i know you well i know the military neatness
which characterises you you shave every morning and in this
season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less
and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until
it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the
jaw it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated
than the other i could not imagine a man of your habits looking
at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a
result i only quote this as a trivial example of observation and
inference therein lies my métier and it is just possible that
it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before
us there are one or two minor points which were brought out in
the inquest and which are worth considering

what are they

it appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after
the return to hatherley farm on the inspector of constabulary
informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not
surprised to hear it and that it was no more than his deserts
this observation of his had the natural effect of removing any
traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the
coroner's jury

it was a confession i ejaculated

no for it was followed by a protestation of innocence

coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at
least a most suspicious remark

on the contrary said holmes it is the brightest rift which i
can at present see in the clouds however innocent he might be
he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the
circumstances were very black against him had he appeared
surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it i
should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such
surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances
and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man his
frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent
man or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and
firmness as to his remark about his deserts it was also not
unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of
his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day
so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and
even according to the little girl whose evidence is so
important to raise his hand as if to strike him the
self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark
appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a
guilty one

i shook my head many men have been hanged on far slighter
evidence i remarked

so they have and many men have been wrongfully hanged

what is the young man's own account of the matter

it is i am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters
though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive
you will find it here and may read it for yourself

he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire
paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the
paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own
statement of what had occurred i settled myself down in the
corner of the carriage and read it very carefully it ran in this
way

mr james mccarthy the only son of the deceased was then called
and gave evidence as follows i had been away from home for
three days at bristol and had only just returned upon the
morning of last monday the rd my father was absent from home at
the time of my arrival and i was informed by the maid that he
had driven over to ross with john cobb the groom shortly after
my return i heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and
looking out of my window i saw him get out and walk rapidly out
of the yard though i was not aware in which direction he was
going i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of
the boscombe pool with the intention of visiting the rabbit
warren which is upon the other side on my way i saw william
crowder the game-keeper as he had stated in his evidence but
he is mistaken in thinking that i was following my father i had
no idea that he was in front of me when about a hundred yards
from the pool i heard a cry of cooee which was a usual signal
between my father and myself i then hurried forward and found
him standing by the pool he appeared to be much surprised at
seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was doing there a
conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows
for my father was a man of a very violent temper seeing that his
passion was becoming ungovernable i left him and returned
towards hatherley farm i had not gone more than yards
however when i heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me
to run back again i found my father expiring upon the ground
with his head terribly injured i dropped my gun and held him in
my arms but he almost instantly expired i knelt beside him for
some minutes and then made my way to mr turner's lodge-keeper
his house being the nearest to ask for assistance i saw no one
near my father when i returned and i have no idea how he came by
his injuries he was not a popular man being somewhat cold and
forbidding in his manners but he had as far as i know no
active enemies i know nothing further of the matter

the coroner did your father make any statement to you before
he died

witness he mumbled a few words but i could only catch some
allusion to a rat

the coroner what did you understand by that

witness it conveyed no meaning to me i thought that he was
delirious

the coroner what was the point upon which you and your father
had this final quarrel

witness i should prefer not to answer

the coroner i am afraid that i must press it

witness it is really impossible for me to tell you i can
assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which
followed

the coroner that is for the court to decide i need not point
out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case
considerably in any future proceedings which may arise

witness i must still refuse

the coroner i understand that the cry of cooee was a common
signal between you and your father

witness it was

the coroner how was it then that he uttered it before he saw
you and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol

witness with considerable confusion i do not know

a juryman did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions
when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father
fatally injured

witness nothing definite

the coroner what do you mean

witness i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into
the open that i could think of nothing except of my father yet
i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay
upon the ground to the left of me it seemed to me to be
something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps
when i rose from my father i looked round for it but it was
gone

do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help

yes it was gone

you cannot say what it was

no i had a feeling something was there

how far from the body

a dozen yards or so

and how far from the edge of the wood

about the same

then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen
yards of it

yes but with my back towards it

this concluded the examination of the witness

i see said i as i glanced down the column that the coroner
in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy
he calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his
father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his
refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and
his singular account of his father's dying words they are all
as he remarks very much against the son

holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon
the cushioned seat both you and the coroner have been at some
pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the
young man's favour don't you see that you alternately give him
credit for having too much imagination and too little too
little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would
give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from
his own inner consciousness anything so outré as a dying
reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth no
sir i shall approach this case from the point of view that what
this young man says is true and we shall see whither that
hypothesis will lead us and now here is my pocket petrarch and
not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the
scene of action we lunch at swindon and i see that we shall be
there in twenty minutes

it was nearly four o'clock when we at last after passing through
the beautiful stroud valley and over the broad gleaming severn
found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of ross a
lean ferret-like man furtive and sly-looking was waiting for
us upon the platform in spite of the light brown dustcoat and
leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic
surroundings i had no difficulty in recognising lestrade of
scotland yard with him we drove to the hereford arms where a
room had already been engaged for us

i have ordered a carriage said lestrade as we sat over a cup
of tea i knew your energetic nature and that you would not be
happy until you had been on the scene of the crime

it was very nice and complimentary of you holmes answered it
is entirely a question of barometric pressure

lestrade looked startled i do not quite follow he said

how is the glass twenty-nine i see no wind and not a cloud
in the sky i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need
smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country
hotel abomination i do not think that it is probable that i
shall use the carriage to-night

lestrade laughed indulgently you have no doubt already formed
your conclusions from the newspapers he said the case is as
plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer
it becomes still of course one can't refuse a lady and such a
very positive one too she has heard of you and would have your
opinion though i repeatedly told her that there was nothing
which you could do which i had not already done why bless my
soul here is her carriage at the door

he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the
most lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life her
violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her
cheeks all thought of her natural reserve lost in her
overpowering excitement and concern

oh mr sherlock holmes she cried glancing from one to the
other of us and finally with a woman's quick intuition
fastening upon my companion i am so glad that you have come i
have driven down to tell you so i know that james didn't do it
i know it and i want you to start upon your work knowing it
too never let yourself doubt upon that point we have known each
other since we were little children and i know his faults as no
one else does but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly such a
charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him

i hope we may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes
you may rely upon my doing all that i can

but you have read the evidence you have formed some conclusion
do you not see some loophole some flaw do you not yourself
think that he is innocent

i think that it is very probable

there now she cried throwing back her head and looking
defiantly at lestrade you hear he gives me hopes

lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am afraid that my colleague
has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said

but he is right oh i know that he is right james never did
it and about his quarrel with his father i am sure that the
reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because
i was concerned in it

in what way asked holmes

it is no time for me to hide anything james and his father had
many disagreements about me mr mccarthy was very anxious that
there should be a marriage between us james and i have always
loved each other as brother and sister but of course he is young
and has seen very little of life yet and and well he
naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet so there
were quarrels and this i am sure was one of them

and your father asked holmes was he in favour of such a
union

no he was averse to it also no one but mr mccarthy was in
favour of it a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as
holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her

thank you for this information said he may i see your father
if i call to-morrow

i am afraid the doctor won't allow it

the doctor

yes have you not heard poor father has never been strong for
years back but this has broken him down completely he has taken
to his bed and dr willows says that he is a wreck and that his
nervous system is shattered mr mccarthy was the only man alive
who had known dad in the old days in victoria

ha in victoria that is important

yes at the mines

quite so at the gold-mines where as i understand mr turner
made his money

yes certainly

thank you miss turner you have been of material assistance to
me

you will tell me if you have any news to-morrow no doubt you
will go to the prison to see james oh if you do mr holmes do
tell him that i know him to be innocent

i will miss turner

i must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if
i leave him good-bye and god help you in your undertaking she
hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we
heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street

i am ashamed of you holmes said lestrade with dignity after a
few minutes silence why should you raise up hopes which you
are bound to disappoint i am not over-tender of heart but i
call it cruel

i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy said
holmes have you an order to see him in prison

yes but only for you and me

then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out we have
still time to take a train to hereford and see him to-night

ample

then let us do so watson i fear that you will find it very
slow but i shall only be away a couple of hours

i walked down to the station with them and then wandered through
the streets of the little town finally returning to the hotel
where i lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a
yellow-backed novel the puny plot of the story was so thin
however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were
groping and i found my attention wander so continually from the
action to the fact that i at last flung it across the room and
gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the
day supposing that this unhappy young man's story were
absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely
unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between
the time when he parted from his father and the moment when
drawn back by his screams he rushed into the glade it was
something terrible and deadly what could it be might not the
nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts
i rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper which
contained a verbatim account of the inquest in the surgeon's
deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left
parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon i marked the spot
upon my own head clearly such a blow must have been struck from
behind that was to some extent in favour of the accused as when
seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father still it
did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his
back before the blow fell still it might be worth while to call
holmes attention to it then there was the peculiar dying
reference to a rat what could that mean it could not be
delirium a man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become
delirious no it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how
he met his fate but what could it indicate i cudgelled my
brains to find some possible explanation and then the incident
of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy if that were true the
murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his
overcoat in his flight and must have had the hardihood to
return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was
kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off what a
tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was i
did not wonder at lestrade's opinion and yet i had so much faith
in sherlock holmes insight that i could not lose hope as long
as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young
mccarthy's innocence

it was late before sherlock holmes returned he came back alone
for lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town

the glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down
it is of importance that it should not rain before we are able
to go over the ground on the other hand a man should be at his
very best and keenest for such nice work as that and i did not
wish to do it when fagged by a long journey i have seen young
mccarthy

and what did you learn from him

nothing

could he throw no light

none at all i was inclined to think at one time that he knew
who had done it and was screening him or her but i am convinced
now that he is as puzzled as everyone else he is not a very
quick-witted youth though comely to look at and i should think
sound at heart

i cannot admire his taste i remarked if it is indeed a fact
that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as
this miss turner

ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale this fellow is madly
insanely in love with her but some two years ago when he was
only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away
five years at a boarding-school what does the idiot do but get
into the clutches of a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a
registry office no one knows a word of the matter but you can
imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not
doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows
to be absolutely impossible it was sheer frenzy of this sort
which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father
at their last interview was goading him on to propose to miss
turner on the other hand he had no means of supporting himself
and his father who was by all accounts a very hard man would
have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth it was with
his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in
bristol and his father did not know where he was mark that
point it is of importance good has come out of evil however
for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious
trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and
has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the
bermuda dockyard so that there is really no tie between them i
think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all
that he has suffered

but if he is innocent who has done it

ah who i would call your attention very particularly to two
points one is that the murdered man had an appointment with
someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his
son for his son was away and he did not know when he would
return the second is that the murdered man was heard to cry
cooee before he knew that his son had returned those are the
crucial points upon which the case depends and now let us talk
about george meredith if you please and we shall leave all
minor matters until to-morrow

there was no rain as holmes had foretold and the morning broke
bright and cloudless at nine o'clock lestrade called for us with
the carriage and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe
pool

there is serious news this morning lestrade observed it is
said that mr turner of the hall is so ill that his life is
despaired of

an elderly man i presume said holmes

about sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life
abroad and he has been in failing health for some time this
business has had a very bad effect upon him he was an old friend
of mccarthy's and i may add a great benefactor to him for i
have learned that he gave him hatherley farm rent free

indeed that is interesting said holmes

oh yes in a hundred other ways he has helped him everybody
about here speaks of his kindness to him

really does it not strike you as a little singular that this
mccarthy who appears to have had little of his own and to have
been under such obligations to turner should still talk of
marrying his son to turner's daughter who is presumably
heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner
as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would
follow it is the more strange since we know that turner himself
was averse to the idea the daughter told us as much do you not
deduce something from that

we have got to the deductions and the inferences said
lestrade winking at me i find it hard enough to tackle facts
holmes without flying away after theories and fancies

you are right said holmes demurely you do find it very hard
to tackle the facts

anyhow i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it
difficult to get hold of replied lestrade with some warmth

and that is 

that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that
all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine

well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said holmes
laughing but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley
farm upon the left

yes that is it it was a widespread comfortable-looking
building two-storied slate-roofed with great yellow blotches
of lichen upon the grey walls the drawn blinds and the smokeless
chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight
of this horror still lay heavy upon it we called at the door
when the maid at holmes request showed us the boots which her
master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the
son's though not the pair which he had then had having measured
these very carefully from seven or eight different points holmes
desired to be led to the court-yard from which we all followed
the winding track which led to boscombe pool

sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent
as this men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of
baker street would have failed to recognise him his face flushed
and darkened his brows were drawn into two hard black lines
while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter
his face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips
compressed and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long
sinewy neck his nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal
lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated
upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell
unheeded upon his ears or at the most only provoked a quick
impatient snarl in reply swiftly and silently he made his way
along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of
the woods to the boscombe pool it was damp marshy ground as is
all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon
the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either
side sometimes holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and
once he made quite a little detour into the meadow lestrade and
i walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous
while i watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the
conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a
definite end

the boscombe pool which is a little reed-girt sheet of water
some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the
hatherley farm and the private park of the wealthy mr turner
above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see
the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich
landowner's dwelling on the hatherley side of the pool the woods
grew very thick and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass
twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
which lined the lake lestrade showed us the exact spot at which
the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground
that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by the
fall of the stricken man to holmes as i could see by his eager
face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read
upon the trampled grass he ran round like a dog who is picking
up a scent and then turned upon my companion

what did you go into the pool for he asked

i fished about with a rake i thought there might be some weapon
or other trace but how on earth 

oh tut tut i have no time that left foot of yours with its
inward twist is all over the place a mole could trace it and
there it vanishes among the reeds oh how simple it would all
have been had i been here before they came like a herd of buffalo
and wallowed all over it here is where the party with the
lodge-keeper came and they have covered all tracks for six or
eight feet round the body but here are three separate tracks of
the same feet he drew out a lens and lay down upon his
waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather to
himself than to us these are young mccarthy's feet twice he
was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are
deeply marked and the heels hardly visible that bears out his
story he ran when he saw his father on the ground then here are
the father's feet as he paced up and down what is this then it
is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening and this
ha ha what have we here tiptoes tiptoes square too quite
unusual boots they come they go they come again of course
that was for the cloak now where did they come from he ran up
and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we
were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a
great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood holmes traced
his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
his face with a little cry of satisfaction for a long time he
remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks
gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and
examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of
the tree as far as he could reach a jagged stone was lying among
the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained then
he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the
highroad where all traces were lost

it has been a case of considerable interest he remarked
returning to his natural manner i fancy that this grey house on
the right must be the lodge i think that i will go in and have a
word with moran and perhaps write a little note having done
that we may drive back to our luncheon you may walk to the cab
and i shall be with you presently

it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove
back into ross holmes still carrying with him the stone which he
had picked up in the wood

this may interest you lestrade he remarked holding it out
the murder was done with it

i see no marks

there are none

how do you know then

the grass was growing under it it had only lain there a few
days there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken it
corresponds with the injuries there is no sign of any other
weapon

and the murderer

is a tall man left-handed limps with the right leg wears
thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak smokes indian
cigars uses a cigar-holder and carries a blunt pen-knife in his
pocket there are several other indications but these may be
enough to aid us in our search

lestrade laughed i am afraid that i am still a sceptic he
said theories are all very well but we have to deal with a
hard-headed british jury

nous verrons answered holmes calmly you work your own
method and i shall work mine i shall be busy this afternoon
and shall probably return to london by the evening train

and leave your case unfinished

no finished

but the mystery

it is solved

who was the criminal then

the gentleman i describe

but who is he

surely it would not be difficult to find out this is not such a
populous neighbourhood

lestrade shrugged his shoulders i am a practical man he said
and i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking
for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg i should become the
laughing-stock of scotland yard

all right said holmes quietly i have given you the chance
here are your lodgings good-bye i shall drop you a line before
i leave

having left lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where
we found lunch upon the table holmes was silent and buried in
thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds
himself in a perplexing position

look here watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit
down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little i don't
know quite what to do and i should value your advice light a
cigar and let me expound

 pray do so

well now in considering this case there are two points about
young mccarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly
although they impressed me in his favour and you against him one
was the fact that his father should according to his account
cry cooee before seeing him the other was his singular dying
reference to a rat he mumbled several words you understand but
that was all that caught the son's ear now from this double
point our research must commence and we will begin it by
presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true

what of this cooee then

well obviously it could not have been meant for the son the
son as far as he knew was in bristol it was mere chance that
he was within earshot the cooee was meant to attract the
attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with but
cooee is a distinctly australian cry and one which is used
between australians there is a strong presumption that the
person whom mccarthy expected to meet him at boscombe pool was
someone who had been in australia

what of the rat then

sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened
it out on the table this is a map of the colony of victoria
he said i wired to bristol for it last night he put his hand
over part of the map what do you read

arat i read

and now he raised his hand

ballarat

quite so that was the word the man uttered and of which his
son only caught the last two syllables he was trying to utter
the name of his murderer so and so of ballarat

it is wonderful i exclaimed

it is obvious and now you see i had narrowed the field down
considerably the possession of a grey garment was a third point
which granting the son's statement to be correct was a
certainty we have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite
conception of an australian from ballarat with a grey cloak

certainly

and one who was at home in the district for the pool can only
be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could
hardly wander

quite so

then comes our expedition of to-day by an examination of the
ground i gained the trifling details which i gave to that
imbecile lestrade as to the personality of the criminal

but how did you gain them

you know my method it is founded upon the observation of
trifles

his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length
of his stride his boots too might be told from their traces

yes they were peculiar boots

but his lameness

the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than
his left he put less weight upon it why because he limped he
was lame

but his left-handedness

you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded
by the surgeon at the inquest the blow was struck from
immediately behind and yet was upon the left side now how can
that be unless it were by a left-handed man he had stood behind
that tree during the interview between the father and son he had
even smoked there i found the ash of a cigar which my special
knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an indian
cigar i have as you know devoted some attention to this and
written a little monograph on the ashes of different
varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco having found the
ash i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
where he had tossed it it was an indian cigar of the variety
which are rolled in rotterdam

and the cigar-holder

i could see that the end had not been in his mouth therefore he
used a holder the tip had been cut off not bitten off but the
cut was not a clean one so i deduced a blunt pen-knife

holmes i said you have drawn a net round this man from which
he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as
truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him i see the
direction in which all this points the culprit is 

mr john turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of
our sitting-room and ushering in a visitor

the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure his
slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of
decrepitude and yet his hard deep-lined craggy features and
his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual
strength of body and of character his tangled beard grizzled
hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air
of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an
ashen white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were
tinged with a shade of blue it was clear to me at a glance that
he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease

pray sit down on the sofa said holmes gently you had my
note

yes the lodge-keeper brought it up you said that you wished to
see me here to avoid scandal

i thought people would talk if i went to the hall

and why did you wish to see me he looked across at my
companion with despair in his weary eyes as though his question
was already answered

yes said holmes answering the look rather than the words it
is so i know all about mccarthy

the old man sank his face in his hands god help me he cried
but i would not have let the young man come to harm i give you
my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at
the assizes

i am glad to hear you say so said holmes gravely

i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl it
would break her heart it will break her heart when she hears
that i am arrested

it may not come to that said holmes

what

i am no official agent i understand that it was your daughter
who required my presence here and i am acting in her interests
young mccarthy must be got off however

i am a dying man said old turner i have had diabetes for
years my doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a
month yet i would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol

holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand
and a bundle of paper before him just tell us the truth he
said i shall jot down the facts you will sign it and watson
here can witness it then i could produce your confession at the
last extremity to save young mccarthy i promise you that i shall
not use it unless it is absolutely needed

it's as well said the old man it's a question whether i
shall live to the assizes so it matters little to me but i
should wish to spare alice the shock and now i will make the
thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but
will not take me long to tell

you didn't know this dead man mccarthy he was a devil
incarnate i tell you that god keep you out of the clutches of
such a man as he his grip has been upon me these twenty years
and he has blasted my life i'll tell you first how i came to be
in his power

it was in the early 's at the diggings i was a young chap
then hot-blooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at
anything i got among bad companions took to drink had no luck
with my claim took to the bush and in a word became what you
would call over here a highway robber there were six of us and
we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time
to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings
black jack of ballarat was the name i went under and our party
is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang

one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne and
we lay in wait for it and attacked it there were six troopers
and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of
their saddles at the first volley three of our boys were killed
however before we got the swag i put my pistol to the head of
the wagon-driver who was this very man mccarthy i wish to the
lord that i had shot him then but i spared him though i saw his
wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every
feature we got away with the gold became wealthy men and made
our way over to england without being suspected there i parted
from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and
respectable life i bought this estate which chanced to be in
the market and i set myself to do a little good with my money
to make up for the way in which i had earned it i married too
and though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice
even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down
the right path as nothing else had ever done in a word i turned
over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past all was
going well when mccarthy laid his grip upon me

i had gone up to town about an investment and i met him in
regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his
foot

here we are jack says he touching me on the arm we'll be
as good as a family to you there's two of us me and my son and
you can have the keeping of us if you don't it's a fine
law-abiding country is england and there's always a policeman
within hail

well down they came to the west country there was no shaking
them off and there they have lived rent free on my best land
ever since there was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness
turn where i would there was his cunning grinning face at my
elbow it grew worse as alice grew up for he soon saw i was more
afraid of her knowing my past than of the police whatever he
wanted he must have and whatever it was i gave him without
question land money houses until at last he asked a thing
which i could not give he asked for alice

his son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as i was
known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that
his lad should step into the whole property but there i was
firm i would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine not that
i had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that
was enough i stood firm mccarthy threatened i braved him to do
his worst we were to meet at the pool midway between our houses
to talk it over

when i went down there i found him talking with his son so i
smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone
but as i listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in
me seemed to come uppermost he was urging his son to marry my
daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she
were a slut from off the streets it drove me mad to think that i
and all that i held most dear should be in the power of such a
man as this could i not snap the bond i was already a dying and
a desperate man though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb
i knew that my own fate was sealed but my memory and my girl
both could be saved if i could but silence that foul tongue i
did it mr holmes i would do it again deeply as i have sinned
i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it but that my girl
should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
than i could suffer i struck him down with no more compunction
than if he had been some foul and venomous beast his cry brought
back his son but i had gained the cover of the wood though i
was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in
my flight that is the true story gentlemen of all that
occurred

well it is not for me to judge you said holmes as the old man
signed the statement which had been drawn out i pray that we
may never be exposed to such a temptation

i pray not sir and what do you intend to do

in view of your health nothing you are yourself aware that you
will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the
assizes i will keep your confession and if mccarthy is
condemned i shall be forced to use it if not it shall never be
seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or
dead shall be safe with us

farewell then said the old man solemnly your own deathbeds
when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace
which you have given to mine tottering and shaking in all his
giant frame he stumbled slowly from the room

god help us said holmes after a long silence why does fate
play such tricks with poor helpless worms i never hear of such
a case as this that i do not think of baxter's words and say
there but for the grace of god goes sherlock holmes

james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a
number of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and
submitted to the defending counsel old turner lived for seven
months after our interview but he is now dead and there is
every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily
together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their
past



adventure v the five orange pips

when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes
cases between the years and i am faced by so many which
present strange and interesting features that it is no easy
matter to know which to choose and which to leave some however
have already gained publicity through the papers and others have
not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend
possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of
these papers to illustrate some too have baffled his
analytical skill and would be as narratives beginnings without
an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and
have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and
surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
him there is however one of these last which was so remarkable
in its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted
to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are
points in connection with it which never have been and probably
never will be entirely cleared up

the year furnished us with a long series of cases of greater
or less interest of which i retain the records among my
headings under this one twelve months i find an account of the
adventure of the paradol chamber of the amateur mendicant
society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a
furniture warehouse of the facts connected with the loss of the
british barque sophy anderson of the singular adventures of the
grice patersons in the island of uffa and finally of the
camberwell poisoning case in the latter as may be remembered
sherlock holmes was able by winding up the dead man's watch to
prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that
therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time a
deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the
case all these i may sketch out at some future date but none of
them present such singular features as the strange train of
circumstances which i have now taken up my pen to describe

it was in the latter days of september and the equinoctial gales
had set in with exceptional violence all day the wind had
screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that
even here in the heart of great hand-made london we were forced
to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and
to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which
shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like
untamed beasts in a cage as evening drew in the storm grew
higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in
the chimney sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the
fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime while i at the
other was deep in one of clark russell's fine sea-stories until
the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text
and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of
the sea waves my wife was on a visit to her mother's and for a
few days i was a dweller once more in my old quarters at baker
street

why said i glancing up at my companion that was surely the
bell who could come to-night some friend of yours perhaps

except yourself i have none he answered i do not encourage
visitors

a client then

if so it is a serious case nothing less would bring a man out
on such a day and at such an hour but i take it that it is more
likely to be some crony of the landlady's

sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there
came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door he
stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and
towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit

come in said he

the man who entered was young some two-and-twenty at the
outside well-groomed and trimly clad with something of
refinement and delicacy in his bearing the streaming umbrella
which he held in his hand and his long shining waterproof told
of the fierce weather through which he had come he looked about
him anxiously in the glare of the lamp and i could see that his
face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is
weighed down with some great anxiety

i owe you an apology he said raising his golden pince-nez to
his eyes i trust that i am not intruding i fear that i have
brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug
chamber

give me your coat and umbrella said holmes they may rest
here on the hook and will be dry presently you have come up from
the south-west i see

yes from horsham

that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is
quite distinctive

i have come for advice

that is easily got

and help

that is not always so easy

i have heard of you mr holmes i heard from major prendergast
how you saved him in the tankerville club scandal

ah of course he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards

he said that you could solve anything

he said too much

that you are never beaten

i have been beaten four times three times by men and once by a
woman

but what is that compared with the number of your successes

it is true that i have been generally successful

then you may be so with me

i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me
with some details as to your case

it is no ordinary one

none of those which come to me are i am the last court of
appeal

and yet i question sir whether in all your experience you
have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of
events than those which have happened in my own family

you fill me with interest said holmes pray give us the
essential facts from the commencement and i can afterwards
question you as to those details which seem to me to be most
important

the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out
towards the blaze

my name said he is john openshaw but my own affairs have
as far as i can understand little to do with this awful
business it is a hereditary matter so in order to give you an
idea of the facts i must go back to the commencement of the
affair

you must know that my grandfather had two sons my uncle elias
and my father joseph my father had a small factory at coventry
which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling he
was a patentee of the openshaw unbreakable tire and his business
met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire
upon a handsome competence

my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and
became a planter in florida where he was reported to have done
very well at the time of the war he fought in jackson's army
and afterwards under hood where he rose to be a colonel when
lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where
he remained for three or four years about or he came
back to europe and took a small estate in sussex near horsham
he had made a very considerable fortune in the states and his
reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his
dislike of the republican policy in extending the franchise to
them he was a singular man fierce and quick-tempered very
foul-mouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring
disposition during all the years that he lived at horsham i
doubt if ever he set foot in the town he had a garden and two or
three fields round his house and there he would take his
exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave
his room he drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very
heavily but he would see no society and did not want any
friends not even his own brother

he didn't mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the
time when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so this
would be in the year after he had been eight or nine years
in england he begged my father to let me live with him and he
was very kind to me in his way when he was sober he used to be
fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would
make me his representative both with the servants and with the
tradespeople so that by the time that i was sixteen i was quite
master of the house i kept all the keys and could go where i
liked and do what i liked so long as i did not disturb him in
his privacy there was one singular exception however for he
had a single room a lumber-room up among the attics which was
invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or
anyone else to enter with a boy's curiosity i have peeped
through the keyhole but i was never able to see more than such a
collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such
a room

one day it was in march a letter with a foreign stamp
lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate it was not a
common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all
paid in ready money and he had no friends of any sort from
india said he as he took it up pondicherry postmark what can
this be opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little
dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate i began to
laugh at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight
of his face his lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his
skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he
still held in his trembling hand k k k he shrieked and
then my god my god my sins have overtaken me

what is it uncle i cried

death said he and rising from the table he retired to his
room leaving me palpitating with horror i took up the envelope
and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the
gum the letter k three times repeated there was nothing else
save the five dried pips what could be the reason of his
overpowering terror i left the breakfast-table and as i
ascended the stair i met him coming down with an old rusty key
which must have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small
brass box like a cashbox in the other

they may do what they like but i'll checkmate them still
said he with an oath tell mary that i shall want a fire in my
room to-day and send down to fordham the horsham lawyer

i did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to
step up to the room the fire was burning brightly and in the
grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned
paper while the brass box stood open and empty beside it as i
glanced at the box i noticed with a start that upon the lid was
printed the treble k which i had read in the morning upon the
envelope

i wish you john said my uncle to witness my will i leave
my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to
my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to
you if you can enjoy it in peace well and good if you find you
cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest
enemy i am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing but i can't
say what turn things are going to take kindly sign the paper
where mr fordham shows you

i signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with
him the singular incident made as you may think the deepest
impression upon me and i pondered over it and turned it every
way in my mind without being able to make anything of it yet i
could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left
behind though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed
and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives i
could see a change in my uncle however he drank more than ever
and he was less inclined for any sort of society most of his
time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the
inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy
and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a
revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man
and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by
man or devil when these hot fits were over however he would
rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him
like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror
which lies at the roots of his soul at such times i have seen
his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it
were new raised from a basin

well to come to an end of the matter mr holmes and not to
abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those
drunken sallies from which he never came back we found him when
we went to search for him face downward in a little
green-scummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden there
was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep
so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity
brought in a verdict of suicide but i who knew how he winced
from the very thought of death had much ado to persuade myself
that he had gone out of his way to meet it the matter passed
however and my father entered into possession of the estate and
of some pounds which lay to his credit at the bank

one moment holmes interposed your statement is i foresee
one of the most remarkable to which i have ever listened let me
have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and
the date of his supposed suicide

the letter arrived on march his death was seven weeks
later upon the night of may nd

thank you pray proceed

when my father took over the horsham property he at my
request made a careful examination of the attic which had been
always locked up we found the brass box there although its
contents had been destroyed on the inside of the cover was a
paper label with the initials of k k k repeated upon it and
letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath
these we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had
been destroyed by colonel openshaw for the rest there was
nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many
scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in
america some of them were of the war time and showed that he had
done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier
others were of a date during the reconstruction of the southern
states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had
evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag
politicians who had been sent down from the north

well it was the beginning of when my father came to live at
horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the
january of on the fourth day after the new year i heard my
father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the
breakfast-table there he was sitting with a newly opened
envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the
outstretched palm of the other one he had always laughed at what
he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel but he looked
very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
himself

why what on earth does this mean john he stammered

my heart had turned to lead it is k k k said i

he looked inside the envelope so it is he cried here are
the very letters but what is this written above them

put the papers on the sundial i read peeping over his
shoulder

what papers what sundial he asked

the sundial in the garden there is no other said i but the
papers must be those that are destroyed

pooh said he gripping hard at his courage we are in a
civilised land here and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind
where does the thing come from

from dundee i answered glancing at the postmark

some preposterous practical joke said he what have i to do
with sundials and papers i shall take no notice of such
nonsense

i should certainly speak to the police i said

and be laughed at for my pains nothing of the sort

then let me do so

no i forbid you i won't have a fuss made about such
nonsense

it was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate
man i went about however with a heart which was full of
forebodings

on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went
from home to visit an old friend of his major freebody who is
in command of one of the forts upon portsdown hill i was glad
that he should go for it seemed to me that he was farther from
danger when he was away from home in that however i was in
error upon the second day of his absence i received a telegram
from the major imploring me to come at once my father had
fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the
neighbourhood and was lying senseless with a shattered skull i
hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered
his consciousness he had as it appears been returning from
fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him
and the chalk-pit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in
bringing in a verdict of death from accidental causes
carefully as i examined every fact connected with his death i
was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of
murder there were no signs of violence no footmarks no
robbery no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads
and yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease
and that i was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been
woven round him

in this sinister way i came into my inheritance you will ask me
why i did not dispose of it i answer because i was well
convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an
incident in my uncle's life and that the danger would be as
pressing in one house as in another

it was in january that my poor father met his end and two
years and eight months have elapsed since then during that time
i have lived happily at horsham and i had begun to hope that
this curse had passed away from the family and that it had ended
with the last generation i had begun to take comfort too soon
however yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in
which it had come upon my father

the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and
turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried
orange pips

this is the envelope he continued the postmark is
london eastern division within are the very words which were
upon my father's last message k k k and then put the
papers on the sundial

what have you done asked holmes

nothing

nothing

to tell the truth he sank his face into his thin white
hands i have felt helpless i have felt like one of those poor
rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it i seem to be in
the grasp of some resistless inexorable evil which no foresight
and no precautions can guard against

tut tut cried sherlock holmes you must act man or you are
lost nothing but energy can save you this is no time for
despair

i have seen the police

ah

but they listened to my story with a smile i am convinced that
the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all
practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really
accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with
the warnings

holmes shook his clenched hands in the air incredible
imbecility he cried

they have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in
the house with me

has he come with you to-night

no his orders were to stay in the house

again holmes raved in the air

why did you come to me he cried and above all why did you
not come at once

i did not know it was only to-day that i spoke to major
prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to
you

it is really two days since you had the letter we should have
acted before this you have no further evidence i suppose than
that which you have placed before us no suggestive detail which
might help us

there is one thing said john openshaw he rummaged in his coat
pocket and drawing out a piece of discoloured blue-tinted
paper he laid it out upon the table i have some remembrance
said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers i
observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the
ashes were of this particular colour i found this single sheet
upon the floor of his room and i am inclined to think that it
may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from
among the others and in that way has escaped destruction beyond
the mention of pips i do not see that it helps us much i think
myself that it is a page from some private diary the writing is
undoubtedly my uncle's

holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper
which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from
a book it was headed march and beneath were the
following enigmatical notices

th hudson came same old platform

th set the pips on mccauley paramore and
 john swain of st augustine

th mccauley cleared

th john swain cleared

th visited paramore all well

thank you said holmes folding up the paper and returning it
to our visitor and now you must on no account lose another
instant we cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told
me you must get home instantly and act

what shall i do

there is but one thing to do it must be done at once you must
put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass
box which you have described you must also put in a note to say
that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that
this is the only one which remains you must assert that in such
words as will carry conviction with them having done this you
must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed do
you understand

entirely

do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present i
think that we may gain that by means of the law but we have our
web to weave while theirs is already woven the first
consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens
you the second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the
guilty parties

i thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his
overcoat you have given me fresh life and hope i shall
certainly do as you advise

do not lose an instant and above all take care of yourself in
the meanwhile for i do not think that there can be a doubt that
you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger how do you
go back

by train from waterloo

it is not yet nine the streets will be crowded so i trust that
you may be in safety and yet you cannot guard yourself too
closely

i am armed

that is well to-morrow i shall set to work upon your case

i shall see you at horsham then

no your secret lies in london it is there that i shall seek
it

then i shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news
as to the box and the papers i shall take your advice in every
particular he shook hands with us and took his leave outside
the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered
against the windows this strange wild story seemed to have come
to us from amid the mad elements blown in upon us like a sheet
of sea-weed in a gale and now to have been reabsorbed by them
once more

sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk
forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire then he
lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue
smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling

i think watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we
have had none more fantastic than this

save perhaps the sign of four

well yes save perhaps that and yet this john openshaw seems
to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the
sholtos

but have you i asked formed any definite conception as to
what these perils are

there can be no question as to their nature he answered

then what are they who is this k k k and why does he pursue
this unhappy family

sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the
arms of his chair with his finger-tips together the ideal
reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a
single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the
chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which
would follow from it as cuvier could correctly describe a whole
animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who
has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents
should be able to accurately state all the other ones both
before and after we have not yet grasped the results which the
reason alone can attain to problems may be solved in the study
which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the
aid of their senses to carry the art however to its highest
pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to
utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge and this
in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all
knowledge which even in these days of free education and
encyclopaedias is a somewhat rare accomplishment it is not so
impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge
which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this i have
endeavoured in my case to do if i remember rightly you on one
occasion in the early days of our friendship defined my limits
in a very precise fashion

yes i answered laughing it was a singular document
philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at zero i
remember botany variable geology profound as regards the
mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry
eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime
records unique violin-player boxer swordsman lawyer and
self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco those i think were the
main points of my analysis

holmes grinned at the last item well he said i say now as
i said then that a man should keep his little brain-attic
stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the
rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library where he
can get it if he wants it now for such a case as the one which
has been submitted to us to-night we need certainly to muster
all our resources kindly hand me down the letter k of the
american encyclopaedia which stands upon the shelf beside you
thank you now let us consider the situation and see what may be
deduced from it in the first place we may start with a strong
presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason for
leaving america men at his time of life do not change all their
habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for
the lonely life of an english provincial town his extreme love
of solitude in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of
someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis
that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from
america as to what it was he feared we can only deduce that by
considering the formidable letters which were received by himself
and his successors did you remark the postmarks of those
letters

the first was from pondicherry the second from dundee and the
third from london

from east london what do you deduce from that

they are all seaports that the writer was on board of a ship

excellent we have already a clue there can be no doubt that
the probability the strong probability is that the writer was
on board of a ship and now let us consider another point in the
case of pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and
its fulfilment in dundee it was only some three or four days
does that suggest anything

a greater distance to travel

but the letter had also a greater distance to come

then i do not see the point

there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man
or men are is a sailing-ship it looks as if they always send
their singular warning or token before them when starting upon
their mission you see how quickly the deed followed the sign
when it came from dundee if they had come from pondicherry in a
steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter
but as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed i think that those
seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which
brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the
writer

it is possible

more than that it is probable and now you see the deadly
urgency of this new case and why i urged young openshaw to
caution the blow has always fallen at the end of the time which
it would take the senders to travel the distance but this one
comes from london and therefore we cannot count upon delay

good god i cried what can it mean this relentless
persecution

the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital
importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship i think
that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them
a single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way
as to deceive a coroner's jury there must have been several in
it and they must have been men of resource and determination
their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may
in this way you see k k k ceases to be the initials of an
individual and becomes the badge of a society

but of what society

have you never said sherlock holmes bending forward and
sinking his voice have you never heard of the ku klux klan

i never have

holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee here it
is said he presently

ku klux klan a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to
the sound produced by cocking a rifle this terrible secret
society was formed by some ex-confederate soldiers in the
southern states after the civil war and it rapidly formed local
branches in different parts of the country notably in tennessee
louisiana the carolinas georgia and florida its power was
used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of
the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country
of those who were opposed to its views its outrages were usually
preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
but generally recognised shape a sprig of oak-leaves in some
parts melon seeds or orange pips in others on receiving this
the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might
fly from the country if he braved the matter out death would
unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and
unforeseen manner so perfect was the organisation of the
society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a
case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with
impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the
perpetrators for some years the organisation flourished in spite
of the efforts of the united states government and of the better
classes of the community in the south eventually in the year
 the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have
been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date

you will observe said holmes laying down the volume that
the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the
disappearance of openshaw from america with their papers it may
well have been cause and effect it is no wonder that he and his
family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track
you can understand that this register and diary may implicate
some of the first men in the south and that there may be many
who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered

then the page we have seen 

is such as we might expect it ran if i remember right sent
the pips to a b and c that is sent the society's warning to
them then there are successive entries that a and b cleared or
left the country and finally that c was visited with i fear a
sinister result for c well i think doctor that we may let
some light into this dark place and i believe that the only
chance young openshaw has in the meantime is to do what i have
told him there is nothing more to be said or to be done
to-night so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for
half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable
ways of our fellow-men


it had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a
subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the
great city sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came
down

you will excuse me for not waiting for you said he i have i
foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of
young openshaw's

what steps will you take i asked

it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries
i may have to go down to horsham after all

you will not go there first

no i shall commence with the city just ring the bell and the
maid will bring up your coffee

as i waited i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and
glanced my eye over it it rested upon a heading which sent a
chill to my heart

holmes i cried you are too late

ah said he laying down his cup i feared as much how was it
done he spoke calmly but i could see that he was deeply moved

my eye caught the name of openshaw and the heading tragedy
near waterloo bridge here is the account

between nine and ten last night police-constable cook of the h
division on duty near waterloo bridge heard a cry for help and
a splash in the water the night however was extremely dark and
stormy so that in spite of the help of several passers-by it
was quite impossible to effect a rescue the alarm however was
given and by the aid of the water-police the body was
eventually recovered it proved to be that of a young gentleman
whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his
pocket was john openshaw and whose residence is near horsham
it is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch
the last train from waterloo station and that in his haste and
the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge
of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats the body
exhibited no traces of violence and there can be no doubt that
the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident
which should have the effect of calling the attention of the
authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages

we sat in silence for some minutes holmes more depressed and
shaken than i had ever seen him

that hurts my pride watson he said at last it is a petty
feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride it becomes a personal
matter with me now and if god sends me health i shall set my
hand upon this gang that he should come to me for help and that
i should send him away to his death he sprang from his chair
and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a
flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and
unclasping of his long thin hands

they must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last how could
they have decoyed him down there the embankment is not on the
direct line to the station the bridge no doubt was too
crowded even on such a night for their purpose well watson
we shall see who will win in the long run i am going out now

to the police

no i shall be my own police when i have spun the web they may
take the flies but not before

all day i was engaged in my professional work and it was late in
the evening before i returned to baker street sherlock holmes
had not come back yet it was nearly ten o'clock before he
entered looking pale and worn he walked up to the sideboard
and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously
washing it down with a long draught of water

you are hungry i remarked

starving it had escaped my memory i have had nothing since
breakfast

nothing

not a bite i had no time to think of it

and how have you succeeded

well

you have a clue

i have them in the hollow of my hand young openshaw shall not
long remain unavenged why watson let us put their own devilish
trade-mark upon them it is well thought of

what do you mean

he took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he
squeezed out the pips upon the table of these he took five and
thrust them into an envelope on the inside of the flap he wrote
s h for j o then he sealed it and addressed it to captain
james calhoun barque lone star savannah georgia

that will await him when he enters port said he chuckling
it may give him a sleepless night he will find it as sure a
precursor of his fate as openshaw did before him

and who is this captain calhoun

the leader of the gang i shall have the others but he first

how did you trace it then

he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with
dates and names

i have spent the whole day said he over lloyd's registers
and files of the old papers following the future career of every
vessel which touched at pondicherry in january and february in
 there were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were
reported there during those months of these one the lone star
instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported
as having cleared from london the name is that which is given to
one of the states of the union

texas i think

i was not and am not sure which but i knew that the ship must
have an american origin

what then

i searched the dundee records and when i found that the barque
lone star was there in january my suspicion became a
certainty i then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present
in the port of london

yes

the lone star had arrived here last week i went down to the
albert dock and found that she had been taken down the river by
the early tide this morning homeward bound to savannah i wired
to gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and
as the wind is easterly i have no doubt that she is now past the
goodwins and not very far from the isle of wight

what will you do then

oh i have my hand upon him he and the two mates are as i
learn the only native-born americans in the ship the others are
finns and germans i know also that they were all three away
from the ship last night i had it from the stevedore who has
been loading their cargo by the time that their sailing-ship
reaches savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter and
the cable will have informed the police of savannah that these
three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder

there is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans
and the murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the
orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as
resolute as themselves was upon their track very long and very
severe were the equinoctial gales that year we waited long for
news of the lone star of savannah but none ever reached us we
did at last hear that somewhere far out in the atlantic a
shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough
of a wave with the letters l s carved upon it and that is
all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone star



adventure vi the man with the twisted lip

isa whitney brother of the late elias whitney dd principal
of the theological college of st george's was much addicted to
opium the habit grew upon him as i understand from some
foolish freak when he was at college for having read de
quincey's description of his dreams and sensations he had
drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the
same effects he found as so many more have done that the
practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many
years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object of
mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives i can see
him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pin-point
pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble
man

one night it was in june there came a ring to my bell
about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the
clock i sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needle-work
down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment

a patient said she you'll have to go out

i groaned for i was newly come back from a weary day

we heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps
upon the linoleum our own door flew open and a lady clad in
some dark-coloured stuff with a black veil entered the room

you will excuse my calling so late she began and then
suddenly losing her self-control she ran forward threw her arms
about my wife's neck and sobbed upon her shoulder oh i'm in
such trouble she cried i do so want a little help

why said my wife pulling up her veil it is kate whitney
how you startled me kate i had not an idea who you were when
you came in

i didn't know what to do so i came straight to you that was
always the way folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds
to a light-house

it was very sweet of you to come now you must have some wine
and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it or
should you rather that i sent james off to bed

oh no no i want the doctor's advice and help too it's about
isa he has not been home for two days i am so frightened about
him

it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her
husband's trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend
and school companion we soothed and comforted her by such words
as we could find did she know where her husband was was it
possible that we could bring him back to her

it seems that it was she had the surest information that of late
he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the
farthest east of the city hitherto his orgies had always been
confined to one day and he had come back twitching and
shattered in the evening but now the spell had been upon him
eight-and-forty hours and he lay there doubtless among the
dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the
effects there he was to be found she was sure of it at the bar
of gold in upper swandam lane but what was she to do how could
she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and
pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him

there was the case and of course there was but one way out of
it might i not escort her to this place and then as a second
thought why should she come at all i was isa whitney's medical
adviser and as such i had influence over him i could manage it
better if i were alone i promised her on my word that i would
send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the
address which she had given me and so in ten minutes i had left
my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me and was speeding
eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at
the time though the future only could show how strange it was to
be

but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my
adventure upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the
high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east
of london bridge between a slop-shop and a gin-shop approached
by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the
mouth of a cave i found the den of which i was in search
ordering my cab to wait i passed down the steps worn hollow in
the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet and by the
light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door i found the latch
and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the
brown opium smoke and terraced with wooden berths like the
forecastle of an emigrant ship

through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying
in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads
thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a
dark lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer out of the black
shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright
now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of
the metal pipes the most lay silent but some muttered to
themselves and others talked together in a strange low
monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then
suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own
thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour at
the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal beside
which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old
man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his elbows upon
his knees staring into the fire

as i entered a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe
for me and a supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth

thank you i have not come to stay said i there is a friend
of mine here mr isa whitney and i wish to speak with him

there was a movement and an exclamation from my right and
peering through the gloom i saw whitney pale haggard and
unkempt staring out at me

my god it's watson said he he was in a pitiable state of
reaction with every nerve in a twitter i say watson what
o'clock is it

nearly eleven

of what day

of friday june th

good heavens i thought it was wednesday it is wednesday what
d'you want to frighten a chap for he sank his face onto his
arms and began to sob in a high treble key

i tell you that it is friday man your wife has been waiting
this two days for you you should be ashamed of yourself

so i am but you've got mixed watson for i have only been here
a few hours three pipes four pipes i forget how many but i'll
go home with you i wouldn't frighten kate poor little kate
give me your hand have you a cab

yes i have one waiting

then i shall go in it but i must owe something find what i
owe watson i am all off colour i can do nothing for myself

i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of
sleepers holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying
fumes of the drug and looking about for the manager as i passed
the tall man who sat by the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my
skirt and a low voice whispered walk past me and then look
back at me the words fell quite distinctly upon my ear i
glanced down they could only have come from the old man at my
side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very
wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between
his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his
fingers i took two steps forward and looked back it took all my
self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
astonishment he had turned his back so that none could see him
but i his form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull
eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and
grinning at my surprise was none other than sherlock holmes he
made a slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he
turned his face half round to the company once more subsided
into a doddering loose-lipped senility

holmes i whispered what on earth are you doing in this den

as low as you can he answered i have excellent ears if you
would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend
of yours i should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with
you

i have a cab outside

then pray send him home in it you may safely trust him for he
appears to be too limp to get into any mischief i should
recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to
say that you have thrown in your lot with me if you will wait
outside i shall be with you in five minutes

it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes requests for
they were always so exceedingly definite and put forward with
such a quiet air of mastery i felt however that when whitney
was once confined in the cab my mission was practically
accomplished and for the rest i could not wish anything better
than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular
adventures which were the normal condition of his existence in a
few minutes i had written my note paid whitney's bill led him
out to the cab and seen him driven through the darkness in a
very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den
and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes for two
streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot
then glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and
burst into a hearty fit of laughter

i suppose watson said he that you imagine that i have added
opium-smoking to cocaine injections and all the other little
weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical
views

i was certainly surprised to find you there

but not more so than i to find you

i came to find a friend

and i to find an enemy

an enemy

yes one of my natural enemies or shall i say my natural
prey briefly watson i am in the midst of a very remarkable
inquiry and i have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent
ramblings of these sots as i have done before now had i been
recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an
hour's purchase for i have used it before now for my own
purposes and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to have
vengeance upon me there is a trap-door at the back of that
building near the corner of paul's wharf which could tell some
strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless
nights

what you do not mean bodies

ay bodies watson we should be rich men if we had pounds
for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den it
is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside and i fear that
neville st clair has entered it never to leave it more but our
trap should be here he put his two forefingers between his
teeth and whistled shrilly a signal which was answered by a
similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle
of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs

now watson said holmes as a tall dog-cart dashed up through
the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from
its side lanterns you'll come with me won't you

if i can be of use

oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still
more so my room at the cedars is a double-bedded one

the cedars

yes that is mr st clair's house i am staying there while i
conduct the inquiry

where is it then

near lee in kent we have a seven-mile drive before us

but i am all in the dark

of course you are you'll know all about it presently jump up
here all right john we shall not need you here's half a
crown look out for me to-morrow about eleven give her her
head so long then

he flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through
the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets which
widened gradually until we were flying across a broad
balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly
beneath us beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and
mortar its silence broken only by the heavy regular footfall of
the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of
revellers a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a
star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of
the clouds holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his
breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought while i sat
beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which
seemed to tax his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in
upon the current of his thoughts we had driven several miles
and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban
villas when he shook himself shrugged his shoulders and lit up
his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he
is acting for the best

you have a grand gift of silence watson said he it makes
you quite invaluable as a companion pon my word it is a great
thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are
not over-pleasant i was wondering what i should say to this dear
little woman to-night when she meets me at the door

you forget that i know nothing about it

i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before
we get to lee it seems absurdly simple and yet somehow i can
get nothing to go upon there's plenty of thread no doubt but i
can't get the end of it into my hand now i'll state the case
clearly and concisely to you watson and maybe you can see a
spark where all is dark to me

proceed then

some years ago to be definite in may there came to lee
a gentleman neville st clair by name who appeared to have
plenty of money he took a large villa laid out the grounds very
nicely and lived generally in good style by degrees he made
friends in the neighbourhood and in he married the daughter
of a local brewer by whom he now has two children he had no
occupation but was interested in several companies and went into
town as a rule in the morning returning by the from cannon
street every night mr st clair is now thirty-seven years of
age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very
affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know
him i may add that his whole debts at the present moment as far
as we have been able to ascertain amount to pounds s while
he has pounds standing to his credit in the capital and
counties bank there is no reason therefore to think that money
troubles have been weighing upon his mind

last monday mr neville st clair went into town rather earlier
than usual remarking before he started that he had two important
commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy
home a box of bricks now by the merest chance his wife
received a telegram upon this same monday very shortly after his
departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable
value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the
offices of the aberdeen shipping company now if you are well up
in your london you will know that the office of the company is
in fresno street which branches out of upper swandam lane where
you found me to-night mrs st clair had her lunch started for
the city did some shopping proceeded to the company's office
got her packet and found herself at exactly walking through
swandam lane on her way back to the station have you followed me
so far

it is very clear

if you remember monday was an exceedingly hot day and mrs st
clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab
as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself
while she was walking in this way down swandam lane she suddenly
heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her
husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning
to her from a second-floor window the window was open and she
distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly
agitated he waved his hands frantically to her and then
vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that
he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind
one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town
in he had on neither collar nor necktie

convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the
steps for the house was none other than the opium den in which
you found me to-night and running through the front room she
attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor at
the foot of the stairs however she met this lascar scoundrel of
whom i have spoken who thrust her back and aided by a dane who
acts as assistant there pushed her out into the street filled
with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the
lane and by rare good-fortune met in fresno street a number of
constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat the
inspector and two men accompanied her back and in spite of the
continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to
the room in which mr st clair had last been seen there was no
sign of him there in fact in the whole of that floor there was
no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who
it seems made his home there both he and the lascar stoutly
swore that no one else had been in the front room during the
afternoon so determined was their denial that the inspector was
staggered and had almost come to believe that mrs st clair had
been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box
which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it out there fell
a cascade of children's bricks it was the toy which he had
promised to bring home

this discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple
showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious
the rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an
abominable crime the front room was plainly furnished as a
sitting-room and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon
the back of one of the wharves between the wharf and the bedroom
window is a narrow strip which is dry at low tide but is covered
at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water the
bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below on
examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill
and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of
the bedroom thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were
all the clothes of mr neville st clair with the exception of
his coat his boots his socks his hat and his watch all were
there there were no signs of violence upon any of these
garments and there were no other traces of mr neville st
clair out of the window he must apparently have gone for no
other exit could be discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon
the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by
swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of
the tragedy

and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately
implicated in the matter the lascar was known to be a man of the
vilest antecedents but as by mrs st clair's story he was
known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few
seconds of her husband's appearance at the window he could
hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime his defence
was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no
knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone his lodger and that he
could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
gentleman's clothes

so much for the lascar manager now for the sinister cripple who
lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was
certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon neville st
clair his name is hugh boone and his hideous face is one which
is familiar to every man who goes much to the city he is a
professional beggar though in order to avoid the police
regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas some
little distance down threadneedle street upon the left-hand
side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the
wall here it is that this creature takes his daily seat
cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap and as he
is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the
greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him i
have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of
making his professional acquaintance and i have been surprised
at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time his
appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him
without observing him a shock of orange hair a pale face
disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has
turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a
pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular
contrast to the colour of his hair all mark him out from amid
the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he
is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be
thrown at him by the passers-by this is the man whom we now
learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been
the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest

but a cripple said i what could he have done single-handed
against a man in the prime of life

he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in
other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man
surely your medical experience would tell you watson that
weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional
strength in the others

pray continue your narrative

mrs st clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the
window and she was escorted home in a cab by the police as her
presence could be of no help to them in their investigations
inspector barton who had charge of the case made a very careful
examination of the premises but without finding anything which
threw any light upon the matter one mistake had been made in not
arresting boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes
during which he might have communicated with his friend the
lascar but this fault was soon remedied and he was seized and
searched without anything being found which could incriminate
him there were it is true some blood-stains upon his right
shirt-sleeve but he pointed to his ring-finger which had been
cut near the nail and explained that the bleeding came from
there adding that he had been to the window not long before and
that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from
the same source he denied strenuously having ever seen mr
neville st clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in
his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police as to
mrs st clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband
at the window he declared that she must have been either mad or
dreaming he was removed loudly protesting to the
police-station while the inspector remained upon the premises in
the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue

and it did though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they
had feared to find it was neville st clair's coat and not
neville st clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded and
what do you think they found in the pockets

i cannot imagine

no i don't think you would guess every pocket stuffed with
pennies and half-pennies pennies and half-pennies it
was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide but a
human body is a different matter there is a fierce eddy between
the wharf and the house it seemed likely enough that the
weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked
away into the river

but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the
room would the body be dressed in a coat alone

no sir but the facts might be met speciously enough suppose
that this man boone had thrust neville st clair through the
window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed
what would he do then it would of course instantly strike him
that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments he would seize
the coat then and be in the act of throwing it out when it
would occur to him that it would swim and not sink he has little
time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried
to force her way up and perhaps he has already heard from his
lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street
there is not an instant to be lost he rushes to some secret
hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he
stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the
pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking he throws it out and
would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard
the rush of steps below and only just had time to close the
window when the police appeared

it certainly sounds feasible

well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a
better boone as i have told you was arrested and taken to the
station but it could not be shown that there had ever before
been anything against him he had for years been known as a
professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very
quiet and innocent one there the matter stands at present and
the questions which have to be solved what neville st clair was
doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is
he now and what hugh boone had to do with his disappearance are
all as far from a solution as ever i confess that i cannot
recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties

while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of
events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great
town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and
we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us
just as he finished however we drove through two scattered
villages where a few lights still glimmered in the windows

we are on the outskirts of lee said my companion we have
touched on three english counties in our short drive starting in
middlesex passing over an angle of surrey and ending in kent
see that light among the trees that is the cedars and beside
that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already i have
little doubt caught the clink of our horse's feet

but why are you not conducting the case from baker street i
asked

because there are many inquiries which must be made out here
mrs st clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and
you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for
my friend and colleague i hate to meet her watson when i have
no news of her husband here we are whoa there whoa

we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its
own grounds a stable-boy had run out to the horse's head and
springing down i followed holmes up the small winding
gravel-drive which led to the house as we approached the door
flew open and a little blonde woman stood in the opening clad
in some sort of light mousseline de soie with a touch of fluffy
pink chiffon at her neck and wrists she stood with her figure
outlined against the flood of light one hand upon the door one
half-raised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head
and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips a standing
question

well she cried well and then seeing that there were two
of us she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw
that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders

no good news

none

no bad

no

thank god for that but come in you must be weary for you have
had a long day

this is my friend dr watson he has been of most vital use to
me in several of my cases and a lucky chance has made it
possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this
investigation

i am delighted to see you said she pressing my hand warmly
you will i am sure forgive anything that may be wanting in our
arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so
suddenly upon us

my dear madam said i i am an old campaigner and if i were
not i can very well see that no apology is needed if i can be of
any assistance either to you or to my friend here i shall be
indeed happy

now mr sherlock holmes said the lady as we entered a
well-lit dining-room upon the table of which a cold supper had
been laid out i should very much like to ask you one or two
plain questions to which i beg that you will give a plain
answer

certainly madam

do not trouble about my feelings i am not hysterical nor given
to fainting i simply wish to hear your real real opinion

upon what point

in your heart of hearts do you think that neville is alive

sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question
frankly now she repeated standing upon the rug and looking
keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair

frankly then madam i do not

you think that he is dead

i do

murdered

i don't say that perhaps

and on what day did he meet his death

on monday

then perhaps mr holmes you will be good enough to explain how
it is that i have received a letter from him to-day

sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been
galvanised

what he roared

yes to-day she stood smiling holding up a little slip of
paper in the air

may i see it

certainly

he snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out
upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently i
had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder the
envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend
postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day
before for it was considerably after midnight

coarse writing murmured holmes surely this is not your
husband's writing madam

no but the enclosure is

i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go
and inquire as to the address

how can you tell that

the name you see is in perfectly black ink which has dried
itself the rest is of the greyish colour which shows that
blotting-paper has been used if it had been written straight
off and then blotted none would be of a deep black shade this
man has written the name and there has then been a pause before
he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not
familiar with it it is of course a trifle but there is
nothing so important as trifles let us now see the letter ha
there has been an enclosure here

yes there was a ring his signet-ring

and you are sure that this is your husband's hand

one of his hands

one

his hand when he wrote hurriedly it is very unlike his usual
writing and yet i know it well

dearest do not be frightened all will come well there is a
huge error which it may take some little time to rectify
wait in patience neville written in pencil upon the fly-leaf
of a book octavo size no water-mark hum posted to-day in
gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb ha and the flap has been
gummed if i am not very much in error by a person who had been
chewing tobacco and you have no doubt that it is your husband's
hand madam

none neville wrote those words

and they were posted to-day at gravesend well mrs st clair
the clouds lighten though i should not venture to say that the
danger is over

but he must be alive mr holmes

unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent
the ring after all proves nothing it may have been taken from
him

no no it is it is his very own writing

very well it may however have been written on monday and only
posted to-day

that is possible

if so much may have happened between

oh you must not discourage me mr holmes i know that all is
well with him there is so keen a sympathy between us that i
should know if evil came upon him on the very day that i saw him
last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet i in the dining-room
rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that
something had happened do you think that i would respond to such
a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death

i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman
may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical
reasoner and in this letter you certainly have a very strong
piece of evidence to corroborate your view but if your husband
is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away
from you

i cannot imagine it is unthinkable

and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you

no

and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane

very much so

was the window open

yes

then he might have called to you

he might

he only as i understand gave an inarticulate cry

yes

a call for help you thought

yes he waved his hands

but it might have been a cry of surprise astonishment at the
unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands

it is possible

and you thought he was pulled back

he disappeared so suddenly

he might have leaped back you did not see anyone else in the
room

no but this horrible man confessed to having been there and
the lascar was at the foot of the stairs

quite so your husband as far as you could see had his
ordinary clothes on

but without his collar or tie i distinctly saw his bare
throat

had he ever spoken of swandam lane

never

had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium

never

thank you mrs st clair those are the principal points about
which i wished to be absolutely clear we shall now have a little
supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day
to-morrow

a large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our
disposal and i was quickly between the sheets for i was weary
after my night of adventure sherlock holmes was a man however
who when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind would go for
days and even for a week without rest turning it over
rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view
until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his
data were insufficient it was soon evident to me that he was now
preparing for an all-night sitting he took off his coat and
waistcoat put on a large blue dressing-gown and then wandered
about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from
the sofa and armchairs with these he constructed a sort of
eastern divan upon which he perched himself cross-legged with
an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front
of him in the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there an
old briar pipe between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the
corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him
silent motionless with the light shining upon his strong-set
aquiline features so he sat as i dropped off to sleep and so he
sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up and i found
the summer sun shining into the apartment the pipe was still
between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was
full of a dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap of
shag which i had seen upon the previous night

awake watson he asked

yes

game for a morning drive

certainly

then dress no one is stirring yet but i know where the
stable-boy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap out he
chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed
a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night

as i dressed i glanced at my watch it was no wonder that no one
was stirring it was twenty-five minutes past four i had hardly
finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was
putting in the horse

i want to test a little theory of mine said he pulling on his
boots i think watson that you are now standing in the
presence of one of the most absolute fools in europe i deserve
to be kicked from here to charing cross but i think i have the
key of the affair now

and where is it i asked smiling

in the bathroom he answered oh yes i am not joking he
continued seeing my look of incredulity i have just been
there and i have taken it out and i have got it in this
gladstone bag come on my boy and we shall see whether it will
not fit the lock

we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into
the bright morning sunshine in the road stood our horse and
trap with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head we both
sprang in and away we dashed down the london road a few country
carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but
the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as
some city in a dream

it has been in some points a singular case said holmes
flicking the horse on into a gallop i confess that i have been
as blind as a mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than
never to learn it at all

in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily
from their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey
side passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the
river and dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the
right and found ourselves in bow street sherlock holmes was well
known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted
him one of them held the horse's head while the other led us in

who is on duty asked holmes

inspector bradstreet sir

ah bradstreet how are you a tall stout official had come
down the stone-flagged passage in a peaked cap and frogged
jacket i wish to have a quiet word with you bradstreet
certainly mr holmes step into my room here it was a small
office-like room with a huge ledger upon the table and a
telephone projecting from the wall the inspector sat down at his
desk

what can i do for you mr holmes

i called about that beggarman boone the one who was charged
with being concerned in the disappearance of mr neville st
clair of lee

yes he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries

so i heard you have him here

in the cells

is he quiet

oh he gives no trouble but he is a dirty scoundrel

dirty

yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his
face is as black as a tinker's well when once his case has been
settled he will have a regular prison bath and i think if you
saw him you would agree with me that he needed it

i should like to see him very much

would you that is easily done come this way you can leave
your bag

no i think that i'll take it

very good come this way if you please he led us down a
passage opened a barred door passed down a winding stair and
brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each
side

the third on the right is his said the inspector here it
is he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door
and glanced through

he is asleep said he you can see him very well

we both put our eyes to the grating the prisoner lay with his
face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing slowly and
heavily he was a middle-sized man coarsely clad as became his
calling with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his
tattered coat he was as the inspector had said extremely
dirty but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its
repulsive ugliness a broad wheal from an old scar ran right
across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up
one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were exposed in a
perpetual snarl a shock of very bright red hair grew low over
his eyes and forehead

he's a beauty isn't he said the inspector

he certainly needs a wash remarked holmes i had an idea that
he might and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me
he opened the gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my
astonishment a very large bath-sponge

he he you are a funny one chuckled the inspector

now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable
figure

well i don't know why not said the inspector he doesn't
look a credit to the bow street cells does he he slipped his
key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell the
sleeper half turned and then settled down once more into a deep
slumber holmes stooped to the water-jug moistened his sponge
and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the
prisoner's face

let me introduce you he shouted to mr neville st clair of
lee in the county of kent

never in my life have i seen such a sight the man's face peeled
off under the sponge like the bark from a tree gone was the
coarse brown tint gone too was the horrid scar which had
seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the
repulsive sneer to the face a twitch brought away the tangled
red hair and there sitting up in his bed was a pale
sad-faced refined-looking man black-haired and smooth-skinned
rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment
then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream and
threw himself down with his face to the pillow

great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing
man i know him from the photograph

the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons
himself to his destiny be it so said he and pray what am i
charged with

with making away with mr neville st oh come you can't be
charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of
it said the inspector with a grin well i have been
twenty-seven years in the force but this really takes the cake

if i am mr neville st clair then it is obvious that no crime
has been committed and that therefore i am illegally
detained

no crime but a very great error has been committed said
holmes you would have done better to have trusted your wife

it was not the wife it was the children groaned the prisoner
god help me i would not have them ashamed of their father my
god what an exposure what can i do

sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him
kindly on the shoulder

if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up said
he of course you can hardly avoid publicity on the other hand
if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible
case against you i do not know that there is any reason that the
details should find their way into the papers inspector
bradstreet would i am sure make notes upon anything which you
might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities the case
would then never go into court at all

god bless you cried the prisoner passionately i would have
endured imprisonment ay even execution rather than have left
my miserable secret as a family blot to my children

you are the first who have ever heard my story my father was a
schoolmaster in chesterfield where i received an excellent
education i travelled in my youth took to the stage and
finally became a reporter on an evening paper in london one day
my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the
metropolis and i volunteered to supply them there was the point
from which all my adventures started it was only by trying
begging as an amateur that i could get the facts upon which to
base my articles when an actor i had of course learned all the
secrets of making up and had been famous in the green-room for
my skill i took advantage now of my attainments i painted my
face and to make myself as pitiable as possible i made a good
scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a
small slip of flesh-coloured plaster then with a red head of
hair and an appropriate dress i took my station in the business
part of the city ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a
beggar for seven hours i plied my trade and when i returned
home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no
less than s d

i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until
some time later i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ
served upon me for pounds i was at my wit's end where to get
the money but a sudden idea came to me i begged a fortnight's
grace from the creditor asked for a holiday from my employers
and spent the time in begging in the city under my disguise in
ten days i had the money and had paid the debt

well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous
work at pounds a week when i knew that i could earn as much in
a day by smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on
the ground and sitting still it was a long fight between my
pride and the money but the dollars won at last and i threw up
reporting and sat day after day in the corner which i had first
chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets
with coppers only one man knew my secret he was the keeper of a
low den in which i used to lodge in swandam lane where i could
every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings
transform myself into a well-dressed man about town this fellow
a lascar was well paid by me for his rooms so that i knew that
my secret was safe in his possession

well very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of
money i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london
could earn pounds a year which is less than my average
takings but i had exceptional advantages in my power of making
up and also in a facility of repartee which improved by
practice and made me quite a recognised character in the city
all day a stream of pennies varied by silver poured in upon me
and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take pounds

as i grew richer i grew more ambitious took a house in the
country and eventually married without anyone having a
suspicion as to my real occupation my dear wife knew that i had
business in the city she little knew what

last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my
room above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw
to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the
street with her eyes fixed full upon me i gave a cry of
surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my
confidant the lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from
coming up to me i heard her voice downstairs but i knew that
she could not ascend swiftly i threw off my clothes pulled on
those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig even a wife's
eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise but then it
occurred to me that there might be a search in the room and that
the clothes might betray me i threw open the window reopening
by my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in
the bedroom that morning then i seized my coat which was
weighted by the coppers which i had just transferred to it from
the leather bag in which i carried my takings i hurled it out of
the window and it disappeared into the thames the other clothes
would have followed but at that moment there was a rush of
constables up the stair and a few minutes after i found rather
i confess to my relief that instead of being identified as mr
neville st clair i was arrested as his murderer

i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain i
was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and
hence my preference for a dirty face knowing that my wife would
be terribly anxious i slipped off my ring and confided it to the
lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together
with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to
fear

that note only reached her yesterday said holmes

good god what a week she must have spent

the police have watched this lascar said inspector bradstreet
and i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to
post a letter unobserved probably he handed it to some sailor
customer of his who forgot all about it for some days

that was it said holmes nodding approvingly i have no doubt
of it but have you never been prosecuted for begging

many times but what was a fine to me

it must stop here however said bradstreet if the police are
to hush this thing up there must be no more of hugh boone

i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take

in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps
may be taken but if you are found again then all must come out
i am sure mr holmes that we are very much indebted to you for
having cleared the matter up i wish i knew how you reach your
results

i reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five
pillows and consuming an ounce of shag i think watson that if
we drive to baker street we shall just be in time for breakfast



vii the adventure of the blue carbuncle

i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second
morning after christmas with the intention of wishing him the
compliments of the season he was lounging upon the sofa in a
purple dressing-gown a pipe-rack within his reach upon the
right and a pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly
studied near at hand beside the couch was a wooden chair and
on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable
hard-felt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several
places a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
purpose of examination

you are engaged said i perhaps i interrupt you

not at all i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss
my results the matter is a perfectly trivial one he jerked his
thumb in the direction of the old hat but there are points in
connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and
even of instruction

i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows
were thick with the ice crystals i suppose i remarked that
homely as it looks this thing has some deadly story linked on to
it that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of
some mystery and the punishment of some crime

no no no crime said sherlock holmes laughing only one of
those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have
four million human beings all jostling each other within the
space of a few square miles amid the action and reaction of so
dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events
may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be
presented which may be striking and bizarre without being
criminal we have already had experience of such

so much so i remarked that of the last six cases which i
have added to my notes three have been entirely free of any
legal crime

precisely you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler
papers to the singular case of miss mary sutherland and to the
adventure of the man with the twisted lip well i have no doubt
that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category
you know peterson the commissionaire

yes

it is to him that this trophy belongs

it is his hat

no no he found it its owner is unknown i beg that you will
look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual
problem and first as to how it came here it arrived upon
christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is i
have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of peterson's
fire the facts are these about four o'clock on christmas
morning peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was
returning from some small jollification and was making his way
homeward down tottenham court road in front of him he saw in
the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and
carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder as he reached the
corner of goodge street a row broke out between this stranger
and a little knot of roughs one of the latter knocked off the
man's hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and
swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him
peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his
assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and
seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him
dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the
labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of tottenham
court road the roughs had also fled at the appearance of
peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of
battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this
battered hat and a most unimpeachable christmas goose

which surely he restored to their owner

my dear fellow there lies the problem it is true that for
mrs henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to
the bird's left leg and it is also true that the initials h
b are legible upon the lining of this hat but as there are
some thousands of bakers and some hundreds of henry bakers in
this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any
one of them

what then did peterson do

he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning
knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me
the goose we retained until this morning when there were signs
that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it
should be eaten without unnecessary delay its finder has carried
it off therefore to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose
while i continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who
lost his christmas dinner

did he not advertise

no

then what clue could you have as to his identity

only as much as we can deduce

from his hat

precisely

but you are joking what can you gather from this old battered
felt

here is my lens you know my methods what can you gather
yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this
article

i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
ruefully it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round
shape hard and much the worse for wear the lining had been of
red silk but was a good deal discoloured there was no maker's
name but as holmes had remarked the initials h b were
scrawled upon one side it was pierced in the brim for a
hat-securer but the elastic was missing for the rest it was
cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places
although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
discoloured patches by smearing them with ink

i can see nothing said i handing it back to my friend

on the contrary watson you can see everything you fail
however to reason from what you see you are too timid in
drawing your inferences

then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat

he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective
fashion which was characteristic of him it is perhaps less
suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there
are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others
which represent at least a strong balance of probability that
the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the
face of it and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the
last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days he
had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a
moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his
fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink
at work upon him this may account also for the obvious fact that
his wife has ceased to love him

my dear holmes

he has however retained some degree of self-respect he
continued disregarding my remonstrance he is a man who leads a
sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is
middle-aged has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the
last few days and which he anoints with lime-cream these are
the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat also
by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid
on in his house

you are certainly joking holmes

not in the least is it possible that even now when i give you
these results you are unable to see how they are attained

i have no doubt that i am very stupid but i must confess that i
am unable to follow you for example how did you deduce that
this man was intellectual

for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head it came right
over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose it is
a question of cubic capacity said he a man with so large a
brain must have something in it

the decline of his fortunes then

this hat is three years old these flat brims curled at the edge
came in then it is a hat of the 
very best quality look at the
band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining if this man could
afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no
hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world

well that is clear enough certainly but how about the
foresight and the moral retrogression

sherlock holmes laughed here is the foresight said he putting
his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer
they are never sold upon hats if this man ordered one it is a
sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his
way to take this precaution against the wind but since we see
that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace
it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly
which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature on the other
hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the
felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not
entirely lost his self-respect

your reasoning is certainly plausible

the further points that he is middle-aged that his hair is
grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses
lime-cream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the
lower part of the lining the lens discloses a large number of
hair-ends clean cut by the scissors of the barber they all
appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of
lime-cream this dust you will observe is not the gritty grey
dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house
showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while
the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the
wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be in
the best of training

but his wife you said that she had ceased to love him

this hat has not been brushed for weeks when i see you my dear
watson with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat and
when your wife allows you to go out in such a state i shall fear
that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's
affection

but he might be a bachelor

nay he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his
wife remember the card upon the bird's leg

you have an answer to everything but how on earth do you deduce
that the gas is not laid on in his house

one tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when i
see no less than five i think that there can be little doubt
that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with
burning tallow walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in
one hand and a guttering candle in the other anyhow he never
got tallow-stains from a gas-jet are you satisfied

well it is very ingenious said i laughing but since as
you said just now there has been no crime committed and no harm
done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a
waste of energy

sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew
open and peterson the commissionaire rushed into the apartment
with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with
astonishment

the goose mr holmes the goose sir he gasped

eh what of it then has it returned to life and flapped off
through the kitchen window holmes twisted himself round upon
the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face

see here sir see what my wife found in its crop he held out
his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
scintillating blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but
of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric
point in the dark hollow of his hand

sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle by jove peterson said
he this is treasure trove indeed i suppose you know what you
have got

a diamond sir a precious stone it cuts into glass as though
it were putty

it's more than a precious stone it is the precious stone

not the countess of morcar's blue carbuncle i ejaculated

precisely so i ought to know its size and shape seeing that i
have read the advertisement about it in the times every day
lately it is absolutely unique and its value can only be
conjectured but the reward offered of pounds is certainly
not within a twentieth part of the market price

a thousand pounds great lord of mercy the commissionaire
plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us

that is the reward and i have reason to know that there are
sentimental considerations in the background which would induce
the countess to part with half her fortune if she could but
recover the gem

it was lost if i remember aright at the hotel cosmopolitan i
remarked

precisely so on december nd just five days ago john horner
a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's
jewel-case the evidence against him was so strong that the case
has been referred to the assizes i have some account of the
matter here i believe he rummaged amid his newspapers
glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out
doubled it over and read the following paragraph

hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery john horner plumber was
brought up upon the charge of having upon the nd inst
abstracted from the jewel-case of the countess of morcar the
valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle james ryder
upper-attendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect
that he had shown horner up to the dressing-room of the countess
of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might
solder the second bar of the grate which was loose he had
remained with horner some little time but had finally been
called away on returning he found that horner had disappeared
that the bureau had been forced open and that the small morocco
casket in which as it afterwards transpired the countess was
accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the
dressing-table ryder instantly gave the alarm and horner was
arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found
either upon his person or in his rooms catherine cusack maid to
the countess deposed to having heard ryder's cry of dismay on
discovering the robbery and to having rushed into the room
where she found matters as described by the last witness
inspector bradstreet b division gave evidence as to the arrest
of horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence
in the strongest terms evidence of a previous conviction for
robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate
refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to
the assizes horner who had shown signs of intense emotion
during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was
carried out of court

hum so much for the police-court said holmes thoughtfully
tossing aside the paper the question for us now to solve is the
sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to
the crop of a goose in tottenham court road at the other you
see watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much
more important and less innocent aspect here is the stone the
stone came from the goose and the goose came from mr henry
baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other
characteristics with which i have bored you so now we must set
ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and
ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery to
do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie
undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers if
this fail i shall have recourse to other methods

what will you say

give me a pencil and that slip of paper now then found at
the corner of goodge street a goose and a black felt hat mr
henry baker can have the same by applying at this evening at
b baker street that is clear and concise

very but will he see it

well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor
man the loss was a heavy one he was clearly so scared by his
mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of peterson
that he thought of nothing but flight but since then he must
have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his
bird then again the introduction of his name will cause him to
see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to
it here you are peterson run down to the advertising agency
and have this put in the evening papers

in which sir

oh in the globe star pall mall st james's evening news
standard echo and any others that occur to you

very well sir and this stone

ah yes i shall keep the stone thank you and i say
peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here
with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place
of the one which your family is now devouring

when the commissionaire had gone holmes took up the stone and
held it against the light it's a bonny thing said he just
see how it glints and sparkles of course it is a nucleus and
focus of crime every good stone is they are the devil's pet
baits in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a
bloody deed this stone is not yet twenty years old it was found
in the banks of the amoy river in southern china and is remarkable
in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is
blue in shade instead of ruby red in spite of its youth it has
already a sinister history there have been two murders a
vitriol-throwing a suicide and several robberies brought about
for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal
who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the
gallows and the prison i'll lock it up in my strong box now and
drop a line to the countess to say that we have it

do you think that this man horner is innocent

i cannot tell

well then do you imagine that this other one henry baker had
anything to do with the matter

it is i think much more likely that henry baker is an
absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird which he
was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made
of solid gold that however i shall determine by a very simple
test if we have an answer to our advertisement

and you can do nothing until then

nothing

in that case i shall continue my professional round but i shall
come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for i
should like to see the solution of so tangled a business

very glad to see you i dine at seven there is a woodcock i
believe by the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps i
ought to ask mrs hudson to examine its crop

i had been delayed at a case and it was a little after half-past
six when i found myself in baker street once more as i
approached the house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a
coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the
bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight just as i
arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to
holmes room

mr henry baker i believe said he rising from his armchair
and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he
could so readily assume pray take this chair by the fire mr
baker it is a cold night and i observe that your circulation is
more adapted for summer than for winter ah watson you have
just come at the right time is that your hat mr baker

yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat

he was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a
broad intelligent face sloping down to a pointed beard of
grizzled brown a touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight
tremor of his extended hand recalled holmes surmise as to his
habits his rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in
front with the collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded
from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt he spoke in a
slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the
impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had
ill-usage at the hands of fortune

we have retained these things for some days said holmes
because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your
address i am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise

our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh shillings have not
been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked i had
no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off
both my hat and the bird i did not care to spend more money in a
hopeless attempt at recovering them

very naturally by the way about the bird we were compelled to
eat it

to eat it our visitor half rose from his chair in his
excitement

yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so
but i presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is
about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your
purpose equally well

oh certainly certainly answered mr baker with a sigh of
relief

of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of
your own bird so if you wish 

the man burst into a hearty laugh they might be useful to me as
relics of my adventure said he but beyond that i can hardly
see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are
going to be to me no sir i think that with your permission i
will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive
upon the sideboard

sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug
of his shoulders

there is your hat then and there your bird said he by the
way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one
from i am somewhat of a fowl fancier and i have seldom seen a
better grown goose

certainly sir said baker who had risen and tucked his newly
gained property under his arm there are a few of us who
frequent the alpha inn near the museum we are to be found in
the museum itself during the day you understand this year our
good host windigate by name instituted a goose club by which
on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to
receive a bird at christmas my pence were duly paid and the
rest is familiar to you i am much indebted to you sir for a
scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity with
a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
strode off upon his way

so much for mr henry baker said holmes when he had closed the
door behind him it is quite certain that he knows nothing
whatever about the matter are you hungry watson

not particularly

then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow
up this clue while it is still hot

by all means

it was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped
cravats about our throats outside the stars were shining coldly
in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passers-by blew out
into smoke like so many pistol shots our footfalls rang out
crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter
wimpole street harley street and so through wigmore street into
oxford street in a quarter of an hour we were in bloomsbury at
the alpha inn which is a small public-house at the corner of one
of the streets which runs down into holborn holmes pushed open
the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from
the ruddy-faced white-aproned landlord

your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese
said he

my geese the man seemed surprised

yes i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr henry baker
who was a member of your goose club

ah yes i see but you see sir them's not our geese

indeed whose then

well i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden

indeed i know some of them which was it

breckinridge is his name

ah i don't know him well here's your good health landlord
and prosperity to your house good-night

now for mr breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat
as we came out into the frosty air remember watson that though
we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we
have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal
servitude unless we can establish his innocence it is possible
that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we
have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police
and which a singular chance has placed in our hands let us
follow it out to the bitter end faces to the south then and
quick march

we passed across holborn down endell street and so through a
zigzag of slums to covent garden market one of the largest
stalls bore the name of breckinridge upon it and the proprietor
a horsey-looking man with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was
helping a boy to put up the shutters

good-evening it's a cold night said holmes

the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my
companion

sold out of geese i see continued holmes pointing at the
bare slabs of marble

let you have five hundred to-morrow morning

that's no good

well there are some on the stall with the gas-flare

ah but i was recommended to you

who by

the landlord of the alpha

oh yes i sent him a couple of dozen

fine birds they were too now where did you get them from

to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the
salesman

now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms
akimbo what are you driving at let's have it straight now

it is straight enough i should like to know who sold you the
geese which you supplied to the alpha

well then i shan't tell you so now

oh it is a matter of no importance but i don't know why you
should be so warm over such a trifle

warm you'd be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as i am
when i pay good money for a good article there should be an end
of the business but it's where are the geese and who did you
sell the geese to and what will you take for the geese one
would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the
fuss that is made over them

well i have no connection with any other people who have been
making inquiries said holmes carelessly if you won't tell us
the bet is off that is all but i'm always ready to back my
opinion on a matter of fowls and i have a fiver on it that the
bird i ate is country bred

well then you've lost your fiver for it's town bred snapped
the salesman

it's nothing of the kind

i say it is

i don't believe it

d'you think you know more about fowls than i who have handled
them ever since i was a nipper i tell you all those birds that
went to the alpha were town bred

you'll never persuade me to believe that

will you bet then

it's merely taking your money for i know that i am right but
i'll have a sovereign on with you just to teach you not to be
obstinate

the salesman chuckled grimly bring me the books bill said
he

the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
greasy-backed one laying them out together beneath the hanging
lamp

now then mr cocksure said the salesman i thought that i
was out of geese but before i finish you'll find that there is
still one left in my shop you see this little book

well

that's the list of the folk from whom i buy d'you see well
then here on this page are the country folk and the numbers
after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger
now then you see this other page in red ink well that is a
list of my town suppliers now look at that third name just
read it out to me

mrs oakshott brixton road read holmes

quite so now turn that up in the ledger

holmes turned to the page indicated here you are mrs
oakshott brixton road egg and poultry supplier

now then what's the last entry

december nd twenty-four geese at s d

quite so there you are and underneath

sold to mr windigate of the alpha at s

what have you to say now

sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined he drew a sovereign from
his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the
air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words a few yards off
he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty noiseless
fashion which was peculiar to him

when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the pink un
protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet
said he i daresay that if i had put pounds down in front of
him that man would not have given me such complete information
as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a
wager well watson we are i fancy nearing the end of our
quest and the only point which remains to be determined is
whether we should go on to this mrs oakshott to-night or
whether we should reserve it for to-morrow it is clear from what
that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves
who are anxious about the matter and i should 

his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke
out from the stall which we had just left turning round we saw a
little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of
yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while
breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was
shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure

i've had enough of you and your geese he shouted i wish you
were all at the devil together if you come pestering me any more
with your silly talk i'll set the dog at you you bring mrs
oakshott here and i'll answer her but what have you to do with
it did i buy the geese off you

no but one of them was mine all the same whined the little
man

well then ask mrs oakshott for it

she told me to ask you

well you can ask the king of proosia for all i care i've had
enough of it get out of this he rushed fiercely forward and
the inquirer flitted away into the darkness

ha this may save us a visit to brixton road whispered holmes
come with me and we will see what is to be made of this
fellow striding through the scattered knots of people who
lounged round the flaring stalls my companion speedily overtook
the little man and touched him upon the shoulder he sprang
round and i could see in the gas-light that every vestige of
colour had been driven from his face

who are you then what do you want he asked in a quavering
voice

you will excuse me said holmes blandly but i could not help
overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now
i think that i could be of assistance to you

you who are you how could you know anything of the matter

my name is sherlock holmes it is my business to know what other
people don't know

but you can know nothing of this

excuse me i know everything of it you are endeavouring to
trace some geese which were sold by mrs oakshott of brixton
road to a salesman named breckinridge by him in turn to mr
windigate of the alpha and by him to his club of which mr
henry baker is a member

oh sir you are the very man whom i have longed to meet cried
the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers
i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter

sherlock holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing in that
case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this
wind-swept market-place said he but pray tell me before we
go farther who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting

the man hesitated for an instant my name is john robinson he
answered with a sidelong glance

no no the real name said holmes sweetly it is always
awkward doing business with an alias

a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger well then
said he my real name is james ryder

precisely so head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan pray
step into the cab and i shall soon be able to tell you
everything which you would wish to know

the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
half-frightened half-hopeful eyes as one who is not sure
whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe
then he stepped into the cab and in half an hour we were back in
the sitting-room at baker street nothing had been said during
our drive but the high thin breathing of our new companion and
the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous
tension within him

here we are said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room
the fire looks very seasonable in this weather you look cold
mr ryder pray take the basket-chair i will just put on my
slippers before we settle this little matter of yours now then
you want to know what became of those geese

yes sir

or rather i fancy of that goose it was one bird i imagine in
which you were interested white with a black bar across the
tail

ryder quivered with emotion oh sir he cried can you tell
me where it went to

it came here

here

yes and a most remarkable bird it proved i don't wonder that
you should take an interest in it it laid an egg after it was
dead the bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen
i have it here in my museum

our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece
with his right hand holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up
the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold
brilliant many-pointed radiance ryder stood glaring with a
drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it

the game's up ryder said holmes quietly hold up man or
you'll be into the fire give him an arm back into his chair
watson he's not got blood enough to go in for felony with
impunity give him a dash of brandy so now he looks a little
more human what a shrimp it is to be sure

for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy
brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and he sat staring
with frightened eyes at his accuser

i have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which i
could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me
still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case
complete you had heard ryder of this blue stone of the
countess of morcar's

it was catherine cusack who told me of it said he in a
crackling voice

i see her ladyship's waiting-maid well the temptation of
sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has
been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous
in the means you used it seems to me ryder that there is the
making of a very pretty villain in you you knew that this man
horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter
before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him
what did you do then you made some small job in my lady's
room you and your confederate cusack and you managed that he
should be the man sent for then when he had left you rifled
the jewel-case raised the alarm and had this unfortunate man
arrested you then 

ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
companion's knees for god's sake have mercy he shrieked
think of my father of my mother it would break their hearts i
never went wrong before i never will again i swear it i'll
swear it on a bible oh don't bring it into court for christ's
sake don't

get back into your chair said holmes sternly it is very well
to cringe and crawl now but you thought little enough of this
poor horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing

i will fly mr holmes i will leave the country sir then the
charge against him will break down

hum we will talk about that and now let us hear a true account
of the next act how came the stone into the goose and how came
the goose into the open market tell us the truth for there lies
your only hope of safety

ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips i will tell you
it just as it happened sir said he when horner had been
arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get
away with the stone at once for i did not know at what moment
the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my
room there was no place about the hotel where it would be safe
i went out as if on some commission and i made for my sister's
house she had married a man named oakshott and lived in brixton
road where she fattened fowls for the market all the way there
every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective
and for all that it was a cold night the sweat was pouring down
my face before i came to the brixton road my sister asked me
what was the matter and why i was so pale but i told her that i
had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel then i went
into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would
be best to do

i had a friend once called maudsley who went to the bad and
has just been serving his time in pentonville one day he had met
me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they
could get rid of what they stole i knew that he would be true to
me for i knew one or two things about him so i made up my mind
to go right on to kilburn where he lived and take him into my
confidence he would show me how to turn the stone into money
but how to get to him in safety i thought of the agonies i had
gone through in coming from the hotel i might at any moment be
seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat
pocket i was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at
the geese which were waddling about round my feet and suddenly
an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the
best detective that ever lived

my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the
pick of her geese for a christmas present and i knew that she
was always as good as her word i would take my goose now and in
it i would carry my stone to kilburn there was a little shed in
the yard and behind this i drove one of the birds a fine big
one white with a barred tail i caught it and prying its bill
open i thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger
could reach the bird gave a gulp and i felt the stone pass
along its gullet and down into its crop but the creature flapped
and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the
matter as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and
fluttered off among the others

whatever were you doing with that bird jem says she

well said i you said you'd give me one for christmas and i
was feeling which was the fattest

oh says she we've set yours aside for you jem's bird we
call it it's the big white one over yonder there's twenty-six
of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen
for the market

thank you maggie says i but if it is all the same to you
i'd rather have that one i was handling just now

the other is a good three pound heavier said she and we
fattened it expressly for you

never mind i'll have the other and i'll take it now said i

oh just as you like said she a little huffed which is it
you want then

that white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the
flock

oh very well kill it and take it with you

well i did what she said mr holmes and i carried the bird
all the way to kilburn i told my pal what i had done for he was
a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to he laughed
until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose my
heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and i
knew that some terrible mistake had occurred i left the bird
rushed back to my sister's and hurried into the back yard there
was not a bird to be seen there

where are they all maggie i cried

gone to the dealer's jem

which dealer's

breckinridge of covent garden

but was there another with a barred tail i asked the same
as the one i chose

yes jem there were two barred-tailed ones and i could never
tell them apart

well then of course i saw it all and i ran off as hard as my
feet would carry me to this man breckinridge but he had sold the
lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they
had gone you heard him yourselves to-night well he has always
answered me like that my sister thinks that i am going mad
sometimes i think that i am myself and now and now i am myself
a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which
i sold my character god help me god help me he burst into
convulsive sobbing with his face buried in his hands

there was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and
by the measured tapping of sherlock holmes finger-tips upon the
edge of the table then my friend rose and threw open the door

get out said he

what sir oh heaven bless you

no more words get out

and no more words were needed there was a rush a clatter upon
the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running
footfalls from the street

after all watson said holmes reaching up his hand for his
clay pipe i am not retained by the police to supply their
deficiencies if horner were in danger it would be another thing
but this fellow will not appear against him and the case must
collapse i suppose that i am commuting a felony but it is just
possible that i am saving a soul this fellow will not go wrong
again he is too terribly frightened send him to gaol now and
you make him a gaol-bird for life besides it is the season of
forgiveness chance has put in our way a most singular and
whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward if you
will have the goodness to touch the bell doctor we will begin
another investigation in which also a bird will be the chief
feature



viii the adventure of the speckled band

on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i
have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend
sherlock holmes i find many tragic some comic a large number
merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did
rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of
wealth he refused to associate himself with any investigation
which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic
of all these varied cases however i cannot recall any which
presented more singular features than that which was associated
with the well-known surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran
the events in question occurred in the early days of my
association with holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors
in baker street it is possible that i might have placed them
upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the
time from which i have only been freed during the last month by
the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given it
is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for i
have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the
death of dr grimesby roylott which tend to make the matter even
more terrible than the truth

it was early in april in the year that i woke one morning to
find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my
bed he was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the
mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven i
blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little
resentment for i was myself regular in my habits

very sorry to knock you up watson said he but it's the
common lot this morning mrs hudson has been knocked up she
retorted upon me and i on you

what is it then a fire

no a client it seems that a young lady has arrived in a
considerable state of excitement who insists upon seeing me she
is waiting now in the sitting-room now when young ladies wander
about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock
sleepy people up out of their beds i presume that it is
something very pressing which they have to communicate should it
prove to be an interesting case you would i am sure wish to
follow it from the outset i thought at any rate that i should
call you and give you the chance

my dear fellow i would not miss it for anything

i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his
professional investigations and in admiring the rapid
deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a
logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were
submitted to him i rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in
a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room a
lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in
the window rose as we entered

good-morning madam said holmes cheerily my name is sherlock
holmes this is my intimate friend and associate dr watson
before whom you can speak as freely as before myself ha i am
glad to see that mrs hudson has had the good sense to light the
fire pray draw up to it and i shall order you a cup of hot
coffee for i observe that you are shivering

it is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low
voice changing her seat as requested

what then

it is fear mr holmes it is terror she raised her veil as
she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable
state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless
frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal her features
and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot
with premature grey and her expression was weary and haggard
sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick
all-comprehensive glances

you must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and
patting her forearm we shall soon set matters right i have no
doubt you have come in by train this morning i see

you know me then

no but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm
of your left glove you must have started early and yet you had
a good drive in a dog-cart along heavy roads before you reached
the station

the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my
companion

there is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling the left
arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven
places the marks are perfectly fresh there is no vehicle save a
dog-cart which throws up mud in that way and then only when you
sit on the left-hand side of the driver

whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said
she i started from home before six reached leatherhead at
twenty past and came in by the first train to waterloo sir i
can stand this strain no longer i shall go mad if it continues
i have no one to turn to none save only one who cares for me
and he poor fellow can be of little aid i have heard of you
mr holmes i have heard of you from mrs farintosh whom you
helped in the hour of her sore need it was from her that i had
your address oh sir do you not think that you could help me
too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness
which surrounds me at present it is out of my power to reward
you for your services but in a month or six weeks i shall be
married with the control of my own income and then at least you
shall not find me ungrateful

holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small
case-book which he consulted

farintosh said he ah yes i recall the case it was
concerned with an opal tiara i think it was before your time
watson i can only say madam that i shall be happy to devote
the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend as to
reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty
to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which
suits you best and now i beg that you will lay before us
everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the
matter

alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation
lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my suspicions
depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to
another that even he to whom of all others i have a right to
look for help and advice looks upon all that i tell him about it
as the fancies of a nervous woman he does not say so but i can
read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes but i have
heard mr holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold
wickedness of the human heart you may advise me how to walk amid
the dangers which encompass me

i am all attention madam

my name is helen stoner and i am living with my stepfather who
is the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in
england the roylotts of stoke moran on the western border of
surrey

holmes nodded his head the name is familiar to me said he

the family was at one time among the richest in england and the
estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north
and hampshire in the west in the last century however four
successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition
and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the
days of the regency nothing was left save a few acres of ground
and the two-hundred-year-old house which is itself crushed under
a heavy mortgage the last squire dragged out his existence
there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but
his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to
the new conditions obtained an advance from a relative which
enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to calcutta
where by his professional skill and his force of character he
established a large practice in a fit of anger however caused
by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he
beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital
sentence as it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and
afterwards returned to england a morose and disappointed man

when dr roylott was in india he married my mother mrs stoner
the young widow of major-general stoner of the bengal artillery
my sister julia and i were twins and we were only two years old
at the time of my mother's re-marriage she had a considerable
sum of money not less than pounds a year and this she
bequeathed to dr roylott entirely while we resided with him
with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to
each of us in the event of our marriage shortly after our return
to england my mother died she was killed eight years ago in a
railway accident near crewe dr roylott then abandoned his
attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us
to live with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran the
money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and
there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness

but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time
instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our
neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of
stoke moran back in the old family seat he shut himself up in
his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious
quarrels with whoever might cross his path violence of temper
approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the
family and in my stepfather's case it had i believe been
intensified by his long residence in the tropics a series of
disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the
police-court until at last he became the terror of the village
and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of
immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger

last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a
stream and it was only by paying over all the money which i
could gather together that i was able to avert another public
exposure he had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies
and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few
acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate
and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents
wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end he has a
passion also for indian animals which are sent over to him by a
correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon
which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the
villagers almost as much as their master

you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i
had no great pleasure in our lives no servant would stay with
us and for a long time we did all the work of the house she was
but thirty at the time of her death and yet her hair had already
begun to whiten even as mine has

your sister is dead then

she died just two years ago and it is of her death that i wish
to speak to you you can understand that living the life which i
have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own
age and position we had however an aunt my mother's maiden
sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow and we
were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's
house julia went there at christmas two years ago and met there
a half-pay major of marines to whom she became engaged my
stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and
offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of
the day which had been fixed for the wedding the terrible event
occurred which has deprived me of my only companion

sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes
closed and his head sunk in a cushion but he half opened his
lids now and glanced across at his visitor

pray be precise as to details said he

it is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful
time is seared into my memory the manor-house is as i have
already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited the
bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor the sitting-rooms
being in the central block of the buildings of these bedrooms
the first is dr roylott's the second my sister's and the third
my own there is no communication between them but they all open
out into the same corridor do i make myself plain

perfectly so

the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn that
fatal night dr roylott had gone to his room early though we
knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled
by the smell of the strong indian cigars which it was his custom
to smoke she left her room therefore and came into mine where
she sat for some time chatting about her approaching wedding at
eleven o'clock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door
and looked back

tell me helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle
in the dead of the night

never said i

i suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in
your sleep

certainly not but why

because during the last few nights i have always about three
in the morning heard a low clear whistle i am a light sleeper
and it has awakened me i cannot tell where it came from perhaps
from the next room perhaps from the lawn i thought that i would
just ask you whether you had heard it

no i have not it must be those wretched gipsies in the
plantation

very likely and yet if it were on the lawn i wonder that you
did not hear it also

ah but i sleep more heavily than you

well it is of no great consequence at any rate she smiled
back at me closed my door and a few moments later i heard her
key turn in the lock

indeed said holmes was it your custom always to lock
yourselves in at night

always

and why

i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah
and a baboon we had no feeling of security unless our doors were
locked

quite so pray proceed with your statement

i could not sleep that night a vague feeling of impending
misfortune impressed me my sister and i you will recollect
were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two
souls which are so closely allied it was a wild night the wind
was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing
against the windows suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale
there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman i knew
that it was my sister's voice i sprang from my bed wrapped a
shawl round me and rushed into the corridor as i opened my door
i seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and
a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had
fallen as i ran down the passage my sister's door was unlocked
and revolved slowly upon its hinges i stared at it
horror-stricken not knowing what was about to issue from it by
the light of the corridor-lamp i saw my sister appear at the
opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for
help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a
drunkard i ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that
moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground
she writhed as one who is in terrible pain and her limbs were
dreadfully convulsed at first i thought that she had not
recognised me but as i bent over her she suddenly shrieked out
in a voice which i shall never forget oh my god helen it was
the band the speckled band there was something else which she
would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the
air in the direction of the doctor's room but a fresh convulsion
seized her and choked her words i rushed out calling loudly for
my stepfather and i met him hastening from his room in his
dressing-gown when he reached my sister's side she was
unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent
for medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for
she slowly sank and died without having recovered her
consciousness such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister

one moment said holmes are you sure about this whistle and
metallic sound could you swear to it

that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry it is
my strong impression that i heard it and yet among the crash of
the gale and the creaking of an old house i may possibly have
been deceived

was your sister dressed

no she was in her night-dress in her right hand was found the
charred stump of a match and in her left a match-box

showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when
the alarm took place that is important and what conclusions did
the coroner come to

he investigated the case with great care for dr roylott's
conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable
to find any satisfactory cause of death my evidence showed that
the door had been fastened upon the inner side and the windows
were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars
which were secured every night the walls were carefully sounded
and were shown to be quite solid all round and the flooring was
also thoroughly examined with the same result the chimney is
wide but is barred up by four large staples it is certain
therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end
besides there were no marks of any violence upon her

how about poison

the doctors examined her for it but without success

what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then

it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock
though what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine

were there gipsies in the plantation at the time

yes there are nearly always some there

ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a band a
speckled band

sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of
delirium sometimes that it may have referred to some band of
people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation i do not
know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear
over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which
she used

holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied

these are very deep waters said he pray go on with your
narrative

two years have passed since then and my life has been until
lately lonelier than ever a month ago however a dear friend
whom i have known for many years has done me the honour to ask
my hand in marriage his name is armitage percy armitage the
second son of mr armitage of crane water near reading my
stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to
be married in the course of the spring two days ago some repairs
were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom
wall has been pierced so that i have had to move into the
chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in
which she slept imagine then my thrill of terror when last
night as i lay awake thinking over her terrible fate i
suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which
had been the herald of her own death i sprang up and lit the
lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room i was too shaken to
go to bed again however so i dressed and as soon as it was
daylight i slipped down got a dog-cart at the crown inn which
is opposite and drove to leatherhead from whence i have come on
this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your
advice

you have done wisely said my friend but have you told me
all

yes all

miss roylott you have not you are screening your stepfather

why what do you mean

for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which
fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee five little
livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed
upon the white wrist

you have been cruelly used said holmes

the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist he
is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own
strength

there was a long silence during which holmes leaned his chin
upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire

this is a very deep business he said at last there are a
thousand details which i should desire to know before i decide
upon our course of action yet we have not a moment to lose if
we were to come to stoke moran to-day would it be possible for
us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your
stepfather

as it happens he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some
most important business it is probable that he will be away all
day and that there would be nothing to disturb you we have a
housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and i could easily
get her out of the way

excellent you are not averse to this trip watson

by no means

then we shall both come what are you going to do yourself

i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am
in town but i shall return by the twelve o'clock train so as to
be there in time for your coming

and you may expect us early in the afternoon i have myself some
small business matters to attend to will you not wait and
breakfast

no i must go my heart is lightened already since i have
confided my trouble to you i shall look forward to seeing you
again this afternoon she dropped her thick black veil over her
face and glided from the room

and what do you think of it all watson asked sherlock holmes
leaning back in his chair

it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business

dark enough and sinister enough

yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls
are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable
then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her
mysterious end

what becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the
very peculiar words of the dying woman

i cannot think

when you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of
a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor
the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has
an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage the dying
allusion to a band and finally the fact that miss helen stoner
heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of
those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its
place i think that there is good ground to think that the
mystery may be cleared along those lines

but what then did the gipsies do

i cannot imagine

i see many objections to any such theory

and so do i it is precisely for that reason that we are going
to stoke moran this day i want to see whether the objections are
fatal or if they may be explained away but what in the name of
the devil

the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that
our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had
framed himself in the aperture his costume was a peculiar
mixture of the professional and of the agricultural having a
black top-hat a long frock-coat and a pair of high gaiters
with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand so tall was he that his
hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his
breadth seemed to span it across from side to side a large face
seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and
marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other
of us while his deep-set bile-shot eyes and his high thin
fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old
bird of prey

which of you is holmes asked this apparition

my name sir but you have the advantage of me said my
companion quietly

i am dr grimesby roylott of stoke moran

indeed doctor said holmes blandly pray take a seat

i will do nothing of the kind my stepdaughter has been here i
have traced her what has she been saying to you

it is a little cold for the time of the year said holmes

what has she been saying to you screamed the old man
furiously

but i have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my
companion imperturbably

ha you put me off do you said our new visitor taking a step
forward and shaking his hunting-crop i know you you scoundrel
i have heard of you before you are holmes the meddler

my friend smiled

holmes the busybody

his smile broadened

holmes the scotland yard jack-in-office

holmes chuckled heartily your conversation is most
entertaining said he when you go out close the door for
there is a decided draught

i will go when i have said my say don't you dare to meddle with
my affairs i know that miss stoner has been here i traced her
i am a dangerous man to fall foul of see here he stepped
swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with
his huge brown hands

see that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and
hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the
room

he seems a very amiable person said holmes laughing i am
not quite so bulky but if he had remained i might have shown him
that my grip was not much more feeble than his own as he spoke
he picked up the steel poker and with a sudden effort
straightened it out again

fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
detective force this incident gives zest to our investigation
however and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer
from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her and now
watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards i shall walk
down to doctors commons where i hope to get some data which may
help us in this matter


it was nearly one o'clock when sherlock holmes returned from his
excursion he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled
over with notes and figures

i have seen the will of the deceased wife said he to
determine its exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the
present prices of the investments with which it is concerned the
total income which at the time of the wife's death was little
short of pounds is now through the fall in agricultural
prices not more than pounds each daughter can claim an
income of pounds in case of marriage it is evident
therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have
had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to
a very serious extent my morning's work has not been wasted
since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for
standing in the way of anything of the sort and now watson
this is too serious for dawdling especially as the old man is
aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you
are ready we shall call a cab and drive to waterloo i should be
very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your
pocket an eley's no is an excellent argument with gentlemen
who can twist steel pokers into knots that and a tooth-brush
are i think all that we need

at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for
leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove
for four or five miles through the lovely surrey lanes it was a
perfect day with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the
heavens the trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out
their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant
smell of the moist earth to me at least there was a strange
contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this
sinister quest upon which we were engaged my companion sat in
the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over
his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the
deepest thought suddenly however he started tapped me on the
shoulder and pointed over the meadows

look there said he

a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope
thickening into a grove at the highest point from amid the
branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a
very old mansion

stoke moran said he

yes sir that be the house of dr grimesby roylott remarked
the driver

there is some building going on there said holmes that is
where we are going

there's the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of
roofs some distance to the left but if you want to get to the
house you'll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by
the foot-path over the fields there it is where the lady is
walking

and the lady i fancy is miss stoner observed holmes shading
his eyes yes i think we had better do as you suggest

we got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way
to leatherhead

i thought it as well said holmes as we climbed the stile
that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or
on some definite business it may stop his gossip
good-afternoon miss stoner you see that we have been as good as
our word

our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a
face which spoke her joy i have been waiting so eagerly for
you she cried shaking hands with us warmly all has turned
out splendidly dr roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely
that he will be back before evening

we have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance
said holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had
occurred miss stoner turned white to the lips as she listened

good heavens she cried he has followed me then

so it appears

he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him what
will he say when he returns

he must guard himself for he may find that there is someone
more cunning than himself upon his track you must lock yourself
up from him to-night if he is violent we shall take you away to
your aunt's at harrow now we must make the best use of our
time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to
examine

the building was of grey lichen-blotched stone with a high
central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab
thrown out on each side in one of these wings the windows were
broken and blocked with wooden boards while the roof was partly
caved in a picture of ruin the central portion was in little
better repair but the right-hand block was comparatively modern
and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke curling up
from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided
some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the
stone-work had been broken into but there were no signs of any
workmen at the moment of our visit holmes walked slowly up and
down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the
outsides of the windows

this i take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep
the centre one to your sister's and the one next to the main
building to dr roylott's chamber

exactly so but i am now sleeping in the middle one

pending the alterations as i understand by the way there does
not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end
wall

there were none i believe that it was an excuse to move me from
my room

ah that is suggestive now on the other side of this narrow
wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open there
are windows in it of course

yes but very small ones too narrow for anyone to pass
through

as you both locked your doors at night your rooms were
unapproachable from that side now would you have the kindness
to go into your room and bar your shutters

miss stoner did so and holmes after a careful examination
through the open window endeavoured in every way to force the
shutter open but without success there was no slit through
which a knife could be passed to raise the bar then with his
lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built
firmly into the massive masonry hum said he scratching his
chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some
difficulties no one could pass these shutters if they were
bolted well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon
the matter

a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which
the three bedrooms opened holmes refused to examine the third
chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which miss
stoner was now sleeping and in which her sister had met with her
fate it was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a
gaping fireplace after the fashion of old country-houses a
brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow
white-counterpaned bed in another and a dressing-table on the
left-hand side of the window these articles with two small
wicker-work chairs made up all the furniture in the room save
for a square of wilton carpet in the centre the boards round and
the panelling of the walls were of brown worm-eaten oak so old
and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building
of the house holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat
silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down
taking in every detail of the apartment

where does that bell communicate with he asked at last
pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed the
tassel actually lying upon the pillow

it goes to the housekeeper's room

it looks newer than the other things

yes it was only put there a couple of years ago

your sister asked for it i suppose

no i never heard of her using it we used always to get what we
wanted for ourselves

indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there
you will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to
this floor he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in
his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining
minutely the cracks between the boards then he did the same with
the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled finally he
walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and
in running his eye up and down the wall finally he took the
bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug

why it's a dummy said he

won't it ring

no it is not even attached to a wire this is very interesting
you can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where
the little opening for the ventilator is

how very absurd i never noticed that before

very strange muttered holmes pulling at the rope there are
one or two very singular points about this room for example
what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another
room when with the same trouble he might have communicated
with the outside air

that is also quite modern said the lady

done about the same time as the bell-rope remarked holmes

yes there were several little changes carried out about that
time

they seem to have been of a most interesting character dummy
bell-ropes and ventilators which do not ventilate with your
permission miss stoner we shall now carry our researches into
the inner apartment

dr grimesby roylott's chamber was larger than that of his
step-daughter but was as plainly furnished a camp-bed a small
wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an
armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a
round table and a large iron safe were the principal things
which met the eye holmes walked slowly round and examined each
and all of them with the keenest interest

what's in here he asked tapping the safe

my stepfather's business papers

oh you have seen inside then

only once some years ago i remember that it was full of
papers

there isn't a cat in it for example

no what a strange idea

well look at this he took up a small saucer of milk which
stood on the top of it

no we don't keep a cat but there is a cheetah and a baboon

ah yes of course well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a
saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants i
daresay there is one point which i should wish to determine he
squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat
of it with the greatest attention

thank you that is quite settled said he rising and putting
his lens in his pocket hullo here is something interesting

the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on
one corner of the bed the lash however was curled upon itself
and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord

what do you make of that watson

it's a common enough lash but i don't know why it should be
tied

that is not quite so common is it ah me it's a wicked world
and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst
of all i think that i have seen enough now miss stoner and
with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn

i had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as
it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation we
had walked several times up and down the lawn neither miss
stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he
roused himself from his reverie

it is very essential miss stoner said he that you should
absolutely follow my advice in every respect

i shall most certainly do so

the matter is too serious for any hesitation your life may
depend upon your compliance

i assure you that i am in your hands

in the first place both my friend and i must spend the night in
your room

both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment

yes it must be so let me explain i believe that that is the
village inn over there

yes that is the crown

very good your windows would be visible from there

certainly

you must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a
headache when your stepfather comes back then when you hear him
retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window
undo the hasp put your lamp there as a signal to us and then
withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want
into the room which you used to occupy i have no doubt that in
spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night

oh yes easily

the rest you will leave in our hands

but what will you do

we shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate
the cause of this noise which has disturbed you

i believe mr holmes that you have already made up your mind
said miss stoner laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve

perhaps i have

then for pity's sake tell me what was the cause of my sister's
death

i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak

you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and
if she died from some sudden fright

no i do not think so i think that there was probably some more
tangible cause and now miss stoner we must leave you for if
dr roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain
good-bye and be brave for if you will do what i have told you
you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers
that threaten you

sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and
sitting-room at the crown inn they were on the upper floor and
from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and
of the inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house at dusk we saw
dr grimesby roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside
the little figure of the lad who drove him the boy had some
slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates and we heard
the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which
he shook his clinched fists at him the trap drove on and a few
minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as
the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms

do you know watson said holmes as we sat together in the
gathering darkness i have really some scruples as to taking you
to-night there is a distinct element of danger

can i be of assistance

your presence might be invaluable

then i shall certainly come

it is very kind of you

you speak of danger you have evidently seen more in these rooms
than was visible to me

no but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more i imagine
that you saw all that i did

i saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope and what purpose
that could answer i confess is more than i can imagine

you saw the ventilator too

yes but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to
have a small opening between two rooms it was so small that a
rat could hardly pass through

i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to
stoke moran

my dear holmes

oh yes i did you remember in her statement she said that her
sister could smell dr roylott's cigar now of course that
suggested at once that there must be a communication between the
two rooms it could only be a small one or it would have been
remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry i deduced a ventilator

but what harm can there be in that

well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates a
ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who sleeps in the
bed dies does not that strike you

i cannot as yet see any connection

did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed

no

it was clamped to the floor did you ever see a bed fastened
like that before

i cannot say that i have

the lady could not move her bed it must always be in the same
relative position to the ventilator and to the rope or so we may
call it since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull

holmes i cried i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at
we are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible
crime

subtle enough and horrible enough when a doctor does go wrong
he is the first of criminals he has nerve and he has knowledge
palmer and pritchard were among the heads of their profession
this man strikes even deeper but i think watson that we shall
be able to strike deeper still but we shall have horrors enough
before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet
pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more
cheerful


about nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished
and all was dark in the direction of the manor house two hours
passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of
eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us

that is our signal said holmes springing to his feet it
comes from the middle window

as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord
explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance
and that it was possible that we might spend the night there a
moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing
in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us
through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand

there was little difficulty in entering the grounds for
unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall making our way
among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about
to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel
bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted
child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and
then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness

my god i whispered did you see it

holmes was for the moment as startled as i his hand closed like
a vice upon my wrist in his agitation then he broke into a low
laugh and put his lips to my ear

it is a nice household he murmured that is the baboon

i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected there
was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders
at any moment i confess that i felt easier in my mind when
after following holmes example and slipping off my shoes i
found myself inside the bedroom my companion noiselessly closed
the shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes
round the room all was as we had seen it in the daytime then
creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered
into my ear again so gently that it was all that i could do to
distinguish the words

the least sound would be fatal to our plans

i nodded to show that i had heard

we must sit without light he would see it through the
ventilator

i nodded again

do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it have your
pistol ready in case we should need it i will sit on the side of
the bed and you in that chair

i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table

holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon
the bed beside him by it he laid the box of matches and the
stump of a candle then he turned down the lamp and we were left
in darkness

how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil i could not hear a
sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet i knew that my
companion sat open-eyed within a few feet of me in the same
state of nervous tension in which i was myself the shutters cut
off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness

from outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird and once at
our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that
the cheetah was indeed at liberty far away we could hear the
deep tones of the parish clock which boomed out every quarter of
an hour how long they seemed those quarters twelve struck and
one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for
whatever might befall

suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the
direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was
succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal
someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern i heard a gentle
sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the
smell grew stronger for half an hour i sat with straining ears
then suddenly another sound became audible a very gentle
soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping
continually from a kettle the instant that we heard it holmes
sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with
his cane at the bell-pull

you see it watson he yelled you see it

but i saw nothing at the moment when holmes struck the light i
heard a low clear whistle but the sudden glare flashing into my
weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which
my friend lashed so savagely i could however see that his face
was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing he had
ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when
suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most
horrible cry to which i have ever listened it swelled up louder
and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled
in the one dreadful shriek they say that away down in the
village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the
sleepers from their beds it struck cold to our hearts and i
stood gazing at holmes and he at me until the last echoes of it
had died away into the silence from which it rose

what can it mean i gasped

it means that it is all over holmes answered and perhaps
after all it is for the best take your pistol and we will
enter dr roylott's room

with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the
corridor twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply
from within then he turned the handle and entered i at his
heels with the cocked pistol in my hand

it was a singular sight which met our eyes on the table stood a
dark-lantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant
beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar
beside this table on the wooden chair sat dr grimesby roylott
clad in a long grey dressing-gown his bare ankles protruding
beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers
across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we
had noticed during the day his chin was cocked upward and his
eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the
ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with
brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his
head as we entered he made neither sound nor motion

the band the speckled band whispered holmes

i took a step forward in an instant his strange headgear began
to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent

it is a swamp adder cried holmes the deadliest snake in
india he has died within ten seconds of being bitten violence
does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls
into the pit which he digs for another let us thrust this
creature back into its den and we can then remove miss stoner to
some place of shelter and let the county police know what has
happened

as he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap
and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from
its horrid perch and carrying it at arm's length threw it into
the iron safe which he closed upon it

such are the true facts of the death of dr grimesby roylott of
stoke moran it is not necessary that i should prolong a
narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling
how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl how we conveyed
her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at harrow
of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the
conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly
playing with a dangerous pet the little which i had yet to learn
of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back
next day

i had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which
shows my dear watson how dangerous it always is to reason from
insufficient data the presence of the gipsies and the use of
the word band which was used by the poor girl no doubt to
explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of
by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an
entirely wrong scent i can only claim the merit that i instantly
reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me
that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not
come either from the window or the door my attention was
speedily drawn as i have already remarked to you to this
ventilator and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed the
discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to
the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was
there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and
coming to the bed the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me
and when i coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was
furnished with a supply of creatures from india i felt that i
was probably on the right track the idea of using a form of
poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical
test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless
man who had had an eastern training the rapidity with which such
a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be
an advantage it would be a sharp-eyed coroner indeed who could
distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
the poison fangs had done their work then i thought of the
whistle of course he must recall the snake before the morning
light revealed it to the victim he had trained it probably by
the use of the milk which we saw to return to him when summoned
he would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he
thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the
rope and land on the bed it might or might not bite the
occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but
sooner or later she must fall a victim

i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his
room an inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in
the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary
in order that he should reach the ventilator the sight of the
safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to
finally dispel any doubts which may have remained the metallic
clang heard by miss stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather
hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant
having once made up my mind you know the steps which i took in
order to put the matter to the proof i heard the creature hiss
as i have no doubt that you did also and i instantly lit the
light and attacked it

with the result of driving it through the ventilator

and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master
at the other side some of the blows of my cane came home and
roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person
it saw in this way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr
grimesby roylott's death and i cannot say that it is likely to
weigh very heavily upon my conscience



ix the adventure of the engineer's thumb

of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend mr
sherlock holmes for solution during the years of our intimacy
there were only two which i was the means of introducing to his
notice that of mr hatherley's thumb and that of colonel
warburton's madness of these the latter may have afforded a
finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was
so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that
it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it
gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of
reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results the story
has i believe been told more than once in the newspapers but
like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when
set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the
facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery clears
gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads
on to the complete truth at the time the circumstances made a
deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly
served to weaken the effect

it was in the summer of not long after my marriage that the
events occurred which i am now about to summarise i had returned
to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker
street rooms although i continually visited him and occasionally
even persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come
and visit us my practice had steadily increased and as i
happened to live at no very great distance from paddington
station i got a few patients from among the officials one of
these whom i had cured of a painful and lingering disease was
never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send
me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence

one morning at a little before seven o'clock i was awakened by
the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come
from paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room i
dressed hurriedly for i knew by experience that railway cases
were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs as i descended my
old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door
tightly behind him

i've got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his
shoulder he's all right

what is it then i asked for his manner suggested that it was
some strange creature which he had caged up in my room

it's a new patient he whispered i thought i'd bring him
round myself then he couldn't slip away there he is all safe
and sound i must go now doctor i have my dooties just the
same as you and off he went this trusty tout without even
giving me time to thank him

i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the
table he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a
soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books round one of
his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all
over with bloodstains he was young not more than
five-and-twenty i should say with a strong masculine face but
he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who
was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his
strength of mind to control

i am sorry to knock you up so early doctor said he but i
have had a very serious accident during the night i came in by
train this morning and on inquiring at paddington as to where i
might find a doctor a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me
here i gave the maid a card but i see that she has left it upon
the side-table

i took it up and glanced at it mr victor hatherley hydraulic
engineer a victoria street rd floor that was the name
style and abode of my morning visitor i regret that i have
kept you waiting said i sitting down in my library-chair you
are fresh from a night journey i understand which is in itself
a monotonous occupation

oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and
laughed he laughed very heartily with a high ringing note
leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides all my medical
instincts rose up against that laugh

stop it i cried pull yourself together and i poured out
some water from a caraffe

it was useless however he was off in one of those hysterical
outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis
is over and gone presently he came to himself once more very
weary and pale-looking

i have been making a fool of myself he gasped

not at all drink this i dashed some brandy into the water
and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks

that's better said he and now doctor perhaps you would
kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb
used to be

he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand it gave even
my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it there were four
protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the
thumb should have been it had been hacked or torn right out from
the roots

good heavens i cried this is a terrible injury it must have
bled considerably

yes it did i fainted when it was done and i think that i must
have been senseless for a long time when i came to i found that
it was still bleeding so i tied one end of my handkerchief very
tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig

excellent you should have been a surgeon

it is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own
province

this has been done said i examining the wound by a very
heavy and sharp instrument

a thing like a cleaver said he

an accident i presume

by no means

what a murderous attack

very murderous indeed

you horrify me

i sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and finally covered
it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages he lay back
without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time

how is that i asked when i had finished

capital between your brandy and your bandage i feel a new man
i was very weak but i have had a good deal to go through

perhaps you had better not speak of the matter it is evidently
trying to your nerves

oh no not now i shall have to tell my tale to the police
but between ourselves if it were not for the convincing
evidence of this wound of mine i should be surprised if they
believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and i
have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and
even if they believe me the clues which i can give them are so
vague that it is a question whether justice will be done

ha cried i if it is anything in the nature of a problem
which you desire to see solved i should strongly recommend you
to come to my friend mr sherlock holmes before you go to the
official police

oh i have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and i
should be very glad if he would take the matter up though of
course i must use the official police as well would you give me
an introduction to him

i'll do better i'll take you round to him myself

i should be immensely obliged to you

we'll call a cab and go together we shall just be in time to
have a little breakfast with him do you feel equal to it

yes i shall not feel easy until i have told my story

then my servant will call a cab and i shall be with you in an
instant i rushed upstairs explained the matter shortly to my
wife and in five minutes was inside a hansom driving with my
new acquaintance to baker street

sherlock holmes was as i expected lounging about his
sitting-room in his dressing-gown reading the agony column of the
times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe which was composed
of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day
before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the
mantelpiece he received us in his quietly genial fashion
ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in a hearty meal
when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the
sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of
brandy and water within his reach

it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one
mr hatherley said he pray lie down there and make yourself
absolutely at home tell us what you can but stop when you are
tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant

thank you said my patient but i have felt another man since
the doctor bandaged me and i think that your breakfast has
completed the cure i shall take up as little of your valuable
time as possible so i shall start at once upon my peculiar
experiences

holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavy-lidded
expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while i sat
opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story
which our visitor detailed to us

you must know said he that i am an orphan and a bachelor
residing alone in lodgings in london by profession i am a
hydraulic engineer and i have had considerable experience of my
work during the seven years that i was apprenticed to venner 
matheson the well-known firm of greenwich two years ago
having served my time and having also come into a fair sum of
money through my poor father's death i determined to start in
business for myself and took professional chambers in victoria
street

i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in
business a dreary experience to me it has been exceptionally so
during two years i have had three consultations and one small
job and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought
me my gross takings amount to pounds s every day from
nine in the morning until four in the afternoon i waited in my
little den until at last my heart began to sink and i came to
believe that i should never have any practice at all

yesterday however just as i was thinking of leaving the
office my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who
wished to see me upon business he brought up a card too with
the name of colonel lysander stark engraved upon it close at
his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle
size but of an exceeding thinness i do not think that i have
ever seen so thin a man his whole face sharpened away into nose
and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over
his outstanding bones yet this emaciation seemed to be his
natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his
step brisk and his bearing assured he was plainly but neatly
dressed and his age i should judge would be nearer forty than
thirty

mr hatherley said he with something of a german accent
you have been recommended to me mr hatherley as being a man
who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet
and capable of preserving a secret

i bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
address may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character

well perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just
at this moment i have it from the same source that you are both
an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in london

that is quite correct i answered but you will excuse me if
i say that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional
qualifications i understand that it was on a professional matter
that you wished to speak to me

undoubtedly so but you will find that all i say is really to
the point i have a professional commission for you but absolute
secrecy is quite essential absolute secrecy you understand and
of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than
from one who lives in the bosom of his family

if i promise to keep a secret said i you may absolutely
depend upon my doing so

he looked very hard at me as i spoke and it seemed to me that i
had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye

do you promise then said he at last

yes i promise

absolute and complete silence before during and after no
reference to the matter at all either in word or writing

i have already given you my word

very good he suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning
across the room he flung open the door the passage outside was
empty

that's all right said he coming back i know that clerks are
sometimes curious as to their master's affairs now we can talk
in safety he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to
stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look

a feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun
to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man
even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from
showing my impatience

i beg that you will state your business sir said i my time
is of value heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the
words came to my lips

how would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you he asked

most admirably

i say a night's work but an hour's would be nearer the mark i
simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which
has got out of gear if you show us what is wrong we shall soon
set it right ourselves what do you think of such a commission as
that

the work appears to be light and the pay munificent

precisely so we shall want you to come to-night by the last
train

where to

to eyford in berkshire it is a little place near the borders
of oxfordshire and within seven miles of reading there is a
train from paddington which would bring you there at about


very good

i shall come down in a carriage to meet you

there is a drive then

yes our little place is quite out in the country it is a good
seven miles from eyford station

then we can hardly get there before midnight i suppose there
would be no chance of a train back i should be compelled to stop
the night

yes we could easily give you a shake-down

that is very awkward could i not come at some more convenient
hour

we have judged it best that you should come late it is to
recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a
young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the
very heads of your profession still of course if you would
like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do
so

i thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they
would be to me not at all said i i shall be very happy to
accommodate myself to your wishes i should like however to
understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to
do

quite so it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which
we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity i
have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all
laid before you i suppose that we are absolutely safe from
eavesdroppers

entirely

then the matter stands thus you are probably aware that
fuller's-earth is a valuable product and that it is only found
in one or two places in england

i have heard so

some little time ago i bought a small place a very small
place within ten miles of reading i was fortunate enough to
discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my
fields on examining it however i found that this deposit was a
comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two
very much larger ones upon the right and left both of them
however in the grounds of my neighbours these good people were
absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was
quite as valuable as a gold-mine naturally it was to my
interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value
but unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this i
took a few of my friends into the secret however and they
suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little
deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would
enable us to buy the neighbouring fields this we have now been
doing for some time and in order to help us in our operations we
erected a hydraulic press this press as i have already
explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the
subject we guard our secret very jealously however and if it
once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our
little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts
came out it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these
fields and carrying out our plans that is why i have made you
promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are
going to eyford to-night i hope that i make it all plain

i quite follow you said i the only point which i could not
quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press
in excavating fuller's-earth which as i understand is dug out
like gravel from a pit

ah said he carelessly we have our own process we compress
the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing
what they are but that is a mere detail i have taken you fully
into my confidence now mr hatherley and i have shown you how i
trust you he rose as he spoke i shall expect you then at
eyford at 

i shall certainly be there

and not a word to a soul he looked at me with a last long
questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in a cold dank
grasp he hurried from the room

well when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very
much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission
which had been intrusted to me on the one hand of course i was
glad for the fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked
had i set a price upon my own services and it was possible that
this order might lead to other ones on the other hand the face
and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon
me and i could not think that his explanation of the
fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my
coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest i should tell
anyone of my errand however i threw all fears to the winds ate
a hearty supper drove to paddington and started off having
obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue

at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station
however i was in time for the last train to eyford and i
reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock i was the
only passenger who got out there and there was no one upon the
platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern as i passed
out through the wicket gate however i found my acquaintance of
the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side without a
word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door
of which was standing open he drew up the windows on either
side tapped on the wood-work and away we went as fast as the
horse could go

one horse interjected holmes

yes only one

did you observe the colour

yes i saw it by the side-lights when i was stepping into the
carriage it was a chestnut

tired-looking or fresh

oh fresh and glossy

thank you i am sorry to have interrupted you pray continue
your most interesting statement

away we went then and we drove for at least an hour colonel
lysander stark had said that it was only seven miles but i
should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the
time that we took that it must have been nearer twelve he sat
at my side in silence all the time and i was aware more than
once when i glanced in his direction that he was looking at me
with great intensity the country roads seem to be not very good
in that part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly i
tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we
were but they were made of frosted glass and i could make out
nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light now
and then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the
journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the
conversation soon flagged at last however the bumping of the
road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive
and the carriage came to a stand colonel lysander stark sprang
out and as i followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch
which gaped in front of us we stepped as it were right out of
the carriage and into the hall so that i failed to catch the
most fleeting glance of the front of the house the instant that
i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us
and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
drove away

it was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled
about looking for matches and muttering under his breath
suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a
long golden bar of light shot out in our direction it grew
broader and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand which she
held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us
i could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which
the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it was a rich
material she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as
though asking a question and when my companion answered in a
gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly
fell from her hand colonel stark went up to her whispered
something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room
from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the
lamp in his hand

perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a
few minutes said he throwing open another door it was a
quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the
centre on which several german books were scattered colonel
stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the
door i shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and
vanished into the darkness

i glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my
ignorance of german i could see that two of them were treatises
on science the others being volumes of poetry then i walked
across to the window hoping that i might catch some glimpse of
the country-side but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded
across it it was a wonderfully silent house there was an old
clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise
everything was deadly still a vague feeling of uneasiness began
to steal over me who were these german people and what were
they doing living in this strange out-of-the-way place and
where was the place i was ten miles or so from eyford that was
all i knew but whether north south east or west i had no
idea for that matter reading and possibly other large towns
were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded
after all yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness
that we were in the country i paced up and down the room
humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling
that i was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee

suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the
utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open the woman
was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind
her the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and
beautiful face i could see at a glance that she was sick with
fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart she held up one
shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few
whispered words of broken english at me her eyes glancing back
like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her

i would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to
speak calmly i would go i should not stay here there is no
good for you to do

but madam said i i have not yet done what i came for i
cannot possibly leave until i have seen the machine

it is not worth your while to wait she went on you can pass
through the door no one hinders and then seeing that i smiled
and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and
made a step forward with her hands wrung together for the love
of heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too
late

but i am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to
engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way i
thought of my fifty-guinea fee of my wearisome journey and of
the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me was it all to
go for nothing why should i slink away without having carried
out my commission and without the payment which was my due this
woman might for all i knew be a monomaniac with a stout
bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than i
cared to confess i still shook my head and declared my intention
of remaining where i was she was about to renew her entreaties
when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps
was heard upon the stairs she listened for an instant threw up
her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and
as noiselessly as she had come

the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man
with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double
chin who was introduced to me as mr ferguson

this is my secretary and manager said the colonel by the
way i was under the impression that i left this door shut just
now i fear that you have felt the draught

on the contrary said i i opened the door myself because i
felt the room to be a little close

he shot one of his suspicious looks at me perhaps we had
better proceed to business then said he mr ferguson and i
will take you up to see the machine

i had better put my hat on i suppose

oh no it is in the house

what you dig fuller's-earth in the house

no no this is only where we compress it but never mind that
all we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us
know what is wrong with it

we went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the
fat manager and i behind him it was a labyrinth of an old house
with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little
low doors the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the
generations who had crossed them there were no carpets and no
signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster
was peeling off the walls and the damp was breaking through in
green unhealthy blotches i tried to put on as unconcerned an
air as possible but i had not forgotten the warnings of the
lady even though i disregarded them and i kept a keen eye upon
my two companions ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent
man but i could see from the little that he said that he was at
least a fellow-countryman

colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door which
he unlocked within was a small square room in which the three
of us could hardly get at one time ferguson remained outside
and the colonel ushered me in

we are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and
it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were
to turn it on the ceiling of this small chamber is really the
end of the descending piston and it comes down with the force of
many tons upon this metal floor there are small lateral columns
of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and
multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you the machine
goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working
of it and it has lost a little of its force perhaps you will
have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set
it right

i took the lamp from him and i examined the machine very
thoroughly it was indeed a gigantic one and capable of
exercising enormous pressure when i passed outside however and
pressed down the levers which controlled it i knew at once by
the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed
a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders an
examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was
round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to
fill the socket along which it worked this was clearly the cause
of the loss of power and i pointed it out to my companions who
followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical
questions as to how they should proceed to set it right when i
had made it clear to them i returned to the main chamber of the
machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity
it was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth
was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose
that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a
purpose the walls were of wood but the floor consisted of a
large iron trough and when i came to examine it i could see a
crust of metallic deposit all over it i had stooped and was
scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i heard a
muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of the
colonel looking down at me

what are you doing there he asked

i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as
that which he had told me i was admiring your fuller's-earth
said i i think that i should be better able to advise you as to
your machine if i knew what the exact purpose was for which it
was used

the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of
my speech his face set hard and a baleful light sprang up in
his grey eyes

very well said he you shall know all about the machine he
took a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key
in the lock i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it
was quite secure and did not give in the least to my kicks and
shoves hullo i yelled hullo colonel let me out

and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my
heart into my mouth it was the clank of the levers and the swish
of the leaking cylinder he had set the engine at work the lamp
still stood upon the floor where i had placed it when examining
the trough by its light i saw that the black ceiling was coming
down upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than
myself with a force which must within a minute grind me to a
shapeless pulp i threw myself screaming against the door and
dragged with my nails at the lock i implored the colonel to let
me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my
cries the ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with
my hand upraised i could feel its hard rough surface then it
flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
very much upon the position in which i met it if i lay on my
face the weight would come upon my spine and i shuddered to
think of that dreadful snap easier the other way perhaps and
yet had i the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black
shadow wavering down upon me already i was unable to stand
erect when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope
back to my heart

i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the
walls were of wood as i gave a last hurried glance around i saw
a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which
broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward for
an instant i could hardly believe that here was indeed a door
which led away from death the next instant i threw myself
through and lay half-fainting upon the other side the panel had
closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few
moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me
how narrow had been my escape

i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist and
i found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor
while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand
while she held a candle in her right it was the same good friend
whose warning i had so foolishly rejected

come come she cried breathlessly they will be here in a
moment they will see that you are not there oh do not waste
the so-precious time but come

this time at least i did not scorn her advice i staggered to
my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding
stair the latter led to another broad passage and just as we
reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of
two voices one answering the other from the floor on which we
were and from the one beneath my guide stopped and looked about
her like one who is at her wit's end then she threw open a door
which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon
was shining brightly

it is your only chance said she it is high but it may be
that you can jump it

as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the
passage and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark
rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a
butcher's cleaver in the other i rushed across the bedroom
flung open the window and looked out how quiet and sweet and
wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be
more than thirty feet down i clambered out upon the sill but i
hesitated to jump until i should have heard what passed between
my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me if she were ill-used
then at any risks i was determined to go back to her assistance
the thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at
the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round
him and tried to hold him back

fritz fritz she cried in english remember your promise
after the last time you said it should not be again he will be
silent oh he will be silent

you are mad elise he shouted struggling to break away from
her you will be the ruin of us he has seen too much let me
pass i say he dashed her to one side and rushing to the
window cut at me with his heavy weapon i had let myself go and
was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell i was
conscious of a dull pain my grip loosened and i fell into the
garden below

i was shaken but not hurt by the fall so i picked myself up and
rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run for i
understood that i was far from being out of danger yet suddenly
however as i ran a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me
i glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and
then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and
that the blood was pouring from my wound i endeavoured to tie my
handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my
ears and next moment i fell in a dead faint among the
rose-bushes

how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell it must have been
a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was
breaking when i came to myself my clothes were all sodden with
dew and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded
thumb the smarting of it recalled in an instant all the
particulars of my night's adventure and i sprang to my feet with
the feeling that i might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers but
to my astonishment when i came to look round me neither house
nor garden were to be seen i had been lying in an angle of the
hedge close by the highroad and just a little lower down was a
long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the
very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night were
it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed
during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream

half dazed i went into the station and asked about the morning
train there would be one to reading in less than an hour the
same porter was on duty i found as had been there when i
arrived i inquired of him whether he had ever heard of colonel
lysander stark the name was strange to him had he observed a
carriage the night before waiting for me no he had not was
there a police-station anywhere near there was one about three
miles off

it was too far for me to go weak and ill as i was i determined
to wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the
police it was a little past six when i arrived so i went first
to have my wound dressed and then the doctor was kind enough to
bring me along here i put the case into your hands and shall do
exactly what you advise

we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to
this extraordinary narrative then sherlock holmes pulled down
from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he
placed his cuttings

here is an advertisement which will interest you said he it
appeared in all the papers about a year ago listen to this
lost on the th inst mr jeremiah hayling aged
twenty-six a hydraulic engineer left his lodgings at ten
o'clock at night and has not been heard of since was
dressed in etc etc ha that represents the last time that
the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled i fancy

good heavens cried my patient then that explains what the
girl said

undoubtedly it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should
stand in the way of his little game like those out-and-out
pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship well
every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall
go down to scotland yard at once as a preliminary to starting for
eyford

some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train
together bound from reading to the little berkshire village
there were sherlock holmes the hydraulic engineer inspector
bradstreet of scotland yard a plain-clothes man and myself
bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the
seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with eyford
for its centre

there you are said he that circle is drawn at a radius of
ten miles from the village the place we want must be somewhere
near that line you said ten miles i think sir

it was an hour's good drive

and you think that they brought you back all that way when you
were unconscious

they must have done so i have a confused memory too of having
been lifted and conveyed somewhere

what i cannot understand said i is why they should have
spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden
perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties

i hardly think that likely i never saw a more inexorable face
in my life

oh we shall soon clear up all that said bradstreet well i
have drawn my circle and i only wish i knew at what point upon
it the folk that we are in search of are to be found

i think i could lay my finger on it said holmes quietly

really now cried the inspector you have formed your
opinion come now we shall see who agrees with you i say it is
south for the country is more deserted there

and i say east said my patient

i am for west remarked the plain-clothes man there are
several quiet little villages up there

and i am for north said i because there are no hills there
and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up
any

come cried the inspector laughing it's a very pretty
diversity of opinion we have boxed the compass among us who do
you give your casting vote to

you are all wrong

but we can't all be

oh yes you can this is my point he placed his finger in the
centre of the circle this is where we shall find them

but the twelve-mile drive gasped hatherley

six out and six back nothing simpler you say yourself that the
horse was fresh and glossy when you got in how could it be that
if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads

indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed bradstreet
thoughtfully of course there can be no doubt as to the nature
of this gang

none at all said holmes they are coiners on a large scale
and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the
place of silver

we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work
said the inspector they have been turning out half-crowns by
the thousand we even traced them as far as reading but could
get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that
showed that they were very old hands but now thanks to this
lucky chance i think that we have got them right enough

but the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not
destined to fall into the hands of justice as we rolled into
eyford station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed
up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and
hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape

a house on fire asked bradstreet as the train steamed off
again on its way

yes sir said the station-master

when did it break out

i hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse
and the whole place is in a blaze

whose house is it

dr becher's

tell me broke in the engineer is dr becher a german very
thin with a long sharp nose

the station-master laughed heartily no sir dr becher is an
englishman and there isn't a man in the parish who has a
better-lined waistcoat but he has a gentleman staying with him
a patient as i understand who is a foreigner and he looks as
if a little good berkshire beef would do him no harm

the station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
hastening in the direction of the fire the road topped a low
hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in
front of us spouting fire at every chink and window while in
the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to
keep the flames under

that's it cried hatherley in intense excitement there is
the gravel-drive and there are the rose-bushes where i lay that
second window is the one that i jumped from

well at least said holmes you have had your revenge upon
them there can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which
when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls
though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to
observe it at the time now keep your eyes open in this crowd for
your friends of last night though i very much fear that they are
a good hundred miles off by now

and holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this
no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the
sinister german or the morose englishman early that morning a
peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very
bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of reading but
there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even holmes
ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their
whereabouts

the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
which they had found within and still more so by discovering a
newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor
about sunset however their efforts were at last successful and
they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in
and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save
some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace remained of
the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so
dearly large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored
in an out-house but no coins were to be found which may have
explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been
already referred to

how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to
the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained
forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a
very plain tale he had evidently been carried down by two
persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other
unusually large ones on the whole it was most probable that the
silent englishman being less bold or less murderous than his
companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out
of the way of danger

well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return
once more to london it has been a pretty business for me i
have lost my thumb and i have lost a fifty-guinea fee and what
have i gained

experience said holmes laughing indirectly it may be of
value you know you have only to put it into words to gain the
reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your
existence



x the adventure of the noble bachelor

the lord st simon marriage and its curious termination have
long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles
in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves fresh scandals have
eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the
gossips away from this four-year-old drama as i have reason to
believe however that the full facts have never been revealed to
the general public and as my friend sherlock holmes had a
considerable share in clearing the matter up i feel that no
memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of
this remarkable episode

it was a few weeks before my own marriage during the days when i
was still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street that he came
home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table
waiting for him i had remained indoors all day for the weather
had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and
the jezail bullet which i had brought back in one of my limbs as
a relic of my afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence
with my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another i had
surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last
saturated with the news of the day i tossed them all aside and
lay listless watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's
noble correspondent could be

here is a very fashionable epistle i remarked as he entered
your morning letters if i remember right were from a
fish-monger and a tide-waiter

yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he
answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more
interesting this looks like one of those unwelcome social
summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie

he broke the seal and glanced over the contents

oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all

not social then

no distinctly professional

and from a noble client

one of the highest in england

my dear fellow i congratulate you

i assure you watson without affectation that the status of my
client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his
case it is just possible however that that also may not be
wanting in this new investigation you have been reading the
papers diligently of late have you not

it looks like it said i ruefully pointing to a huge bundle in
the corner i have had nothing else to do

it is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up i
read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column the
latter is always instructive but if you have followed recent
events so closely you must have read about lord st simon and his
wedding

oh yes with the deepest interest

that is well the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord
st simon i will read it to you and in return you must turn
over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter
this is what he says

my dear mr sherlock holmes lord backwater tells me that i
may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion i
have determined therefore to call upon you and to consult you
in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
connection with my wedding mr lestrade of scotland yard is
acting already in the matter but he assures me that he sees no
objection to your co-operation and that he even thinks that
it might be of some assistance i will call at four o'clock in
the afternoon and should you have any other engagement at that
time i hope that you will postpone it as this matter is of
paramount importance yours faithfully st simon

it is dated from grosvenor mansions written with a quill pen
and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink
upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked holmes
as he folded up the epistle

he says four o'clock it is three now he will be here in an
hour

then i have just time with your assistance to get clear upon
the subject turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in
their order of time while i take a glance as to who our client
is he picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of
reference beside the mantelpiece here he is said he sitting
down and flattening it out upon his knee lord robert walsingham
de vere st simon second son of the duke of balmoral hum arms
azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable born in 
he's forty-one years of age which is mature for marriage was
under-secretary for the colonies in a late administration the
duke his father was at one time secretary for foreign affairs
they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent and tudor on
the distaff side ha well there is nothing very instructive in
all this i think that i must turn to you watson for something
more solid

i have very little difficulty in finding what i want said i
for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck me as
remarkable i feared to refer them to you however as i knew
that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the
intrusion of other matters

oh you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square
furniture van that is quite cleared up now though indeed it
was obvious from the first pray give me the results of your
newspaper selections

here is the first notice which i can find it is in the personal
column of the morning post and dates as you see some weeks
back a marriage has been arranged it says and will if
rumour is correct very shortly take place between lord robert
st simon second son of the duke of balmoral and miss hatty
doran the only daughter of aloysius doran esq of san
francisco cal usa that is all

terse and to the point remarked holmes stretching his long
thin legs towards the fire

there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society
papers of the same week ah here it is there will soon be a
call for protection in the marriage market for the present
free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home
product one by one the management of the noble houses of great
britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across
the atlantic an important addition has been made during the last
week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by
these charming invaders lord st simon who has shown himself
for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows has
now definitely announced his approaching marriage with miss hatty
doran the fascinating daughter of a california millionaire miss
doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much
attention at the westbury house festivities is an only child
and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the
future as it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has
been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years
and as lord st simon has no property of his own save the small
estate of birchmoor it is obvious that the californian heiress
is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to
make the easy and common transition from a republican lady to a
british peeress

anything else asked holmes yawning

oh yes plenty then there is another note in the morning post
to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it
would be at st george's hanover square that only half a dozen
intimate friends would be invited and that the party would
return to the furnished house at lancaster gate which has been
taken by mr aloysius doran two days later that is on
wednesday last there is a curt announcement that the wedding had
taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at lord
backwater's place near petersfield those are all the notices
which appeared before the disappearance of the bride

before the what asked holmes with a start

the vanishing of the lady

when did she vanish then

at the wedding breakfast

indeed this is more interesting than it promised to be quite
dramatic in fact

yes it struck me as being a little out of the common

they often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during
the honeymoon but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt
as this pray let me have the details

i warn you that they are very incomplete

perhaps we may make them less so

such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a
morning paper of yesterday which i will read to you it is
headed singular occurrence at a fashionable wedding

the family of lord robert st simon has been thrown into the
greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which
have taken place in connection with his wedding the ceremony as
shortly announced in the papers of yesterday occurred on the
previous morning but it is only now that it has been possible to
confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently
floating about in spite of the attempts of the friends to hush
the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it
that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what
is a common subject for conversation

the ceremony which was performed at st george's hanover
square was 
a very quiet one no one being present save the
father of the bride mr aloysius doran the duchess of balmoral
lord backwater lord eustace and lady clara st simon the
younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and lady alicia
whittington the whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of
mr aloysius doran at lancaster gate where breakfast had been
prepared it appears that some little trouble was caused by a
woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to
force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging
that she had some claim upon lord st simon it was only after a
painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler
and the footman the bride who had fortunately entered the house
before this unpleasant interruption had sat down to breakfast
with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and
retired to her room her prolonged absence having caused some
comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that
she had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an
ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage one of the
footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus
apparelled but had refused to credit that it was his mistress
believing her to be with the company on ascertaining that his
daughter had disappeared mr aloysius doran in conjunction with
the bridegroom instantly put themselves in communication with
the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which
will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very
singular business up to a late hour last night however nothing
had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady there
are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the
police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the
original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or some
other motive she may have been concerned in the strange
disappearance of the bride

and is that all

only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is
a suggestive one

and it is 

that miss flora millar the lady who had caused the disturbance
has actually been arrested it appears that she was formerly a
danseuse at the allegro and that she has known the bridegroom
for some years there are no further particulars and the whole
case is in your hands now so far as it has been set forth in the
public press

and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be i would
not have missed it for worlds but there is a ring at the bell
watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four i
have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client do not
dream of going watson for i very much prefer having a witness
if only as a check to my own memory

lord robert st simon announced our page-boy throwing open
the door a gentleman entered with a pleasant cultured face
high-nosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about
the mouth and with the steady well-opened eye of a man whose
pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed his
manner was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue
impression of age for he had a slight forward stoop and a little
bend of the knees as he walked his hair too as he swept off
his very curly-brimmed hat was grizzled round the edges and thin
upon the top as to his dress it was careful to the verge of
foppishness with high collar black frock-coat white waistcoat
yellow gloves patent-leather shoes and light-coloured gaiters
he advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to
right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his
golden eyeglasses

good-day lord st simon said holmes rising and bowing pray
take the basket-chair this is my friend and colleague dr
watson draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this
matter over

a most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine
mr holmes i have been cut to the quick i understand that you
have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir
though i presume that they were hardly from the same class of
society

no i am descending

i beg pardon

my last client of the sort was a king

oh really i had no idea and which king

the king of scandinavia

what had he lost his wife

you can understand said holmes suavely that i extend to the
affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to
you in yours

of course very right very right i'm sure i beg pardon as to
my own case i am ready to give you any information which may
assist you in forming an opinion

thank you i have already learned all that is in the public
prints nothing more i presume that i may take it as correct this
article for example as to the disappearance of the bride

lord st simon glanced over it yes it is correct as far as it
goes

but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could
offer an opinion i think that i may arrive at my facts most
directly by questioning you

pray do so

when did you first meet miss hatty doran

in san francisco a year ago

you were travelling in the states

yes

did you become engaged then

no

but you were on a friendly footing

i was amused by her society and she could see that i was
amused

her father is very rich

he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope

and how did he make his money

in mining he had nothing a few years ago then he struck gold
invested it and came up by leaps and bounds

now what is your own impression as to the young lady's your
wife's character

the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down
into the fire you see mr holmes said he my wife was
twenty before her father became a rich man during that time she
ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or
mountains so that her education has come from nature rather than
from the schoolmaster she is what we call in england a tomboy
with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of
traditions she is impetuous volcanic i was about to say she
is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
resolutions on the other hand i would not have given her the
name which i have the honour to bear he gave a little stately
cough had not i thought her to be at bottom a noble woman i
believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that
anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her

have you her photograph

i brought this with me he opened a locket and showed us the
full face of a very lovely woman it was not a photograph but an
ivory miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect
of the lustrous black hair the large dark eyes and the
exquisite mouth holmes gazed long and earnestly at it then he
closed the locket and handed it back to lord st simon

the young lady came to london then and you renewed your
acquaintance

yes her father brought her over for this last london season i
met her several times became engaged to her and have now
married her

she brought i understand a considerable dowry

a fair dowry not more than is usual in my family

and this of course remains to you since the marriage is a
fait accompli

i really have made no inquiries on the subject

very naturally not did you see miss doran on the day before the
wedding

yes

was she in good spirits

never better she kept talking of what we should do in our
future lives

indeed that is very interesting and on the morning of the
wedding

she was as bright as possible at least until after the
ceremony

and did you observe any change in her then

well to tell the truth i saw then the first signs that i had
ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp the incident
however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible
bearing upon the case

pray let us have it for all that

oh it is childish she dropped her bouquet as we went towards
the vestry she was passing the front pew at the time and it
fell over into the pew there was a moment's delay but the
gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not
appear to be the worse for the fall yet when i spoke to her of
the matter she answered me abruptly and in the carriage on our
way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause

indeed you say that there was a gentleman in the pew some of
the general public were present then

oh yes it is impossible to exclude them when the church is
open

this gentleman was not one of your wife's friends

no no i call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a
common-looking person i hardly noticed his appearance but
really i think that we are wandering rather far from the point

lady st simon then returned from the wedding in a less
cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it what did she do
on re-entering her father's house

i saw her in conversation with her maid

and who is her maid

alice is her name she is an american and came from california
with her

a confidential servant

a little too much so it seemed to me that her mistress allowed
her to take great liberties still of course in america they
look upon these things in a different way

how long did she speak to this alice

oh a few minutes i had something else to think of

you did not overhear what they said

lady st simon said something about jumping a claim she was
accustomed to use slang of the kind i have no idea what she
meant

american slang is very expressive sometimes and what did your
wife do when she finished speaking to her maid

she walked into the breakfast-room

on your arm

no alone she was very independent in little matters like that
then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose
hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room she
never came back

but this maid alice as i understand deposes that she went to
her room covered her bride's dress with a long ulster put on a
bonnet and went out

quite so and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in
company with flora millar a woman who is now in custody and who
had already made a disturbance at mr doran's house that
morning

ah yes i should like a few particulars as to this young lady
and your relations to her

lord st simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows
we have been on a friendly footing for some years i may say on
a very friendly footing she used to be at the allegro i have
not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of
complaint against me but you know what women are mr holmes
flora was a dear little thing but exceedingly hot-headed and
devotedly attached to me she wrote me dreadful letters when she
heard that i was about to be married and to tell the truth the
reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that i
feared lest there might be a scandal in the church she came to
mr doran's door just after we returned and she endeavoured to
push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my
wife and even threatening her but i had foreseen the
possibility of something of the sort and i had two police
fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again
she was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a
row

did your wife hear all this

no thank goodness she did not

and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards

yes that is what mr lestrade of scotland yard looks upon as
so serious it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid
some terrible trap for her

well it is a possible supposition

you think so too

i did not say a probable one but you do not yourself look upon
this as likely

i do not think flora would hurt a fly

still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters pray
what is your own theory as to what took place

well really i came to seek a theory not to propound one i
have given you all the facts since you ask me however i may
say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of
this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a
social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous
disturbance in my wife

in short that she had become suddenly deranged

well really when i consider that she has turned her back i
will not say upon me but upon so much that many have aspired to
without success i can hardly explain it in any other fashion

well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said
holmes smiling and now lord st simon i think that i have
nearly all my data may i ask whether you were seated at the
breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window

we could see the other side of the road and the park

quite so then i do not think that i need to detain you longer
i shall communicate with you

should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our
client rising

i have solved it

eh what was that

i say that i have solved it

where then is my wife

that is a detail which i shall speedily supply

lord st simon shook his head i am afraid that it will take
wiser heads than yours or mine he remarked and bowing in a
stately old-fashioned manner he departed

it is very good of lord st simon to honour my head by putting
it on a level with his own said sherlock holmes laughing i
think that i shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all
this cross-questioning i had formed my conclusions as to the
case before our client came into the room

my dear holmes

i have notes of several similar cases though none as i
remarked before which were quite as prompt my whole examination
served to turn my conjecture into a certainty circumstantial
evidence is occasionally very convincing as when you find a
trout in the milk to quote thoreau's example

but i have heard all that you have heard

without however the knowledge of pre-existing cases which
serves me so well there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some
years back and something on very much the same lines at munich
the year after the franco-prussian war it is one of these
cases but hullo here is lestrade good-afternoon lestrade
you will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are
cigars in the box

the official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat
which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance and he carried a
black canvas bag in his hand with a short greeting he seated
himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him

what's up then asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye you
look dissatisfied

and i feel dissatisfied it is this infernal st simon marriage
case i can make neither head nor tail of the business

really you surprise me

who ever heard of such a mixed affair every clue seems to slip
through my fingers i have been at work upon it all day

and very wet it seems to have made you said holmes laying his
hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket

yes i have been dragging the serpentine

in heaven's name what for

in search of the body of lady st simon

sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily

have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain he
asked

why what do you mean

because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in
the one as in the other

lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion i suppose you
know all about it he snarled

well i have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up

oh indeed then you think that the serpentine plays no part in
the matter

i think it very unlikely

then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found
this in it he opened his bag as he spoke and tumbled onto the
floor a wedding-dress of watered silk a pair of white satin
shoes and a bride's wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked
in water there said he putting a new wedding-ring upon the
top of the pile there is a little nut for you to crack master
holmes

oh indeed said my friend blowing blue rings into the air
you dragged them from the serpentine

no they were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper
they have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me
that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off

by the same brilliant reasoning every man's body is to be found
in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe and pray what did you hope
to arrive at through this

at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance

i am afraid that you will find it difficult

are you indeed now cried lestrade with some bitterness i
am afraid holmes that you are not very practical with your
deductions and your inferences you have made two blunders in as
many minutes this dress does implicate miss flora millar

and how

in the dress is a pocket in the pocket is a card-case in the
card-case is a note and here is the very note he slapped it
down upon the table in front of him listen to this you will
see me when all is ready come at once fhm now my theory all
along has been that lady st simon was decoyed away by flora
millar and that she with confederates no doubt was
responsible for her disappearance here signed with her
initials is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped
into her hand at the door and which lured her within their
reach

very good lestrade said holmes laughing you really are
very fine indeed let me see it he took up the paper in a
listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he
gave a little cry of satisfaction this is indeed important
said he

ha you find it so

extremely so i congratulate you warmly

lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look why he
shrieked you're looking at the wrong side

on the contrary this is the right side

the right side you're mad here is the note written in pencil
over here

and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel
bill which interests me deeply

there's nothing in it i looked at it before said lestrade
oct th rooms s breakfast s d cocktail s lunch s
d glass sherry d i see nothing in that

very likely not it is most important all the same as to the
note it is important also or at least the initials are so i
congratulate you again

i've wasted time enough said lestrade rising i believe in
hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories
good-day mr holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom
of the matter first he gathered up the garments thrust them
into the bag and made for the door

just one hint to you lestrade drawled holmes before his rival
vanished i will tell you the true solution of the matter lady
st simon is a myth there is not and there never has been any
such person

lestrade looked sadly at my companion then he turned to me
tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and
hurried away

he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on
his overcoat there is something in what the fellow says about
outdoor work he remarked so i think watson that i must
leave you to your papers for a little

it was after five o'clock when sherlock holmes left me but i had
no time to be lonely for within an hour there arrived a
confectioner's man with a very large flat box this he unpacked
with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him and
presently to my very great astonishment a quite epicurean
little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble
lodging-house mahogany there were a couple of brace of cold
woodcock a pheasant a pâté de foie gras pie with a group of
ancient and cobwebby bottles having laid out all these luxuries
my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the arabian
nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid
for and were ordered to this address

just before nine o'clock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the
room his features were gravely set but there was a light in his
eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his
conclusions

they have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands

you seem to expect company they have laid for five

yes i fancy we may have some company dropping in said he i
am surprised that lord st simon has not already arrived ha i
fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs

it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in
dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever and with a very
perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features

my messenger reached you then asked holmes

yes and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure
have you good authority for what you say

the best possible

lord st simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his
forehead

what will the duke say he murmured when he hears that one of
the family has been subjected to such humiliation

it is the purest accident i cannot allow that there is any
humiliation

ah you look on these things from another standpoint

i fail to see that anyone is to blame i can hardly see how the
lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of
doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted having no mother she
had no one to advise her at such a crisis

it was a slight sir a public slight said lord st simon
tapping his fingers upon the table

you must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so
unprecedented a position

i will make no allowance i am very angry indeed and i have
been shamefully used

i think that i heard a ring said holmes yes there are steps
on the landing if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view
of the matter lord st simon i have brought an advocate here
who may be more successful he opened the door and ushered in a
lady and gentleman lord st simon said he allow me to
introduce you to mr and mrs francis hay moulton the lady i
think you have already met

at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his
seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand
thrust into the breast of his frock-coat a picture of offended
dignity the lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out
her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes it was
as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was
one which it was hard to resist

you're angry robert said she well i guess you have every
cause to be

pray make no apology to me said lord st simon bitterly

oh yes i know that i have treated you real bad and that i
should have spoken to you before i went but i was kind of
rattled and from the time when i saw frank here again i just
didn't know what i was doing or saying i only wonder i didn't
fall down and do a faint right there before the altar

perhaps mrs moulton you would like my friend and me to leave
the room while you explain this matter

if i may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman
we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business
already for my part i should like all europe and america to
hear the rights of it he was a small wiry sunburnt man
clean-shaven with a sharp face and alert manner

then i'll tell our story right away said the lady frank here
and i met in in mcquire's camp near the rockies where pa
was working a claim we were engaged to each other frank and i
but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile
while poor frank here had a claim that petered out and came to
nothing the richer pa grew the poorer was frank so at last pa
wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took
me away to frisco frank wouldn't throw up his hand though so
he followed me there and he saw me without pa knowing anything
about it it would only have made him mad to know so we just
fixed it all up for ourselves frank said that he would go and
make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had
as much as pa so then i promised to wait for him to the end of
time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived
why shouldn't we be married right away then said he and
then i will feel sure of you and i won't claim to be your
husband until i come back well we talked it over and he had
fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting
that we just did it right there and then frank went off to seek
his fortune and i went back to pa

the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana and then
he went prospecting in arizona and then i heard of him from new
mexico after that came a long newspaper story about how a
miners camp had been attacked by apache indians and there was
my frank's name among the killed i fainted dead away and i was
very sick for months after pa thought i had a decline and took
me to half the doctors in frisco not a word of news came for a
year and more so that i never doubted that frank was really
dead then lord st simon came to frisco and we came to london
and a marriage was arranged and pa was very pleased but i felt
all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
in my heart that had been given to my poor frank

still if i had married lord st simon of course i'd have done
my duty by him we can't command our love but we can our
actions i went to the altar with him with the intention to make
him just as good a wife as it was in me to be but you may
imagine what i felt when just as i came to the altar rails i
glanced back and saw frank standing and looking at me out of the
first pew i thought it was his ghost at first but when i looked
again there he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as
if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to see him i wonder i
didn't drop i know that everything was turning round and the
words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my
ear i didn't know what to do should i stop the service and make
a scene in the church i glanced at him again and he seemed to
know what i was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to
tell me to be still then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper
and i knew that he was writing me a note as i passed his pew on
the way out i dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the
note into my hand when he returned me the flowers it was only a
line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so
of course i never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now
to him and i determined to do just whatever he might direct

when i got back i told my maid who had known him in california
and had always been his friend i ordered her to say nothing but
to get a few things packed and my ulster ready i know i ought to
have spoken to lord st simon but it was dreadful hard before
his mother and all those great people i just made up my mind to
run away and explain afterwards i hadn't been at the table ten
minutes before i saw frank out of the window at the other side of
the road he beckoned to me and then began walking into the park
i slipped out put on my things and followed him some woman
came talking something or other about lord st simon to
me seemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little
secret of his own before marriage also but i managed to get away
from her and soon overtook frank we got into a cab together and
away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square and
that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting frank
had been a prisoner among the apaches had escaped came on to
frisco found that i had given him up for dead and had gone to
england followed me there and had come upon me at last on the
very morning of my second wedding

i saw it in a paper explained the american it gave the name
and the church but not where the lady lived

then we had a talk as to what we should do and frank was all
for openness but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i
should like to vanish away and never see any of them again just
sending a line to pa perhaps to show him that i was alive it
was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting
round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back so
frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of
them so that i should not be traced and dropped them away
somewhere where no one could find them it is likely that we
should have gone on to paris to-morrow only that this good
gentleman mr holmes came round to us this evening though how
he found us is more than i can think and he showed us very
clearly and kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right and
that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so
secret then he offered to give us a chance of talking to lord
st simon alone and so we came right away round to his rooms at
once now robert you have heard it all and i am very sorry if
i have given you pain and i hope that you do not think very
meanly of me

lord st simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but
had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this
long narrative

excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most
intimate personal affairs in this public manner

then you won't forgive me you won't shake hands before i go

oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure he put out
his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him

i had hoped suggested holmes that you would have joined us
in a friendly supper

i think that there you ask a little too much responded his
lordship i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent
developments but i can hardly be expected to make merry over
them i think that with your permission i will now wish you all a
very good-night he included us all in a sweeping bow and
stalked out of the room

then i trust that you at least will honour me with your
company said sherlock holmes it is always a joy to meet an
american mr moulton for i am one of those who believe that the
folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone
years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens
of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a
quartering of the union jack with the stars and stripes

the case has been an interesting one remarked holmes when our
visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how
simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight
seems to be almost inexplicable nothing could be more natural
than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing
stranger than the result when viewed for instance by mr
lestrade of scotland yard

you were not yourself at fault at all then

from the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that
the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony
the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of
returning home obviously something had occurred during the
morning then to cause her to change her mind what could that
something be she could not have spoken to anyone when she was
out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom had she
seen someone then if she had it must be someone from america
because she had spent so short a time in this country that she
could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence
over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change
her plans so completely you see we have already arrived by a
process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an
american then who could this american be and why should he
possess so much influence over her it might be a lover it might
be a husband her young womanhood had i knew been spent in
rough scenes and under strange conditions so far i had got
before i ever heard lord st simon's narrative when he told us
of a man in a pew of the change in the bride's manner of so
transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a
bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and of her very
significant allusion to claim-jumping which in miners parlance
means taking possession of that which another person has a prior
claim to the whole situation became absolutely clear she had
gone off with a man and the man was either a lover or was a
previous husband the chances being in favour of the latter

and how in the world did you find them

it might have been difficult but friend lestrade held
information in his hands the value of which he did not himself
know the initials were of course of the highest importance
but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had
settled his bill at one of the most select london hotels

how did you deduce the select

by the select prices eight shillings for a bed and eightpence
for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive
hotels there are not many in london which charge at that rate
in the second one which i visited in northumberland avenue i
learned by an inspection of the book that francis h moulton an
american gentleman had left only the day before and on looking
over the entries against him i came upon the very items which i
had seen in the duplicate bill his letters were to be forwarded
to gordon square so thither i travelled and being fortunate
enough to find the loving couple at home i ventured to give them
some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
better in every way that they should make their position a little
clearer both to the general public and to lord st simon in
particular i invited them to meet him here and as you see i
made him keep the appointment

but with no very good result i remarked his conduct was
certainly not very gracious

ah watson said holmes smiling perhaps you would not be
very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and
wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of
fortune i think that we may judge lord st simon very mercifully
and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in
the same position draw your chair up and hand me my violin for
the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away
these bleak autumnal evenings



xi the adventure of the beryl coronet

holmes said i as i stood one morning in our bow-window looking
down the street here is a madman coming along it seems rather
sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone

my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands
in the pockets of his dressing-gown looking over my shoulder it
was a bright crisp february morning and the snow of the day
before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the
wintry sun down the centre of baker street it had been ploughed
into a brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and
on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as
when it fell the grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but
was still dangerously slippery so that there were fewer
passengers than usual indeed from the direction of the
metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman
whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention

he was a man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with a
massive strongly marked face and a commanding figure he was
dressed in a sombre yet rich style in black frock-coat shining
hat neat brown gaiters and well-cut pearl-grey trousers yet
his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
and features for he was running hard with occasional little
springs such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to
set any tax upon his legs as he ran he jerked his hands up and
down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most
extraordinary contortions

what on earth can be the matter with him i asked he is
looking up at the numbers of the houses

i believe that he is coming here said holmes rubbing his
hands

here

yes i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally i
think that i recognise the symptoms ha did i not tell you as
he spoke the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and
pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the
clanging

a few moments later he was in our room still puffing still
gesticulating but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in
his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and
pity for a while he could not get his words out but swayed his
body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the
extreme limits of his reason then suddenly springing to his
feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we
both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room
sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and sitting
beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy
soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ

you have come to me to tell your story have you not said he
you are fatigued with your haste pray wait until you have
recovered yourself and then i shall be most happy to look into
any little problem which you may submit to me

the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest fighting
against his emotion then he passed his handkerchief over his
brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us

no doubt you think me mad said he

i see that you have had some great trouble responded holmes

god knows i have a trouble which is enough to unseat my
reason so sudden and so terrible is it public disgrace i might
have faced although i am a man whose character has never yet
borne a stain private affliction also is the lot of every man
but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have
been enough to shake my very soul besides it is not i alone
the very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found
out of this horrible affair

pray compose yourself sir said holmes and let me have a
clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen
you

my name answered our visitor is probably familiar to your
ears i am alexander holder of the banking firm of holder 
stevenson of threadneedle street

the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior
partner in the second largest private banking concern in the city
of london what could have happened then to bring one of the
foremost citizens of london to this most pitiable pass we
waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced
himself to tell his story

i feel that time is of value said he that is why i hastened
here when the police inspector suggested that i should secure
your co-operation i came to baker street by the underground and
hurried from there on foot for the cabs go slowly through this
snow that is why i was so out of breath for i am a man who
takes very little exercise i feel better now and i will put the
facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as i can

it is of course well known to you that in a successful banking
business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
and the number of our depositors one of our most lucrative means
of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security
is unimpeachable we have done a good deal in this direction
during the last few years and there are many noble families to
whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their
pictures libraries or plate

yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a
card was brought in to me by one of the clerks i started when i
saw the name for it was that of none other than well perhaps
even to you i had better say no more than that it was a name
which is a household word all over the earth one of the highest
noblest most exalted names in england i was overwhelmed by the
honour and attempted when he entered to say so but he plunged
at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry
quickly through a disagreeable task

mr holder said he i have been informed that you are in the
habit of advancing money

the firm does so when the security is good i answered

it is absolutely essential to me said he that i should have
 pounds at once i could of course borrow so trifling a
sum ten times over from my friends but i much prefer to make it
a matter of business and to carry out that business myself in my
position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place
one's self under obligations

for how long may i ask do you want this sum i asked

next monday i have a large sum due to me and i shall then most
certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you
think it right to charge but it is very essential to me that the
money should be paid at once

i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my
own private purse said i were it not that the strain would be
rather more than it could bear if on the other hand i am to do
it in the name of the firm then in justice to my partner i must
insist that even in your case every businesslike precaution
should be taken

i should much prefer to have it so said he raising up a
square black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair
you have doubtless heard of the beryl coronet

one of the most precious public possessions of the empire
said i

precisely he opened the case and there imbedded in soft
flesh-coloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery
which he had named there are thirty-nine enormous beryls said
he and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable the
lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the
sum which i have asked i am prepared to leave it with you as my
security

i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some
perplexity from it to my illustrious client

you doubt its value he asked

not at all i only doubt 

the propriety of my leaving it you may set your mind at rest
about that i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely
certain that i should be able in four days to reclaim it it is a
pure matter of form is the security sufficient

ample

you understand mr holder that i am giving you a strong proof
of the confidence which i have in you founded upon all that i
have heard of you i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to
refrain from all gossip upon the matter but above all to
preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because i
need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any
harm were to befall it any injury to it would be almost as
serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the
world to match these and it would be impossible to replace them
i leave it with you however with every confidence and i shall
call for it in person on monday morning

seeing that my client was anxious to leave i said no more but
calling for my cashier i ordered him to pay over fifty 
pound notes when i was alone once more however with the
precious case lying upon the table in front of me i could not
but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
which it entailed upon me there could be no doubt that as it
was a national possession a horrible scandal would ensue if any
misfortune should occur to it i already regretted having ever
consented to take charge of it however it was too late to alter
the matter now so i locked it up in my private safe and turned
once more to my work

when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave
so precious a thing in the office behind me bankers safes had
been forced before now and why should not mine be if so how
terrible would be the position in which i should find myself i
determined therefore that for the next few days i would always
carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might
never be really out of my reach with this intention i called a
cab and drove out to my house at streatham carrying the jewel
with me i did not breathe freely until i had taken it upstairs
and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room

and now a word as to my household mr holmes for i wish you to
thoroughly understand the situation my groom and my page sleep
out of the house and may be set aside altogether i have three
maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose
absolute reliability is quite above suspicion another lucy
parr the second waiting-maid has only been in my service a few
months she came with an excellent character however and has
always given me satisfaction she is a very pretty girl and has
attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place
that is the only drawback which we have found to her but we
believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way

so much for the servants my family itself is so small that it
will not take me long to describe it i am a widower and have an
only son arthur he has been a disappointment to me mr
holmes a grievous disappointment i have no doubt that i am
myself to blame people tell me that i have spoiled him very
likely i have when my dear wife died i felt that he was all i
had to love i could not bear to see the smile fade even for a
moment from his face i have never denied him a wish perhaps it
would have been better for both of us had i been sterner but i
meant it for the best

it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
business but he was not of a business turn he was wild
wayward and to speak the truth i could not trust him in the
handling of large sums of money when he was young he became a
member of an aristocratic club and there having charming
manners he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long
purses and expensive habits he learned to play heavily at cards
and to squander money on the turf until he had again and again
to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
allowance that he might settle his debts of honour he tried
more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he
was keeping but each time the influence of his friend sir
george burnwell was enough to draw him back again

and indeed i could not wonder that such a man as sir george
burnwell should gain an influence over him for he has frequently
brought him to my house and i have found myself that i could
hardly resist the fascination of his manner he is older than
arthur a man of the world to his finger-tips one who had been
everywhere seen everything a brilliant talker and a man of
great personal beauty yet when i think of him in cold blood far
away from the glamour of his presence i am convinced from his
cynical speech and the look which i have caught in his eyes that
he is one who should be deeply distrusted so i think and so
too thinks my little mary who has a woman's quick insight into
character

and now there is only she to be described she is my niece but
when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the
world i adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my
daughter she is a sunbeam in my house sweet loving beautiful
a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and
gentle as a woman could be she is my right hand i do not know
what i could do without her in only one matter has she ever gone
against my wishes twice my boy has asked her to marry him for
he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him i
think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it
would have been she and that his marriage might have changed his
whole life but now alas it is too late forever too late

now mr holmes you know the people who live under my roof and
i shall continue with my miserable story

when we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after
dinner i told arthur and mary my experience and of the precious
treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name
of my client lucy parr who had brought in the coffee had i am
sure left the room but i cannot swear that the door was closed
mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous
coronet but i thought it better not to disturb it

where have you put it asked arthur

in my own bureau

well i hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the
night said he

it is locked up i answered

oh any old key will fit that bureau when i was a youngster i
have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard

he often had a wild way of talking so that i thought little of
what he said he followed me to my room however that night with
a very grave face

look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you let
me have pounds

no i cannot i answered sharply i have been far too
generous with you in money matters

you have been very kind said he but i must have this money
or else i can never show my face inside the club again

and a very good thing too i cried

yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man
said he i could not bear the disgrace i must raise the money
in some way and if you will not let me have it then i must try
other means

i was very angry for this was the third demand during the
month you shall not have a farthing from me i cried on which
he bowed and left the room without another word

when he was gone i unlocked my bureau made sure that my
treasure was safe and locked it again then i started to go
round the house to see that all was secure a duty which i
usually leave to mary but which i thought it well to perform
myself that night as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself
at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as
i approached

tell me dad said she looking i thought a little
disturbed did you give lucy the maid leave to go out
to-night

certainly not

she came in just now by the back door i have no doubt that she
has only been to the side gate to see someone but i think that
it is hardly safe and should be stopped

you must speak to her in the morning or i will if you prefer
it are you sure that everything is fastened

quite sure dad

then good-night i kissed her and went up to my bedroom
again where i was soon asleep

i am endeavouring to tell you everything mr holmes which may
have any bearing upon the case but i beg that you will question
me upon any point which i do not make clear

on the contrary your statement is singularly lucid

i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be
particularly so i am not a very heavy sleeper and the anxiety
in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual
about two in the morning then i was awakened by some sound in
the house it had ceased ere i was wide awake but it had left an
impression behind it as though a window had gently closed
somewhere i lay listening with all my ears suddenly to my
horror there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in
the next room i slipped out of bed all palpitating with fear
and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door

arthur i screamed you villain you thief how dare you
touch that coronet

the gas was half up as i had left it and my unhappy boy
dressed only in his shirt and trousers was standing beside the
light holding the coronet in his hands he appeared to be
wrenching at it or bending it with all his strength at my cry
he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death i
snatched it up and examined it one of the gold corners with
three of the beryls in it was missing

you blackguard i shouted beside myself with rage you have
destroyed it you have dishonoured me forever where are the
jewels which you have stolen

stolen he cried

yes thief i roared shaking him by the shoulder

there are none missing there cannot be any missing said he

there are three missing and you know where they are must i
call you a liar as well as a thief did i not see you trying to
tear off another piece

you have called me names enough said he i will not stand it
any longer i shall not say another word about this business
since you have chosen to insult me i will leave your house in
the morning and make my own way in the world

you shall leave it in the hands of the police i cried
half-mad with grief and rage i shall have this matter probed to
the bottom

you shall learn nothing from me said he with a passion such
as i should not have thought was in his nature if you choose to
call the police let the police find what they can

by this time the whole house was astir for i had raised my
voice in my anger mary was the first to rush into my room and
at the sight of the coronet and of arthur's face she read the
whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the
ground i sent the house-maid for the police and put the
investigation into their hands at once when the inspector and a
constable entered the house arthur who had stood sullenly with
his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to charge
him with theft i answered that it had ceased to be a private
matter but had become a public one since the ruined coronet was
national property i was determined that the law should have its
way in everything

at least said he you will not have me arrested at once it
would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the
house for five minutes

that you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you
have stolen said i and then realising the dreadful position
in which i was placed i implored him to remember that not only
my honour but that of one who was far greater than i was at
stake and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would
convulse the nation he might avert it all if he would but tell
me what he had done with the three missing stones

you may as well face the matter said i you have been caught
in the act and no confession could make your guilt more heinous
if you but make such reparation as is in your power by telling
us where the beryls are all shall be forgiven and forgotten

keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he answered
turning away from me with a sneer i saw that he was too hardened
for any words of mine to influence him there was but one way for
it i called in the inspector and gave him into custody a search
was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of
every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed
the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the
wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our
threats this morning he was removed to a cell and i after
going through all the police formalities have hurried round to
you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter
the police have openly confessed that they can at present make
nothing of it you may go to any expense which you think
necessary i have already offered a reward of pounds my
god what shall i do i have lost my honour my gems and my son
in one night oh what shall i do

he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to
and fro droning to himself like a child whose grief has got
beyond words

sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows
knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire

do you receive much company he asked

none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of
arthur's sir george burnwell has been several times lately no
one else i think

do you go out much in society

arthur does mary and i stay at home we neither of us care for
it

that is unusual in a young girl

she is of a quiet nature besides she is not so very young she
is four-and-twenty

this matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to
her also

terrible she is even more affected than i

you have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt

how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet
in his hands

i hardly consider that a conclusive proof was the remainder of
the coronet at all injured

yes it was twisted

do you not think then that he might have been trying to
straighten it

god bless you you are doing what you can for him and for me
but it is too heavy a task what was he doing there at all if
his purpose were innocent why did he not say so

precisely and if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie
his silence appears to me to cut both ways there are several
singular points about the case what did the police think of the
noise which awoke you from your sleep

they considered that it might be caused by arthur's closing his
bedroom door

a likely story as if a man bent on felony would slam his door
so as to wake a household what did they say then of the
disappearance of these gems

they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture
in the hope of finding them

have they thought of looking outside the house

yes they have shown extraordinary energy the whole garden has
already been minutely examined

now my dear sir said holmes is it not obvious to you now
that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you
or the police were at first inclined to think it appeared to you
to be a simple case to me it seems exceedingly complex consider
what is involved by your theory you suppose that your son came
down from his bed went at great risk to your dressing-room
opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by main
force a small portion of it went off to some other place
concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine with such skill that
nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirty-six
into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger
of being discovered i ask you now is such a theory tenable

but what other is there cried the banker with a gesture of
despair if his motives were innocent why does he not explain
them

it is our task to find that out replied holmes so now if
you please mr holder we will set off for streatham together
and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into
details

my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition
which i was eager enough to do for my curiosity and sympathy
were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened i
confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be
as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still i had such
faith in holmes judgment that i felt that there must be some
grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted
explanation he hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the
southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his breast and his
hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought our client
appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
which had been presented to him and he even broke into a
desultory chat with me over his business affairs a short railway
journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank the modest
residence of the great financier

fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone standing
back a little from the road a double carriage-sweep with a
snow-clad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates
which closed the entrance on the right side was a small wooden
thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges
stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the
tradesmen's entrance on the left ran a lane which led to the
stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a
public though little used thoroughfare holmes left us standing
at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the
front down the tradesmen's path and so round by the garden
behind into the stable lane so long was he that mr holder and i
went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should
return we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and
a young lady came in she was rather above the middle height
slim with dark hair and eyes which seemed the darker against
the absolute pallor of her skin i do not think that i have ever
seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face her lips too were
bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying as she swept
silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of
grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the
more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong
character with immense capacity for self-restraint disregarding
my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand
over his head with a sweet womanly caress

you have given orders that arthur should be liberated have you
not dad she asked

no no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom

but i am so sure that he is innocent you know what woman's
instincts are i know that he has done no harm and that you will
be sorry for having acted so harshly

why is he silent then if he is innocent

who knows perhaps because he was so angry that you should
suspect him

how could i help suspecting him when i actually saw him with
the coronet in his hand

oh but he had only picked it up to look at it oh do do take
my word for it that he is innocent let the matter drop and say
no more it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in
prison

i shall never let it drop until the gems are found never mary
your affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences
to me far from hushing the thing up i have brought a gentleman
down from london to inquire more deeply into it

this gentleman she asked facing round to me

no his friend he wished us to leave him alone he is round in
the stable lane now

the stable lane she raised her dark eyebrows what can he
hope to find there ah this i suppose is he i trust sir
that you will succeed in proving what i feel sure is the truth
that my cousin arthur is innocent of this crime

i fully share your opinion and i trust with you that we may
prove it returned holmes going back to the mat to knock the
snow from his shoes i believe i have the honour of addressing
miss mary holder might i ask you a question or two

pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up

you heard nothing yourself last night

nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly i heard
that and i came down

you shut up the windows and doors the night before did you
fasten all the windows

yes

were they all fastened this morning

yes

you have a maid who has a sweetheart i think that you remarked
to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him

yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room and
who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet

i see you infer that she may have gone out to tell her
sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery

but what is the good of all these vague theories cried the
banker impatiently when i have told you that i saw arthur with
the coronet in his hands

wait a little mr holder we must come back to that about this
girl miss holder you saw her return by the kitchen door i
presume

yes when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i
met her slipping in i saw the man too in the gloom

do you know him

oh yes he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round
his name is francis prosper

he stood said holmes to the left of the door that is to
say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door

yes he did

and he is a man with a wooden leg

something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive
black eyes why you are like a magician said she how do you
know that she smiled but there was no answering smile in
holmes thin eager face

i should be very glad now to go upstairs said he i shall
probably wish to go over the outside of the house again perhaps
i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go up

he walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at
the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane
this he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill
with his powerful magnifying lens now we shall go upstairs
said he at last

the banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little
chamber with a grey carpet a large bureau and a long mirror
holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock

which key was used to open it he asked

that which my son himself indicated that of the cupboard of the
lumber-room

have you it here

that is it on the dressing-table

sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau

it is a noiseless lock said he it is no wonder that it did
not wake you this case i presume contains the coronet we must
have a look at it he opened the case and taking out the diadem
he laid it upon the table it was a magnificent specimen of the
jeweller's art and the thirty-six stones were the finest that i
have ever seen at one side of the coronet was a cracked edge
where a corner holding three gems had been torn away

now mr holder said holmes here is the corner which
corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost might i
beg that you will break it off

the banker recoiled in horror i should not dream of trying
said he

then i will holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it but
without result i feel it give a little said he but though
i am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my
time to break it an ordinary man could not do it now what do
you think would happen if i did break it mr holder there would
be a noise like a pistol shot do you tell me that all this
happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard
nothing of it

i do not know what to think it is all dark to me

but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go what do you think
miss holder

i confess that i still share my uncle's perplexity

your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him

he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt

thank you we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary
luck during this inquiry and it will be entirely our own fault
if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up with your
permission mr holder i shall now continue my investigations
outside

he went alone at his own request for he explained that any
unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult for an
hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet
heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever

i think that i have seen now all that there is to see mr
holder said he i can serve you best by returning to my
rooms

but the gems mr holmes where are they

i cannot tell

the banker wrung his hands i shall never see them again he
cried and my son you give me hopes

my opinion is in no way altered

then for god's sake what was this dark business which was
acted in my house last night

if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms to-morrow
morning between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to
make it clearer i understand that you give me carte blanche to
act for you provided only that i get back the gems and that you
place no limit on the sum i may draw

i would give my fortune to have them back

very good i shall look into the matter between this and then
good-bye it is just possible that i may have to come over here
again before evening

it was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up
about the case although what his conclusions were was more than
i could even dimly imagine several times during our homeward
journey i endeavoured to sound him upon the point but he always
glided away to some other topic until at last i gave it over in
despair it was not yet three when we found ourselves in our
rooms once more he hurried to his chamber and was down again in
a few minutes dressed as a common loafer with his collar turned
up his shiny seedy coat his red cravat and his worn boots he
was a perfect sample of the class

i think that this should do said he glancing into the glass
above the fireplace i only wish that you could come with me
watson but i fear that it won't do i may be on the trail in
this matter or i may be following a will-o-the-wisp but i
shall soon know which it is i hope that i may be back in a few
hours he cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard
sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this
rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition

i had just finished my tea when he returned evidently in
excellent spirits swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his
hand he chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a
cup of tea

i only looked in as i passed said he i am going right on

where to

oh to the other side of the west end it may be some time
before i get back don't wait up for me in case i should be
late

how are you getting on

oh so so nothing to complain of i have been out to streatham
since i saw you last but i did not call at the house it is a
very sweet little problem and i would not have missed it for a
good deal however i must not sit gossiping here but must get
these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly
respectable self

i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for
satisfaction than his words alone would imply his eyes twinkled
and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks he
hastened upstairs and a few minutes later i heard the slam of
the hall door which told me that he was off once more upon his
congenial hunt

i waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so
i retired to my room it was no uncommon thing for him to be away
for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent so that
his lateness caused me no surprise i do not know at what hour he
came in but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there
he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the
other as fresh and trim as possible

you will excuse my beginning without you watson said he but
you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this
morning

why it is after nine now i answered i should not be
surprised if that were he i thought i heard a ring

it was indeed our friend the financier i was shocked by the
change which had come over him for his face which was naturally
of a broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in
while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter he entered
with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than
his violence of the morning before and he dropped heavily into
the armchair which i pushed forward for him

i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried said
he only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man without
a care in the world now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured
age one sorrow comes close upon the heels of another my niece
mary has deserted me

deserted you

yes her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was
empty and a note for me lay upon the hall table i had said to
her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had
married my boy all might have been well with him perhaps it was
thoughtless of me to say so it is to that remark that she refers
in this note

my dearest uncle i feel that i have brought trouble upon you
and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune
might never have occurred i cannot with this thought in my
mind ever again be happy under your roof and i feel that i must
leave you forever do not worry about my future for that is
provided for and above all do not search for me for it will
be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me in life or in
death i am ever your loving mary

what could she mean by that note mr holmes do you think it
points to suicide

no no nothing of the kind it is perhaps the best possible
solution i trust mr holder that you are nearing the end of
your troubles

ha you say so you have heard something mr holmes you have
learned something where are the gems

you would not think pounds apiece an excessive sum for
them

i would pay ten

that would be unnecessary three thousand will cover the matter
and there is a little reward i fancy have you your check-book
here is a pen better make it out for pounds

with a dazed face the banker made out the required check holmes
walked over to his desk took out a little triangular piece of
gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table

with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up

you have it he gasped i am saved i am saved

the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and
he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom

there is one other thing you owe mr holder said sherlock
holmes rather sternly

owe he caught up a pen name the sum and i will pay it

no the debt is not to me you owe a very humble apology to that
noble lad your son who has carried himself in this matter as i
should be proud to see my own son do should i ever chance to
have one

then it was not arthur who took them

i told you yesterday and i repeat to-day that it was not

you are sure of it then let us hurry to him at once to let him
know that the truth is known

he knows it already when i had cleared it all up i had an
interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the
story i told it to him on which he had to confess that i was
right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite
clear to me your news of this morning however may open his
lips

for heaven's sake tell me then what is this extraordinary
mystery

i will do so and i will show you the steps by which i reached
it and let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me
to say and for you to hear there has been an understanding
between sir george burnwell and your niece mary they have now
fled together

my mary impossible

it is unfortunately more than possible it is certain neither
you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you
admitted him into your family circle he is one of the most
dangerous men in england a ruined gambler an absolutely
desperate villain a man without heart or conscience your niece
knew nothing of such men when he breathed his vows to her as he
had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she
alone had touched his heart the devil knows best what he said
but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing
him nearly every evening

i cannot and i will not believe it cried the banker with an
ashen face

i will tell you then what occurred in your house last night
your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room
slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which
leads into the stable lane his footmarks had pressed right
through the snow so long had he stood there she told him of the
coronet his wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he
bent her to his will i have no doubt that she loved you but
there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all
other loves and i think that she must have been one she had
hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
downstairs on which she closed the window rapidly and told you
about one of the servants escapade with her wooden-legged lover
which was all perfectly true

your boy arthur went to bed after his interview with you but
he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts
in the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door
so he rose and looking out was surprised to see his cousin
walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared
into your dressing-room petrified with astonishment the lad
slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what
would come of this strange affair presently she emerged from the
room again and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw
that she carried the precious coronet in her hands she passed
down the stairs and he thrilling with horror ran along and
slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see
what passed in the hall beneath he saw her stealthily open the
window hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom and then
closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close
to where he stood hid behind the curtain

as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action
without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved but the
instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune
this would be for you and how all-important it was to set it
right he rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened
the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane
where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight sir george
burnwell tried to get away but arthur caught him and there was
a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the
coronet and his opponent at the other in the scuffle your son
struck sir george and cut him over the eye then something
suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet
in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your
room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in
the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you
appeared upon the scene

is it possible gasped the banker

you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when
he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks he could not
explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who
certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands he
took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her
secret

and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the
coronet cried mr holder oh my god what a blind fool i have
been and his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes
the dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the
scene of the struggle how cruelly i have misjudged him

when i arrived at the house continued holmes i at once went
very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in
the snow which might help me i knew that none had fallen since
the evening before and also that there had been a strong frost
to preserve impressions i passed along the tradesmen's path but
found it all trampled down and indistinguishable just beyond it
however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had stood
and talked with a man whose round impressions on one side showed
that he had a wooden leg i could even tell that they had been
disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was
shown by the deep toe and light heel marks while wooden-leg had
waited a little and then had gone away i thought at the time
that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had
already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was so i passed
round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks
which i took to be the police but when i got into the stable
lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in
front of me

there was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second
double line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked
feet i was at once convinced from what you had told me that the
latter was your son the first had walked both ways but the
other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over
the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed
after the other i followed them up and found they led to the
hall window where boots had worn all the snow away while
waiting then i walked to the other end which was a hundred
yards or more down the lane i saw where boots had faced round
where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle
and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me
that i was not mistaken boots had then run down the lane and
another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been
hurt when he came to the highroad at the other end i found that
the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue

on entering the house however i examined as you remember the
sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and i could
at once see that someone had passed out i could distinguish the
outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming
in i was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what
had occurred a man had waited outside the window someone had
brought the gems the deed had been overseen by your son he had
pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged
at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which
neither alone could have effected he had returned with the
prize but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent so
far i was clear the question now was who was the man and who
was it brought him the coronet

it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the
truth now i knew that it was not you who had brought it down
so there only remained your niece and the maids but if it were
the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in
their place there could be no possible reason as he loved his
cousin however there was an excellent explanation why he should
retain her secret the more so as the secret was a disgraceful
one when i remembered that you had seen her at that window and
how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture
became a certainty

and who could it be who was her confederate a lover evidently
for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must
feel to you i knew that you went out little and that your
circle of friends was a very limited one but among them was sir
george burnwell i had heard of him before as being a man of evil
reputation among women it must have been he who wore those boots
and retained the missing gems even though he knew that arthur
had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was
safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his
own family

well your own good sense will suggest what measures i took
next i went in the shape of a loafer to sir george's house
managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that
his master had cut his head the night before and finally at
the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of
his cast-off shoes with these i journeyed down to streatham and
saw that they exactly fitted the tracks

i saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening
said mr holder

precisely it was i i found that i had my man so i came home
and changed my clothes it was a delicate part which i had to
play then for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert
scandal and i knew that so astute a villain would see that our
hands were tied in the matter i went and saw him at first of
course he denied everything but when i gave him every
particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a
life-preserver from the wall i knew my man however and i
clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike then he
became a little more reasonable i told him that we would give
him a price for the stones he held pounds apiece that
brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown why
dash it all said he i've let them go at six hundred for the
three i soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had
them on promising him that there would be no prosecution off i
set to him and after much chaffering i got our stones at 
pounds apiece then i looked in upon your son told him that all
was right and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock after
what i may call a really hard day's work

a day which has saved england from a great public scandal said
the banker rising sir i cannot find words to thank you but
you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done your
skill has indeed exceeded all that i have heard of it and now i
must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which i
have done him as to what you tell me of poor mary it goes to my
very heart not even your skill can inform me where she is now

i think that we may safely say returned holmes that she is
wherever sir george burnwell is it is equally certain too that
whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than
sufficient punishment



xii the adventure of the copper beeches

to the man who loves art for its own sake remarked sherlock
holmes tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the daily
telegraph it is frequently in its least important and lowliest
manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived it is
pleasant to me to observe watson that you have so far grasped
this truth that in these little records of our cases which you
have been good enough to draw up and i am bound to say
occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much
to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which i
have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
trivial in themselves but which have given room for those
faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made
my special province

and yet said i smiling i cannot quite hold myself absolved
from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my
records

you have erred perhaps he observed taking up a glowing
cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood
pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a
disputatious rather than a meditative mood you have erred
perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your
statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing
upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is
really the only notable feature about the thing

it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter
i remarked with some coldness for i was repelled by the egotism
which i had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my
friend's singular character

no it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as
was his wont my thoughts rather than my words if i claim full
justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thing a
thing beyond myself crime is common logic is rare therefore it
is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should
dwell you have degraded what should have been a course of
lectures into a series of tales

it was a cold morning of the early spring and we sat after
breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at
baker street a thick fog rolled down between the lines of
dun-coloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark
shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths our gas was lit
and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for
the table had not been cleared yet sherlock holmes had been
silent all the morning dipping continuously into the
advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last
having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very
sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings

at the same time he remarked after a pause during which he
had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire
you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of
these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself
in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense
at all the small matter in which i endeavoured to help the king
of bohemia the singular experience of miss mary sutherland the
problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the
incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are
outside the pale of the law but in avoiding the sensational i
fear that you may have bordered on the trivial

the end may have been so i answered but the methods i hold
to have been novel and of interest

pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant
public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a
compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of
analysis and deduction but indeed if you are trivial i cannot
blame you for the days of the great cases are past man or at
least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality as
to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an
agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to
young ladies from boarding-schools i think that i have touched
bottom at last however this note i had this morning marks my
zero-point i fancy read it he tossed a crumpled letter across
to me

it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening and
ran thus

dear mr holmes i am very anxious to consult you as to whether
i should or should not accept a situation which has been offered
to me as governess i shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if i
do not inconvenience you yours faithfully
 violet hunter

do you know the young lady i asked

not i

it is half-past ten now

yes and i have no doubt that is her ring

it may turn out to be of more interest than you think you
remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle which appeared to
be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investigation
it may be so in this case also

well let us hope so but our doubts will very soon be solved
for here unless i am much mistaken is the person in question

as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room
she was plainly but neatly dressed with a bright quick face
freckled like a plover's egg and with the brisk manner of a
woman who has had her own way to make in the world

you will excuse my troubling you i am sure said she as my
companion rose to greet her but i have had a very strange
experience and as i have no parents or relations of any sort
from whom i could ask advice i thought that perhaps you would be
kind enough to tell me what i should do

pray take a seat miss hunter i shall be happy to do anything
that i can to serve you

i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner
and speech of his new client he looked her over in his searching
fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and
his finger-tips together to listen to her story

i have been a governess for five years said she in the
family of colonel spence munro but two months ago the colonel
received an appointment at halifax in nova scotia and took his
children over to america with him so that i found myself without
a situation i advertised and i answered advertisements but
without success at last the little money which i had saved began
to run short and i was at my wit's end as to what i should do

there is a well-known agency for governesses in the west end
called westaway's and there i used to call about once a week in
order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me
westaway was the name of the founder of the business but it is
really managed by miss stoper she sits in her own little office
and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom
and are then shown in one by one when she consults her ledgers
and sees whether she has anything which would suit them

well when i called last week i was shown into the little office
as usual but i found that miss stoper was not alone a
prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy
chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at
her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose looking very
earnestly at the ladies who entered as i came in he gave quite a
jump in his chair and turned quickly to miss stoper

that will do said he i could not ask for anything better
capital capital he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his
hands together in the most genial fashion he was such a
comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at
him

you are looking for a situation miss he asked

yes sir

as governess

yes sir

and what salary do you ask

i had pounds a month in my last place with colonel spence
munro

oh tut tut sweating rank sweating he cried throwing his
fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling
passion how could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with
such attractions and accomplishments

my accomplishments sir may be less than you imagine said i
a little french a little german music and drawing 

tut tut he cried this is all quite beside the question
the point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment
of a lady there it is in a nutshell if you have not you are
not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a
considerable part in the history of the country but if you have
why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to
accept anything under the three figures your salary with me
madam would commence at pounds a year

you may imagine mr holmes that to me destitute as i was
such an offer seemed almost too good to be true the gentleman
however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face
opened a pocket-book and took out a note

it is also my custom said he smiling in the most pleasant
fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid
the white creases of his face to advance to my young ladies
half their salary beforehand so that they may meet any little
expenses of their journey and their wardrobe

it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so
thoughtful a man as i was already in debt to my tradesmen the
advance was a great convenience and yet there was something
unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know
a little more before i quite committed myself

may i ask where you live sir said i

hampshire charming rural place the copper beeches five miles
on the far side of winchester it is the most lovely country my
dear young lady and the dearest old country-house

and my duties sir i should be glad to know what they would
be

one child one dear little romper just six years old oh if
you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper smack
smack smack three gone before you could wink he leaned back
in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again

i was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement
but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was
joking

my sole duties then i asked are to take charge of a single
child

no no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he
cried your duty would be as i am sure your good sense would
suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided
always that they were such commands as a lady might with
propriety obey you see no difficulty heh

i should be happy to make myself useful

quite so in dress now for example we are faddy people you
know faddy but kind-hearted if you were asked to wear any dress
which we might give you you would not object to our little whim
heh

no said i considerably astonished at his words

or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to
you

oh no

or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us

i could hardly believe my ears as you may observe mr holmes
my hair is somewhat luxuriant and of a rather peculiar tint of
chestnut it has been considered artistic i could not dream of
sacrificing it in this offhand fashion

i am afraid that that is quite impossible said i he had been
watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and i could see a
shadow pass over his face as i spoke

i am afraid that it is quite essential said he it is a
little fancy of my wife's and ladies fancies you know madam
ladies fancies must be consulted and so you won't cut your
hair

no sir i really could not i answered firmly

ah very well then that quite settles the matter it is a
pity because in other respects you would really have done very
nicely in that case miss stoper i had best inspect a few more
of your young ladies

the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers
without a word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so
much annoyance upon her face that i could not help suspecting
that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal

do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she asked

if you please miss stoper

well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the
most excellent offers in this fashion said she sharply you
can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such
opening for you good-day to you miss hunter she struck a gong
upon the table and i was shown out by the page

well mr holmes when i got back to my lodgings and found
little enough in the cupboard and two or three bills upon the
table i began to ask myself whether i had not done a very
foolish thing after all if these people had strange fads and
expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were
at least ready to pay for their eccentricity very few
governesses in england are getting pounds a year besides
what use was my hair to me many people are improved by wearing
it short and perhaps i should be among the number next day i was
inclined to think that i had made a mistake and by the day after
i was sure of it i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go
back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open
when i received this letter from the gentleman himself i have it
here and i will read it to you

 the copper beeches near winchester
dear miss hunter miss stoper has very kindly given me your
address and i write from here to ask you whether you have
reconsidered your decision my wife is very anxious that you
should come for she has been much attracted by my description of
you we are willing to give pounds a quarter or pounds a
year so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which
our fads may cause you they are not very exacting after all my
wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would
like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning you need
not however go to the expense of purchasing one as we have one
belonging to my dear daughter alice now in philadelphia which
would i should think fit you very well then as to sitting
here or there or amusing yourself in any manner indicated that
need cause you no inconvenience as regards your hair it is no
doubt a pity especially as i could not help remarking its beauty
during our short interview but i am afraid that i must remain
firm upon this point and i only hope that the increased salary
may recompense you for the loss your duties as far as the child
is concerned are very light now do try to come and i shall
meet you with the dog-cart at winchester let me know your train
yours faithfully jephro rucastle

that is the letter which i have just received mr holmes and
my mind is made up that i will accept it i thought however
that before taking the final step i should like to submit the
whole matter to your consideration

well miss hunter if your mind is made up that settles the
question said holmes smiling

but you would not advise me to refuse

i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to
see a sister of mine apply for

what is the meaning of it all mr holmes

ah i have no data i cannot tell perhaps you have yourself
formed some opinion

well there seems to me to be only one possible solution mr
rucastle seemed to be a very kind good-natured man is it not
possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the
matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum and that
he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an
outbreak

that is a possible solution in fact as matters stand it is
the most probable one but in any case it does not seem to be a
nice household for a young lady

but the money mr holmes the money

well yes of course the pay is good too good that is what
makes me uneasy why should they give you pounds a year when
they could have their pick for pounds there must be some
strong reason behind

i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would
understand afterwards if i wanted your help i should feel so
much stronger if i felt that you were at the back of me

oh you may carry that feeling away with you i assure you that
your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has
come my way for some months there is something distinctly novel
about some of the features if you should find yourself in doubt
or in danger 

danger what danger do you foresee

holmes shook his head gravely it would cease to be a danger if
we could define it said he but at any time day or night a
telegram would bring me down to your help

that is enough she rose briskly from her chair with the
anxiety all swept from her face i shall go down to hampshire
quite easy in my mind now i shall write to mr rucastle at once
sacrifice my poor hair to-night and start for winchester
to-morrow with a few grateful words to holmes she bade us both
good-night and bustled off upon her way

at least said i as we heard her quick firm steps descending
the stairs she seems to be a young lady who is very well able
to take care of herself

and she would need to be said holmes gravely i am much
mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past

it was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled
a fortnight went by during which i frequently found my thoughts
turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of
human experience this lonely woman had strayed into the unusual
salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to
something abnormal though whether a fad or a plot or whether
the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was quite beyond
my powers to determine as to holmes i observed that he sat
frequently for half an hour on end with knitted brows and an
abstracted air but he swept the matter away with a wave of his
hand when i mentioned it data data data he cried
impatiently i can't make bricks without clay and yet he would
always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever
have accepted such a situation

the telegram which we eventually received came late one night
just as i was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down
to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently
indulged in when i would leave him stooping over a retort and a
test-tube at night and find him in the same position when i came
down to breakfast in the morning he opened the yellow envelope
and then glancing at the message threw it across to me

just look up the trains in bradshaw said he and turned back
to his chemical studies

the summons was a brief and urgent one

please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday
to-morrow it said do come i am at my wit's end hunter

will you come with me asked holmes glancing up

i should wish to

just look it up then

there is a train at half-past nine said i glancing over my
bradshaw it is due at winchester at 

that will do very nicely then perhaps i had better postpone my
analysis of the acetones as we may need to be at our best in the
morning

by eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the
old english capital holmes had been buried in the morning papers
all the way down but after we had passed the hampshire border he
threw them down and began to admire the scenery it was an ideal
spring day a light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white
clouds drifting across from west to east the sun was shining
very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air
which set an edge to a man's energy all over the countryside
away to the rolling hills around aldershot the little red and
grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light
green of the new foliage

are they not fresh and beautiful i cried with all the
enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of baker street

but holmes shook his head gravely

do you know watson said he that it is one of the curses of
a mind with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with
reference to my own special subject you look at these scattered
houses and you are impressed by their beauty i look at them
and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their
isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed
there

good heavens i cried who would associate crime with these
dear old homesteads

they always fill me with a certain horror it is my belief
watson founded upon my experience that the lowest and vilest
alleys in london do not present a more dreadful record of sin
than does the smiling and beautiful countryside

you horrify me

but the reason is very obvious the pressure of public opinion
can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish there is no
lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of
a drunkard's blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among
the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever
so close that a word of complaint can set it going and there is
but a step between the crime and the dock but look at these
lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part
with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law think of the
deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on
year in year out in such places and none the wiser had this
lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester i
should never have had a fear for her it is the five miles of
country which makes the danger still it is clear that she is
not personally threatened

no if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away

quite so she has her freedom

what can be the matter then can you suggest no explanation

i have devised seven separate explanations each of which would
cover the facts as far as we know them but which of these is
correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we
shall no doubt find waiting for us well there is the tower of
the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that miss hunter has
to tell

the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street at no
distance from the station and there we found the young lady
waiting for us she had engaged a sitting-room and our lunch
awaited us upon the table

i am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly it
is so very kind of you both but indeed i do not know what i
should do your advice will be altogether invaluable to me

pray tell us what has happened to you

i will do so and i must be quick for i have promised mr
rucastle to be back before three i got his leave to come into
town this morning though he little knew for what purpose

let us have everything in its due order holmes thrust his long
thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen

in the first place i may say that i have met on the whole
with no actual ill-treatment from mr and mrs rucastle it is
only fair to them to say that but i cannot understand them and
i am not easy in my mind about them

what can you not understand

their reasons for their conduct but you shall have it all just
as it occurred when i came down mr rucastle met me here and
drove me in his dog-cart to the copper beeches it is as he
said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself
for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all
stained and streaked with damp and bad weather there are grounds
round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which
slopes down to the southampton highroad which curves past about
a hundred yards from the front door this ground in front belongs
to the house but the woods all round are part of lord
southerton's preserves a clump of copper beeches immediately in
front of the hall door has given its name to the place

i was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever
and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child
there was no truth mr holmes in the conjecture which seemed to
us to be probable in your rooms at baker street mrs rucastle is
not mad i found her to be a silent pale-faced woman much
younger than her husband not more than thirty i should think
while he can hardly be less than forty-five from their
conversation i have gathered that they have been married about
seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by
the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia mr
rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother as
the daughter could not have been less than twenty i can quite
imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her
father's young wife

mrs rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as
in feature she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse
she was a nonentity it was easy to see that she was passionately
devoted both to her husband and to her little son her light grey
eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every
little want and forestalling it if possible he was kind to her
also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they
seemed to be a happy couple and yet she had some secret sorrow
this woman she would often be lost in deep thought with the
saddest look upon her face more than once i have surprised her
in tears i have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of
her child which weighed upon her mind for i have never met so
utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature he is small
for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately large
his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between
savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking giving
pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea
of amusement and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning
the capture of mice little birds and insects but i would
rather not talk about the creature mr holmes and indeed he
has little to do with my story

i am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they
seem to you to be relevant or not

i shall try not to miss anything of importance the one
unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at once was
the appearance and conduct of the servants there are only two a
man and his wife toller for that is his name is a rough
uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and a perpetual
smell of drink twice since i have been with them he has been
quite drunk and yet mr rucastle seemed to take no notice of it
his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as
silent as mrs rucastle and much less amiable they are a most
unpleasant couple but fortunately i spend most of my time in the
nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one
corner of the building

for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was
very quiet on the third mrs rucastle came down just after
breakfast and whispered something to her husband

oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to
you miss hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut
your hair i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest
iota from your appearance we shall now see how the electric-blue
dress will become you you will find it laid out upon the bed in
your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should
both be extremely obliged

the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade
of blue it was of excellent material a sort of beige but it
bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before it could not
have been a better fit if i had been measured for it both mr
and mrs rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which
seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence they were waiting for
me in the drawing-room which is a very large room stretching
along the entire front of the house with three long windows
reaching down to the floor a chair had been placed close to the
central window with its back turned towards it in this i was
asked to sit and then mr rucastle walking up and down on the
other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest
stories that i have ever listened to you cannot imagine how
comical he was and i laughed until i was quite weary mrs
rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so
much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad
anxious look upon her face after an hour or so mr rucastle
suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the
day and that i might change my dress and go to little edward in
the nursery

two days later this same performance was gone through under
exactly similar circumstances again i changed my dress again i
sat in the window and again i laughed very heartily at the funny
stories of which my employer had an immense répertoire and which
he told inimitably then he handed me a yellow-backed novel and
moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not
fall upon the page he begged me to read aloud to him i read for
about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then
suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and
to change my dress

you can easily imagine mr holmes how curious i became as to
what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly
be they were always very careful i observed to turn my face
away from the window so that i became consumed with the desire
to see what was going on behind my back at first it seemed to be
impossible but i soon devised a means my hand-mirror had been
broken so a happy thought seized me and i concealed a piece of
the glass in my handkerchief on the next occasion in the midst
of my laughter i put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able
with a little management to see all that there was behind me i
confess that i was disappointed there was nothing at least that
was my first impression at the second glance however i
perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton road
a small bearded man in a grey suit who seemed to be looking in
my direction the road is an important highway and there are
usually people there this man however was leaning against the
railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up i
lowered my handkerchief and glanced at mrs rucastle to find her
eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze she said nothing
but i am convinced that she had divined that i had a mirror in my
hand and had seen what was behind me she rose at once

jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the
road there who stares up at miss hunter

no friend of yours miss hunter he asked

no i know no one in these parts

dear me how very impertinent kindly turn round and motion to
him to go away

surely it would be better to take no notice

no no we should have him loitering here always kindly turn
round and wave him away like that

i did as i was told and at the same instant mrs rucastle drew
down the blind that was a week ago and from that time i have
not sat again in the window nor have i worn the blue dress nor
seen the man in the road

pray continue said holmes your narrative promises to be a
most interesting one

you will find it rather disconnected i fear and there may
prove to be little relation between the different incidents of
which i speak on the very first day that i was at the copper
beeches mr rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands
near the kitchen door as we approached it i heard the sharp
rattling of a chain and the sound as of a large animal moving
about

look in here said mr rucastle showing me a slit between two
planks is he not a beauty

i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of a
vague figure huddled up in the darkness

don't be frightened said my employer laughing at the start
which i had given it's only carlo my mastiff i call him mine
but really old toller my groom is the only man who can do
anything with him we feed him once a day and not too much then
so that he is always as keen as mustard toller lets him loose
every night and god help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs
upon for goodness sake don't you ever on any pretext set your
foot over the threshold at night for it's as much as your life
is worth

the warning was no idle one for two nights later i happened to
look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning
it was a beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the
house was silvered over and almost as bright as day i was
standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when i was
aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper
beeches as it emerged into the moonshine i saw what it was it
was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging
jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones it walked slowly
across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side
that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which i do not
think that any burglar could have done

and now i have a very strange experience to tell you i had as
you know cut off my hair in london and i had placed it in a
great coil at the bottom of my trunk one evening after the
child was in bed i began to amuse myself by examining the
furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things
there was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones
empty and open the lower one locked i had filled the first two
with my linen and as i had still much to pack away i was
naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer it
struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight
so i took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it the very
first key fitted to perfection and i drew the drawer open there
was only one thing in it but i am sure that you would never
guess what it was it was my coil of hair

i took it up and examined it it was of the same peculiar tint
and the same thickness but then the impossibility of the thing
obtruded itself upon me how could my hair have been locked in
the drawer with trembling hands i undid my trunk turned out the
contents and drew from the bottom my own hair i laid the two
tresses together and i assure you that they were identical was
it not extraordinary puzzle as i would i could make nothing at
all of what it meant i returned the strange hair to the drawer
and i said nothing of the matter to the rucastles as i felt that
i had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had
locked

i am naturally observant as you may have remarked mr holmes
and i soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head
there was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited
at all a door which faced that which led into the quarters of
the tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked
one day however as i ascended the stair i met mr rucastle
coming out through this door his keys in his hand and a look on
his face which made him a very different person to the round
jovial man to whom i was accustomed his cheeks were red his
brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his
temples with passion he locked the door and hurried past me
without a word or a look

this aroused my curiosity so when i went out for a walk in the
grounds with my charge i strolled round to the side from which i
could see the windows of this part of the house there were four
of them in a row three of which were simply dirty while the
fourth was shuttered up they were evidently all deserted as i
strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally mr rucastle
came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever

ah said he you must not think me rude if i passed you
without a word my dear young lady i was preoccupied with
business matters

i assured him that i was not offended by the way said i
you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one
of them has the shutters up

he looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled
at my remark

photography is one of my hobbies said he i have made my
dark room up there but dear me what an observant young lady we
have come upon who would have believed it who would have ever
believed it he spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest
in his eyes as he looked at me i read suspicion there and
annoyance but no jest

well mr holmes from the moment that i understood that there
was something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know
i was all on fire to go over them it was not mere curiosity
though i have my share of that it was more a feeling of duty a
feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this
place they talk of woman's instinct perhaps it was woman's
instinct which gave me that feeling at any rate it was there
and i was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the
forbidden door

it was only yesterday that the chance came i may tell you that
besides mr rucastle both toller and his wife find something to
do in these deserted rooms and i once saw him carrying a large
black linen bag with him through the door recently he has been
drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk and when
i came upstairs there was the key in the door i have no doubt at
all that he had left it there mr and mrs rucastle were both
downstairs and the child was with them so that i had an
admirable opportunity i turned the key gently in the lock
opened the door and slipped through

there was a little passage in front of me unpapered and
uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end
round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third
of which were open they each led into an empty room dusty and
cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so
thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through
them the centre door was closed and across the outside of it
had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked
at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with
stout cord the door itself was locked as well and the key was
not there this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the
shuttered window outside and yet i could see by the glimmer from
beneath it that the room was not in darkness evidently there was
a skylight which let in light from above as i stood in the
passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it
might veil i suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room
and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little
slit of dim light which shone out from under the door a mad
unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight mr holmes my
overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and i turned and ran ran
as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the
skirt of my dress i rushed down the passage through the door
and straight into the arms of mr rucastle who was waiting
outside

so said he smiling it was you then i thought that it
must be when i saw the door open

oh i am so frightened i panted

my dear young lady my dear young lady you cannot think how
caressing and soothing his manner was and what has frightened
you my dear young lady

but his voice was just a little too coaxing he overdid it i
was keenly on my guard against him

i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing i answered
but it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was
frightened and ran out again oh it is so dreadfully still in
there

only that said he looking at me keenly

why what did you think i asked

why do you think that i lock this door

i am sure that i do not know

it is to keep people out who have no business there do you
see he was still smiling in the most amiable manner

i am sure if i had known 

well then you know now and if you ever put your foot over
that threshold again here in an instant the smile hardened into
a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a
demon i'll throw you to the mastiff

i was so terrified that i do not know what i did i suppose that
i must have rushed past him into my room i remember nothing
until i found myself lying on my bed trembling all over then i
thought of you mr holmes i could not live there longer without
some advice i was frightened of the house of the man of the
woman of the servants even of the child they were all horrible
to me if i could only bring you down all would be well of
course i might have fled from the house but my curiosity was
almost as strong as my fears my mind was soon made up i would
send you a wire i put on my hat and cloak went down to the
office which is about half a mile from the house and then
returned feeling very much easier a horrible doubt came into my
mind as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose but i
remembered that toller had drunk himself into a state of
insensibility that evening and i knew that he was the only one
in the household who had any influence with the savage creature
or who would venture to set him free i slipped in in safety and
lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you
i had no difficulty in getting leave to come into winchester this
morning but i must be back before three o'clock for mr and
mrs rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the
evening so that i must look after the child now i have told you
all my adventures mr holmes and i should be very glad if you
could tell me what it all means and above all what i should
do

holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story
my friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in
his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon
his face

is toller still drunk he asked

yes i heard his wife tell mrs rucastle that she could do
nothing with him

that is well and the rucastles go out to-night

yes

is there a cellar with a good strong lock

yes the wine-cellar

you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very
brave and sensible girl miss hunter do you think that you could
perform one more feat i should not ask it of you if i did not
think you a quite exceptional woman

i will try what is it

we shall be at the copper beeches by seven o'clock my friend
and i the rucastles will be gone by that time and toller will
we hope be incapable there only remains mrs toller who might
give the alarm if you could send her into the cellar on some
errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate
matters immensely

i will do it

excellent we shall then look thoroughly into the affair of
course there is only one feasible explanation you have been
brought there to personate someone and the real person is
imprisoned in this chamber that is obvious as to who this
prisoner is i have no doubt that it is the daughter miss alice
rucastle if i remember right who was said to have gone to
america you were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height
figure and the colour of your hair hers had been cut off very
possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of
course yours had to be sacrificed also by a curious chance you
came upon her tresses the man in the road was undoubtedly some
friend of hers possibly her fiancé and no doubt as you wore
the girl's dress and were so like her he was convinced from your
laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture
that miss rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer
desired his attentions the dog is let loose at night to prevent
him from endeavouring to communicate with her so much is fairly
clear the most serious point in the case is the disposition of
the child

what on earth has that to do with it i ejaculated

my dear watson you as a medical man are continually gaining
light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the
parents don't you see that the converse is equally valid i have
frequently gained my first real insight into the character of
parents by studying their children this child's disposition is
abnormally cruel merely for cruelty's sake and whether he
derives this from his smiling father as i should suspect or
from his mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their
power

i am sure that you are right mr holmes cried our client a
thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you
have hit it oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to
this poor creature

we must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning
man we can do nothing until seven o'clock at that hour we shall
be with you and it will not be long before we solve the
mystery

we were as good as our word for it was just seven when we
reached the copper beeches having put up our trap at a wayside
public-house the group of trees with their dark leaves shining
like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were
sufficient to mark the house even had miss hunter not been
standing smiling on the door-step

have you managed it asked holmes

a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs that is
mrs toller in the cellar said she her husband lies snoring
on the kitchen rug here are his keys which are the duplicates
of mr rucastle's

you have done well indeed cried holmes with enthusiasm now
lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black
business

we passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a
passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss
hunter had described holmes cut the cord and removed the
transverse bar then he tried the various keys in the lock but
without success no sound came from within and at the silence
holmes face clouded over

i trust that we are not too late said he i think miss
hunter that we had better go in without you now watson put
your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our
way in

it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united
strength together we rushed into the room it was empty there
was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a
basketful of linen the skylight above was open and the prisoner
gone

there has been some villainy here said holmes this beauty
has guessed miss hunter's intentions and has carried his victim
off

but how

through the skylight we shall soon see how he managed it he
swung himself up onto the roof ah yes he cried here's the
end of a long light ladder against the eaves that is how he did
it

but it is impossible said miss hunter the ladder was not
there when the rucastles went away

he has come back and done it i tell you that he is a clever and
dangerous man i should not be very much surprised if this were
he whose step i hear now upon the stair i think watson that it
would be as well for you to have your pistol ready

the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at
the door of the room a very fat and burly man with a heavy
stick in his hand miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the
wall at the sight of him but sherlock holmes sprang forward and
confronted him

you villain said he where's your daughter

the fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open
skylight

it is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves spies
and thieves i have caught you have i you are in my power i'll
serve you he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he
could go

he's gone for the dog cried miss hunter

i have my revolver said i

better close the front door cried holmes and we all rushed
down the stairs together we had hardly reached the hall when we
heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a
horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to an
elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out
at a side door

my god he cried someone has loosed the dog it's not been
fed for two days quick quick or it'll be too late

holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house with
toller hurrying behind us there was the huge famished brute its
black muzzle buried in rucastle's throat while he writhed and
screamed upon the ground running up i blew its brains out and
it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great
creases of his neck with much labour we separated them and
carried him living but horribly mangled into the house we laid
him upon the drawing-room sofa and having dispatched the sobered
toller to bear the news to his wife i did what i could to
relieve his pain we were all assembled round him when the door
opened and a tall gaunt woman entered the room

mrs toller cried miss hunter

yes miss mr rucastle let me out when he came back before he
went up to you ah miss it is a pity you didn't let me know
what you were planning for i would have told you that your pains
were wasted

ha said holmes looking keenly at her it is clear that mrs
toller knows more about this matter than anyone else

yes sir i do and i am ready enough to tell what i know

then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several
points on which i must confess that i am still in the dark

i will soon make it clear to you said she and i'd have done
so before now if i could ha got out from the cellar if there's
police-court business over this you'll remember that i was the
one that stood your friend and that i was miss alice's friend
too

she was never happy at home miss alice wasn't from the time
that her father married again she was slighted like and had no
say in anything but it never really became bad for her until
after she met mr fowler at a friend's house as well as i could
learn miss alice had rights of her own by will but she was so
quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them
but just left everything in mr rucastle's hands he knew he was
safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming
forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then
her father thought it time to put a stop on it he wanted her to
sign a paper so that whether she married or not he could use
her money when she wouldn't do it he kept on worrying her until
she got brain-fever and for six weeks was at death's door then
she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with her
beautiful hair cut off but that didn't make no change in her
young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be

ah said holmes i think that what you have been good enough
to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that i can deduce
all that remains mr rucastle then i presume took to this
system of imprisonment

yes sir

and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of
the disagreeable persistence of mr fowler

that was it sir

but mr fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should
be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain
arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your
interests were the same as his

mr fowler was a very kind-spoken free-handed gentleman said
mrs toller serenely

and in this way he managed that your good man should have no
want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment
when your master had gone out

you have it sir just as it happened

i am sure we owe you an apology mrs toller said holmes for
you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us and
here comes the country surgeon and mrs rucastle so i think
watson that we had best escort miss hunter back to winchester
as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a
questionable one

and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the
copper beeches in front of the door mr rucastle survived but
was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of
his devoted wife they still live with their old servants who
probably know so much of rucastle's past life that he finds it
difficult to part from them mr fowler and miss rucastle were
married by special license in southampton the day after their
flight and he is now the holder of a government appointment in
the island of mauritius as to miss violet hunter my friend
holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further
interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
of his problems and she is now the head of a private school at
walsall where i believe that she has met with considerable success






chapter i

the science of deduction

sherlock holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece and
his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case with his long
white nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle and rolled back
his left shirt-cuff for some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully
upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with
innumerable puncture-marks finally he thrust the sharp point home
pressed down the tiny piston and sank back into the velvet-lined
arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction

three times a day for many months i had witnessed this performance but
custom had not reconciled my mind to it on the contrary from day to
day i had become more irritable at the sight and my conscience swelled
nightly within me at the thought that i had lacked the courage to
protest again and again i had registered a vow that i should deliver
my soul upon the subject but there was that in the cool nonchalant
air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would
care to take anything approaching to a liberty his great powers his
masterly manner and the experience which i had had of his many
extraordinary qualities all made me diffident and backward in crossing
him

yet upon that afternoon whether it was the beaune which i had taken
with my lunch or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme
deliberation of his manner i suddenly felt that i could hold out no
longer

which is it to-day i asked morphine or cocaine

he raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he
had opened it is cocaine he said a seven-per-cent solution
would you care to try it

no indeed i answered brusquely my constitution has not got over
the afghan campaign yet i cannot afford to throw any extra strain
upon it

he smiled at my vehemence perhaps you are right watson he said
i suppose that its influence is physically a bad one i find it
however so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that
its secondary action is a matter of small moment

but consider i said earnestly count the cost your brain may
as you say be roused and excited but it is a pathological and morbid
process which involves increased tissue-change and may at last leave a
permanent weakness you know too what a black reaction comes upon
you surely the game is hardly worth the candle why should you for
a mere passing pleasure risk the loss of those great powers with which
you have been endowed remember that i speak not only as one comrade to
another but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to
some extent answerable

he did not seem offended on the contrary he put his finger-tips
together and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair like one who
has a relish for conversation

my mind he said rebels at stagnation give me problems give me
work give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate
analysis and i am in my own proper atmosphere i can dispense then
with artificial stimulants but i abhor the dull routine of existence
i crave for mental exaltation that is why i have chosen my own
particular profession or rather created it for i am the only one in
the world

the only unofficial detective i said raising my eyebrows

the only unofficial consulting detective he answered i am the
last and highest court of appeal in detection when gregson or
lestrade or athelney jones are out of their depths which by the way
is their normal state the matter is laid before me i examine the
data as an expert and pronounce a specialist's opinion i claim no
credit in such cases my name figures in no newspaper the work
itself the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers is my
highest reward but you have yourself had some experience of my
methods of work in the jefferson hope case

yes indeed said i cordially i was never so struck by anything
in my life i even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat
fantastic title of a study in scarlet

he shook his head sadly i glanced over it said he honestly i
cannot congratulate you upon it detection is or ought to be an
exact science and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional
manner you have attempted to tinge it with romanticism which
produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an
elopement into the fifth proposition of euclid

but the romance was there i remonstrated i could not tamper with
the facts

some facts should be suppressed or at least a just sense of
proportion should be observed in treating them the only point in the
case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from
effects to causes by which i succeeded in unraveling it

i was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially
designed to please him i confess too that i was irritated by the
egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be
devoted to his own special doings more than once during the years
that i had lived with him in baker street i had observed that a small
vanity underlay my companion's quiet and didactic manner i made no
remark however but sat nursing my wounded leg i had a jezail bullet
through it some time before and though it did not prevent me from
walking it ached wearily at every change of the weather

my practice has extended recently to the continent said holmes
after a while filling up his old brier-root pipe i was consulted
last week by francois le villard who as you probably know has come
rather to the front lately in the french detective service he has all
the celtic power of quick intuition but he is deficient in the wide
range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments
of his art the case was concerned with a will and possessed some
features of interest i was able to refer him to two parallel cases
the one at riga in and the other at st louis in which have
suggested to him the true solution here is the letter which i had
this morning acknowledging my assistance he tossed over as he
spoke a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper i glanced my eyes down
it catching a profusion of notes of admiration with stray
magnifiques coup-de-maitres and tours-de-force all testifying
to the ardent admiration of the frenchman

he speaks as a pupil to his master said i

oh he rates my assistance too highly said sherlock holmes lightly
he has considerable gifts himself he possesses two out of the three
qualities necessary for the ideal detective he has the power of
observation and that of deduction he is only wanting in knowledge
and that may come in time he is now translating my small works into
french

your works

oh didn't you know he cried laughing yes i have been guilty of
several monographs they are all upon technical subjects here for
example is one upon the distinction between the ashes of the various
tobaccoes in it i enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar-
cigarette- and pipe-tobacco with colored plates illustrating the
difference in the ash it is a point which is continually turning up
in criminal trials and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a
clue if you can say definitely for example that some murder has
been done by a man who was smoking an indian lunkah it obviously
narrows your field of search to the trained eye there is as much
difference between the black ash of a trichinopoly and the white fluff
of bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato

you have an extraordinary genius for minutiae i remarked

i appreciate their importance here is my monograph upon the tracing
of footsteps with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of paris as a
preserver of impresses here too is a curious little work upon the
influence of a trade upon the form of the hand with lithotypes of the
hands of slaters sailors corkcutters compositors weavers and
diamond-polishers that is a matter of great practical interest to the
scientific detective especially in cases of unclaimed bodies or in
discovering the antecedents of criminals but i weary you with my
hobby

not at all i answered earnestly it is of the greatest interest
to me especially since i have had the opportunity of observing your
practical application of it but you spoke just now of observation and
deduction surely the one to some extent implies the other

why hardly he answered leaning back luxuriously in his arm-chair
and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe for example
observation shows me that you have been to the wigmore street
post-office this morning but deduction lets me know that when there
you dispatched a telegram

right said i right on both points but i confess that i don't
see how you arrived at it it was a sudden impulse upon my part and i
have mentioned it to no one

it is simplicity itself he remarked chuckling at my surprise so
absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous and yet it may
serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction
observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to
your instep just opposite the seymour street office they have taken
up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that
it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering the earth is of
this peculiar reddish tint which is found as far as i know nowhere
else in the neighborhood so much is observation the rest is
deduction

how then did you deduce the telegram

why of course i knew that you had not written a letter since i sat
opposite to you all morning i see also in your open desk there that
you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards what
could you go into the post-office for then but to send a wire
eliminate all other factors and the one which remains must be the
truth

in this case it certainly is so i replied after a little thought
the thing however is as you say of the simplest would you think
me impertinent if i were to put your theories to a more severe test

on the contrary he answered it would prevent me from taking a
second dose of cocaine i should be delighted to look into any problem
which you might submit to me

i have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object
in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it
in such a way that a trained observer might read it now i have here
a watch which has recently come into my possession would you have the
kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the
late owner

i handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my
heart for the test was as i thought an impossible one and i
intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he
occasionally assumed he balanced the watch in his hand gazed hard at
the dial opened the back and examined the works first with his naked
eyes and then with a powerful convex lens i could hardly keep from
smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and
handed it back

there are hardly any data he remarked the watch has been recently
cleaned which robs me of my most suggestive facts

you are right i answered it was cleaned before being sent to me
in my heart i accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and
impotent excuse to cover his failure what data could he expect from
an uncleaned watch

though unsatisfactory my research has not been entirely barren he
observed staring up at the ceiling with dreamy lack-lustre eyes
subject to your correction i should judge that the watch belonged to
your elder brother who inherited it from your father

that you gather no doubt from the h w upon the back

quite so the w suggests your own name the date of the watch is
nearly fifty years back and the initials are as old as the watch so
it was made for the last generation jewelry usually descends to the
eldest son and he is most likely to have the same name as the father
your father has if i remember right been dead many years it has
therefore been in the hands of your eldest brother

right so far said i anything else

he was a man of untidy habits very untidy and careless he was left
with good prospects but he threw away his chances lived for some time
in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity and finally
taking to drink he died that is all i can gather

i sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with
considerable bitterness in my heart

this is unworthy of you holmes i said i could not have believed
that you would have descended to this you have made inquires into the
history of my unhappy brother and you now pretend to deduce this
knowledge in some fanciful way you cannot expect me to believe that
you have read all this from his old watch it is unkind and to speak
plainly has a touch of charlatanism in it

my dear doctor said he kindly pray accept my apologies viewing
the matter as an abstract problem i had forgotten how personal and
painful a thing it might be to you i assure you however that i
never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch

then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts
they are absolutely correct in every particular

ah that is good luck i could only say what was the balance of
probability i did not at all expect to be so accurate

but it was not mere guess-work

no no i never guess it is a shocking habit destructive to the
logical faculty what seems strange to you is only so because you do
not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which
large inferences may depend for example i began by stating that your
brother was careless when you observe the lower part of that
watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places but it
is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard
objects such as coins or keys in the same pocket surely it is no
great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so
cavalierly must be a careless man neither is it a very far-fetched
inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty
well provided for in other respects

i nodded to show that i followed his reasoning

it is very customary for pawnbrokers in england when they take a
watch to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the
inside of the case it is more handy than a label as there is no risk
of the number being lost or transposed there are no less than four
such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case
inference that your brother was often at low water secondary
inference that he had occasional bursts of prosperity or he could
not have redeemed the pledge finally i ask you to look at the inner
plate which contains the key-hole look at the thousands of scratches
all round the hole marks where the key has slipped what sober man's
key could have scored those grooves but you will never see a
drunkard's watch without them he winds it at night and he leaves
these traces of his unsteady hand where is the mystery in all this

it is as clear as daylight i answered i regret the injustice
which i did you i should have had more faith in your marvellous
faculty may i ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot
at present

none hence the cocaine i cannot live without brain-work what else
is there to live for stand at the window here was ever such a
dreary dismal unprofitable world see how the yellow fog swirls down
the street and drifts across the dun-colored houses what could be
more hopelessly prosaic and material what is the use of having
powers doctor when one has no field upon which to exert them crime
is commonplace existence is commonplace and no qualities save those
which are commonplace have any function upon earth

i had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade when with a crisp knock
our landlady entered bearing a card upon the brass salver

a young lady for you sir she said addressing my companion

miss mary morstan he read hum i have no recollection of the
name ask the young lady to step up mrs hudson don't go doctor
i should prefer that you remain



chapter ii

the statement of the case

miss morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure
of manner she was a blonde young lady small dainty well gloved
and dressed in the most perfect taste there was however a plainness
and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of
limited means the dress was a sombre grayish beige untrimmed and
unbraided and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue relieved
only by a suspicion of white feather in the side her face had neither
regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion but her expression was
sweet and amiable and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual
and sympathetic in an experience of women which extends over many
nations and three separate continents i have never looked upon a face
which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature i could
not but observe that as she took the seat which sherlock holmes placed
for her her lip trembled her hand quivered and she showed every sign
of intense inward agitation

i have come to you mr holmes she said because you once enabled
my employer mrs cecil forrester to unravel a little domestic
complication she was much impressed by your kindness and skill

mrs cecil forrester he repeated thoughtfully i believe that i
was of some slight service to her the case however as i remember
it was a very simple one

she did not think so but at least you cannot say the same of mine
i can hardly imagine anything more strange more utterly inexplicable
than the situation in which i find myself

holmes rubbed his hands and his eyes glistened he leaned forward in
his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his
clear-cut hawklike features state your case said he in brisk
business tones

i felt that my position was an embarrassing one you will i am sure
excuse me i said rising from my chair

to my surprise the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me
if your friend she said would be good enough to stop he might be
of inestimable service to me

i relapsed into my chair

briefly she continued the facts are these my father was an
officer in an indian regiment who sent me home when i was quite a
child my mother was dead and i had no relative in england i was
placed however in a comfortable boarding establishment at edinburgh
and there i remained until i was seventeen years of age in the year
 my father who was senior captain of his regiment obtained twelve
months leave and came home he telegraphed to me from london that he
had arrived all safe and directed me to come down at once giving the
langham hotel as his address his message as i remember was full of
kindness and love on reaching london i drove to the langham and was
informed that captain morstan was staying there but that he had gone
out the night before and had not yet returned i waited all day without
news of him that night on the advice of the manager of the hotel i
communicated with the police and next morning we advertised in all the
papers our inquiries led to no result and from that day to this no
word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father he came home with
his heart full of hope to find some peace some comfort and
instead  she put her hand to her throat and a choking sob cut short
the sentence

the date asked holmes opening his note-book

he disappeared upon the d of december  nearly ten years ago

his luggage

remained at the hotel there was nothing in it to suggest a
clue some clothes some books and a considerable number of
curiosities from the andaman islands he had been one of the officers
in charge of the convict-guard there

had he any friends in town

only one that we know of major sholto of his own regiment the th
bombay infantry the major had retired some little time before and
lived at upper norwood we communicated with him of course but he
did not even know that his brother officer was in england

a singular case remarked holmes

i have not yet described to you the most singular part about six
years ago to be exact upon the th of may  an advertisement
appeared in the times asking for the address of miss mary morstan and
stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward there was
no name or address appended i had at that time just entered the
family of mrs cecil forrester in the capacity of governess by her
advice i published my address in the advertisement column the same
day there arrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to
me which i found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl no word
of writing was enclosed since then every year upon the same date
there has always appeared a similar box containing a similar pearl
without any clue as to the sender they have been pronounced by an
expert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value you can see
for yourselves that they are very handsome she opened a flat box as
she spoke and showed me six of the finest pearls that i had ever seen

your statement is most interesting said sherlock holmes has
anything else occurred to you

yes and no later than to-day that is why i have come to you this
morning i received this letter which you will perhaps read for
yourself

thank you said holmes the envelope too please postmark
london sw date july hum man's thumb-mark on
corner probably postman best quality paper envelopes at sixpence
a packet particular man in his stationery no address be at the
third pillar from the left outside the lyceum theatre to-night at seven
o'clock if you are distrustful bring two friends you are a wronged
woman and shall have justice do not bring police if you do all
will be in vain your unknown friend well really this is a very
pretty little mystery what do you intend to do miss morstan

that is exactly what i want to ask you

then we shall most certainly go you and i and yes why dr watson
is the very man your correspondent says two friends he and i have
worked together before

but would he come she asked with something appealing in her voice
and expression

i should be proud and happy said i fervently if i can be of any
service

you are both very kind she answered i have led a retired life
and have no friends whom i could appeal to if i am here at six it
will do i suppose

you must not be later said holmes there is one other point
however is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box
addresses

i have them here she answered producing half a dozen pieces of
paper

you are certainly a model client you have the correct intuition
let us see now he spread out the papers upon the table and gave
little darting glances from one to the other they are disguised
hands except the letter he said presently but there can be no
question as to the authorship see how the irrepressible greek e will
break out and see the twirl of the final s they are undoubtedly by
the same person i should not like to suggest false hopes miss
morstan but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of
your father

nothing could be more unlike

i expected to hear you say so we shall look out for you then at
six pray allow me to keep the papers i may look into the matter
before then it is only half-past three au revoir then

au revoir said our visitor and with a bright kindly glance from
one to the other of us she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and
hurried away standing at the window i watched her walking briskly
down the street until the gray turban and white feather were but a
speck in the sombre crowd

what a very attractive woman i exclaimed turning to my companion

he had lit his pipe again and was leaning back with drooping eyelids
is she he said languidly i did not observe

you really are an automaton a calculating-machine i cried there
is something positively inhuman in you at times

he smiled gently it is of the first importance he said not to
allow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities a client is to
me a mere unit a factor in a problem the emotional qualities are
antagonistic to clear reasoning i assure you that the most winning
woman i ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for
their insurance-money and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is
a philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the
london poor

in this case however 

i never make exceptions an exception disproves the rule have you
ever had occasion to study character in handwriting what do you make
of this fellow's scribble

it is legible and regular i answered a man of business habits and
some force of character

holmes shook his head look at his long letters he said they
hardly rise above the common herd that d might be an a and that l an
e men of character always differentiate their long letters however
illegibly they may write there is vacillation in his k's and
self-esteem in his capitals i am going out now i have some few
references to make let me recommend this book one of the most
remarkable ever penned it is winwood reade's martyrdom of man i
shall be back in an hour

i sat in the window with the volume in my hand but my thoughts were
far from the daring speculations of the writer my mind ran upon our
late visitor her smiles the deep rich tones of her voice the
strange mystery which overhung her life if she were seventeen at the
time of her father's disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now a
sweet age when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a
little sobered by experience so i sat and mused until such dangerous
thoughts came into my head that i hurried away to my desk and plunged
furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology what was i an army
surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account that i should
dare to think of such things she was a unit a factor nothing more
if my future were black it was better surely to face it like a man
than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o-the-wisps of the
imagination



chapter iii

in quest of a solution

it was half-past five before holmes returned he was bright eager
and in excellent spirits a mood which in his case alternated with
fits of the blackest depression

there is no great mystery in this matter he said taking the cup of
tea which i had poured out for him the facts appear to admit of only
one explanation

what you have solved it already

well that would be too much to say i have discovered a suggestive
fact that is all it is however very suggestive the details are
still to be added i have just found on consulting the back files of
the times that major sholto of upper norword late of the th bombay
infantry died upon the th of april 

i may be very obtuse holmes but i fail to see what this suggests

no you surprise me look at it in this way then captain morstan
disappears the only person in london whom he could have visited is
major sholto major sholto denies having heard that he was in london
four years later sholto dies within a week of his death captain
morstan's daughter receives a valuable present which is repeated from
year to year and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a
wronged woman what wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of
her father and why should the presents begin immediately after
sholto's death unless it is that sholto's heir knows something of the
mystery and desires to make compensation have you any alternative
theory which will meet the facts

but what a strange compensation and how strangely made why too
should he write a letter now rather than six years ago again the
letter speaks of giving her justice what justice can she have it is
too much to suppose that her father is still alive there is no other
injustice in her case that you know of

there are difficulties there are certainly difficulties said
sherlock holmes pensively but our expedition of to-night will solve
them all ah here is a four-wheeler and miss morstan is inside are
you all ready then we had better go down for it is a little past the
hour

i picked up my hat and my heaviest stick but i observed that holmes
took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket it
was clear that he thought that our night's work might be a serious one

miss morstan was muffled in a dark cloak and her sensitive face was
composed but pale she must have been more than woman if she did not
feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were
embarking yet her self-control was perfect and she readily answered
the few additional questions which sherlock holmes put to her

major sholto was a very particular friend of papa's she said his
letters were full of allusions to the major he and papa were in
command of the troops at the andaman islands so they were thrown a
great deal together by the way a curious paper was found in papa's
desk which no one could understand i don't suppose that it is of the
slightest importance but i thought you might care to see it so i
brought it with me it is here

holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee
he then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens

it is paper of native indian manufacture he remarked it has at
some time been pinned to a board the diagram upon it appears to be a
plan of part of a large building with numerous halls corridors and
passages at one point is a small cross done in red ink and above it
is from left in faded pencil-writing in the left-hand corner
is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms
touching beside it is written in very rough and coarse characters
the sign of the four jonathan small mahomet singh abdullah khan
dost akbar no i confess that i do not see how this bears upon the
matter yet it is evidently a document of importance it has been kept
carefully in a pocket-book for the one side is as clean as the other

it was in his pocket-book that we found it

preserve it carefully then miss morstan for it may prove to be of
use to us i begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much
deeper and more subtle than i at first supposed i must reconsider my
ideas he leaned back in the cab and i could see by his drawn brow
and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently miss morstan and i
chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible
outcome but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until
the end of our journey

it was a september evening and not yet seven o'clock but the day had
been a dreary one and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city
mud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets down the
strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw
a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement the yellow glare
from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy vaporous air and
threw a murky shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare
there was to my mind something eerie and ghost-like in the endless
procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of
light sad faces and glad haggard and merry like all human kind
they flitted from the gloom into the light and so back into the gloom
once more i am not subject to impressions but the dull heavy
evening with the strange business upon which we were engaged combined
to make me nervous and depressed i could see from miss morstan's
manner that she was suffering from the same feeling holmes alone
could rise superior to petty influences he held his open note-book
upon his knee and from time to time he jotted down figures and
memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern

at the lyceum theatre the crowds were already thick at the
side-entrances in front a continuous stream of hansoms and
four-wheelers were rattling up discharging their cargoes of
shirt-fronted men and beshawled bediamonded women we had hardly
reached the third pillar which was our rendezvous before a small
dark brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us

are you the parties who come with miss morstan he asked

i am miss morstan and these two gentlemen are my friends said she

he bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us
you will excuse me miss he said with a certain dogged manner but
i was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions
is a police-officer

i give you my word on that she answered

he gave a shrill whistle on which a street arab led across a
four-wheeler and opened the door the man who had addressed us mounted
to the box while we took our places inside we had hardly done so
before the driver whipped up his horse and we plunged away at a
furious pace through the foggy streets

the situation was a curious one we were driving to an unknown place
on an unknown errand yet our invitation was either a complete
hoax which was an inconceivable hypothesis or else we had good
reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey
miss morstan's demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever i
endeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in
afghanistan but to tell the truth i was myself so excited at our
situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were
slightly involved to this day she declares that i told her one moving
anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night
and how i fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it at first i had
some idea as to the direction in which we were driving but soon what
with our pace the fog and my own limited knowledge of london i lost
my bearings and knew nothing save that we seemed to be going a very
long way sherlock holmes was never at fault however and he muttered
the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous
by-streets

rochester row said he now vincent square now we come out on the
vauxhall bridge road we are making for the surrey side apparently
yes i thought so now we are on the bridge you can catch glimpses
of the river

we did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the thames with the
lamps shining upon the broad silent water but our cab dashed on and
was soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side

wordsworth road said my companion priory road lark hall lane
stockwell place robert street cold harbor lane our quest does not
appear to take us to very fashionable regions

we had indeed reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood
long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare
and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner then came rows
of two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden and
then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings the
monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the
country at last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace
none of the other houses were inhabited and that at which we stopped
was as dark as its neighbors save for a single glimmer in the kitchen
window on our knocking however the door was instantly thrown open
by a hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban white loose-fitting
clothes and a yellow sash there was something strangely incongruous
in this oriental figure framed in the commonplace door-way of a
third-rate suburban dwelling-house

the sahib awaits you said he and even as he spoke there came a high
piping voice from some inner room show them in to me khitmutgar
it cried show them straight in to me



chapter iv

the story of the bald-headed man

we followed the indian down a sordid and common passage ill lit and
worse furnished until he came to a door upon the right which he threw
open a blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us and in the centre
of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head a bristle
of red hair all round the fringe of it and a bald shining scalp which
shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees he writhed
his hands together as he stood and his features were in a perpetual
jerk now smiling now scowling but never for an instant in repose
nature had given him a pendulous lip and a too visible line of yellow
and irregular teeth which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly
passing his hand over the lower part of his face in spite of his
obtrusive baldness he gave the impression of youth in point of fact
he had just turned his thirtieth year

your servant miss morstan he kept repeating in a thin high voice
your servant gentlemen pray step into my little sanctum a small
place miss but furnished to my own liking an oasis of art in the
howling desert of south london

we were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he
invited us in that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond
of the first water in a setting of brass the richest and glossiest of
curtains and tapestries draped the walls looped back here and there to
expose some richly-mounted painting or oriental vase the carpet was
of amber-and-black so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly
into it as into a bed of moss two great tiger-skins thrown athwart
it increased the suggestion of eastern luxury as did a huge hookah
which stood upon a mat in the corner a lamp in the fashion of a
silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre
of the room as it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic
odor

mr thaddeus sholto said the little man still jerking and smiling
that is my name you are miss morstan of course and these
gentlemen 

this is mr sherlock holmes and this is dr watson

a doctor eh cried he much excited have you your stethoscope
might i ask you would you have the kindness i have grave doubts as
to my mitral valve if you would be so very good the aortic i may
rely upon but i should value your opinion upon the mitral

i listened to his heart as requested but was unable to find anything
amiss save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear for he shivered
from head to foot it appears to be normal i said you have no
cause for uneasiness

you will excuse my anxiety miss morstan he remarked airily i am
a great sufferer and i have long had suspicions as to that valve i
am delighted to hear that they are unwarranted had your father miss
morstan refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart he might have
been alive now

i could have struck the man across the face so hot was i at this
callous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter miss morstan
sat down and her face grew white to the lips i knew in my heart
that he was dead said she

i can give you every information said he and what is more i can
do you justice and i will too whatever brother bartholomew may say
i am so glad to have your friends here not only as an escort to you
but also as witnesses to what i am about to do and say the three of
us can show a bold front to brother bartholomew but let us have no
outsiders no police or officials we can settle everything
satisfactorily among ourselves without any interference nothing
would annoy brother bartholomew more than any publicity he sat down
upon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak watery
blue eyes

for my part said holmes whatever you may choose to say will go no
further

i nodded to show my agreement

that is well that is well said he may i offer you a glass of
chianti miss morstan or of tokay i keep no other wines shall i
open a flask no well then i trust that you have no objection to
tobacco-smoke to the mild balsamic odor of the eastern tobacco i am
a little nervous and i find my hookah an invaluable sedative he
applied a taper to the great bowl and the smoke bubbled merrily
through the rose-water we sat all three in a semicircle with our
heads advanced and our chins upon our hands while the strange jerky
little fellow with his high shining head puffed uneasily in the
centre

when i first determined to make this communication to you said he
i might have given you my address but i feared that you might
disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you i took the
liberty therefore of making an appointment in such a way that my man
williams might be able to see you first i have complete confidence in
his discretion and he had orders if he were dissatisfied to proceed
no further in the matter you will excuse these precautions but i am
a man of somewhat retiring and i might even say refined tastes and
there is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman i have a natural
shrinking from all forms of rough materialism i seldom come in contact
with the rough crowd i live as you see with some little atmosphere
of elegance around me i may call myself a patron of the arts it is
my weakness the landscape is a genuine corot and though a
connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that salvator rosa there
cannot be the least question about the bouguereau i am partial to the
modern french school

you will excuse me mr sholto said miss morstan but i am here at
your request to learn something which you desire to tell me it is
very late and i should desire the interview to be as short as
possible

at the best it must take some time he answered for we shall
certainly have to go to norwood and see brother bartholomew we shall
all go and try if we can get the better of brother bartholomew he is
very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me
i had quite high words with him last night you cannot imagine what a
terrible fellow he is when he is angry

if we are to go to norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at
once i ventured to remark

he laughed until his ears were quite red that would hardly do he
cried i don't know what he would say if i brought you in that sudden
way no i must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each
other in the first place i must tell you that there are several
points in the story of which i am myself ignorant i can only lay the
facts before you as far as i know them myself

my father was as you may have guessed major john sholto once of the
indian army he retired some eleven years ago and came to live at
pondicherry lodge in upper norwood he had prospered in india and
brought back with him a considerable sum of money a large collection
of valuable curiosities and a staff of native servants with these
advantages he bought himself a house and lived in great luxury my
twin-brother bartholomew and i were the only children

i very well remember the sensation which was caused by the
disappearance of captain morstan we read the details in the papers
and knowing that he had been a friend of our father's we discussed
the case freely in his presence he used to join in our speculations
as to what could have happened never for an instant did we suspect
that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast that of all men
he alone knew the fate of arthur morstan

we did know however that some mystery some positive
danger overhung our father he was very fearful of going out alone
and he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at
pondicherry lodge williams who drove you to-night was one of them
he was once light-weight champion of england our father would never
tell us what it was he feared but he had a most marked aversion to men
with wooden legs on one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a
wooden-legged man who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for
orders we had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up my brother
and i used to think this a mere whim of my father's but events have
since led us to change our opinion

early in my father received a letter from india which was a great
shock to him he nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened
it and from that day he sickened to his death what was in the letter
we could never discover but i could see as he held it that it was
short and written in a scrawling hand he had suffered for years from
an enlarged spleen but he now became rapidly worse and towards the
end of april we were informed that he was beyond all hope and that he
wished to make a last communication to us

when we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing
heavily he besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side
of the bed then grasping our hands he made a remarkable statement
to us in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain i
shall try and give it to you in his own very words

i have only one thing he said which weighs upon my mind at this
supreme moment it is my treatment of poor morstan's orphan the
cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld
from her the treasure half at least of which should have been hers
and yet i have made no use of it myself so blind and foolish a thing
is avarice the mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that
i could not bear to share it with another see that chaplet dipped
with pearls beside the quinine-bottle even that i could not bear to
part with although i had got it out with the design of sending it to
her you my sons will give her a fair share of the agra treasure but
send her nothing not even the chaplet until i am gone after all men
have been as bad as this and have recovered

i will tell you how morstan died he continued he had suffered
for years from a weak heart but he concealed it from every one i
alone knew it when in india he and i through a remarkable chain of
circumstances came into possession of a considerable treasure i
brought it over to england and on the night of morstan's arrival he
came straight over here to claim his share he walked over from the
station and was admitted by my faithful lal chowdar who is now dead
morstan and i had a difference of opinion as to the division of the
treasure and we came to heated words morstan had sprung out of his
chair in a paroxysm of anger when he suddenly pressed his hand to his
side his face turned a dusky hue and he fell backwards cutting his
head against the corner of the treasure-chest when i stooped over him
i found to my horror that he was dead

for a long time i sat half distracted wondering what i should do
my first impulse was of course to call for assistance but i could
not but recognize that there was every chance that i would be accused
of his murder his death at the moment of a quarrel and the gash in
his head would be black against me again an official inquiry could
not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure which i
was particularly anxious to keep secret he had told me that no soul
upon earth knew where he had gone there seemed to be no necessity why
any soul ever should know

i was still pondering over the matter when looking up i saw my
servant lal chowdar in the doorway he stole in and bolted the door
behind him do not fear sahib he said no one need know that you
have killed him let us hide him away and who is the wiser i did
not kill him said i lal chowdar shook his head and smiled i
heard it all sahib said he i heard you quarrel and i heard the
blow but my lips are sealed all are asleep in the house let us put
him away together that was enough to decide me if my own servant
could not believe my innocence how could i hope to make it good before
twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box lal chowdar and i disposed of
the body that night and within a few days the london papers were full
of the mysterious disappearance of captain morstan you will see from
what i say that i can hardly be blamed in the matter my fault lies in
the fact that we concealed not only the body but also the treasure
and that i have clung to morstan's share as well as to my own i wish
you therefore to make restitution put your ears down to my mouth
the treasure is hidden in  at this instant a horrible change came
over his expression his eyes stared wildly his jaw dropped and he
yelled in a voice which i can never forget keep him out for
christ's sake keep him out we both stared round at the window behind
us upon which his gaze was fixed a face was looking in at us out of
the darkness we could see the whitening of the nose where it was
pressed against the glass it was a bearded hairy face with wild
cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence my brother
and i rushed towards the window but the man was gone when we
returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to
beat

we searched the garden that night but found no sign of the intruder
save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the
flower-bed but for that one trace we might have thought that our
imaginations had conjured up that wild fierce face we soon however
had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies
at work all round us the window of my father's room was found open in
the morning his cupboards and boxes had been rifled and upon his
chest was fixed a torn piece of paper with the words the sign of the
four scrawled across it what the phrase meant or who our secret
visitor may have been we never knew as far as we can judge none of
my father's property had been actually stolen though everything had
been turned out my brother and i naturally associated this peculiar
incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life but it
is still a complete mystery to us

the little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully
for a few moments we had all sat absorbed listening to his
extraordinary narrative at the short account of her father's death
miss morstan had turned deadly white and for a moment i feared that
she was about to faint she rallied however on drinking a glass of
water which i quietly poured out for her from a venetian carafe upon
the side-table sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair with an
abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes
as i glanced at him i could not but think how on that very day he had
complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life here at least was
a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost mr thaddeus
sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the
effect which his story had produced and then continued between the
puffs of his overgrown pipe

my brother and i said he were as you may imagine much excited as
to the treasure which my father had spoken of for weeks and for
months we dug and delved in every part of the garden without
discovering its whereabouts it was maddening to think that the
hiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died we could
judge the splendor of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had
taken out over this chaplet my brother bartholomew and i had some
little discussion the pearls were evidently of great value and he
was averse to part with them for between friends my brother was
himself a little inclined to my father's fault he thought too that
if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally
bring us into trouble it was all that i could do to persuade him to
let me find out miss morstan's address and send her a detached pearl at
fixed intervals so that at least she might never feel destitute

it was a kindly thought said our companion earnestly it was
extremely good of you

the little man waved his hand deprecatingly we were your trustees
he said that was the view which i took of it though brother
bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light we had plenty
of money ourselves i desired no more besides it would have been
such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion le
mauvais gout mene au crime the french have a very neat way of
putting these things our difference of opinion on this subject went so
far that i thought it best to set up rooms for myself so i left
pondicherry lodge taking the old khitmutgar and williams with me
yesterday however i learn that an event of extreme importance has
occurred the treasure has been discovered i instantly communicated
with miss morstan and it only remains for us to drive out to norwood
and demand our share i explained my views last night to brother
bartholomew so we shall be expected if not welcome visitors

mr thaddeus sholto ceased and sat twitching on his luxurious settee
we all remained silent with our thoughts upon the new development
which the mysterious business had taken holmes was the first to
spring to his feet

you have done well sir from first to last said he it is
possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing
some light upon that which is still dark to you but as miss morstan
remarked just now it is late and we had best put the matter through
without delay

our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his
hookah and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged
topcoat with astrakhan collar and cuffs this he buttoned tightly up
in spite of the extreme closeness of the night and finished his attire
by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the
ears so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky
face my health is somewhat fragile he remarked as he led the way
down the passage i am compelled to be a valetudinarian

our cab was awaiting us outside and our programme was evidently
prearranged for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace
thaddeus sholto talked incessantly in a voice which rose high above
the rattle of the wheels

bartholomew is a clever fellow said he how do you think he found
out where the treasure was he had come to the conclusion that it was
somewhere indoors so he worked out all the cubic space of the house
and made measurements everywhere so that not one inch should be
unaccounted for among other things he found that the height of the
building was seventy-four feet but on adding together the heights of
all the separate rooms and making every allowance for the space
between which he ascertained by borings he could not bring the total
to more than seventy feet there were four feet unaccounted for these
could only be at the top of the building he knocked a hole
therefore in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room and
there sure enough he came upon another little garret above it which
had been sealed up and was known to no one in the centre stood the
treasure-chest resting upon two rafters he lowered it through the
hole and there it lies he computes the value of the jewels at not
less than half a million sterling

at the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another
open-eyed miss morstan could we secure her rights would change from
a needy governess to the richest heiress in england surely it was the
place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news yet i am ashamed to
say that selfishness took me by the soul and that my heart turned as
heavy as lead within me i stammered out some few halting words of
congratulation and then sat downcast with my head drooped deaf to
the babble of our new acquaintance he was clearly a confirmed
hypochondriac and i was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth
interminable trains of symptoms and imploring information as to the
composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums some of which he
bore about in a leather case in his pocket i trust that he may not
remember any of the answers which i gave him that night holmes
declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of
taking more than two drops of castor oil while i recommended
strychnine in large doses as a sedative however that may be i was
certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman
sprang down to open the door

this miss morstan is pondicherry lodge said mr thaddeus sholto
as he handed her out



chapter v

the tragedy of pondicherry lodge

it was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our
night's adventures we had left the damp fog of the great city behind
us and the night was fairly fine a warm wind blew from the westward
and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky with half a moon peeping
occasionally through the rifts it was clear enough to see for some
distance but thaddeus sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the
carriage to give us a better light upon our way

pondicherry lodge stood in its own grounds and was girt round with a
very high stone wall topped with broken glass a single narrow
iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance on this our guide
knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat

who is there cried a gruff voice from within

it is i mcmurdo you surely know my knock by this time

there was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys the
door swung heavily back and a short deep-chested man stood in the
opening with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his
protruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes

that you mr thaddeus but who are the others i had no orders
about them from the master

no mcmurdo you surprise me i told my brother last night that i
should bring some friends

he ain't been out o his room to-day mr thaddeus and i have no
orders you know very well that i must stick to regulations i can let
you in but your friends must just stop where they are

this was an unexpected obstacle thaddeus sholto looked about him in a
perplexed and helpless manner this is too bad of you mcmurdo he
said if i guarantee them that is enough for you there is the young
lady too she cannot wait on the public road at this hour

very sorry mr thaddeus said the porter inexorably folk may be
friends o yours and yet no friends o the master's he pays me well
to do my duty and my duty i'll do i don't know none o your friends

oh yes you do mcmurdo cried sherlock holmes genially i don't
think you can have forgotten me don't you remember the amateur who
fought three rounds with you at alison's rooms on the night of your
benefit four years back

not mr sherlock holmes roared the prize-fighter god's truth how
could i have mistook you if instead o standin there so quiet you
had just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw
i'd ha known you without a question ah you're one that has wasted
your gifts you have you might have aimed high if you had joined the
fancy

you see watson if all else fails me i have still one of the
scientific professions open to me said holmes laughing our friend
won't keep us out in the cold now i am sure

in you come sir in you come you and your friends he answered
very sorry mr thaddeus but orders are very strict had to be
certain of your friends before i let them in

inside a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of
a house square and prosaic all plunged in shadow save where a
moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window the vast
size of the building with its gloom and its deathly silence struck a
chill to the heart even thaddeus sholto seemed ill at ease and the
lantern quivered and rattled in his hand

i cannot understand it he said there must be some mistake i
distinctly told bartholomew that we should be here and yet there is no
light in his window i do not know what to make of it

does he always guard the premises in this way asked holmes

yes he has followed my father's custom he was the favorite son you
know and i sometimes think that my father may have told him more than
he ever told me that is bartholomew's window up there where the
moonshine strikes it is quite bright but there is no light from
within i think

none said holmes but i see the glint of a light in that little
window beside the door

ah that is the housekeeper's room that is where old mrs bernstone
sits she can tell us all about it but perhaps you would not mind
waiting here for a minute or two for if we all go in together and she
has no word of our coming she may be alarmed but hush what is that

he held up the lantern and his hand shook until the circles of light
flickered and wavered all round us miss morstan seized my wrist and
we all stood with thumping hearts straining our ears from the great
black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most
pitiful of sounds the shrill broken whimpering of a frightened woman

it is mrs bernstone said sholto she is the only woman in the
house wait here i shall be back in a moment he hurried for the
door and knocked in his peculiar way we could see a tall old woman
admit him and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him

oh mr thaddeus sir i am so glad you have come i am so glad you
have come mr thaddeus sir we heard her reiterated rejoicings
until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled
monotone

our guide had left us the lantern holmes swung it slowly round and
peered keenly at the house and at the great rubbish-heaps which
cumbered the grounds miss morstan and i stood together and her hand
was in mine a wondrous subtle thing is love for here were we two who
had never seen each other before that day between whom no word or even
look of affection had ever passed and yet now in an hour of trouble
our hands instinctively sought for each other i have marvelled at it
since but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that i should
go out to her so and as she has often told me there was in her also
the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection so we stood
hand in hand like two children and there was peace in our hearts for
all the dark things that surrounded us

what a strange place she said looking round

it looks as though all the moles in england had been let loose in it
i have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near ballarat
where the prospectors had been at work

and from the same cause said holmes these are the traces of the
treasure-seekers you must remember that they were six years looking
for it no wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit

at that moment the door of the house burst open and thaddeus sholto
came running out with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes

there is something amiss with bartholomew he cried i am
frightened my nerves cannot stand it he was indeed half
blubbering with fear and his twitching feeble face peeping out from
the great astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a
terrified child

come into the house said holmes in his crisp firm way

yes do pleaded thaddeus sholto i really do not feel equal to
giving directions

we all followed him into the housekeeper's room which stood upon the
left-hand side of the passage the old woman was pacing up and down
with a scared look and restless picking fingers but the sight of miss
morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her

god bless your sweet calm face she cried with an hysterical sob
it does me good to see you oh but i have been sorely tried this
day

our companion patted her thin work-worn hand and murmured some few
words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the color back into the
others bloodless cheeks

master has locked himself in and will not answer me she explained
all day i have waited to hear from him for he often likes to be
alone but an hour ago i feared that something was amiss so i went up
and peeped through the key-hole you must go up mr thaddeus you
must go up and look for yourself i have seen mr bartholomew sholto
in joy and in sorrow for ten long years but i never saw him with such
a face on him as that

sherlock holmes took the lamp and led the way for thaddeus sholto's
teeth were chattering in his head so shaken was he that i had to pass
my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs for his knees were
trembling under him twice as we ascended holmes whipped his lens out
of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be
mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served
as a stair-carpet he walked slowly from step to step holding the
lamp and shooting keen glances to right and left miss morstan had
remained behind with the frightened housekeeper

the third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length
with a great picture in indian tapestry upon the right of it and three
doors upon the left holmes advanced along it in the same slow and
methodical way while we kept close at his heels with our long black
shadows streaming backwards down the corridor the third door was that
which we were seeking holmes knocked without receiving any answer
and then tried to turn the handle and force it open it was locked on
the inside however and by a broad and powerful bolt as we could see
when we set our lamp up against it the key being turned however the
hole was not entirely closed sherlock holmes bent down to it and
instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath

there is something devilish in this watson said he more moved than
i had ever before seen him what do you make of it

i stooped to the hole and recoiled in horror moonlight was streaming
into the room and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance
looking straight at me and suspended as it were in the air for all
beneath was in shadow there hung a face the very face of our
companion thaddeus there was the same high shining head the same
circular bristle of red hair the same bloodless countenance the
features were set however in a horrible smile a fixed and unnatural
grin which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the
nerves than any scowl or contortion so like was the face to that of
our little friend that i looked round at him to make sure that he was
indeed with us then i recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us
that his brother and he were twins

this is terrible i said to holmes what is to be done

the door must come down he answered and springing against it he
put all his weight upon the lock it creaked and groaned but did not
yield together we flung ourselves upon it once more and this time it
gave way with a sudden snap and we found ourselves within bartholomew
sholto's chamber

it appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory a double
line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the
door and the table was littered over with bunsen burners test-tubes
and retorts in the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets
one of these appeared to leak or to have been broken for a stream of
dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it and the air was heavy
with a peculiarly pungent tar-like odor a set of steps stood at one
side of the room in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster and
above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man
to pass through at the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was
thrown carelessly together

by the table in a wooden arm-chair the master of the house was seated
all in a heap with his head sunk upon his left shoulder and that
ghastly inscrutable smile upon his face he was stiff and cold and
had clearly been dead many hours it seemed to me that not only his
features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most
fantastic fashion by his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar
instrument a brown close-grained stick with a stone head like a
hammer rudely lashed on with coarse twine beside it was a torn sheet
of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it holmes glanced at it
and then handed it to me

you see he said with a significant raising of the eyebrows

in the light of the lantern i read with a thrill of horror the sign
of the four

in god's name what does it all mean i asked

it means murder said he stooping over the dead man ah i
expected it look here he pointed to what looked like a long dark
thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear

it looks like a thorn said i

it is a thorn you may pick it out but be careful for it is
poisoned

i took it up between my finger and thumb it came away from the skin
so readily that hardly any mark was left behind one tiny speck of
blood showed where the puncture had been

this is all an insoluble mystery to me said i it grows darker
instead of clearer

on the contrary he answered it clears every instant i only
require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case

we had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the
chamber he was still standing in the door-way the very picture of
terror wringing his hands and moaning to himself suddenly however
he broke out into a sharp querulous cry

the treasure is gone he said they have robbed him of the
treasure there is the hole through which we lowered it i helped him
to do it i was the last person who saw him i left him here last
night and i heard him lock the door as i came down-stairs

what time was that

it was ten o'clock and now he is dead and the police will be called
in and i shall be suspected of having had a hand in it oh yes i am
sure i shall but you don't think so gentlemen surely you don't
think that it was i is it likely that i would have brought you here
if it were i oh dear oh dear i know that i shall go mad he
jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy

you have no reason for fear mr sholto said holmes kindly putting
his hand upon his shoulder take my advice and drive down to the
station to report this matter to the police offer to assist them in
every way we shall wait here until your return

the little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion and we heard him
stumbling down the stairs in the dark



chapter vi

sherlock holmes gives a demonstration

now watson said holmes rubbing his hands we have half an hour to
ourselves let us make good use of it my case is as i have told
you almost complete but we must not err on the side of
over-confidence simple as the case seems now there may be something
deeper underlying it

simple i ejaculated

surely said he with something of the air of a clinical professor
expounding to his class just sit in the corner there that your
footprints may not complicate matters now to work in the first
place how did these folk come and how did they go the door has not
been opened since last night how of the window he carried the lamp
across to it muttering his observations aloud the while but
addressing them to himself rather than to me window is snibbed on
the inner side framework is solid no hinges at the side let us
open it no water-pipe near roof quite out of reach yet a man has
mounted by the window it rained a little last night here is the
print of a foot in mould upon the sill and here is a circular muddy
mark and here again upon the floor and here again by the table see
here watson this is really a very pretty demonstration

i looked at the round well-defined muddy discs this is not a
footmark said i

it is something much more valuable to us it is the impression of a
wooden stump you see here on the sill is the boot-mark a heavy boot
with the broad metal heel and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe

it is the wooden-legged man

quite so but there has been some one else a very able and
efficient ally could you scale that wall doctor

i looked out of the open window the moon still shone brightly on that
angle of the house we were a good sixty feet from the ground and
look where i would i could see no foothold nor as much as a crevice
in the brick-work

it is absolutely impossible i answered

without aid it is so but suppose you had a friend up here who
lowered you this good stout rope which i see in the corner securing
one end of it to this great hook in the wall then i think if you
were an active man you might swarm up wooden leg and all you would
depart of course in the same fashion and your ally would draw up the
rope untie it from the hook shut the window snib it on the inside
and get away in the way that he originally came as a minor point it
may be noted he continued fingering the rope that our
wooden-legged friend though a fair climber was not a professional
sailor his hands were far from horny my lens discloses more than
one blood-mark especially towards the end of the rope from which i
gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin
off his hand

this is all very well said i but the thing becomes more
unintelligible than ever how about this mysterious ally how came he
into the room

yes the ally repeated holmes pensively there are features of
interest about this ally he lifts the case from the regions of the
commonplace i fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals
of crime in this country though parallel cases suggest themselves
from india and if my memory serves me from senegambia

how came he then i reiterated the door is locked the window is
inaccessible was it through the chimney

the grate is much too small he answered i had already considered
that possibility

how then i persisted

you will not apply my precept he said shaking his head how often
have i said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible
whatever remains however improbable must be the truth we know that
he did not come through the door the window or the chimney we also
know that he could not have been concealed in the room as there is no
concealment possible whence then did he come

he came through the hole in the roof i cried

of course he did he must have done so if you will have the kindness
to hold the lamp for me we shall now extend our researches to the room
above the secret room in which the treasure was found

he mounted the steps and seizing a rafter with either hand he swung
himself up into the garret then lying on his face he reached down
for the lamp and held it while i followed him

the chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and
six the other the floor was formed by the rafters with thin
lath-and-plaster between so that in walking one had to step from beam
to beam the roof ran up to an apex and was evidently the inner shell
of the true roof of the house there was no furniture of any sort and
the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor

here you are you see said sherlock holmes putting his hand against
the sloping wall this is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof
i can press it back and here is the roof itself sloping at a gentle
angle this then is the way by which number one entered let us see
if we can find any other traces of his individuality

he held down the lamp to the floor and as he did so i saw for the
second time that night a startled surprised look come over his face
for myself as i followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes
the floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot clear
well defined perfectly formed but scarce half the size of those of an
ordinary man

holmes i said in a whisper a child has done the horrid thing

he had recovered his self-possession in an instant i was staggered
for the moment he said but the thing is quite natural my memory
failed me or i should have been able to foretell it there is nothing
more to be learned here let us go down

what is your theory then as to those footmarks i asked eagerly
when we had regained the lower room once more

my dear watson try a little analysis yourself said he with a touch
of impatience you know my methods apply them and it will be
instructive to compare results

i cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts i answered

it will be clear enough to you soon he said in an off-hand way i
think that there is nothing else of importance here but i will look
he whipped out his lens and a tape measure and hurried about the room
on his knees measuring comparing examining with his long thin nose
only a few inches from the planks and his beady eyes gleaming and
deep-set like those of a bird so swift silent and furtive were his
movements like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent
that i could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made
had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law instead of
exerting them in its defense as he hunted about he kept muttering to
himself and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight

we are certainly in luck said he we ought to have very little
trouble now number one has had the misfortune to tread in the
creosote you can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here
at the side of this evil-smelling mess the carboy has been cracked
you see and the stuff has leaked out

what then i asked

why we have got him that's all said he i know a dog that would
follow that scent to the world's end if a pack can track a trailed
herring across a shire how far can a specially-trained hound follow so
pungent a smell as this it sounds like a sum in the rule of three
the answer should give us the but halloo here are the accredited
representatives of the law

heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below and
the hall door shut with a loud crash

before they come said holmes just put your hand here on this poor
fellow's arm and here on his leg what do you feel

the muscles are as hard as a board i answered

quite so they are in a state of extreme contraction far exceeding
the usual rigor mortis coupled with this distortion of the face this
hippocratic smile or risus sardonicus as the old writers called it
what conclusion would it suggest to your mind

death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid i answered some
strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus

that was the idea which occurred to me the instant i saw the drawn
muscles of the face on getting into the room i at once looked for the
means by which the poison had entered the system as you saw i
discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force
into the scalp you observe that the part struck was that which would
be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his
chair now examine the thorn

i took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern it was
long sharp and black with a glazed look near the point as though
some gummy substance had dried upon it the blunt end had been trimmed
and rounded off with a knife

is that an english thorn he asked

no it certainly is not

with all these data you should be able to draw some just inference
but here are the regulars so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat

as he spoke the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on
the passage and a very stout portly man in a gray suit strode heavily
into the room he was red-faced burly and plethoric with a pair of
very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen
and puffy pouches he was closely followed by an inspector in uniform
and by the still palpitating thaddeus sholto

here's a business he cried in a muffled husky voice here's a
pretty business but who are all these why the house seems to be as
full as a rabbit-warren

i think you must recollect me mr athelney jones said holmes
quietly

why of course i do he wheezed it's mr sherlock holmes the
theorist remember you i'll never forget how you lectured us all on
causes and inferences and effects in the bishopgate jewel case it's
true you set us on the right track but you'll own now that it was more
by good luck than good guidance

it was a piece of very simple reasoning

oh come now come never be ashamed to own up but what is all
this bad business bad business stern facts here no room for
theories how lucky that i happened to be out at norwood over another
case i was at the station when the message arrived what d'you think
the man died of

oh this is hardly a case for me to theorize over said holmes dryly

no no still we can't deny that you hit the nail on the head
sometimes dear me door locked i understand jewels worth half a
million missing how was the window

fastened but there are steps on the sill

well well if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with
the matter that's common sense man might have died in a fit but
then the jewels are missing ha i have a theory these flashes come
upon me at times just step outside sergeant and you mr sholto
your friend can remain what do you think of this holmes sholto
was on his own confession with his brother last night the brother
died in a fit on which sholto walked off with the treasure how's
that

on which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on
the inside

hum there's a flaw there let us apply common sense to the matter
this thaddeus sholto was with his brother there was a quarrel so much
we know the brother is dead and the jewels are gone so much also we
know no one saw the brother from the time thaddeus left him his bed
had not been slept in thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state
of mind his appearance is well not attractive you see that i am
weaving my web round thaddeus the net begins to close upon him

you are not quite in possession of the facts yet said holmes this
splinter of wood which i have every reason to believe to be poisoned
was in the man's scalp where you still see the mark this card
inscribed as you see it was on the table and beside it lay this
rather curious stone-headed instrument how does all that fit into
your theory

confirms it in every respect said the fat detective pompously
house is full of indian curiosities thaddeus brought this up and if
this splinter be poisonous thaddeus may as well have made murderous use
of it as any other man the card is some hocus-pocus a blind as
like as not the only question is how did he depart ah of course
here is a hole in the roof with great activity considering his
bulk he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret and
immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he
had found the trap-door

he can find something remarked holmes shrugging his shoulders he
has occasional glimmerings of reason il n'y a pas des sots si
incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit

you see said athelney jones reappearing down the steps again
facts are better than mere theories after all my view of the case
is confirmed there is a trap-door communicating with the roof and it
is partly open

it was i who opened it

oh indeed you did notice it then he seemed a little crestfallen
at the discovery well whoever noticed it it shows how our
gentleman got away inspector

yes sir from the passage

ask mr sholto to step this way mr sholto it is my duty to inform
you that anything which you may say will be used against you i arrest
you in the queen's name as being concerned in the death of your
brother

there now didn't i tell you cried the poor little man throwing
out his hands and looking from one to the other of us

don't trouble yourself about it mr sholto said holmes i think
that i can engage to clear you of the charge

don't promise too much mr theorist don't promise too much
snapped the detective you may find it a harder matter than you
think

not only will i clear him mr jones but i will make you a free
present of the name and description of one of the two people who were
in this room last night his name i have every reason to believe is
jonathan small he is a poorly-educated man small active with his
right leg off and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the
inner side his left boot has a coarse square-toed sole with an iron
band round the heel he is a middle-aged man much sunburned and has
been a convict these few indications may be of some assistance to
you coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing
from the palm of his hand the other man 

ah the other man  asked athelney jones in a sneering voice but
impressed none the less as i could easily see by the precision of the
other's manner

is a rather curious person said sherlock holmes turning upon his
heel i hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair
of them a word with you watson

he led me out to the head of the stair this unexpected occurrence
he said has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of
our journey

i have just been thinking so i answered it is not right that miss
morstan should remain in this stricken house

no you must escort her home she lives with mrs cecil forrester
in lower camberwell so it is not very far i will wait for you here
if you will drive out again or perhaps you are too tired

by no means i don't think i could rest until i know more of this
fantastic business i have seen something of the rough side of life
but i give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises
to-night has shaken my nerve completely i should like however to
see the matter through with you now that i have got so far

your presence will be of great service to me he answered we shall
work the case out independently and leave this fellow jones to exult
over any mare's-nest which he may choose to construct when you have
dropped miss morstan i wish you to go on to no pinchin lane down
near the water's edge at lambeth the third house on the right-hand
side is a bird-stuffer's sherman is the name you will see a weasel
holding a young rabbit in the window knock old sherman up and tell
him with my compliments that i want toby at once you will bring
toby back in the cab with you

a dog i suppose

yes a queer mongrel with a most amazing power of scent i would
rather have toby's help than that of the whole detective force of
london

i shall bring him then said i it is one now i ought to be back
before three if i can get a fresh horse

and i said holmes shall see what i can learn from mrs bernstone
and from the indian servant who mr thaddeus tell me sleeps in the
next garret then i shall study the great jones's methods and listen
to his not too delicate sarcasms wir sind gewohnt das die menschen
verhoehnen was sie nicht verstehen goethe is always pithy



chapter vii

the episode of the barrel

the police had brought a cab with them and in this i escorted miss
morstan back to her home after the angelic fashion of women she had
borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker
than herself to support and i had found her bright and placid by the
side of the frightened housekeeper in the cab however she first
turned faint and then burst into a passion of weeping so sorely had
she been tried by the adventures of the night she has told me since
that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey she little
guessed the struggle within my breast or the effort of self-restraint
which held me back my sympathies and my love went out to her even as
my hand had in the garden i felt that years of the conventionalities
of life could not teach me to know her sweet brave nature as had this
one day of strange experiences yet there were two thoughts which
sealed the words of affection upon my lips she was weak and helpless
shaken in mind and nerve it was to take her at a disadvantage to
obtrude love upon her at such a time worse still she was rich if
holmes's researches were successful she would be an heiress was it
fair was it honorable that a half-pay surgeon should take such
advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about might she not
look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker i could not bear to risk
that such a thought should cross her mind this agra treasure
intervened like an impassable barrier between us

it was nearly two o'clock when we reached mrs cecil forrester's the
servants had retired hours ago but mrs forrester had been so
interested by the strange message which miss morstan had received that
she had sat up in the hope of her return she opened the door herself
a middle-aged graceful woman and it gave me joy to see how tenderly
her arm stole round the other's waist and how motherly was the voice in
which she greeted her she was clearly no mere paid dependant but an
honored friend i was introduced and mrs forrester earnestly begged
me to step in and tell her our adventures i explained however the
importance of my errand and promised faithfully to call and report any
progress which we might make with the case as we drove away i stole a
glance back and i still seem to see that little group on the step the
two graceful clinging figures the half-opened door the hall light
shining through stained glass the barometer and the bright
stair-rods it was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a
tranquil english home in the midst of the wild dark business which had
absorbed us

and the more i thought of what had happened the wilder and darker it
grew i reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as i
rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets there was the original
problem that at least was pretty clear now the death of captain
morstan the sending of the pearls the advertisement the letter we
had had light upon all those events they had only led us however to
a deeper and far more tragic mystery the indian treasure the curious
plan found among morstan's baggage the strange scene at major sholto's
death the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the
murder of the discoverer the very singular accompaniments to the
crime the footsteps the remarkable weapons the words upon the card
corresponding with those upon captain morstan's chart here was indeed
a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my
fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue

pinchin lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower
quarter of lambeth i had to knock for some time at no before i
could make my impression at last however there was the glint of a
candle behind the blind and a face looked out at the upper window

go on you drunken vagabone said the face if you kick up any more
row i'll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you

if you'll let one out it's just what i have come for said i

go on yelled the voice so help me gracious i have a wiper in the
bag an i'll drop it on your ead if you don't hook it

but i want a dog i cried

i won't be argued with shouted mr sherman now stand clear for
when i say three down goes the wiper

mr sherlock holmes  i began but the words had a most magical
effect for the window instantly slammed down and within a minute the
door was unbarred and open mr sherman was a lanky lean old man
with stooping shoulders a stringy neck and blue-tinted glasses

a friend of mr sherlock is always welcome said he step in sir
keep clear of the badger for he bites ah naughty naughty would
you take a nip at the gentleman this to a stoat which thrust its
wicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage don't mind
that sir it's only a slow-worm it hain't got no fangs so i gives
it the run o the room for it keeps the beetles down you must not
mind my bein just a little short wi you at first for i'm guyed at by
the children and there's many a one just comes down this lane to knock
me up what was it that mr sherlock holmes wanted sir

he wanted a dog of yours

ah that would be toby

yes toby was the name

toby lives at no on the left here he moved slowly forward with
his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round
him in the uncertain shadowy light i could see dimly that there were
glancing glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and
corner even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls
who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices
disturbed their slumbers

toby proved to be an ugly long-haired lop-eared creature half spaniel
and half lurcher brown-and-white in color with a very clumsy waddling
gait it accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old
naturalist handed to me and having thus sealed an alliance it
followed me to the cab and made no difficulties about accompanying me
it had just struck three on the palace clock when i found myself back
once more at pondicherry lodge the ex-prize-fighter mcmurdo had i
found been arrested as an accessory and both he and mr sholto had
been marched off to the station two constables guarded the narrow
gate but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the
detective's name

holmes was standing on the door-step with his hands in his pockets
smoking his pipe

ah you have him there said he good dog then atheney jones has
gone we have had an immense display of energy since you left he has
arrested not only friend thaddeus but the gatekeeper the housekeeper
and the indian servant we have the place to ourselves but for a
sergeant up-stairs leave the dog here and come up

we tied toby to the hall table and reascended the stairs the room
was as he had left it save that a sheet had been draped over the
central figure a weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner

lend me your bull's-eye sergeant said my companion now tie this
bit of card round my neck so as to hang it in front of me thank you
now i must kick off my boots and stockings just you carry them down
with you watson i am going to do a little climbing and dip my
handkerchief into the creasote that will do now come up into the
garret with me for a moment

we clambered up through the hole holmes turned his light once more
upon the footsteps in the dust

i wish you particularly to notice these footmarks he said do you
observe anything noteworthy about them

they belong i said to a child or a small woman

apart from their size though is there nothing else

they appear to be much as other footmarks

not at all look here this is the print of a right foot in the
dust now i make one with my naked foot beside it what is the chief
difference

your toes are all cramped together the other print has each toe
distinctly divided

quite so that is the point bear that in mind now would you
kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the
wood-work i shall stay here as i have this handkerchief in my hand

i did as he directed and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry
smell

that is where he put his foot in getting out if you can trace him i
should think that toby will have no difficulty now run down-stairs
loose the dog and look out for blondin

by the time that i got out into the grounds sherlock holmes was on the
roof and i could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very
slowly along the ridge i lost sight of him behind a stack of
chimneys but he presently reappeared and then vanished once more upon
the opposite side when i made my way round there i found him seated
at one of the corner eaves

that you watson he cried

yes

this is the place what is that black thing down there

a water-barrel

top on it

yes

no sign of a ladder

no

confound the fellow it's a most break-neck place i ought to be
able to come down where he could climb up the water-pipe feels pretty
firm here goes anyhow

there was a scuffling of feet and the lantern began to come steadily
down the side of the wall then with a light spring he came on to the
barrel and from there to the earth

it was easy to follow him he said drawing on his stockings and
boots tiles were loosened the whole way along and in his hurry he
had dropped this it confirms my diagnosis as you doctors express it

the object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out
of colored grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it in
shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case inside were half a
dozen spines of dark wood sharp at one end and rounded at the other
like that which had struck bartholomew sholto

they are hellish things said he look out that you don't prick
yourself i'm delighted to have them for the chances are that they
are all he has there is the less fear of you or me finding one in our
skin before long i would sooner face a martini bullet myself are
you game for a six-mile trudge watson

certainly i answered

your leg will stand it

oh yes

here you are doggy good old toby smell it toby smell it he
pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog's nose while the
creature stood with its fluffy legs separated and with a most comical
cock to its head like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of a famous
vintage holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance fastened a
stout cord to the mongrel's collar and led him to the foot of the
water-barrel the creature instantly broke into a succession of high
tremulous yelps and with his nose on the ground and his tail in the
air pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and
kept us at the top of our speed

the east had been gradually whitening and we could now see some
distance in the cold gray light the square massive house with its
black empty windows and high bare walls towered up sad and forlorn
behind us our course led right across the grounds in and out among
the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected
the whole place with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs
had a blighted ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy
which hung over it

on reaching the boundary wall toby ran along whining eagerly
underneath its shadow and stopped finally in a corner screened by a
young beech where the two walls joined several bricks had been
loosened and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the
lower side as though they had frequently been used as a ladder
holmes clambered up and taking the dog from me he dropped it over
upon the other side

there's the print of wooden-leg's hand he remarked as i mounted up
beside him you see the slight smudge of blood upon the white
plaster what a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain
since yesterday the scent will lie upon the road in spite of their
eight-and-twenty hours start

i confess that i had my doubts myself when i reflected upon the great
traffic which had passed along the london road in the interval my
fears were soon appeased however toby never hesitated or swerved
but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion clearly the pungent
smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents

do not imagine said holmes that i depend for my success in this
case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot
in the chemical i have knowledge now which would enable me to trace
them in many different ways this however is the readiest and since
fortune has put it into our hands i should be culpable if i neglected
it it has however prevented the case from becoming the pretty
little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be there
might have been some credit to be gained out of it but for this too
palpable clue

there is credit and to spare said i i assure you holmes that i
marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case even
more than i did in the jefferson hope murder the thing seems to me to
be deeper and more inexplicable how for example could you describe
with such confidence the wooden-legged man

pshaw my dear boy it was simplicity itself i don't wish to be
theatrical it is all patent and above-board two officers who are in
command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried
treasure a map is drawn for them by an englishman named jonathan
small you remember that we saw the name upon the chart in captain
morstan's possession he had signed it in behalf of himself and his
associates the sign of the four as he somewhat dramatically called
it aided by this chart the officers or one of them gets the
treasure and brings it to england leaving we will suppose some
condition under which he received it unfulfilled now then why did
not jonathan small get the treasure himself the answer is obvious
the chart is dated at a time when morstan was brought into close
association with convicts jonathan small did not get the treasure
because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not
get away

but that is mere speculation said i

it is more than that it is the only hypothesis which covers the
facts let us see how it fits in with the sequel major sholto
remains at peace for some years happy in the possession of his
treasure then he receives a letter from india which gives him a great
fright what was that

a letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free

or had escaped that is much more likely for he would have known
what their term of imprisonment was it would not have been a surprise
to him what does he do then he guards himself against a
wooden-legged man a white man mark you for he mistakes a white
tradesman for him and actually fires a pistol at him now only one
white man's name is on the chart the others are hindoos or
mohammedans there is no other white man therefore we may say with
confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with jonathan small
does the reasoning strike you as being faulty

no it is clear and concise

well now let us put ourselves in the place of jonathan small let us
look at it from his point of view he comes to england with the double
idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having
his revenge upon the man who had wronged him he found out where
sholto lived and very possibly he established communications with some
one inside the house there is this butler lal rao whom we have not
seen mrs bernstone gives him far from a good character small could
not find out however where the treasure was hid for no one ever
knew save the major and one faithful servant who had died suddenly
small learns that the major is on his death-bed in a frenzy lest the
secret of the treasure die with him he runs the gauntlet of the
guards makes his way to the dying man's window and is only deterred
from entering by the presence of his two sons mad with hate however
against the dead man he enters the room that night searches his
private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to
the treasure and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short
inscription upon the card he had doubtless planned beforehand that
should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body
as a sign that it was not a common murder but from the point of view
of the four associates something in the nature of an act of justice
whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the
annals of crime and usually afford valuable indications as to the
criminal do you follow all this

very clearly

now what could jonathan small do he could only continue to keep a
secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure possibly he
leaves england and only comes back at intervals then comes the
discovery of the garret and he is instantly informed of it we again
trace the presence of some confederate in the household jonathan
with his wooden leg is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of
bartholomew sholto he takes with him however a rather curious
associate who gets over this difficulty but dips his naked foot into
creasote whence comes toby and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer
with a damaged tendo achillis

but it was the associate and not jonathan who committed the crime

quite so and rather to jonathan's disgust to judge by the way he
stamped about when he got into the room he bore no grudge against
bartholomew sholto and would have preferred if he could have been
simply bound and gagged he did not wish to put his head in a halter
there was no help for it however the savage instincts of his
companion had broken out and the poison had done its work so
jonathan small left his record lowered the treasure-box to the ground
and followed it himself that was the train of events as far as i can
decipher them of course as to his personal appearance he must be
middle-aged and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an
oven as the andamans his height is readily calculated from the length
of his stride and we know that he was bearded his hairiness was the
one point which impressed itself upon thaddeus sholto when he saw him
at the window i don't know that there is anything else

the associate

ah well there is no great mystery in that but you will know all
about it soon enough how sweet the morning air is see how that one
little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo
now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the london cloud-bank
it shines on a good many folk but on none i dare bet who are on a
stranger errand than you and i how small we feel with our petty
ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces
of nature are you well up in your jean paul

fairly so i worked back to him through carlyle

that was like following the brook to the parent lake he makes one
curious but profound remark it is that the chief proof of man's real
greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness it argues you
see a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a
proof of nobility there is much food for thought in richter you
have not a pistol have you

i have my stick

it is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get
to their lair jonathan i shall leave to you but if the other turns
nasty i shall shoot him dead he took out his revolver as he spoke
and having loaded two of the chambers he put it back into the
right-hand pocket of his jacket

we had during this time been following the guidance of toby down the
half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis now
however we were beginning to come among continuous streets where
laborers and dockmen were already astir and slatternly women were
taking down shutters and brushing door-steps at the square-topped
corner public houses business was just beginning and rough-looking men
were emerging rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their
morning wet strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as
we passed but our inimitable toby looked neither to the right nor to
the left but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an
occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent

we had traversed streatham brixton camberwell and now found
ourselves in kennington lane having borne away through the
side-streets to the east of the oval the men whom we pursued seemed
to have taken a curiously zigzag road with the idea probably of
escaping observation they had never kept to the main road if a
parallel side-street would serve their turn at the foot of kennington
lane they had edged away to the left through bond street and miles
street where the latter street turns into knight's place toby ceased
to advance but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked
and the other drooping the very picture of canine indecision then he
waddled round in circles looking up to us from time to time as if to
ask for sympathy in his embarrassment

what the deuce is the matter with the dog growled holmes they
surely would not take a cab or go off in a balloon

perhaps they stood here for some time i suggested

ah it's all right he's off again said my companion in a tone of
relief

he was indeed off for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up
his mind and darted away with an energy and determination such as he
had not yet shown the scent appeared to be much hotter than before
for he had not even to put his nose on the ground but tugged at his
leash and tried to break into a run i cold see by the gleam in
holmes's eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey

our course now ran down nine elms until we came to broderick and
nelson's large timber-yard just past the white eagle tavern here the
dog frantic with excitement turned down through the side-gate into
the enclosure where the sawyers were already at work on the dog
raced through sawdust and shavings down an alley round a passage
between two wood-piles and finally with a triumphant yelp sprang
upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it
had been brought with lolling tongue and blinking eyes toby stood
upon the cask looking from one to the other of us for some sign of
appreciation the staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley
were smeared with a dark liquid and the whole air was heavy with the
smell of creasote

sherlock holmes and i looked blankly at each other and then burst
simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter



chapter viii

the baker street irregulars

what now i asked toby has lost his character for infallibility

he acted according to his lights said holmes lifting him down from
the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard if you consider
how much creasote is carted about london in one day it is no great
wonder that our trail should have been crossed it is much used now
especially for the seasoning of wood poor toby is not to blame

we must get on the main scent again i suppose

yes and fortunately we have no distance to go evidently what
puzzled the dog at the corner of knight's place was that there were two
different trails running in opposite directions we took the wrong one
it only remains to follow the other

there was no difficulty about this on leading toby to the place where
he had committed his fault he cast about in a wide circle and finally
dashed off in a fresh direction

we must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the
creasote-barrel came from i observed

i had thought of that but you notice that he keeps on the pavement
whereas the barrel passed down the roadway no we are on the true
scent now

it tended down towards the river-side running through belmont place
and prince's street at the end of broad street it ran right down to
the water's edge where there was a small wooden wharf toby led us to
the very edge of this and there stood whining looking out on the dark
current beyond

we are out of luck said holmes they have taken to a boat here
several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the
edge of the wharf we took toby round to each in turn but though he
sniffed earnestly he made no sign

close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house with a wooden
placard slung out through the second window mordecai smith was
printed across it in large letters and underneath boats to hire by
the hour or day a second inscription above the door informed us that
a steam launch was kept a statement which was confirmed by a great
pile of coke upon the jetty sherlock holmes looked slowly round and
his face assumed an ominous expression

this looks bad said he these fellows are sharper than i expected
they seem to have covered their tracks there has i fear been
preconcerted management here

he was approaching the door of the house when it opened and a little
curly-headed lad of six came running out followed by a stoutish
red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand

you come back and be washed jack she shouted come back you
young imp for if your father comes home and finds you like that he'll
let us hear of it

dear little chap said holmes strategically what a rosy-cheeked
young rascal now jack is there anything you would like

the youth pondered for a moment i'd like a shillin said he

nothing you would like better

i'd like two shillin better the prodigy answered after some
thought

here you are then catch a fine child mrs smith

lor bless you sir he is that and forward he gets a'most too much
for me to manage specially when my man is away days at a time

away is he said holmes in a disappointed voice i am sorry for
that for i wanted to speak to mr smith

he's been away since yesterday mornin sir and truth to tell i am
beginnin to feel frightened about him but if it was about a boat
sir maybe i could serve as well

i wanted to hire his steam launch

why bless you sir it is in the steam launch that he has gone
that's what puzzles me for i know there ain't more coals in her than
would take her to about woolwich and back if he'd been away in the
barge i'd ha thought nothin for many a time a job has taken him as
far as gravesend and then if there was much doin there he might ha
stayed over but what good is a steam launch without coals

he might have bought some at a wharf down the river

he might sir but it weren't his way many a time i've heard him
call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags besides i don't
like that wooden-legged man wi his ugly face and outlandish talk
what did he want always knockin about here for

a wooden-legged man said holmes with bland surprise

yes sir a brown monkey-faced chap that's called more'n once for my
old man it was him that roused him up yesternight and what's more
my man knew he was comin for he had steam up in the launch i tell
you straight sir i don't feel easy in my mind about it

but my dear mrs smith said holmes shrugging his shoulders you
are frightening yourself about nothing how could you possibly tell
that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night i don't quite
understand how you can be so sure

his voice sir i knew his voice which is kind o thick and foggy
he tapped at the winder about three it would be show a leg
matey says he time to turn out guard my old man woke up
jim that's my eldest and away they went without so much as a word
to me i could hear the wooden leg clackin on the stones

and was this wooden-legged man alone

couldn't say i am sure sir i didn't hear no one else

i am sorry mrs smith for i wanted a steam launch and i have heard
good reports of the let me see what is her name

the aurora sir

ah she's not that old green launch with a yellow line very broad in
the beam

no indeed she's as trim a little thing as any on the river she's
been fresh painted black with two red streaks

thanks i hope that you will hear soon from mr smith i am going
down the river and if i should see anything of the aurora i shall let
him know that you are uneasy a black funnel you say

no sir black with a white band

ah of course it was the sides which were black good-morning mrs
smith there is a boatman here with a wherry watson we shall take
it and cross the river

the main thing with people of that sort said holmes as we sat in
the sheets of the wherry is never to let them think that their
information can be of the slightest importance to you if you do they
will instantly shut up like an oyster if you listen to them under
protest as it were you are very likely to get what you want

our course now seems pretty clear said i

what would you do then

i would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the
aurora

my dear fellow it would be a colossal task she may have touched at
any wharf on either side of the stream between here and greenwich
below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for
miles it would take you days and days to exhaust them if you set
about it alone

employ the police then

no i shall probably call athelney jones in at the last moment he is
not a bad fellow and i should not like to do anything which would
injure him professionally but i have a fancy for working it out
myself now that we have gone so far

could we advertise then asking for information from wharfingers

worse and worse our men would know that the chase was hot at their
heels and they would be off out of the country as it is they are
likely enough to leave but as long as they think they are perfectly
safe they will be in no hurry jones's energy will be of use to us
there for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily
press and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong
scent

what are we to do then i asked as we landed near millbank
penitentiary

take this hansom drive home have some breakfast and get an hour's
sleep it is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again
stop at a telegraph-office cabby we will keep toby for he may be of
use to us yet

we pulled up at the great peter street post-office and holmes
despatched his wire whom do you think that is to he asked as we
resumed our journey

i am sure i don't know

you remember the baker street division of the detective police force
whom i employed in the jefferson hope case

well said i laughing

this is just the case where they might be invaluable if they fail i
have other resources but i shall try them first that wire was to my
dirty little lieutenant wiggins and i expect that he and his gang
will be with us before we have finished our breakfast

it was between eight and nine o'clock now and i was conscious of a
strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night i was
limp and weary befogged in mind and fatigued in body i had not the
professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on nor could i look
at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem as far as the
death of bartholomew sholto went i had heard little good of him and
could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers the treasure
however was a different matter that or part of it belonged
rightfully to miss morstan while there was a chance of recovering it
i was ready to devote my life to the one object true if i found it
it would probably put her forever beyond my reach yet it would be a
petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as
that if holmes could work to find the criminals i had a tenfold
stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure

a bath at baker street and a complete change freshened me up
wonderfully when i came down to our room i found the breakfast laid
and homes pouring out the coffee

here it is said he laughing and pointing to an open newspaper
the energetic jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up
between them but you have had enough of the case better have your
ham and eggs first

i took the paper from him and read the short notice which was headed
mysterious business at upper norwood

about twelve o'clock last night said the standard mr bartholomew
sholto of pondicherry lodge upper norwood was found dead in his room
under circumstances which point to foul play as far as we can learn
no actual traces of violence were found upon mr sholto's person but a
valuable collection of indian gems which the deceased gentleman had
inherited from his father has been carried off the discovery was
first made by mr sherlock holmes and dr watson who had called at the
house with mr thaddeus sholto brother of the deceased by a singular
piece of good fortune mr athelney jones the well-known member of the
detective police force happened to be at the norwood police station
and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm his
trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the
detection of the criminals with the gratifying result that the
brother thaddeus sholto has already been arrested together with the
housekeeper mrs bernstone an indian butler named lal rao and a
porter or gatekeeper named mcmurdo it is quite certain that the
thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house for mr jones's
well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation
have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not
have entered by the door or by the window but must have made their way
across the roof of the building and so through a trap-door into a room
which communicated with that in which the body was found this fact
which has been very clearly made out proves conclusively that it was
no mere haphazard burglary the prompt and energetic action of the
officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such
occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind we cannot but think
that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our
detectives more decentralized and so brought into closer and more
effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate

isn't it gorgeous said holmes grinning over his coffee-cup what
do you think of it

i think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for
the crime

so do i i wouldn't answer for our safety now if he should happen to
have another of his attacks of energy

at this moment there was a loud ring at the bell and i could hear mrs
hudson our landlady raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and
dismay

by heaven holmes i said half rising i believe that they are
really after us

no it's not quite so bad as that it is the unofficial force the
baker street irregulars

as he spoke there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the
stairs a clatter of high voices and in rushed a dozen dirty and
ragged little street-arabs there was some show of discipline among
them despite their tumultuous entry for they instantly drew up in
line and stood facing us with expectant faces one of their number
taller and older than the others stood forward with an air of lounging
superiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little
scarecrow

got your message sir said he and brought em on sharp three bob
and a tanner for tickets

here you are said holmes producing some silver in future they
can report to you wiggins and you to me i cannot have the house
invaded in this way however it is just as well that you should all
hear the instructions i want to find the whereabouts of a steam
launch called the aurora owner mordecai smith black with two red
streaks funnel black with a white band she is down the river
somewhere i want one boy to be at mordecai smith's landing-stage
opposite millbank to say if the boat comes back you must divide it
out among yourselves and do both banks thoroughly let me know the
moment you have news is that all clear

yes guv'nor said wiggins

the old scale of pay and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat
here's a day in advance now off you go he handed them a shilling
each and away they buzzed down the stairs and i saw them a moment
later streaming down the street

if the launch is above water they will find her said holmes as he
rose from the table and lit his pipe they can go everywhere see
everything overhear every one i expect to hear before evening that
they have spotted her in the mean while we can do nothing but await
results we cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the
aurora or mr mordecai smith

toby could eat these scraps i dare say are you going to bed
holmes

no i am not tired i have a curious constitution i never remember
feeling tired by work though idleness exhausts me completely i am
going to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair
client has introduced us if ever man had an easy task this of ours
ought to be wooden-legged men are not so common but the other man
must i should think be absolutely unique

that other man again

i have no wish to make a mystery of him to you anyway but you
must have formed your own opinion now do consider the data
diminutive footmarks toes never fettered by boots naked feet
stone-headed wooden mace great agility small poisoned darts what do
you make of all this

a savage i exclaimed perhaps one of those indians who were the
associates of jonathan small

hardly that said he when first i saw signs of strange weapons i
was inclined to think so but the remarkable character of the footmarks
caused me to reconsider my views some of the inhabitants of the
indian peninsula are small men but none could have left such marks as
that the hindoo proper has long and thin feet the sandal-wearing
mohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others because
the thong is commonly passed between these little darts too could
only be shot in one way they are from a blow-pipe now then where
are we to find our savage

south american i hazarded

he stretched his hand up and took down a bulky volume from the shelf
this is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published
it may be looked upon as the very latest authority what have we here
andaman islands situated miles to the north of sumatra in the
bay of bengal hum hum what's all this moist climate coral
reefs sharks port blair convict-barracks rutland island
cottonwoods ah here we are the aborigines of the andaman islands
may perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this
earth though some anthropologists prefer the bushmen of africa the
digger indians of america and the terra del fuegians the average
height is rather below four feet although many full-grown adults may
be found who are very much smaller than this they are a fierce
morose and intractable people though capable of forming most devoted
friendships when their confidence has once been gained mark that
watson now then listen to this they are naturally hideous
having large misshapen heads small fierce eyes and distorted
features their feet and hands however are remarkably small so
intractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the british
official have failed to win them over in any degree they have always
been a terror to shipwrecked crews braining the survivors with their
stone-headed clubs or shooting them with their poisoned arrows these
massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast nice amiable
people watson if this fellow had been left to his own unaided
devices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn i
fancy that even as it is jonathan small would give a good deal not to
have employed him

but how came he to have so singular a companion

ah that is more than i can tell since however we had already
determined that small had come from the andamans it is not so very
wonderful that this islander should be with him no doubt we shall
know all about it in time look here watson you look regularly done
lie down there on the sofa and see if i can put you to sleep

he took up his violin from the corner and as i stretched myself out he
began to play some low dreamy melodious air his own no doubt for
he had a remarkable gift for improvisation i have a vague remembrance
of his gaunt limbs his earnest face and the rise and fall of his bow
then i seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound
until i found myself in dream-land with the sweet face of mary morstan
looking down upon me



chapter ix

a break in the chain

it was late in the afternoon before i woke strengthened and refreshed
sherlock holmes still sat exactly as i had left him save that he had
laid aside his violin and was deep in a book he looked across at me
as i stirred and i noticed that his face was dark and troubled

you have slept soundly he said i feared that our talk would wake
you

i heard nothing i answered have you had fresh news then

unfortunately no i confess that i am surprised and disappointed i
expected something definite by this time wiggins has just been up to
report he says that no trace can be found of the launch it is a
provoking check for every hour is of importance

can i do anything i am perfectly fresh now and quite ready for
another night's outing

no we can do nothing we can only wait if we go ourselves the
message might come in our absence and delay be caused you can do
what you will but i must remain on guard

then i shall run over to camberwell and call upon mrs cecil
forrester she asked me to yesterday

on mrs cecil forrester asked holmes with the twinkle of a smile in
his eyes

well of course miss morstan too they were anxious to hear what
happened

i would not tell them too much said holmes women are never to be
entirely trusted not the best of them

i did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment i shall be
back in an hour or two i remarked

all right good luck but i say if you are crossing the river you
may as well return toby for i don't think it is at all likely that we
shall have any use for him now

i took our mongrel accordingly and left him together with a
half-sovereign at the old naturalist's in pinchin lane at camberwell
i found miss morstan a little weary after her night's adventures but
very eager to hear the news mrs forrester too was full of
curiosity i told them all that we had done suppressing however the
more dreadful parts of the tragedy thus although i spoke of mr
sholto's death i said nothing of the exact manner and method of it
with all my omissions however there was enough to startle and amaze
them

it is a romance cried mrs forrester an injured lady half a
million in treasure a black cannibal and a wooden-legged ruffian
they take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl

and two knight-errants to the rescue added miss morstan with a
bright glance at me

why mary your fortune depends upon the issue of this search i don't
think that you are nearly excited enough just imagine what it must be
to be so rich and to have the world at your feet

it sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no
sign of elation at the prospect on the contrary she gave a toss of
her proud head as though the matter were one in which she took small
interest

it is for mr thaddeus sholto that i am anxious she said nothing
else is of any consequence but i think that he has behaved most kindly
and honorably throughout it is our duty to clear him of this dreadful
and unfounded charge

it was evening before i left camberwell and quite dark by the time i
reached home my companion's book and pipe lay by his chair but he
had disappeared i looked about in the hope of seeing a note but
there was none

i suppose that mr sherlock holmes has gone out i said to mrs
hudson as she came up to lower the blinds

no sir he has gone to his room sir do you know sir sinking
her voice into an impressive whisper i am afraid for his health

why so mrs hudson

well he's that strange sir after you was gone he walked and he
walked up and down and up and down until i was weary of the sound of
his footstep then i heard him talking to himself and muttering and
every time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead with what is
that mrs hudson and now he has slammed off to his room but i can
hear him walking away the same as ever i hope he's not going to be
ill sir i ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine
but he turned on me sir with such a look that i don't know how ever i
got out of the room

i don't think that you have any cause to be uneasy mrs hudson i
answered i have seen him like this before he has some small matter
upon his mind which makes him restless i tried to speak lightly to
our worthy landlady but i was myself somewhat uneasy when through the
long night i still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread
and knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary
inaction

at breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard with a little fleck of
feverish color upon either cheek

you are knocking yourself up old man i remarked i heard you
marching about in the night

no i could not sleep he answered this infernal problem is
consuming me it is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle
when all else had been overcome i know the men the launch
everything and yet i can get no news i have set other agencies at
work and used every means at my disposal the whole river has been
searched on either side but there is no news nor has mrs smith heard
of her husband i shall come to the conclusion soon that they have
scuttled the craft but there are objections to that

or that mrs smith has put us on a wrong scent

no i think that may be dismissed i had inquiries made and there is
a launch of that description

could it have gone up the river

i have considered that possibility too and there is a search-party
who will work up as far as richmond if no news comes to-day i shall
start off myself to-morrow and go for the men rather than the boat
but surely surely we shall hear something

we did not however not a word came to us either from wiggins or from
the other agencies there were articles in most of the papers upon the
norwood tragedy they all appeared to be rather hostile to the
unfortunate thaddeus sholto no fresh details were to be found
however in any of them save that an inquest was to be held upon the
following day i walked over to camberwell in the evening to report
our ill success to the ladies and on my return i found holmes dejected
and somewhat morose he would hardly reply to my questions and busied
himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved
much heating of retorts and distilling of vapors ending at last in a
smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment up to the small hours
of the morning i could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told
me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment

in the early dawn i woke with a start and was surprised to find him
standing by my bedside clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket
and a coarse red scarf round his neck

i am off down the river watson said he i have been turning it
over in my mind and i can see only one way out of it it is worth
trying at all events

surely i can come with you then said i

no you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my
representative i am loath to go for it is quite on the cards that
some message may come during the day though wiggins was despondent
about it last night i want you to open all notes and telegrams and to
act on your own judgment if any news should come can i rely upon you

most certainly

i am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me for i can hardly
tell yet where i may find myself if i am in luck however i may not
be gone so very long i shall have news of some sort or other before i
get back

i had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time on opening the standard
however i found that there was a fresh allusion to the business
with reference to the upper norwood tragedy it remarked we have
reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and
mysterious than was originally supposed fresh evidence has shown that
it is quite impossible that mr thaddeus sholto could have been in any
way concerned in the matter he and the housekeeper mrs bernstone
were both released yesterday evening it is believed however that
the police have a clue as to the real culprits and that it is being
prosecuted by mr athelney jones of scotland yard with all his
well-known energy and sagacity further arrests may be expected at any
moment

that is satisfactory so far as it goes thought i friend sholto is
safe at any rate i wonder what the fresh clue may be though it
seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder

i tossed the paper down upon the table but at that moment my eye
caught an advertisement in the agony column it ran in this way

lost whereas mordecai smith boatman and his son jim left smith's
wharf at or about three o'clock last tuesday morning in the steam
launch aurora black with two red stripes funnel black with a white
band the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give
information to mrs smith at smith's wharf or at b baker street
as to the whereabouts of the said mordecai smith and the launch aurora

this was clearly holmes's doing the baker street address was enough
to prove that it struck me as rather ingenious because it might be
read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural
anxiety of a wife for her missing husband

it was a long day every time that a knock came to the door or a
sharp step passed in the street i imagined that it was either holmes
returning or an answer to his advertisement i tried to read but my
thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted
and villainous pair whom we were pursuing could there be i wondered
some radical flaw in my companion's reasoning might he be suffering
from some huge self-deception was it not possible that his nimble and
speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises i
had never known him to be wrong and yet the keenest reasoner may
occasionally be deceived he was likely i thought to fall into error
through the over-refinement of his logic his preference for a subtle
and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay
ready to his hand yet on the other hand i had myself seen the
evidence and i had heard the reasons for his deductions when i
looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances many of them
trivial in themselves but all tending in the same direction i could
not disguise from myself that even if holmes's explanation were
incorrect the true theory must be equally outre and startling

at three o'clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell an
authoritative voice in the hall and to my surprise no less a person
than mr athelney jones was shown up to me very different was he
however from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who
had taken over the case so confidently at upper norwood his
expression was downcast and his bearing meek and even apologetic

good-day sir good-day said he mr sherlock holmes is out i
understand

yes and i cannot be sure when he will be back but perhaps you would
care to wait take that chair and try one of these cigars

thank you i don't mind if i do said he mopping his face with a red
bandanna handkerchief

and a whiskey-and-soda

well half a glass it is very hot for the time of year and i have
had a good deal to worry and try me you know my theory about this
norwood case

i remember that you expressed one

well i have been obliged to reconsider it i had my net drawn
tightly round mr sholto sir when pop he went through a hole in the
middle of it he was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken
from the time that he left his brother's room he was never out of sight
of some one or other so it could not be he who climbed over roofs and
through trap-doors it's a very dark case and my professional credit
is at stake i should be very glad of a little assistance

we all need help sometimes said i

your friend mr sherlock holmes is a wonderful man sir said he in
a husky and confidential voice he's a man who is not to be beat i
have known that young man go into a good many cases but i never saw
the case yet that he could not throw a light upon he is irregular in
his methods and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories but on
the whole i think he would have made a most promising officer and i
don't care who knows it i have had a wire from him this morning by
which i understand that he has got some clue to this sholto business
here is the message

he took the telegram out of his pocket and handed it to me it was
dated from poplar at twelve o'clock go to baker street at once it
said if i have not returned wait for me i am close on the track
of the sholto gang you can come with us to-night if you want to be in
at the finish

this sounds well he has evidently picked up the scent again said i

ah then he has been at fault too exclaimed jones with evident
satisfaction even the best of us are thrown off sometimes of
course this may prove to be a false alarm but it is my duty as an
officer of the law to allow no chance to slip but there is some one at
the door perhaps this is he

a heavy step was heard ascending the stair with a great wheezing and
rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath once or
twice he stopped as though the climb were too much for him but at
last he made his way to our door and entered his appearance
corresponded to the sounds which we had heard he was an aged man
clad in seafaring garb with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his
throat his back was bowed his knees were shaky and his breathing
was painfully asthmatic as he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his
shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs he had
a colored scarf round his chin and i could see little of his face save
a pair of keen dark eyes overhung by bushy white brows and long gray
side-whiskers altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable
master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty

what is it my man i asked

he looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age

is mr sherlock holmes here said he

no but i am acting for him you can tell me any message you have for
him

it was to him himself i was to tell it said he

but i tell you that i am acting for him was it about mordecai
smith's boat

yes i knows well where it is an i knows where the men he is after
are an i knows where the treasure is i knows all about it

then tell me and i shall let him know

it was to him i was to tell it he repeated with the petulant
obstinacy of a very old man

well you must wait for him

no no i ain't goin to lose a whole day to please no one if mr
holmes ain't here then mr holmes must find it all out for himself i
don't care about the look of either of you and i won't tell a word

he shuffled towards the door but athelney jones got in front of him

wait a bit my friend said he you have important information and
you must not walk off we shall keep you whether you like or not
until our friend returns

the old man made a little run towards the door but as athelney jones
put his broad back up against it he recognized the uselessness of
resistance

pretty sort o treatment this he cried stamping his stick i come
here to see a gentleman and you two who i never saw in my life seize
me and treat me in this fashion

you will be none the worse i said we shall recompense you for the
loss of your time sit over here on the sofa and you will not have
long to wait

he came across sullenly enough and seated himself with his face
resting on his hands jones and i resumed our cigars and our talk
suddenly however holmes's voice broke in upon us

i think that you might offer me a cigar too he said

we both started in our chairs there was holmes sitting close to us
with an air of quiet amusement

holmes i exclaimed you here but where is the old man

here is the old man said he holding out a heap of white hair here
he is wig whiskers eyebrows and all i thought my disguise was
pretty good but i hardly expected that it would stand that test

ah you rogue cried jones highly delighted you would have made
an actor and a rare one you had the proper workhouse cough and
those weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week i thought i knew
the glint of your eye though you didn't get away from us so easily
you see

i have been working in that get-up all day said he lighting his
cigar you see a good many of the criminal classes begin to know
me especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my
cases so i can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise
like this you got my wire

yes that was what brought me here

how has your case prospered

it has all come to nothing i have had to release two of my
prisoners and there is no evidence against the other two

never mind we shall give you two others in the place of them but
you must put yourself under my orders you are welcome to all the
official credit but you must act on the line that i point out is
that agreed

entirely if you will help me to the men

well then in the first place i shall want a fast police-boat a
steam launch to be at the westminster stairs at seven o'clock

that is easily managed there is always one about there but i can
step across the road and telephone to make sure

then i shall want two stanch men in case of resistance

there will be two or three in the boat what else

when we secure the men we shall get the treasure i think that it
would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the
young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs let her be the first
to open it eh watson

it would be a great pleasure to me

rather an irregular proceeding said jones shaking his head
however the whole thing is irregular and i suppose we must wink at
it the treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities
until after the official investigation

certainly that is easily managed one other point i should much
like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of jonathan
small himself you know i like to work the detail of my cases out
there is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him
either here in my rooms or elsewhere as long as he is efficiently
guarded

well you are master of the situation i have had no proof yet of the
existence of this jonathan small however if you can catch him i
don't see how i can refuse you an interview with him

that is understood then

perfectly is there anything else

only that i insist upon your dining with us it will be ready in half
an hour i have oysters and a brace of grouse with something a little
choice in white wines watson you have never yet recognized my merits
as a housekeeper



chapter x

the end of the islander

our meal was a merry one holmes could talk exceedingly well when he
chose and that night he did choose he appeared to be in a state of
nervous exaltation i have never known him so brilliant he spoke on
a quick succession of subjects on miracle-plays on medieval pottery
on stradivarius violins on the buddhism of ceylon and on the
war-ships of the future handling each as though he had made a special
study of it his bright humor marked the reaction from his black
depression of the preceding days athelney jones proved to be a
sociable soul in his hours of relaxation and faced his dinner with the
air of a bon vivant for myself i felt elated at the thought that we
were nearing the end of our task and i caught something of holmes's
gaiety none of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had
brought us together

when the cloth was cleared holmes glanced at his watch and filled up
three glasses with port one bumper said he to the success of our
little expedition and now it is high time we were off have you a
pistol watson

i have my old service-revolver in my desk

you had best take it then it is well to be prepared i see that
the cab is at the door i ordered it for half-past six

it was a little past seven before we reached the westminster wharf and
found our launch awaiting us holmes eyed it critically

is there anything to mark it as a police-boat

yes that green lamp at the side

then take it off

the small change was made we stepped on board and the ropes were cast
off jones holmes and i sat in the stern there was one man at the
rudder one to tend the engines and two burly police-inspectors
forward

where to asked jones

to the tower tell them to stop opposite jacobson's yard

our craft was evidently a very fast one we shot past the long lines
of loaded barges as though they were stationary holmes smiled with
satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us

we ought to be able to catch anything on the river he said

well hardly that but there are not many launches to beat us

we shall have to catch the aurora and she has a name for being a
clipper i will tell you how the land lies watson you recollect how
annoyed i was at being balked by so small a thing

yes

well i gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical
analysis one of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work
is the best rest so it is when i had succeeded in dissolving the
hydrocarbon which i was at work at i came back to our problem of the
sholtos and thought the whole matter out again my boys had been up
the river and down the river without result the launch was not at any
landing-stage or wharf nor had it returned yet it could hardly have
been scuttled to hide their traces though that always remained as a
possible hypothesis if all else failed i knew this man small had a
certain degree of low cunning but i did not think him capable of
anything in the nature of delicate finesse that is usually a product
of higher education i then reflected that since he had certainly been
in london some time as we had evidence that he maintained a continual
watch over pondicherry lodge he could hardly leave at a moment's
notice but would need some little time if it were only a day to
arrange his affairs that was the balance of probability at any rate

it seems to me to be a little weak said i it is more probable
that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his
expedition

no i hardly think so this lair of his would be too valuable a
retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he
could do without it but a second consideration struck me jonathan
small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion
however much he may have top-coated him would give rise to gossip and
possibly be associated with this norwood tragedy he was quite sharp
enough to see that they had started from their head-quarters under
cover of darkness and he would wish to get back before it was broad
light now it was past three o'clock according to mrs smith when
they got the boat it would be quite bright and people would be about
in an hour or so therefore i argued they did not go very far they
paid smith well to hold his tongue reserved his launch for the final
escape and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box in a
couple of nights when they had time to see what view the papers took
and whether there was any suspicion they would make their way under
cover of darkness to some ship at gravesend or in the downs where no
doubt they had already arranged for passages to america or the
colonies

but the launch they could not have taken that to their lodgings

quite so i argued that the launch must be no great way off in spite
of its invisibility i then put myself in the place of small and
looked at it as a man of his capacity would he would probably
consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would
make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track how
then could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted
i wondered what i should do myself if i were in his shoes i could
only think of one way of doing it i might land the launch over to
some boat-builder or repairer with directions to make a trifling
change in her she would then be removed to his shed or yard and so
be effectually concealed while at the same time i could have her at a
few hours notice

that seems simple enough

it is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be
overlooked however i determined to act on the idea i started at
once in this harmless seaman's rig and inquired at all the yards down
the river i drew blank at fifteen but at the
sixteenth jacobson's i learned that the aurora had been handed over
to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man with some trivial
directions as to her rudder there ain't naught amiss with her
rudder said the foreman there she lies with the red streaks at
that moment who should come down but mordecai smith the missing owner
he was rather the worse for liquor i should not of course have
known him but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch i
want her to-night at eight o'clock said he eight o'clock sharp
mind for i have two gentlemen who won't be kept waiting they had
evidently paid him well for he was very flush of money chucking
shillings about to the men i followed him some distance but he
subsided into an ale-house so i went back to the yard and happening
to pick up one of my boys on the way i stationed him as a sentry over
the launch he is to stand at water's edge and wave his handkerchief
to us when they start we shall be lying off in the stream and it
will be a strange thing if we do not take men treasure and all

you have planned it all very neatly whether they are the right men or
not said jones but if the affair were in my hands i should have had
a body of police in jacobson's yard and arrested them when they came
down

which would have been never this man small is a pretty shrewd
fellow he would send a scout on ahead and if anything made him
suspicious lie snug for another week

but you might have stuck to mordecai smith and so been led to their
hiding-place said i

in that case i should have wasted my day i think that it is a hundred
to one against smith knowing where they live as long as he has liquor
and good pay why should he ask questions they send him messages what
to do no i thought over every possible course and this is the best

while this conversation had been proceeding we had been shooting the
long series of bridges which span the thames as we passed the city
the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of st
paul's it was twilight before we reached the tower

that is jacobson's yard said holmes pointing to a bristle of masts
and rigging on the surrey side cruise gently up and down here under
cover of this string of lighters he took a pair of night-glasses
from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore i see my sentry at
his post he remarked but no sign of a handkerchief

suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them said
jones eagerly we were all eager by this time even the policemen and
stokers who had a very vague idea of what was going forward

we have no right to take anything for granted holmes answered it
is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream but we cannot be
certain from this point we can see the entrance of the yard and they
can hardly see us it will be a clear night and plenty of light we
must stay where we are see how the folk swarm over yonder in the
gaslight

they are coming from work in the yard

dirty-looking rascals but i suppose every one has some little
immortal spark concealed about him you would not think it to look at
them there is no a priori probability about it a strange enigma is
man

some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal i suggested

winwood reade is good upon the subject said holmes he remarks
that while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle in the aggregate
he becomes a mathematical certainty you can for example never
foretell what any one man will do but you can say with precision what
an average number will be up to individuals vary but percentages
remain constant so says the statistician but do i see a
handkerchief surely there is a white flutter over yonder

yes it is your boy i cried i can see him plainly

and there is the aurora exclaimed holmes and going like the devil
full speed ahead engineer make after that launch with the yellow
light by heaven i shall never forgive myself if she proves to have
the heels of us

she had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two
or three small craft so that she had fairly got her speed up before we
saw her now she was flying down the stream near in to the shore
going at a tremendous rate jones looked gravely at her and shook his
head

she is very fast he said i doubt if we shall catch her

we must catch her cried holmes between his teeth heap it on
stokers make her do all she can if we burn the boat we must have
them

we were fairly after her now the furnaces roared and the powerful
engines whizzed and clanked like a great metallic heart her sharp
steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to
right and to left of us with every throb of the engines we sprang and
quivered like a living thing one great yellow lantern in our bows
threw a long flickering funnel of light in front of us right ahead a
dark blur upon the water showed where the aurora lay and the swirl of
white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going we
flashed past barges steamers merchant-vessels in and out behind
this one and round the other voices hailed us out of the darkness
but still the aurora thundered on and still we followed close upon her
track

pile it on men pile it on cried holmes looking down into the
engine-room while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager
aquiline face get every pound of steam you can

i think we gain a little said jones with his eyes on the aurora

i am sure of it said i we shall be up with her in a very few
minutes

at that moment however as our evil fate would have it a tug with
three barges in tow blundered in between us it was only by putting
our helm hard down that we avoided a collision and before we could
round them and recover our way the aurora had gained a good two hundred
yards she was still however well in view and the murky uncertain
twilight was setting into a clear starlit night our boilers were
strained to their utmost and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with
the fierce energy which was driving us along we had shot through the
pool past the west india docks down the long deptford reach and up
again after rounding the isle of dogs the dull blur in front of us
resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty aurora jones
turned our search-light upon her so that we could plainly see the
figures upon her deck one man sat by the stern with something black
between his knees over which he stooped beside him lay a dark mass
which looked like a newfoundland dog the boy held the tiller while
against the red glare of the furnace i could see old smith stripped to
the waist and shovelling coals for dear life they may have had some
doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them but now as
we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no
longer be any question about it at greenwich we were about three
hundred paces behind them at blackwall we could not have been more
than two hundred and fifty i have coursed many creatures in many
countries during my checkered career but never did sport give me such
a wild thrill as this mad flying man-hunt down the thames steadily
we drew in upon them yard by yard in the silence of the night we
could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery the man in the
stern still crouched upon the deck and his arms were moving as though
he were busy while every now and then he would look up and measure
with a glance the distance which still separated us nearer we came
and nearer jones yelled to them to stop we were not more than four
boat's lengths behind them both boats flying at a tremendous pace it
was a clear reach of the river with barking level upon one side and
the melancholy plumstead marshes upon the other at our hail the man
in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists
at us cursing the while in a high cracked voice he was a good-sized
powerful man and as he stood poising himself with legs astride i could
see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the
right side at the sound of his strident angry cries there was
movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck it straightened itself
into a little black man the smallest i have ever seen with a great
misshapen head and a shock of tangled dishevelled hair holmes had
already drawn his revolver and i whipped out mine at the sight of this
savage distorted creature he was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster
or blanket which left only his face exposed but that face was enough
to give a man a sleepless night never have i seen features so deeply
marked with all bestiality and cruelty his small eyes glowed and
burned with a sombre light and his thick lips were writhed back from
his teeth which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury

fire if he raises his hand said holmes quietly we were within a
boat's-length by this time and almost within touch of our quarry i
can see the two of them now as they stood the white man with his legs
far apart shrieking out curses and the unhallowed dwarf with his
hideous face and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light
of our lantern

it was well that we had so clear a view of him even as we looked he
plucked out from under his covering a short round piece of wood like
a school-ruler and clapped it to his lips our pistols rang out
together he whirled round threw up his arms and with a kind of
choking cough fell sideways into the stream i caught one glimpse of
his venomous menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters at the
same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put
it hard down so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank
while we shot past her stern only clearing her by a few feet we were
round after her in an instant but she was already nearly at the bank
it was a wild and desolate place where the moon glimmered upon a wide
expanse of marsh-land with pools of stagnant water and beds of
decaying vegetation the launch with a dull thud ran up upon the
mud-bank with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water
the fugitive sprang out but his stump instantly sank its whole length
into the sodden soil in vain he struggled and writhed not one step
could he possibly take either forwards or backwards he yelled in
impotent rage and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot
but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky
bank when we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored
that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that
we were able to haul him out and to drag him like some evil fish
over our side the two smiths father and son sat sullenly in their
launch but came aboard meekly enough when commanded the aurora
herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern a solid iron chest
of indian workmanship stood upon the deck this there could be no
question was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of
the sholtos there was no key but it was of considerable weight so
we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin as we steamed
slowly up-stream again we flashed our search-light in every direction
but there was no sign of the islander somewhere in the dark ooze at
the bottom of the thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our
shores


see here said holmes pointing to the wooden hatchway we were
hardly quick enough with our pistols there sure enough just behind
where we had been standing stuck one of those murderous darts which we
knew so well it must have whizzed between us at the instant that we
fired holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy
fashion but i confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible
death which had passed so close to us that night



chapter xi

the great agra treasure

our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done
so much and waited so long to gain he was a sunburned reckless-eyed
fellow with a net-work of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany
features which told of a hard open-air life there was a singular
prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be
easily turned from his purpose his age may have been fifty or
thereabouts for his black curly hair was thickly shot with gray his
face in repose was not an unpleasing one though his heavy brows and
aggressive chin gave him as i had lately seen a terrible expression
when moved to anger he sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his
lap and his head sunk upon his breast while he looked with his keen
twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings
it seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and
contained countenance once he looked up at me with a gleam of
something like humor in his eyes

well jonathan small said holmes lighting a cigar i am sorry that
it has come to this

and so am i sir he answered frankly i don't believe that i can
swing over the job i give you my word on the book that i never raised
hand against mr sholto it was that little hell-hound tonga who shot
one of his cursed darts into him i had no part in it sir i was as
grieved as if it had been my blood-relation i welted the little devil
with the slack end of the rope for it but it was done and i could not
undo it again

have a cigar said holmes and you had best take a pull out of my
flask for you are very wet how could you expect so small and weak a
man as this black fellow to overpower mr sholto and hold him while you
were climbing the rope

you seem to know as much about it as if you were there sir the truth
is that i hoped to find the room clear i knew the habits of the house
pretty well and it was the time when mr sholto usually went down to
his supper i shall make no secret of the business the best defence
that i can make is just the simple truth now if it had been the old
major i would have swung for him with a light heart i would have
thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar but it's
cursed hard that i should be lagged over this young sholto with whom i
had no quarrel whatever

you are under the charge of mr athelney jones of scotland yard he
is going to bring you up to my rooms and i shall ask you for a true
account of the matter you must make a clean breast of it for if you
do i hope that i may be of use to you i think i can prove that the
poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached
the room

that he was sir i never got such a turn in my life as when i saw
him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as i climbed through
the window it fairly shook me sir i'd have half killed tonga for
it if he had not scrambled off that was how he came to leave his
club and some of his darts too as he tells me which i dare say
helped to put you on our track though how you kept on it is more than
i can tell i don't feel no malice against you for it but it does
seem a queer thing he added with a bitter smile that i who have a
fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first
half of my life building a breakwater in the andamans and am like to
spend the other half digging drains at dartmoor it was an evil day
for me when first i clapped eyes upon the merchant achmet and had to do
with the agra treasure which never brought anything but a curse yet
upon the man who owned it to him it brought murder to major sholto
it brought fear and guilt to me it has meant slavery for life

at this moment athelney jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders
into the tiny cabin quite a family party he remarked i think i
shall have a pull at that flask holmes well i think we may all
congratulate each other pity we didn't take the other alive but
there was no choice i say holmes you must confess that you cut it
rather fine it was all we could do to overhaul her

all is well that ends well said holmes but i certainly did not
know that the aurora was such a clipper

smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river and that
if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never
have caught her he swears he knew nothing of this norwood business

neither he did cried our prisoner not a word i chose his launch
because i heard that she was a flier we told him nothing but we paid
him well and he was to get something handsome if we reached our
vessel the esmeralda at gravesend outward bound for the brazils

well if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him
if we are pretty quick in catching our men we are not so quick in
condemning them it was amusing to notice how the consequential jones
was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the
capture from the slight smile which played over sherlock holmes's
face i could see that the speech had not been lost upon him

we will be at vauxhall bridge presently said jones and shall land
you dr watson with the treasure-box i need hardly tell you that i
am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this it is
most irregular but of course an agreement is an agreement i must
however as a matter of duty send an inspector with you since you
have so valuable a charge you will drive no doubt

yes i shall drive

it is a pity there is no key that we may make an inventory first
you will have to break it open where is the key my man

at the bottom of the river said small shortly

hum there was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble we have
had work enough already through you however doctor i need not warn
you to be careful bring the box back with you to the baker street
rooms you will find us there on our way to the station

they landed me at vauxhall with my heavy iron box and with a bluff
genial inspector as my companion a quarter of an hour's drive brought
us to mrs cecil forrester's the servant seemed surprised at so late
a visitor mrs cecil forrester was out for the evening she
explained and likely to be very late miss morstan however was in
the drawing-room so to the drawing-room i went box in hand leaving
the obliging inspector in the cab

she was seated by the open window dressed in some sort of white
diaphanous material with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and
waist the soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned
back in the basket chair playing over her sweet grave face and
tinting with a dull metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant
hair one white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair and
her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy at the
sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet however and a bright
flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks

i heard a cab drive up she said i thought that mrs forrester had
come back very early but i never dreamed that it might be you what
news have you brought me

i have brought something better than news said i putting down the
box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously though my
heart was heavy within me i have brought you something which is
worth all the news in the world i have brought you a fortune

she glanced at the iron box is that the treasure then she asked
coolly enough

yes this is the great agra treasure half of it is yours and half is
thaddeus sholto's you will have a couple of hundred thousand each
think of that an annuity of ten thousand pounds there will be few
richer young ladies in england is it not glorious

i think that i must have been rather overacting my delight and that
she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations for i saw her
eyebrows rise a little and she glanced at me curiously

if i have it said she i owe it to you

no no i answered not to me but to my friend sherlock holmes
with all the will in the world i could never have followed up a clue
which has taxed even his analytical genius as it was we very nearly
lost it at the last moment

pray sit down and tell me all about it dr watson said she

i narrated briefly what had occurred since i had seen her
last holmes's new method of search the discovery of the aurora the
appearance of athelney jones our expedition in the evening and the
wild chase down the thames she listened with parted lips and shining
eyes to my recital of our adventures when i spoke of the dart which
had so narrowly missed us she turned so white that i feared that she
was about to faint

it is nothing she said as i hastened to pour her out some water
i am all right again it was a shock to me to hear that i had placed
my friends in such horrible peril

that is all over i answered it was nothing i will tell you no
more gloomy details let us turn to something brighter there is the
treasure what could be brighter than that i got leave to bring it
with me thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it

it would be of the greatest interest to me she said there was no
eagerness in her voice however it had struck her doubtless that it
might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which
had cost so much to win

what a pretty box she said stooping over it this is indian work
i suppose

yes it is benares metal-work

and so heavy she exclaimed trying to raise it the box alone must
be of some value where is the key

small threw it into the thames i answered i must borrow mrs
forrester's poker there was in the front a thick and broad hasp
wrought in the image of a sitting buddha under this i thrust the end
of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever the hasp sprang open
with a loud snap with trembling fingers i flung back the lid we
both stood gazing in astonishment the box was empty

no wonder that it was heavy the iron-work was two-thirds of an inch
thick all round it was massive well made and solid like a chest
constructed to carry things of great price but not one shred or crumb
of metal or jewelry lay within it it was absolutely and completely
empty

the treasure is lost said miss morstan calmly

as i listened to the words and realized what they meant a great shadow
seemed to pass from my soul i did not know how this agra treasure had
weighed me down until now that it was finally removed it was
selfish no doubt disloyal wrong but i could realize nothing save
that the golden barrier was gone from between us thank god i
ejaculated from my very heart

she looked at me with a quick questioning smile why do you say
that she asked

because you are within my reach again i said taking her hand she
did not withdraw it because i love you mary as truly as ever a man
loved a woman because this treasure these riches sealed my lips
now that they are gone i can tell you how i love you that is why i
said thank god

then i say thank god too she whispered as i drew her to my
side whoever had lost a treasure i knew that night that i had gained
one



chapter xii

the strange story of jonathan small

a very patient man was that inspector in the cab for it was a weary
time before i rejoined him his face clouded over when i showed him
the empty box

there goes the reward said he gloomily where there is no money
there is no pay this night's work would have been worth a tenner each
to sam brown and me if the treasure had been there

mr thaddeus sholto is a rich man i said he will see that you are
rewarded treasure or no

the inspector shook his head despondently however it's a bad job
he repeated and so mr athelney jones will think

his forecast proved to be correct for the detective looked blank
enough when i got to baker street and showed him the empty box they
had only just arrived holmes the prisoner and he for they had
changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon
the way my companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless
expression while small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden
leg cocked over his sound one as i exhibited the empty box he leaned
back in his chair and laughed aloud

this is your doing small said athelney jones angrily

yes i have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it he
cried exultantly it is my treasure and if i can't have the loot
i'll take darned good care that no one else does i tell you that no
living man has any right to it unless it is three men who are in the
andaman convict-barracks and myself i know now that i cannot have the
use of it and i know that they cannot i have acted all through for
them as much as for myself it's been the sign of four with us always
well i know that they would have had me do just what i have done and
throw the treasure into the thames rather than let it go to kith or kin
of sholto or of morstan it was not to make them rich that we did for
achmet you'll find the treasure where the key is and where little
tonga is when i saw that your launch must catch us i put the loot
away in a safe place there are no rupees for you this journey

you are deceiving us small said athelney jones sternly if you
had wished to throw the treasure into the thames it would have been
easier for you to have thrown box and all

easier for me to throw and easier for you to recover he answered
with a shrewd sidelong look the man that was clever enough to hunt
me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a
river now that they are scattered over five miles or so it may be a
harder job it went to my heart to do it though i was half mad when
you came up with us however there's no good grieving over it i've
had ups in my life and i've had downs but i've learned not to cry
over spilled milk

this is a very serious matter small said the detective if you
had helped justice instead of thwarting it in this way you would have
had a better chance at your trial

justice snarled the ex-convict a pretty justice whose loot is
this if it is not ours where is the justice that i should give it up
to those who have never earned it look how i have earned it twenty
long years in that fever-ridden swamp all day at work under the
mangrove-tree all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts bitten
by mosquitoes racked with ague bullied by every cursed black-faced
policeman who loved to take it out of a white man that was how i
earned the agra treasure and you talk to me of justice because i
cannot bear to feel that i have paid this price only that another may
enjoy it i would rather swing a score of times or have one of
tonga's darts in my hide than live in a convict's cell and feel that
another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be
mine small had dropped his mask of stoicism and all this came out in
a wild whirl of words while his eyes blazed and the handcuffs clanked
together with the impassioned movement of his hands i could
understand as i saw the fury and the passion of the man that it was
no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed major sholto when
he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track

you forget that we know nothing of all this said holmes quietly
we have not heard your story and we cannot tell how far justice may
originally have been on your side

well sir you have been very fair-spoken to me though i can see that
i have you to thank that i have these bracelets upon my wrists still
i bear no grudge for that it is all fair and above-board if you
want to hear my story i have no wish to hold it back what i say to you
is god's truth every word of it thank you you can put the glass
beside me here and i'll put my lips to it if i am dry

i am a worcestershire man myself born near pershore i dare say you
would find a heap of smalls living there now if you were to look i
have often thought of taking a look round there but the truth is that
i was never much of a credit to the family and i doubt if they would
be so very glad to see me they were all steady chapel-going folk
small farmers well known and respected over the country-side while i
was always a bit of a rover at last however when i was about
eighteen i gave them no more trouble for i got into a mess over a
girl and could only get out of it again by taking the queen's shilling
and joining the d buffs which was just starting for india

i wasn't destined to do much soldiering however i had just got past
the goose-step and learned to handle my musket when i was fool enough
to go swimming in the ganges luckily for me my company sergeant
john holder was in the water at the same time and he was one of the
finest swimmers in the service a crocodile took me just as i was
half-way across and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon
could have done it just above the knee what with the shock and the
loss of blood i fainted and should have drowned if holder had not
caught hold of me and paddled for the bank i was five months in
hospital over it and when at last i was able to limp out of it with
this timber toe strapped to my stump i found myself invalided out of
the army and unfitted for any active occupation

i was as you can imagine pretty down on my luck at this time for i
was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year however my
misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise a man named
abelwhite who had come out there as an indigo-planter wanted an
overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work he
happened to be a friend of our colonel's who had taken an interest in
me since the accident to make a long story short the colonel
recommended me strongly for the post and as the work was mostly to be
done on horseback my leg was no great obstacle for i had enough knee
left to keep good grip on the saddle what i had to do was to ride
over the plantation to keep an eye on the men as they worked and to
report the idlers the pay was fair i had comfortable quarters and
altogether i was content to spend the remainder of my life in
indigo-planting mr abelwhite was a kind man and he would often drop
into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me for white folk out
there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at
home

well i was never in luck's way long suddenly without a note of
warning the great mutiny broke upon us one month india lay as still
and peaceful to all appearance as surrey or kent the next there were
two hundred thousand black devils let loose and the country was a
perfect hell of course you know all about it gentlemen a deal more
than i do very like since reading is not in my line i only know
what i saw with my own eyes our plantation was at a place called
muttra near the border of the northwest provinces night after night
the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows and day after day
we had small companies of europeans passing through our estate with
their wives and children on their way to agra where were the nearest
troops mr abelwhite was an obstinate man he had it in his head
that the affair had been exaggerated and that it would blow over as
suddenly as it had sprung up there he sat on his veranda drinking
whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots while the country was in a blaze
about him of course we stuck by him i and dawson who with his
wife used to do the book-work and the managing well one fine day
the crash came i had been away on a distant plantation and was
riding slowly home in the evening when my eye fell upon something all
huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah i rode down to see
what it was and the cold struck through my heart when i found it was
dawson's wife all cut into ribbons and half eaten by jackals and
native dogs a little further up the road dawson himself was lying on
his face quite dead with an empty revolver in his hand and four
sepoys lying across each other in front of him i reined up my horse
wondering which way i should turn but at that moment i saw thick smoke
curling up from abelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst
through the roof i knew then that i could do my employer no good but
would only throw my own life away if i meddled in the matter from
where i stood i could see hundreds of the black fiends with their red
coats still on their backs dancing and howling round the burning
house some of them pointed at me and a couple of bullets sang past
my head so i broke away across the paddy-fields and found myself late
at night safe within the walls at agra

as it proved however there was no great safety there either the
whole country was up like a swarm of bees wherever the english could
collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns
commanded everywhere else they were helpless fugitives it was a
fight of the millions against the hundreds and the cruellest part of
it was that these men that we fought against foot horse and gunners
were our own picked troops whom we had taught and trained handling
our own weapons and blowing our own bugle-calls at agra there were
the d bengal fusiliers some sikhs two troops of horse and a battery
of artillery a volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been
formed and this i joined wooden leg and all we went out to meet the
rebels at shahgunge early in july and we beat them back for a time
but our powder gave out and we had to fall back upon the city
nothing but the worst news came to us from every side which is not to
be wondered at for if you look at the map you will see that we were
right in the heart of it lucknow is rather better than a hundred
miles to the east and cawnpore about as far to the south from every
point on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and
outrage

the city of agra is a great place swarming with fanatics and fierce
devil-worshippers of all sorts our handful of men were lost among the
narrow winding streets our leader moved across the river therefore
and took up his position in the old fort at agra i don't know if any
of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort it
is a very queer place the queerest that ever i was in and i have
been in some rum corners too first of all it is enormous in size
i should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres there is a
modern part which took all our garrison women children stores and
everything else with plenty of room over but the modern part is
nothing like the size of the old quarter where nobody goes and which
is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes it is all full of
great deserted halls and winding passages and long corridors twisting
in and out so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it for
this reason it was seldom that any one went into it though now and
again a party with torches might go exploring

the river washes along the front of the old fort and so protects it
but on the sides and behind there are many doors and these had to be
guarded of course in the old quarter as well as in that which was
actually held by our troops we were short-handed with hardly men
enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns it was
impossible for us therefore to station a strong guard at every one of
the innumerable gates what we did was to organize a central
guard-house in the middle of the fort and to leave each gate under the
charge of one white man and two or three natives i was selected to
take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door
upon the southwest side of the building two sikh troopers were placed
under my command and i was instructed if anything went wrong to fire
my musket when i might rely upon help coming at once from the central
guard as the guard was a good two hundred paces away however and as
the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and
corridors i had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time
to be of any use in case of an actual attack

well i was pretty proud at having this small command given me since
i was a raw recruit and a game-legged one at that for two nights i
kept the watch with my punjaubees they were tall fierce-looking
chaps mahomet singh and abdullah khan by name both old fighting-men
who had borne arms against us at chilian-wallah they could talk
english pretty well but i could get little out of them they
preferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer sikh
lingo for myself i used to stand outside the gate-way looking down
on the broad winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great
city the beating of drums the rattle of tomtoms and the yells and
howls of the rebels drunk with opium and with bang were enough to
remind us all night of our dangerous neighbors across the stream
every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the
posts to make sure that all was well

the third night of my watch was dark and dirty with a small driving
rain it was dreary work standing in the gate-way hour after hour in
such weather i tried again and again to make my sikhs talk but
without much success at two in the morning the rounds passed and
broke for a moment the weariness of the night finding that my
companions would not be led into conversation i took out my pipe and
laid down my musket to strike the match in an instant the two sikhs
were upon me one of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at
my head while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore
between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if i moved a step

my first thought was that these fellows were in league with the
rebels and that this was the beginning of an assault if our door
were in the hands of the sepoys the place must fall and the women and
children be treated as they were in cawnpore maybe you gentlemen
think that i am just making out a case for myself but i give you my
word that when i thought of that though i felt the point of the knife
at my throat i opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream
if it was my last one which might alarm the main guard the man who
held me seemed to know my thoughts for even as i braced myself to it
he whispered don't make a noise the fort is safe enough there are
no rebel dogs on this side of the river there was the ring of truth
in what he said and i knew that if i raised my voice i was a dead man
i could read it in the fellow's brown eyes i waited therefore in
silence to see what it was that they wanted from me

listen to me sahib said the taller and fiercer of the pair the
one whom they called abdullah khan you must either be with us now or
you must be silenced forever the thing is too great a one for us to
hesitate either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the
cross of the christians or your body this night shall be thrown into
the ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army
there is no middle way which is it to be death or life we can only
give you three minutes to decide for the time is passing and all must
be done before the rounds come again

how can i decide said i you have not told me what you want of
me but i tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of
the fort i will have no truck with it so you can drive home your knife
and welcome

it is nothing against the fort said he we only ask you to do
that which your countrymen come to this land for we ask you to be
rich if you will be one of us this night we will swear to you upon
the naked knife and by the threefold oath which no sikh was ever known
to break that you shall have your fair share of the loot a quarter
of the treasure shall be yours we can say no fairer

but what is the treasure then i asked i am as ready to be rich
as you can be if you will but show me how it can be done

you will swear then said he by the bones of your father by the
honor of your mother by the cross of your faith to raise no hand and
speak no word against us either now or afterwards

i will swear it i answered provided that the fort is not
endangered

then my comrade and i will swear that you shall have a quarter of the
treasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us

there are but three said i

no dost akbar must have his share we can tell the tale to you
while we await them do you stand at the gate mahomet singh and give
notice of their coming the thing stands thus sahib and i tell it to
you because i know that an oath is binding upon a feringhee and that
we may trust you had you been a lying hindoo though you had sworn by
all the gods in their false temples your blood would have been upon
the knife and your body in the water but the sikh knows the
englishman and the englishman knows the sikh hearken then to what
i have to say

there is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth
though his lands are small much has come to him from his father and
more still he has set by himself for he is of a low nature and hoards
his gold rather than spend it when the troubles broke out he would be
friends both with the lion and the tiger with the sepoy and with the
company's raj soon however it seemed to him that the white men's
day was come for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of
their death and their overthrow yet being a careful man he made
such plans that come what might half at least of his treasure should
be left to him that which was in gold and silver he kept by him in
the vaults of his palace but the most precious stones and the choicest
pearls that he had he put in an iron box and sent it by a trusty
servant who under the guise of a merchant should take it to the fort
at agra there to lie until the land is at peace thus if the rebels
won he would have his money but if the company conquered his jewels
would be saved to him having thus divided his hoard he threw himself
into the cause of the sepoys since they were strong upon his borders
by doing this mark you sahib his property becomes the due of those
who have been true to their salt

this pretended merchant who travels under the name of achmet is now
in the city of agra and desires to gain his way into the fort he has
with him as travelling-companion my foster-brother dost akbar who
knows his secret dost akbar has promised this night to lead him to a
side-postern of the fort and has chosen this one for his purpose
here he will come presently and here he will find mahomet singh and
myself awaiting him the place is lonely and none shall know of his
coming the world shall know of the merchant achmet no more but the
great treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us what say you to
it sahib

in worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing
but it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and
you have been used to meeting death at every turn whether achmet the
merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me but at the
talk about the treasure my heart turned to it and i thought of what i
might do in the old country with it and how my folk would stare when
they saw their ne'er-do-well coming back with his pockets full of gold
moidores i had therefore already made up my mind abdullah khan
however thinking that i hesitated pressed the matter more closely

consider sahib said he that if this man is taken by the
commandant he will be hung or shot and his jewels taken by the
government so that no man will be a rupee the better for them now
since we do the taking of him why should we not do the rest as well
the jewels will be as well with us as in the company's coffers there
will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs no
one can know about the matter for here we are cut off from all men
what could be better for the purpose say again then sahib whether
you are with us or if we must look upon you as an enemy

i am with you heart and soul said i

it is well he answered handing me back my firelock you see that
we trust you for your word like ours is not to be broken we have
now only to wait for my brother and the merchant

does your brother know then of what you will do i asked

the plan is his he has devised it we will go to the gate and
share the watch with mahomet singh

the rain was still falling steadily for it was just the beginning of
the wet season brown heavy clouds were drifting across the sky and
it was hard to see more than a stone-cast a deep moat lay in front of
our door but the water was in places nearly dried up and it could
easily be crossed it was strange to me to be standing there with
those two wild punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his
death

suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side
of the moat it vanished among the mound-heaps and then appeared
again coming slowly in our direction

here they are i exclaimed

you will challenge him sahib as usual whispered abdullah give
him no cause for fear send us in with him and we shall do the rest
while you stay here on guard have the lantern ready to uncover that
we may be sure that it is indeed the man

the light had flickered onwards now stopping and now advancing until
i could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat i let
them scramble down the sloping bank splash through the mire and climb
half-way up to the gate before i challenged them

who goes there said i in a subdued voice

friends came the answer i uncovered my lantern and threw a flood
of light upon them the first was an enormous sikh with a black beard
which swept nearly down to his cummerbund outside of a show i have
never seen so tall a man the other was a little fat round fellow
with a great yellow turban and a bundle in his hand done up in a
shawl he seemed to be all in a quiver with fear for his hands
twitched as if he had the ague and his head kept turning to left and
right with two bright little twinkling eyes like a mouse when he
ventures out from his hole it gave me the chills to think of killing
him but i thought of the treasure and my heart set as hard as a flint
within me when he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy
and came running up towards me

your protection sahib he panted your protection for the unhappy
merchant achmet i have travelled across rajpootana that i might seek
the shelter of the fort at agra i have been robbed and beaten and
abused because i have been the friend of the company it is a blessed
night this when i am once more in safety i and my poor possessions

what have you in the bundle i asked

an iron box he answered which contains one or two little family
matters which are of no value to others but which i should be sorry to
lose yet i am not a beggar and i shall reward you young sahib and
your governor also if he will give me the shelter i ask

i could not trust myself to speak longer with the man the more i
looked at his fat frightened face the harder did it seem that we
should slay him in cold blood it was best to get it over

take him to the main guard said i the two sikhs closed in upon
him on each side and the giant walked behind while they marched in
through the dark gate-way never was a man so compassed round with
death i remained at the gate-way with the lantern

i could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through
the lonely corridors suddenly it ceased and i heard voices and a
scuffle with the sound of blows a moment later there came to my
horror a rush of footsteps coming in my direction with the loud
breathing of a running man i turned my lantern down the long
straight passage and there was the fat man running like the wind
with a smear of blood across his face and close at his heels bounding
like a tiger the great black-bearded sikh with a knife flashing in
his hand i have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant
he was gaining on the sikh and i could see that if he once passed me
and got to the open air he would save himself yet my heart softened
to him but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and
bitter i cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past and he
rolled twice over like a shot rabbit ere he could stagger to his feet
the sikh was upon him and buried his knife twice in his side the man
never uttered moan nor moved muscle but lay were he had fallen i
think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall you see
gentlemen that i am keeping my promise i am telling you every work
of the business just exactly as it happened whether it is in my favor
or not

he stopped and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water
which holmes had brewed for him for myself i confess that i had now
conceived the utmost horror of the man not only for this cold-blooded
business in which he had been concerned but even more for the somewhat
flippant and careless way in which he narrated it whatever punishment
was in store for him i felt that he might expect no sympathy from me
sherlock holmes and jones sat with their hands upon their knees deeply
interested in the story but with the same disgust written upon their
faces he may have observed it for there was a touch of defiance in
his voice and manner as he proceeded

it was all very bad no doubt said he i should like to know how
many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when
they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains
besides it was my life or his when once he was in the fort if he had
got out the whole business would come to light and i should have been
court-martialled and shot as likely as not for people were not very
lenient at a time like that

go on with your story said holmes shortly

well we carried him in abdullah akbar and i a fine weight he
was too for all that he was so short mahomet singh was left to
guard the door we took him to a place which the sikhs had already
prepared it was some distance off where a winding passage leads to a
great empty hall the brick walls of which were all crumbling to
pieces the earth floor had sunk in at one place making a natural
grave so we left achmet the merchant there having first covered him
over with loose bricks this done we all went back to the treasure

it lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked the box
was the same which now lies open upon your table a key was hung by a
silken cord to that carved handle upon the top we opened it and the
light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as i have
read of and thought about when i was a little lad at pershore it was
blinding to look upon them when we had feasted our eyes we took them
all out and made a list of them there were one hundred and
forty-three diamonds of the first water including one which has been
called i believe the great mogul and is said to be the second
largest stone in existence then there were ninety-seven very fine
emeralds and one hundred and seventy rubies some of which however
were small there were forty carbuncles two hundred and ten
sapphires sixty-one agates and a great quantity of beryls onyxes
cats-eyes turquoises and other stones the very names of which i did
not know at the time though i have become more familiar with them
since besides this there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls
twelve of which were set in a gold coronet by the way these last had
been taken out of the chest and were not there when i recovered it

after we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and
carried them to the gate-way to show them to mahomet singh then we
solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our
secret we agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the
country should be at peace again and then to divide it equally among
ourselves there was no use dividing it at present for if gems of
such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion and there was
no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them we
carried the box therefore into the same hall where we had buried the
body and there under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall we
made a hollow and put our treasure we made careful note of the place
and next day i drew four plans one for each of us and put the sign of
the four of us at the bottom for we had sworn that we should each
always act for all so that none might take advantage that is an oath
that i can put my hand to my heart and swear that i have never broken

well there's no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the indian
mutiny after wilson took delhi and sir colin relieved lucknow the
back of the business was broken fresh troops came pouring in and
nana sahib made himself scarce over the frontier a flying column under
colonel greathed came round to agra and cleared the pandies away from
it peace seemed to be settling upon the country and we four were
beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off
with our shares of the plunder in a moment however our hopes were
shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of achmet

it came about in this way when the rajah put his jewels into the
hands of achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man
they are suspicious folk in the east however so what does this rajah
do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the
spy upon the first this second man was ordered never to let achmet
out of his sight and he followed him like his shadow he went after
him that night and saw him pass through the doorway of course he
thought he had taken refuge in the fort and applied for admission
there himself next day but could find no trace of achmet this seemed
to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides who
brought it to the ears of the commandant a thorough search was
quickly made and the body was discovered thus at the very moment
that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought
to trial on a charge of murder three of us because we had held the
gate that night and the fourth because he was known to have been in
the company of the murdered man not a word about the jewels came out
at the trial for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of india
so no one had any particular interest in them the murder however
was clearly made out and it was certain that we must all have been
concerned in it the three sikhs got penal servitude for life and i
was condemned to death though my sentence was afterwards commuted into
the same as the others

it was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then there
we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of
ever getting out again while we each held a secret which might have
put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it it
was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick
and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office to have rice to eat and
water to drink when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside
just waiting to be picked up it might have driven me mad but i was
always a pretty stubborn one so i just held on and bided my time

at last it seemed to me to have come i was changed from agra to
madras and from there to blair island in the andamans there are very
few white convicts at this settlement and as i had behaved well from
the first i soon found myself a sort of privileged person i was
given a hut in hope town which is a small place on the slopes of mount
harriet and i was left pretty much to myself it is a dreary
fever-stricken place and all beyond our little clearings was infested
with wild cannibal natives who were ready enough to blow a poisoned
dart at us if they saw a chance there was digging and ditching and
yam-planting and a dozen other things to be done so we were busy
enough all day though in the evening we had a little time to
ourselves among other things i learned to dispense drugs for the
surgeon and picked up a smattering of his knowledge all the time i
was on the lookout for a chance of escape but it is hundreds of miles
from any other land and there is little or no wind in those seas so
it was a terribly difficult job to get away

the surgeon dr somerton was a fast sporting young chap and the
other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play
cards the surgery where i used to make up my drugs was next to his
sitting-room with a small window between us often if i felt
lonesome i used to turn out the lamp in the surgery and then
standing there i could hear their talk and watch their play i am
fond of a hand at cards myself and it was almost as good as having one
to watch the others there was major sholto captain morstan and
lieutenant bromley brown who were in command of the native troops and
there was the surgeon himself and two or three prison-officials
crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game a very snug little
party they used to make

well there was one thing which very soon struck me and that was that
the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win mind i
don't say that there was anything unfair but so it was these
prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had
been at the andamans and they knew each other's game to a point while
the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down
anyhow night after night the soldiers got up poorer men and the
poorer they got the more keen they were to play major sholto was the
hardest hit he used to pay in notes and gold at first but soon it
came to notes of hand and for big sums he sometimes would win for a
few deals just to give him heart and then the luck would set in
against him worse than ever all day he would wander about as black as
thunder and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him

one night he lost even more heavily than usual i was sitting in my
hut when he and captain morstan came stumbling along on the way to
their quarters they were bosom friends those two and never far
apart the major was raving about his losses

it's all up morstan he was saying as they passed my hut i shall
have to send in my papers i am a ruined man

nonsense old chap said the other slapping him upon the shoulder
i've had a nasty facer myself but  that was all i could hear but
it was enough to set me thinking

a couple of days later major sholto was strolling on the beach so i
took the chance of speaking to him

i wish to have your advice major said i

well small what is it he asked taking his cheroot from his lips

i wanted to ask you sir said i who is the proper person to whom
hidden treasure should be handed over i know where half a million
worth lies and as i cannot use it myself i thought perhaps the best
thing that i could do would be to hand it over to the proper
authorities and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for
me

half a million small he gasped looking hard at me to see if i was
in earnest

quite that sir in jewels and pearls it lies there ready for any
one and the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed
and cannot hold property so that it belongs to the first comer

to government small he stammered to government but he said
it in a halting fashion and i knew in my heart that i had got him

you think then sir that i should give the information to the
governor-general said i quietly

well well you must not do anything rash or that you might repent
let me hear all about it small give me the facts

i told him the whole story with small changes so that he could not
identify the places when i had finished he stood stock still and full
of thought i could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a
struggle going on within him

this is a very important matter small he said at last you must
not say a word to any one about it and i shall see you again soon

two nights later he and his friend captain morstan came to my hut in
the dead of the night with a lantern

i want you just to let captain morstan hear that story from your own
lips small said he

i repeated it as i had told it before

it rings true eh said he it's good enough to act upon

captain morstan nodded

look here small said the major we have been talking it over my
friend here and i and we have come to the conclusion that this secret
of yours is hardly a government matter after all but is a private
concern of your own which of course you have the power of disposing of
as you think best now the question is what price would you ask for
it we might be inclined to take it up and at least look into it if
we could agree as to terms he tried to speak in a cool careless
way but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed

why as to that gentlemen i answered trying also to be cool but
feeling as excited as he did there is only one bargain which a man in
my position can make i shall want you to help me to my freedom and
to help my three companions to theirs we shall then take you into
partnership and give you a fifth share to divide between you

hum said he a fifth share that is not very tempting

it would come to fifty thousand apiece said i

but how can we gain your freedom you know very well that you ask an
impossibility

nothing of the sort i answered i have thought it all out to the
last detail the only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit
for the voyage and no provisions to last us for so long a time there
are plenty of little yachts and yawls at calcutta or madras which would
serve our turn well do you bring one over we shall engage to get
aboard her by night and if you will drop us on any part of the indian
coast you will have done your part of the bargain

if there were only one he said

none or all i answered we have sworn it the four of us must
always act together

you see morstan said he small is a man of his word he does not
flinch from his friend i think we may very well trust him

it's a dirty business the other answered yet as you say the
money would save our commissions handsomely

well small said the major we must i suppose try and meet you
we must first of course test the truth of your story tell me where
the box is hid and i shall get leave of absence and go back to india
in the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair

not so fast said i growing colder as he got hot i must have the
consent of my three comrades i tell you that it is four or none with
us

nonsense he broke in what have three black fellows to do with
our agreement

black or blue said i they are in with me and we all go together

well the matter ended by a second meeting at which mahomet singh
abdullah khan and dost akbar were all present we talked the matter
over again and at last we came to an arrangement we were to provide
both the officers with charts of the part of the agra fort and mark the
place in the wall where the treasure was hid major sholto was to go
to india to test our story if he found the box he was to leave it
there to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage which was to
lie off rutland island and to which we were to make our way and
finally to return to his duties captain morstan was then to apply for
leave of absence to meet us at agra and there we were to have a final
division of the treasure he taking the major's share as well as his
own all this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could
think or the lips utter i sat up all night with paper and ink and by
the morning i had the two charts all ready signed with the sign of
four that is of abdullah akbar mahomet and myself

well gentlemen i weary you with my long story and i know that my
friend mr jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey i'll
make it as short as i can the villain sholto went off to india but
he never came back again captain morstan showed me his name among a
list of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards
his uncle had died leaving him a fortune and he had left the army
yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us morstan
went over to agra shortly afterwards and found as we expected that
the treasure was indeed gone the scoundrel had stolen it all without
carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret
from that day i lived only for vengeance i thought of it by day and i
nursed it by night it became an overpowering absorbing passion with
me i cared nothing for the law nothing for the gallows to escape
to track down sholto to have my hand upon his throat that was my one
thought even the agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my
mind than the slaying of sholto

well i have set my mind on many things in this life and never one
which i did not carry out but it was weary years before my time came
i have told you that i had picked up something of medicine one day
when dr somerton was down with a fever a little andaman islander was
picked up by a convict-gang in the woods he was sick to death and
had gone to a lonely place to die i took him in hand though he was
as venomous as a young snake and after a couple of months i got him
all right and able to walk he took a kind of fancy to me then and
would hardly go back to his woods but was always hanging about my hut
i learned a little of his lingo from him and this made him all the
fonder of me

tonga for that was his name was a fine boatman and owned a big
roomy canoe of his own when i found that he was devoted to me and
would do anything to serve me i saw my chance of escape i talked it
over with him he was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an
old wharf which was never guarded and there he was to pick me up i
gave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams
cocoa-nuts and sweet potatoes

he was stanch and true was little tonga no man ever had a more
faithful mate at the night named he had his boat at the wharf as it
chanced however there was one of the convict-guard down there a
vile pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me
i had always vowed vengeance and now i had my chance it was as if
fate had placed him in my way that i might pay my debt before i left
the island he stood on the bank with his back to me and his carbine
on his shoulder i looked about for a stone to beat out his brains
with but none could i see then a queer thought came into my head and
showed me where i could lay my hand on a weapon i sat down in the
darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg with three long hops i was on
him he put his carbine to his shoulder but i struck him full and
knocked the whole front of his skull in you can see the split in the
wood now where i hit him we both went down together for i could not
keep my balance but when i got up i found him still lying quiet
enough i made for the boat and in an hour we were well out at sea
tonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him his arms and
his gods among other things he had a long bamboo spear and some
andaman cocoa-nut matting with which i made a sort of sail for ten
days we were beating about trusting to luck and on the eleventh we
were picked up by a trader which was going from singapore to jiddah
with a cargo of malay pilgrims they were a rum crowd and tonga and i
soon managed to settle down among them they had one very good
quality they let you alone and asked no questions

well if i were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and
i went through you would not thank me for i would have you here until
the sun was shining here and there we drifted about the world
something always turning up to keep us from london all the time
however i never lost sight of my purpose i would dream of sholto at
night a hundred times i have killed him in my sleep at last
however some three or four years ago we found ourselves in england
i had no great difficulty in finding where sholto lived and i set to
work to discover whether he had realized the treasure or if he still
had it i made friends with someone who could help me i name no
names for i don't want to get any one else in a hole and i soon
found that he still had the jewels then i tried to get at him in many
ways but he was pretty sly and had always two prize-fighters besides
his sons and his khitmutgar on guard over him

one day however i got word that he was dying i hurried at once to
the garden mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that and
looking through the window i saw him lying in his bed with his sons
on each side of him i'd have come through and taken my chance with
the three of them only even as i looked at him his jaw dropped and i
knew that he was gone i got into his room that same night though
and i searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he
had hidden our jewels there was not a line however so i came away
bitter and savage as a man could be before i left i bethought me that
if i ever met my sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know
that i had left some mark of our hatred so i scrawled down the sign
of the four of us as it had been on the chart and i pinned it on his
bosom it was too much that he should be taken to the grave without
some token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled

we earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor tonga at fairs
and other such places as the black cannibal he would eat raw meat and
dance his war-dance so we always had a hatful of pennies after a
day's work i still heard all the news from pondicherry lodge and for
some years there was no news to hear except that they were hunting for
the treasure at last however came what we had waited for so long
the treasure had been found it was up at the top of the house in mr
bartholomew sholto's chemical laboratory i came at once and had a
look at the place but i could not see how with my wooden leg i was to
make my way up to it i learned however about a trap-door in the
roof and also about mr sholto's supper-hour it seemed to me that i
could manage the thing easily through tonga i brought him out with me
with a long rope wound round his waist he could climb like a cat and
he soon made his way through the roof but as ill luck would have it
bartholomew sholto was still in the room to his cost tonga thought
he had done something very clever in killing him for when i came up by
the rope i found him strutting about as proud as a peacock very much
surprised was he when i made at him with the rope's end and cursed him
for a little blood-thirsty imp i took the treasure-box and let it
down and then slid down myself having first left the sign of the four
upon the table to show that the jewels had come back at last to those
who had most right to them tonga then pulled up the rope closed the
window and made off the way that he had come

i don't know that i have anything else to tell you i had heard a
waterman speak of the speed of smith's launch the aurora so i thought
she would be a handy craft for our escape i engaged with old smith
and was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship he knew
no doubt that there was some screw loose but he was not in our
secrets all this is the truth and if i tell it to you gentlemen it
is not to amuse you for you have not done me a very good turn but
it is because i believe the best defence i can make is just to hold
back nothing but let all the world know how badly i have myself been
served by major sholto and how innocent i am of the death of his son

a very remarkable account said sherlock holmes a fitting wind-up
to an extremely interesting case there is nothing at all new to me in
the latter part of your narrative except that you brought your own
rope that i did not know by the way i had hoped that tonga had
lost all his darts yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat

he had lost them all sir except the one which was in his blow-pipe
at the time

ah of course said holmes i had not thought of that

is there any other point which you would like to ask about asked the
convict affably

i think not thank you my companion answered

well holmes said athelney jones you are a man to be humored and
we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime but duty is duty and
i have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me i
shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under
lock and key the cab still waits and there are two inspectors
down-stairs i am much obliged to you both for your assistance of
course you will be wanted at the trial good-night to you

good-night gentlemen both said jonathan small

you first small remarked the wary jones as they left the room
i'll take particular care that you don't club me with your wooden leg
whatever you may have done to the gentleman at the andaman isles

well and there is the end of our little drama i remarked after we
had set some time smoking in silence i fear that it may be the last
investigation in which i shall have the chance of studying your
methods miss morstan has done me the honor to accept me as a husband
in prospective

he gave a most dismal groan i feared as much said he i really
cannot congratulate you

i was a little hurt have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my
choice i asked

not at all i think she is one of the most charming young ladies i
ever met and might have been most useful in such work as we have been
doing she had a decided genius that way witness the way in which she
preserved that agra plan from all the other papers of her father but
love is an emotional thing and whatever is emotional is opposed to
that true cold reason which i place above all things i should never
marry myself lest i bias my judgment

i trust said i laughing that my judgment may survive the ordeal
but you look weary

yes the reaction is already upon me i shall be as limp as a rag for
a week

strange said i how terms of what in another man i should call
laziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigor

yes he answered there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer
and also of a pretty spry sort of fellow i often think of those lines
of old goethe 

 schade dass die natur nur einen mensch aus dir schuf
 denn zum wuerdigen mann war und zum schelmen der stoff

by the way a propos of this norwood business you see that they had
as i surmised a confederate in the house who could be none other than
lal rao the butler so jones actually has the undivided honor of
having caught one fish in his great haul

the division seems rather unfair i remarked you have done all the
work in this business i get a wife out of it jones gets the credit
pray what remains for you

for me said sherlock holmes there still remains the
cocaine-bottle and he stretched his long white hand up for it

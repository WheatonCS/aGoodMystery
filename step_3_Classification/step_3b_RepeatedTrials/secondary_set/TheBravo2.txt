yet a few days and dreamperturbed nights
and i shall slumber well but where no matter
adieu my angelina
marino falter
when the carmelite reentered the apartment 
donna violetta his face was covered with the hue
 death and his limbs with difficulty supported him
to a chair he scarcely observed that don camilla
monforte was still present not did he note the brightness
and joy which glowed in the eyes the ardent
violetta indeed his appearance was at first unseen
by the happy lovers for the lord st agata had
succeeded in wresting the secret from the breast 
his mistress if that may be called a secret which
italian character had scarcely struggled to retain
and he had crossed the room before even the more
tranquil look the donna florinda rested on his
person
thou art ill exclaimed the governess father
anselmo hath not been absent without grave cause
the monk threw back his cowl for air and the
act discovered the deadly paleness his features
but his eye charged with a meaning horror
rolled over the faces those who drew around
him as if he struggled with memory to recall their
persons
ferdinando father anselmo cried the donna
florinda correcting the unbidden familiarity though
she could not command the anxiety her rebel features
 speak to us thou art suffering 
 the bravo
 at heart florinda
deceive us not haply thou hast more evil
tidings venice 
is a fearful state
why hast thou quitted us why in a moment 
so much importance to our pupil a moment that
may prse the last influence on her happiness
hast thou been absent for a long hour
violetta turned a surprised and unconscious glance
towards the clock but she spoke not
the servants the state had need me
returned the monk easing the pain his spirit by
a groan
i understand thee father thou hast shrived
a penitent
daughter i have and fewer depart more at
peace with god and their fellows 
donna florinda murmured a short prayer for the
soul the dead piously crossing herself as she concluded
her example was imitated by her pupil
and even the lips don camillo moved while his
head was bowed by the side his fair companion
in seeming reverence
twas a just father demanded donna
florinda 
it was an unmerited one cried the monk with
fervor or there is no faith in man i have witnessed
the death one who was better fitted to
live as happily he was better fitted to die than
those who pronounced his doom what a fearful
state is verse
and such are they who are masters thy person
violetta said don camillo to these midnight
murderers will thy happiness be consigned tell us
father does thy sad tragedy touch in any manner
on the interests this fair being for we are encircled
here by mysteries that are as incomprehensible
while they are nearly as fearful as fate itself
the bravo 
the monk looked from one to the other and a
more human expression began to appear in his
countenance
thou art right he said such are the men
who mean to dispose the person our pupil
holy st mark pardon the prostitution his revered
name and shield her with the virtue his
prayers 
father are we worthy to know more that
thou hast witnessed
the secrets the confessional are sacred my
son but this hath been a disclosure to cover the
living and not the dead with shame
i see the hand those up above in this for so
most spoke the council three they have
tampered with my right for years to suit their selfish
purposes and to my shame must i own it they
have driven me to a submission in order to obtain
justice that as ill accords with my feelings as with
my character
nay camillo thou art incapable this injustice
to thyself
tis a fearful government dearest and its fruits
are equally pernicious to the ruler and the subject
it hath all other dangers the greatest the curse
 secrecy on its intentions its acts and its responsibilities
 
thou sayest true my son there is no security
against oppression and wrong in a state but the fear
 god or the fear man the first venice
hath none for too many souls share the odium 
her sins and as for the last her deeds are hid from
their knowledge
we speak boldly for those who live beneath her
laws observed donna florinda glancing a look
timidly around her as we can neither change
nor amend the practices the state better that we
should be silent
a 
 the bravo
if we cannot alter the power the council we
may elude it hastily answered don camillo though
he too dropped his voice and assured himself 
their security by closing the casement and casting
his eyes towards the different doors the room
are you assured the fidelity the menials
donna florinda
far from it signore we have those who are
 ancient service and tried character but we
have those who are named by the senator gradeni
go and who are doubtless no other than the agents
 the state
in this lanner do they pry into the privacy 
all i am compelled to entertain in my palace varlets
that i know to be their hirelings and yet do i
find it better to seem unconscious their views lest
they environ me in a manner that i cannot even suspect
think you father that my presence here hath
escaped the spies
it would be to hazard much were we to rely on
such security none saw us enter as i think for we
used the secret gate and the more private entrance 
but who is certain being unobserved when every
fifth eye is that a mercenary
the terrified violetta laid her hand on the arm 
her lover
even now camillo she said thou mayest be
observed and secretly devoted to punishment 
if seen doubt it not st mark will never pardon
so bold an interference with his pleasure and
yet sweetest violetta to gain thy favor this risk is
nothing nor will a far greater hazard turn me from
my purpose
these inexperienced and confiding spirits have
taken advantage my absence to communicate more
freely than was discreet said the carmelite in the
manner one who foresaw the answer
the bravo 
father nature is too strong for the weak preventives
 prudence
the brow the monk became clouded his companions
watched the workings his mind as they
appeared in a countenance that in common was so
benevolent though always sad for a few moments
none broke the silence n
the carmelite at length demanded raising his
troubled look to the countenance don camillo
hast thou duly reflected on the consequences 
this rashness son what dost thou purpose in thus
braving the anger the republic and in setting at
defiance her arts her secret means intelligence
and her terrors
father i have reflected as all my years reflect
when in heart and soul they love i have brought
myself to feel that any misery would be happiness
compared to the loss violetta and that no risk
can exceed the reward gaining her favor thus
much for the first thy questions for the last i can
only say that i am too much accustomed to the wiles
 the senate to be a novice in the means counteracting
them
there is but one language for youth when seduced
by that pleasing delusion which paints the future
with hues gold age and experience may
condemn it but the weakness will continue to prevail
in all until life shall appear in its true colors
duke sant agata though a noble high lineage
and illustrious name and though lord many vassals
thou art not a power thou canst not declare
thy palace in venice a fortress nor send a herald
to the doge with defiance
true reverend monk i cannot do this nor
would it be well for him who could to trust his fortune
on so reckless a risk but the states st mark
do not cover the earth we can fly
 the bravo
the senate hath a long arm and it hath a thousand
secret hands
none know it better than i still it does no violence
without motive the faith their ward irretrievably
mine the evil as respects them becomes
irreparable
tank st thou so means would quickly be found
to separate you believe not that venice would
be thwarted its design so easily the wealth 
a house like this would purchase many an unworthy
suitor and thy right would be disregarded or haply
denied
but father the ceremony the church may
not be despised exclaimed violetta it comes from
heaven and is sacred
daughter i say it with sorrow but the great and
the powerful find means even to set aside that venerable
and holy sacrament thine own gold would
serve to seal thy misery
this might arrive father were we to continue
within the grasp st mark interrupted the neapolitan
 but once beyond his borders t would bea
bold interference with the right a foreign state
to lay hand on our persons more than this i have
a castle in st agata that will defy their most secret
means until events might happen which should
render it more prudent for them to desist than to persevere

this reason hath force wert thou within the walls
 st agata instead being as thou art among
the canals 
here is one calabria a vassal born mine
a certain stefano milanoo the padrone a serpentine
felucca now lying in the port the man is in strict
amity with my own gondolier he who was third
in this day s race art thou ill father that thou appeared
troubled
the bravo
proceed with thy expedient answered the
monk motioning that he wished not to be observed
my faithful gino reports that this stefano is on
the canals on some errand the republic as he
thinks for though the mariner is less disposed to familiarity
than is wont he hath let drop hints that
lead to such a conclusion the felucca is ready
from hour to hour to put upon the sea and doubt
not the padrone would rather serve his natural lord
than these doubledealing miscreants the senate
i can pay as well as they if served to my pleasure 
and i can punish too when offended
there is reason in this signore wert thou beyond
the wiles this mysterious city but in what
manner canst thou embark without drawing the
notice those who doubtless watch our movements
on thy person
there are maskers on the canals at all hours
and if venice be so impertinent in her system 
watchfulness thou knowest father that without extraordinary
motive that disguise is sacred without
this narrow privilege the town would not be
habitable a day
i fear the result observed the hesitating monk
while it was evident from the thought fulness his
countenance that he calculated the chances the
adventure if known and arrested we are all
lost
trust me father that thy fortune shall not be
forgotten even in that unhappy issue i have an
uncle as you know high in the favor the pontiff
and who wears the scarlet hat i pledge to you the
honor a cavalier all my interest with this relative
to gain such intercession from the church as shall
weaken the blow to her servant
the features the carmelite flushed and for
the first time the ardent young noble observed
 the bravo
around his ascetic mouth an expression worldly
pride
thou hast unjustly rated my apprehensions
lord st agata he said i fear not for myself
but for others this tender and lovely child hath
not been confided to my care without creating a
parental solicitude in her behalf and he paused
and seemed to struggle with himself i have too
long known the mild and womanly virtues donna
florinda to witness with indifference her exposure
to a near and fearful danger abandon our charge
we cannot nor do i see in what manner as prudent
and watchful guardians we may in any manner
consent to this risk let us hope that they who
govern will yet consult the honor and happiness 
donna violetta
that were to hope the winged lion would become
a lamb or the dark and soulless senate a community
 selfmortifying and godly carthusian 
no reverend monk we must seize the happy moment
and none is likely to be more fortunate than
this or trust our hopes to a cold mid calculating
policy that disregards all motives but its own object
an hour nay half the time would suffice to apprize
the mariner and ere the morning light we might
see the domes venice sinking into their own
hated lagunes
these are the plans confident youth quickened
by passion believe me son it is not easy as
thou imagines to mislead the agents the police
this palace could not be quitted the felucca entered
or any one the many necessary steps hazarded
without drawing upon us their eyes hark i
hear the wash oars a gondola is even now at
the watergate
donna florinda went hastily to the balcony and
as quickly returned to report that she had seen an
officer the republic enter the palace there was
the bravo 
no time to lose and don camilla was again urged
to conceal himself in the little oratory this necessary
caution had hardly been observed before the
door the room opened and the privileged messenger
 the senate announced his own appearance
it was the very individual who had presided at the
fearful execution the fisherman arid who had
already announced the cessation the signor gras
s powers his eye glanced suspiciously
around the room as he entered and the carmelite
trembled in every limb at the look which encountered
his own but all immediate apprehensions vanished
when the usual artful smile with which he
was wont to soften his disagreeable communications
took place the momentary expression a vague
and an habitual suspicion
noble lady he said bowing with deference to
the rank her he addressed you may learn by
this assiduity on the part their servant the interest
which the senate takes in your welfare anxious
to do you pleasure and ever attentive to the wishes
 one so young it hath been decided to give you
the amusement and variety another scene at a
season when the canals our city become disagreeable
from their warmth and the crowds which
live in the air i am sent to request you will make
such preparations as may befit your convenience
during a few months residence in a purer atmosphere
and that this may be done speedily as your
journey always to prevent discomfort to yourself
will commence before the rising the sun
this is short notice signore for a female about
to quit the dwelling her ancestors
st mark suffers his love and parental care to
overlook the vain ceremonies form it is thus
the parent death with the child there is little
need unusual notice since it will be the business
 the government to see all that is necessary 
the bravo
patched to the residence which is to be honored
with the presence so illustrious a lady
for myself signore little preparation is needed
but i fear the train servitors that befit my condition
will require more leisure for their arrange
ment
lady that embarrassment hath been foreseen
and to remove it the council hath decided to supply
you with the only attendant you will require during
an absence from the city which will be so short
how signore am i to be separated from my
people
from the hired menials your palace lady to
be confided to those who will serve your person
from a nobler motive
and my maternal friend my ghostly adviser 
they will be permitted to repose from their
trusts during your absence
an exclamation from donna florinda and an involuntary
movement the monk betrayed their
mutual concern donna violetta suppressed the
exhibition her own resentment and her wounded
affections by a powerful effort in which she was
greatly sustained by her pride but she could not
entirely conceal the anguish another sort that
was seated in her eye
do i understand that this prohibition extends to
her who in common serves my person
signora such are my instructions
is it expected that violetta tiepolo will do these
menial offices for herself
signora no a most excellent and agreeable
attendant has been provided for that duty angina
he continued approaching the door thy noble mistress
is impatient to see thee
as he spoke the daughter the wineseller appeared
she wore an air assumed humility but
the bravo 
it was accompanied by a secret mien that betrayed
independence the pleasure her new mistress
and this damsel is to be my nearest confidant 
exclaimed donna violetta after studying the artful
and demure countenance the girl a moment with
a dislike she did not care to conceal
such hath been the solicitude your illustrious
guardians lady as the damsel is instructed in all
that is necessary i will intrude no longer but take
my leave recommending that you improve the hours
which are now few between this and the rising sun
that you may profit by the morning breeze in quitting
the city
the officer glanced another look around the room
more however through habitual caution than any
other reason bowed and departed
a profound and sorrowful silence succeeded
then the apprehension that don camillo might mistake
their situation and appear flashed upon the mind
 violetta and she hastened to apprize him the
danger by speaking to the new attendant
thou hast served before this annina she
asked so loud as to permit the words to be heard in
the oratory
never a lady so beautiful and illustrious signora
but i hope to make myself agreeable to one that i
hear is kind to all around her
thou art not new to the flattery thy class 
go then and acquaint my ancient attendants with
this sudden resolution that i may not disappoint the
council by tardiness i commit all to thy care annina
since thou knowest the pleasure my guardians
those without will furnish the means
the girl lingered and her watchful observers
noted suspicion and hesitation in her reluctant manner
 compliance she obeyed however leaving
the room with the domestic donna violetta summoned
from the antechamber the instant the door
vol ii b
 the bravo
was closed behind her don camillo was in the
group and the whole four stood regarding each
other in a common panic
canst thou still hesitate father demanded
the lover
not a moment my son did i see the means 
accomplishing flight
how thou wilt not then desert me exclaimed
violetta kissing his hands in joy nor thou
my second mother
neither answered the governess who possessed
intuitive means comprehending the resolutions
 the monk we will go with thee love to the
castle st agata or to the dungeon st mark
virtuous and sainted florinda receive my
thanks cried the reprieved violetta clasping her
hands on her bosom with an emotion in which piety
and gratitude were mingled camillo we await
thy guidance
refrain observed the monk a footstep thy
concealment
don camillo was scarce hid from view when
annina reappeared she had the same suspicious
manner glancing her eye around as the official
and it would seem by the idle question she put that
her entrance had some other object than the mere
pretence which she made consulting her new mistress
s humor in the color a robe
do as thou wilt girl said violetta with impatience
 thou knowest the place my intended retirement
and canst judge the fitness my attire
hasten thy preparations that i be not the cause 
delay enrico attend my new maid to the wardrobe

annina reluctantly withdrew for she was far too
much practised in wiles not to distrust this unexpected
compliance with the will the council or not to
perceive that she was admitted with displeasure to
the bravo 
the discharge her new duties as the faithful domestic
 donna violetta kept at her side she was
fain however to submit and suffered herself to be
led a few steps from the door suddenly pretending
to recollect a new question she returned with so
much rapidity as to be again in the room before
enrico could anticipate the intention
 daughter complete thy errands and forbear to
interrupt our privacy said the monk sternly i
am about to confess this penitent who may pine long
for the consolations the holy office ere we meet
again if thou hast not aught urgent withdraw ere
thou seriously gives offence to the church
the severity the carmelite s tone and the commanding
though subdued gleaming his eye had
the qfect to awe the girl quailing before his look
and in truth startled at the risk she ran in offending
against opinions so deeply seated in the minds all
and from which her own superstitious habits were
far from free she muttered a few words apology
and finally withdrew there was another uneasy
and suspicious glance thrown around her however
before the door was closed when they were once
more alone the monk motioned for silence to the
impetuous don camillo who could scarce restrain
his impatience until the intruder departed
son be prudent he said we are in the midst
 treachery in this unhappy city none know in
whom they can confide
i think we are sure enrico said the donna
florinda though the very doubts she affected not to
feel lingered in the tones her voice
it matters not daughter he is ignorant the
presence don camillo and in that we are safe
duke sans agata if you can deliver us from these
toils we will accompany you
a cry joy was near bursting from the lips 
violetta but obedient to the eye the monk she
 the bravo
turned to her lover as if to learn his decision the
expression don camillo s face was the pledge 
his assent without speaking he wrote hastily with
a pencil a few words on the envelope a letter
and inclosing a piece coin in its folds he moved
with a cautious step to the balcony a signal was
given and all awaited in breathless silence the answer
presently they heard the wash the water
caused by the movement a gondola beneath the
window stepping forward again don camillo
dropped the paper with such precision that he distinctly
heard the fall the coin in the bottom the
boat the gondolier scarce raised his eyes to the
balcony but commencing an air much used on the
canals he swept onward like one whose duty called
for no haste
that has succeeded said don camillo when
he heard the song gino in an hour my agent
will have secured the felucca arid all now depends
on our own means quitting the palace unobserved
my people will await us shortly and perhaps
twould be well to trust openly to our speed in gaining
the adriatic
there is a solemn and necessary duty to perform
observed the monk daughters withdraw
to your rooms and occupy yourselves with the preparation
necessary for your flight which may readily
be made to appear as intended to meet the
senate s pleasure in a few minutes i shall summon
you hither v again
wondering but obedient the females withdrew
the carmelite then made a brief but clear explanation
 his intention don camillo listened eagerly
and when the other had done speaking they retired
together into the oratory fifteen minutes had not
passed before the monk reappeared alone and
touched the bell which communicated with the
the bravo 
closet violetta donna florinda and her pupil
were quickly in the room
prepare thy mind for the confessional said the
priest placing himself with grave dignity in that
chair which he habitually used when listening to
the selfaccusations and failings his spiritual child
the brow violetta paled and flushed again as
if there lay a heavy sin on her conscience she
turned an imploring look on her maternal monitor
in whose mild features she met an encouraging
smile and then with a beating heart though illcol
elected for the solemn duty but with a decision that
the occasion required she knelt on the cushion at
the feet the monk
the murmured language donna violetta was
audilje to none but him for whose paternal ear it
was intended and that dread being whose just anger
it was hoped it might lessen but don camillo
gazed through the halfopened door the chapel
on the kneeling form the clasped lance and the uplifted
countenance the beautiful penitent as she
proceeded with the acknowledgment her errors
the flush on her cheek deepened and a pious excitement
kindled in those eyes which he had so
lately seen glowing with a very different passion
the ingenuous and disciplined soul violetta was
not so quickly disburthened its load sin as that
 the more practised mind the lord sant
agata the latter fancied that he could trace in
the movement her lips the sound his own name
and a dozen times during the confession lie thought
he could even comprehend sentences which he
himself was the subject twice the good father
smiled involuntarily and at each indiscretion he
laid a hand in affection on the bared head the
suppliant but violetta ceased to speak and the
absolution was pronounced with a fervor that the
b
 the bravo
remarkable circumstances in which they all stood
did not fail to heighten
when this portion his duty was ended the
carmelite entered the oratory with steady hands
he lighted the candles the altar and made the
other dispositions for the mass during this interval
don camillo was at the side his mistress whispering
with the warmth a triumphant and happy
lover the governess stood near the door watching
for the sound footsteps in the antechamber
the monk then advanced to the entrance the little
chapel and was about to speak when a hurried
step from donna florinda arrested his words don
camillo had just time to conceal his person within
the drapery a window before the door opened
and annina entered
when the preparations the altar and the solemn
countenance the priest first met her eye the girl
recoiled with the air one rebuked but rallying
her thoughtswith that readiness which had gained
her the employment she filled she crossed herself
reverently and took a place apart like one who
while she knew her station wished to participate in
the mysteries the holy office
daughter none who commence this mass with
us can quit the presence ere it be completed observed
the monk
father it is my duty to be near the person 
my mistress and it is a happiness to be near it on
the occasion this early matin
the monk was embarrassed he looked from one
to the other in indecision and was about to frame
some pretence to get rid the intruder when don
camillo appeared in the middle the room
reverend monk proceed he said tis but
another witness my happiness
while speaking the noble touched the handle 
his sword significantly with a finger and cast a
the bravo 
look at the halfpetrified annina which effectually
controlled the exclamation that was about to escape
her the monk appeared to understand the terms
 this silent compact for with a deep voice he
commenced the offices the mass the singularity
 their situation the important results the act in
which they were engaged the impressive dignity
 the carmelite and the imminent hazard which
they all ran exposure together with the certainty
 punishment for their daring to thwart the will 
venice if betrayed caused a deeper feeling than
that which usually pervades a marriage ceremony
to preside at nuptials thus celebrated the youthful
violetta trembled at every intonation the solemn
voice the monk and towards the close she leaned
in helplessness on the arm the man to whom
she had just plighted her vows the eye the
carmelite kindled as he proceeded with the office
however and long ere he had done he had obtained
such a command over the feelings even
annina as to hold her mercenary spirit in awe
the final union was pronounced arid the benediction
given
maria pure memory watch over thy happiness
daughter said the monk for the first time in
his life saluting the fair brow the weeping bride
duke sam agata may thy patron hear thy
prayers as thou proves kind to this innocent and
confiding child 
amen ha we are not too soon united my
violetta i hear the sound oars
a glance from the balcony assured him the truth
 his words and rendered it apparent that it had
now become necessary to take the most decided step
 all a sixoared gondola a size suited to endure
the waves the adriatic at that mild season
and with a pavilion fit dimensions stopped at the
watergate the palace
 the bravo
i wonder at this boldness exclaimed don
camillo there must be no delay lest some
spy the republic apprize the police away
dearest violetta away donna florinda father
away
the governess and her charge passed swiftly into
the inner rooms in a minute they returned bearing
the caskets donna violetta and a sufficient
supply necessaries for a short voyage the instant
they reappeared all was ready for don ca
mill had long held himself prepared for this decisive
moment and the selfdenying carmelite had little
need superfluities it was no moment for unnecessary
explanation or trivial objections
our hope is in celerity said don camillo secrecy
is impossible
he was still speaking when the monk led the way
from the room donna florinda and the halfbreath
less violetta followed don camillo drew the arm
 annina under his own and in a low voice bid herat
her peril refuse to obey
the long suite outer rooms was passed without
meeting a single observer the extraordinary
movement but when the fugitives entered the great
hall that communicated with the principal stairs they
found themselves in the centre a dozen menials
 both sexes
place cried the duke sant agata whose
person and voice were alike unknown to them
your mistress will breathe the air the canals
wonder and curiosity were alive in every countenance
but suspicion and eager attention were uppermost
in the features many the foot donna
violetta had scarcely touched the pavement 
the lower hall when several menials glided down
the flight and quitted the palace by its different outlets
each sought those who engaged him in the
service one flew along the narrow streets the
the bravo 
islands to the residence the signor gradenigo
another sought his sen and one ignorant the
person him he served actually searched an agent
 don camillo to impart a circumstance in which
that noble was himself so conspicuous an actor to
such a pass corruption had doubledealing and
mystery reduced the household the fairest and
richest in venice the gondola lay at the marble
steps the watergate held against the stones by
two its crew don camillo saw at a glance
that the masked gondoliers had neglected none the
precautions he had prescribed and he inwardly commended
their punctuality each wore a short rapier
at his girdle and he fancied he could trace beneath
the folds their garments evidence the
presence the clumsy firearms in use at that period
these observations were made while the carmelite
and violetta entered the boat donna florida
followed and annina was about to imitate her
example when she was arrested by the arm don
camillo
thy service ends here whispered the bridegroom
 seek another mistress in fault a better
thou mayest devote thyself to venice
the little interruption caused don camillo to look
backward and for a single moment he paused to
scrutinize the group eyes that crowded the hall
 the palace at a respectful distance 
adieu my friends he added those among
ye who love your mistress shall be remembered
he would have said more but a rude seizure 
his arms caused him to turn hastily away he was
firm in the grasp the two gondoliers who had
landed while he was yet in too much astonishment
to struggle annina obedient to a signal darted
past him and leaped into the boat the oars fell
into the water don camillo was repelled by a violent
shove backward into the hall the gondoliers
 the bravo
stepped lightly into their places and the gondola
swept away from the steps beyond the power him
they left to follow
gino miscreant what means this treachery

the moving the parting gondola was accompanied
by no other sound than the usual washing 
the water in speechless agony don camillo saw
the boat glide swifter and swifter at each stroke 
the oars along the canal and then whirling round
the angle a palace disappear
venice admitted not pursuit like another city
for there was no passage along the canal taken by
the gondola but by water several the boats
used by the family lay within the piles on the great
canal at the principal entrance and don camillo
was about to rush into one and to seize its oars
with his own hands when the usual sounds announced
the approach a gondola from the direction 
the bridge that had so long served as a place 
concealment to his own domestic it soon issued
from the obscurity cast by the shadows the houses
and proved to be a large gondola pulled like the one
which had just disappeared by six masked gondoliers
the resemblance between the equipments 
the two was so exact that at first not onlythe wondering
camillo but all the others present fancied the
latter bsome extraordinary speed had already
made the tour the adjoining palaces and was
once more approaching the private entrance that
 donna violetta 
gino cried the bewildered bridegroom
signore mio answered the faithful domestic
draw nearer varlet what meaneth this idle
trifling at a moment like this
don camillo leaped a fearful distance and happily
he reached the gondola to pass the men and rush
the bravo 
into the canopy needed but a moment to perceive
that it was empty was the work a glance
villains have you dared to be false cried the
confounded noble
at that instant the clock the city began to tell
the hour two and it was only as that appointed
signal sounded heavy and melancholy on the nightair
that the undeceived camillo got a certain glimpse
 the truth
gino he said repressing his voice like one
summoning a desperate resolution are thy fellows
true
as faithful as your own vassals signore
and thou didst not fail to deliver the note to my
agent
he had it before the ink was dry excellent
the mercenary villain he told thee where to
find the gondola equipped as i see it
signore he did and i do the man the justice
to say that nothing is wanting either to speed or
comfort
ay he even deals in duplicates so tender is his
care muttered don camillo between his teeth
pull away men your own safety and my happiness
now depend on your arms a thousand ducats
if you equal my hopes my just anger if you
disappoint them 
don camillo threw himself on the cushions as he
spoke in bitterness heart though he seconded his
words by a gesture which bid the men proceed
gino who occupied the stern and managed the directing
oar opened a small window in the canopy
which communicated with the interior and bent to
take his master s directions as the boat sprang ahead
rising from his stooping posture the practised gondolier
gave a sweep with his blade which caused the
sluggish element the narrow canal to whirl in 
the bravo
dies and then the gondola glided into the great canal
as if it obeyed an instinct
chapter ii
why lies thou so on the green earth 
tis not the hour slumber why so pale 
cain
notwithstanding his apparent decision the duke
 sant agata was completely at a loss in what
manner to direct his future movements that he
had been duped by one or more the agents to
whom he had been compelled to confide his necessary
preparations for the flight he had meditated
several days was too certain to admit his deceiving
himself with the hopes that some unaccountable
mistake was the cause his loss he
saw at once that the senate was master the person
 his bride and he too well knew its power
and its utter disregard human obligations when
any paramount interest the state was to be consulted
to doubt for an instant its willingness to use
its advantage in any manner that was most likely to
contribute to its own views by the premature
death her uncle donna violetta had become the
heiress vast estates in the dominions the church
and a compliance with that jealous and arbitrary law
 venice which commanded all its nobles to
dispose any foreign possessions they might acquire
was only suspended on account her sex
and as has already been seen with the hope disposing
 her hand in a manner that would prove
more profitable to the republic with this object
still before them and with the means accomplishthe
bravo 
ing it in their own hands the bridegroom well knew
that his marriage would not only be denied but he
feared the witnesses the ceremony would be so
disposed as to give little reason ever to expect
embarrassment from their testimony for himself
personally he felt less apprehension though he foresaw
that he had furnished his opponents with an argument
that was likely to defer to an indefinite period
if it did not entirely defeat his claims to the
disputed succession but he had already made up
his rind to this result though it is probable that his
passion for violetta had not entirely blinded him to
the fact that her roman signories would be no
unequal offset for the loss he believed that he might
possibly return to his palace with impunity so far as
any personal injury was concerned for the great
consideration he enjoyed in his native land and the
high interest he possessed at the court rome
were sufficient pledges that no open violence would
be done him the chief reason why his claim had
been kept in suspense was the wish to profit by his
near connexion with the favorite cardinal and though
he had never been able entirely to satisfy the everincreasing
demands the council in this respect
he thought it probable that the power the vatican
would not be spared to save him from any very imminent
personal hazard still he had given the state
 venice plausible reasons for severity and liberty
just at that moment was so much importance
that he dreaded falling into the hands the officials
as one the greatest misfortunes which could momentarily
overtake him he so well knew the
crooked policy those with whom he had to deal
that he believed he might be arrested solely that the
government could make an especial merit his future
release under circumstances so seeming gravity
his order to gino therefore had been to pull down
the principal passage toward the port
vol ii c
 the bravo
before the gondola which sprung at each united
effort its crew like some bounding animal entered
among the shipping its master had time to recover
his selfpossession and to form some hasty
plans for the future making a signal for the crew
to cease rowing he came from beneath the canopy
notwithstanding the lateness the hour boats
were plying on the water within the town and the
song was still audible on the canals but among the
mariners a general stillness prevailed such as befitted
their toil during the day and their ordinary habits
call the first idle gondolier thy acquaintance
hither gino said don camillo with assumed calmness
 i would question him
in less than a minute he was gratified
hast seen any strongly manned gondola plying
 late in this part the canal demanded don
camillo the man they had stopped
none but this your own signore which is
the fastest all that passed beneath the rialto in
this day s regatta
how knowest thou friend aught the speed
 my boat
signore i have pulled an oar on the canals 
venice sixandtwenty years and i do not remember
to have seen a gondola move more swiftly on
them than did this very boat but a few minutes ago
when it dashed among the feluccas further down in
the port as if it were again running for the oar
corpo di bacco there are rich wines in the
palaces the nobles that men can give such life to
wood
whither did we steer eagerly asked don
camillo
blessed san teodoro i do not wonder excellent
that you ask that question for though it is buta
moment since here i see you lying as motionless
on the water as a floating weed
the bravo 
friend here is silver actio
the gondolier swept slowly onward singing a
strain in honor his bark while the boat don
camillo darted ahead mystic felucca xebec brigantine
and threemasted ship were apparently floating
past them as they shot through the maze 
shipping when gino bent forward and drew the attention
 his master to a large gondola which was
pulling with a lazy oar toward them from the direction
 the lido both boats were in a wide
avenue in the midst the vessels the usual track
 those who went to sea and there was no object
whatever between them by changing the course
 his own boat don camillo soon found himself
within an oar s length the other he saw at a
glance it was the treacherous gondola by which he
had been duped
draw men and follow shouted the desperate
neapolitan preparing to leap into the midst his
enemies
you draw against st mark cried a warning
voice from beneath the canopy the chances are
unequal signore for the smallest signal would
bring twenty galleys to our succor
don camillo might have disregarded this menace
had he not perceived that it caused the halfdrawn
rapiers his followers to return to their scabbards
robber he answered restore her whom you
have spirited away
signore you young nobles are often pleased to
play your extravagances with the servants the
republic here are none but the gondoliers and
myself a movement the boat permitted don
camillo to look into the covered part and he saw
that the other uttered no more than the truth convinced
 the uselessness further parley knowing
the value every moment and believing he
 the bravo
was on a track which might still lead to success the
young neapolitan signed to his people to go on
the boats parted in silence that don camillo
proceeding in the direction from which the other
had just come
in a short time the gondola don camillo was
in an open part the guidecca and entirely beyond
the tiers the shipping it was so late that
the moon had begun to fall and its light was cast
obliquely on the bay throwing the eastern sides 
the buildings and the other objects into shadow a
dozen different vessels were seen aided by the landbreeze
steering towards the entrance the port
the rays the moon fell upon the broad surface
 those sides their canvas which were nearest
to the town and they resembled so many spotless
clouds sweeping the water and floating seaward
they are sending my wife to dalmatia cried
don camillo like a man on whom the truth began
to dawn
signore mio exclaimed the astonished gino
i tell thee sirrah that this accursed senate hath
plotted against my happiness and having robbed
me thy mistress hath employed one the many
feluccas that i see to transport her to some its
strongholds on the eastern coast the adriatic
blessed maria signor duca and my honoured
master they say that the very images stone in
venice have ears and that the horses bronze
will kick if an evil word is spoken against those up
above 
is it not enough varlet to draw curses from the
meek job to rob him a wife hast thou no feeling
for thy mistress
i did not dream eccellenza that you were so
happy as to have the one or that i was so honored
as to have the other
thou reminded me my folly good gino in
the bravo 
aiding me on this occasion thou wilt have thy own
fortune in view as thy efforts like those thy fellows
will be made in behalf the lady to whom i
have just plighted a husband s vows
san teodoro help us all and hint what is to be
done the lady is most happy signor don camillo
and if i only knew by what name to mention her
she should never be forgotten in any prayer that so
humble a sinner might dare to offer
thou hast not forgotten the beautiful lady i
drew from the guideeca
corpo di bacco your eccellenza floated like
a swan and swam faster than a gull forgotten 
signore no i think it every time i hear a plash
in the canals and every time i think it i curse
the anconaman in my heart st theodore forgive
me if it be unlike a christian to do so but though
we all tell marvels what our lord did in the
guidecca the dip its waters is not the marriageceremony
nor can we speak with much certainty
 beauty that was seen to so great disadvantage
thou art right gino but that lady the illustrious
donna violetta tiepolo the daughter and
heiress a famed senator is now thy mistress it
remains for us to establish her in the castle sant
agata where i shall defy venice and its agents
gino bowed his head in submission though he
cast a look behind to make sure that none those
agents whom his master set so openly at defiance
were within earshot
in the mean time the gondola proceeded for the
dialogue in no manner interrupted the exertions 
gino still holding the direction the lido as the
landbreeze freshened the different vessels in sight
glided away and by the time don camillo reached
the barrier sand which separates the lagunes
from the adriatic most them had glided through
the passages and were now shaping their courses
c 
 the bravo
according to their different destinations across the
open gulf the young noble had permitted his people
to pursue the direction originally taken in pure
indecision he was certain that his bride was in
one the many barks in sight but he possessed no
clue to lead him towards the right one nor any sufficient
means pursuit were he even master 
that important secret when he landed therefore
it was with the simple hope being able to form
some general conjecture as to the portion the republic
s dominions in which he might search for her
he had lost by observing to what part the adriatic
the different feluccas held their way he had
determined on immediate pursuit however and before
he quitted the gondola he once more turned to
his confidential gondolier to give the necessary instructions

thou knowest gino he said that there is
one born a vassal on my estates here in the port
with a felucca from the serpentine shore
i know the man better than i know my own
faults signore or even my own virtues
go to him at once and make sure his presence
i have imagined a plan to decoy him into
the service his lord but i would now know the
condition his vessel
gino said a few words in commendation the
zeal his friend stefano and in praise the
bella sorrentina as the gondola receded from the
shore and then he dashed his oar into the water
like a man in earnest to execute the commission
there is a lonely spot on the lido di palestrina
where catholic exclusion has decreed that the remains
 all who die in venice without the pale 
the church rome shall moulder into their kindred
dust though it is not distant from the ordinary
landing and the few buildings which line the
shore it is a place that in itself is no bad emblem
the bravo 
 a hopeless lot solitary exposed equally to the
hot airs the south and the bleak blasts the alps
frequently covered with the spray the adriatic
and based on barren sands the utmost that human
art aided by a soil which has been fattened by human
remains can do has been to create around the
modest graves a meager vegetation that is in slight
contrast to the sterility most the bank this
place interment is without the relief trees at
the present day it is uninclosed and in the opinions
 those who have set it apart for heretic and jew
it is unblessed and yet though condemned alike
to this the last indignity which man can inflict on
his fellow the two proscribed classes furnish a melancholy
proof the waywardness human passions
and prejudice by refusing to share in common the
scanty pittance earth which bigotry has allowed
for their everlasting repose while the protestant
sleeps by the side protestant in exclusive obloquy
the children israel moulder apart on the same
barren heath sedulous to preserve even in the
grave the outward distinctions faith we shall
not endeavor to seek that deeplyseated principle
which renders man so callous to the most eloquent
and striking appeals to liberality but rest satisfied
with being grateful that we have been born in a
land in which the interests religion are as little
as possible sullied by the vicious contamination 
those life in which christian humility is not exhibited
beneath the purple nor jewish adhesion by
intolerance in which man is left to cape for the
welfare his own soul and in which so far as the
human eye can penetrate god is worshipped for
himself
don camillo monforte landed near the retired
graves the proscribed as he wished to ascend
the low sandhills which have been thrown up by
the waves and the winds the gulf on the outer
 the bravo
edge the lido it was necessary that he should
pass directly across the contemned spot or make
such a circuit as would have been inconvenient
crossing himself with a superstition that was interwoven
with all his habits and opinions and loosening
his rapier in order that he might not miss the
succor that good weapon at need he moved
across the heath tenanted by the despised dead
taking care to avoid the mouldering heaps earth
which lay above the bones heretic or jew he
had not threaded more than half the graves however
when a human form arose from the grass and
seemed to walk like one who mused on the moral
that the piles at his feet would be apt to excite
again don camillo touched the handle his rapier 
then moving aside in a manner to give himself an
equal advantage from the light the moon he
drew near the stranger his footstep was heard
for the other paused regarded the approaching
cavalier and folding his arms as it might be in sign
 neutrality awaited his nearer approach
thou hast chosen a melancholy hour for thy
walk signore said the yours neapolitan and a
still more melancholy scene i hope i do not intrude
on an israelite or a lutheran who mourns
for his friend
don camillo monforte i am like yourself a
christian
ha thou knowest me tis baptista the gondolier
that i once entertained in my household
signore tis not baptista
as he spoke the stranger faced the moon in a
manner that threw all its mild light upon his features

jacopo exclaimed the duke recoiling as did
all in venice habitually when that speaking eye was
unexpectedly met
signore jacopo
time bravo 
in a moment the rapier don camillo glittered
in the rays the moon
keep thy distance fellow and explain the
motive that hath brought thee thus across my solitude

the bravo smiled but his arms maintained their
fold
i might with equal justice call upon the duke
 sant agata to furnish reasons why he wanders
at this hour among the hebrew graves
nay spare thy pleasantry i trifle not with men
 thy reputation if any in venice have thought
fit to employ thee against my person thou wilt have
need all thy courage and skill ere thou earnest
thy fee
put up thy rapier don camillo here is none todo
you harm think you if employed in the manner
you name i would be in this spot to seek you t
ask yourself whether your visit here was known
or whether it was more than the idle caprice a
young noble who finds his bed less easy than his
gondola we have met duke sant agata when
you distrusted my honor less
thou speakest true jacopo returned the noble
suffering the point his rapier to fall from before
the breast the bravo though he still hesitated
to withdraw the point thou sayest the truth
my visit to this spot is indeed accidental and thou
could st not have possibly foreseen it why art thou
here
why are these here demanded jacopo pointing
to the graves at his feet we are born and
we die that much is known to us all but the
when and the where are mysteries until time reveals
them
thou art not a man to act without good motive
though these israelites could not foresee their
 the bravo
visit to the lido thine hath not been without intention

i am here don camillo monforte because my
spirit hath need room i want the air the sea
the canals choke me i can only breathe in freedom
on this bank sand 
thou hast another reason jacopo 
ay signore i lethe yon city crimes 
as the bravo spoke he shook his hand in the direction
 the domes st mark and the deep tones
 his voice appeared to heave up from the depths 
his chest
this is extraordinary language for a 
bravo speak the word boldly signore it is no
stranger to my ears but even the stiletto a
bravo is honorable compared to that sword pretended
justice which st mark wields the commonest
hireling italy he who will plant his dagger
in the heart his friend for two sequins is a man
 open dealing compared to the merciless treachery
 some in yonder town 
i understand thee jacopo thou art at length
proscribed the public voice faint as it is in the
republic has finally reached the ears thy employers
and they withdraw their protection
jacopo regarded the noble for an instant with an
expression so ambiguous as to cause the latter insensibly
to raise the point his rapier but when he
answered it was with his ordinary quiet
signor duca he said i have been thought
worthy to be retained by don camillo monforte 
i deny it not and now that thou recollect the
occasion new light breaks in upon me villain to
thy faithlessness i owe the loss my bride 
though the rapier was at the very throat 
jacopo he did not flinch gazing at his excited
companion he laughed in a smothered manner but
bitterly
the bravo 
it would seem that the lord sant agata
wishes to rob me my trade he said arise
ye israelites and bear witness lest men doubt the
fact a common bravo the canals is waylaid
among your despised graves by the proudest signor
 calabria you have chosen your spot in
mercy don camillo for sooner or later this crumbling
and seaworn earth is to receive me were i
to die at the altar itself with the most penitent prayer
 holy church on my lips the bigots would send
my body to rest among those hungry hebrews and
accursed heretics yes i am a man proscribed and
unfit to sleep with the faithful 
his companion spoke with so strange a mixture
 irony and melancholy that the purpose don
camillo wavered but remembering his loss he
shook the rapier s point and continued 
thy taunts and effrontery will not avail thee
knave he cried thou knowest that i would
have engaged thee as the leader a chosen band
to favor the flight one dear from venice
nothing more true signore
and thou didst refuse the service 
noble duke i did
not content with this having learned the particulars
 my project thou sold the secret to the
senate
don camillo monforte i did not my engagements
with the council would not permit me to
serve you else by the brightest star yonder
vault it would have gladdened my hearilo have
witnessed the happiness two young and faithful
lovers no no no they know me not who
think i cannot find pleasure in the joy another
i told you that i was the senate s and there the
matter ended
and i had the weakness to believe thee jacopo
for thou hast a character so strangely compounded
 the bravo
 good and evil and dearest so fair a name for observance
 thy faith that the seeming frankness
 the answer lulled me to security fellow i
have been betrayed and that at the moment when
i thought success most sure
jacopo manifested interest but as he moved
slowly on accompanied by the vigilant and zealous
noble he smiled coldly like one who had pity for
the other s credulity
in bitterness soul i have cursed the whole
race for its treachery continued the neapolitan
this is rather for the prior st mark than
for the ear one who carries a public stiletto
 my gondola has been imitated the liveries 
my people copied my bride stolen thou answered
not jacopo
what answer would you have you have been
cozened signore in a state whose very prince
dare not trust his secrets to his wife you would
have robbed venice an heiress and venice
has robbed you a bride you have played
high don camillo and have lost a heavy stake
you have thought your own wishes and rights
while you have pretended to serve venice with the
spaniard
don camillo started in surprise
why this wonder signore you forget that i
have lived much among those who weigh the
chances every political interest and that your
name is often in their mouths this marriage is
doubly disagreeable to venice who has nearly as
much need the bridegroom as the bride the
council hath long ago forbidden the banns
ay but the means explain the means by
which i have been duped lest the treachery be
ascribed to thee
signore the very marbles the city give up
their secrets to the state i have seen much and
the bravo 
understood much when my superiors have believed
me merely a tool but i have seen much that even
those who employed me could not comprehend i
could have foretold this consummation your nuptials
had i known their celebration
this thou could st not have done without being
an agent their treachery
the schemes the selfish may be foretold it
is only the generous and the honest that baffle calculation
he who can gain a knowledge the
present interest venice is master her dearest
secrets state for what she wishes she will do
unless the service cost too dear as for the means
how can they be wanting in a household like
yours signore
i trusted none but those deepest in my confidence

don camillo there is not a servitor in your
palace gino alone excepted who is not a hireling
 the senate or its agents the very gondoliers
who row you to your daily pleasures have had
their hands crossed with the republic s sequins
nay they are not only paid to watch you but to
watch each other
can this be true
t have you ever doubted it signore asked
jacopo looking up like one who admired at
another s simplicity
i knew them to be false pretenders to a faith
that in secret they mock but i had not believed
they dared to tamper with the very menials my
person this undermining the security families
is to destroy society at its core 
you talk like one who hath not been long a
bridegroom signore said the bravo with a hollow
laugh a year hence you may know what
it is to have your own wife turning your secret
thoughts into gold
vol ii d
 the bravo
and thou serves them jacopo 
who does not in some manner suited to his
habits we are not masters our fortune don
camillo or the duke sant agata would not be
turning his influence with a relative to the advantage
 the republic what i have done hath not
been done without bitter penitence and an agony
 soul that your own light servitude may have
spared you signore
poor jacopo
if i have lived through it all tis because one
mightier than the state hath not deserted me but
don camillo monforte there are crimes which pass
beyond the powers man ta endure
the bravo shuddered and he moved among the
despised graves in silence
they have then proved too ruthless even for
thee said don camillo who watched the contracting
eye and heaving form his companion in
wonder
signore they have i have witnessed this
night a proof their heartlessness and bad faith
that hath caused me to look forward to my own
fate the delusion is over from this hour i serve
them no longer
the bravo spoke with deep feeling and his companion
fancied strange as it was coming from such
a man with an air wounded integrity don
camillo knew that there was no condition life
however degraded or lost to the world which had
not its own particular opinions the faith due to its
fellows and he had seen enough the sinuous
course the oligarchy venice to understand
that it was quite possible its shameless and irresponsible
duplicity might offend the principles even
an assassin less odium was attached to men 
that class in italy and at that day than will be
easily imagined in a country like this for the radii
bravo 
cal defects and the vicious administration the
laws caused an irritable and sensitive people too
often to take into their own hands the right redressing
their own wrongs custom had lessened
the odium the crime and though society denounced
the assassin himself it is scarcely too
much to say that his employer was regarded with
little more disgust than the religious our time regard
the survivor a private combat still it was
not usual for nobles like don camillo to hold intercourse
beyond that which the required service exacted
with men jacopo s cast but the language
and manner the bravo so strongly attracted the
curiosity and even the sympathy his companion
that the latter unconsciously sheathed his rapier and
drew nearer
thy penitence and regrets jacopo may lead
thee yet nearer to virtue he said than mere abandonment
 the senate s service seek out some
godly priest and ease thy soul by confession and
prayer
the bravo trembled in every limb and his eye
turned wistfully to the countenance the other
speak jacopo even i will hear thee if thou
would st remove the mountain from thy breast
thanks noble signore a thousand thanks for
this glimpse sympathy to which i have long been
a stranger none know how dear a word kindness
is as he who has been condemned by all as i
have been i have prayed i have craved i have
wept for some ear to listen to my tale and i thought
i had found one who would have heard me without
scorn when the cold policy the senate struck him
i came here to commune with the hated dead when
chance brought us together could i the bravo
paused and looked doubtfully again at his companion

say on jacopo
 the bravo
i have not dared to trust my secrets even to the
confessional signore and can i be so bold as to
offer them to you 
truly it is a strange behest 
signore it is you are noble i am humble
blood your ancestors were senators and doges 
venice while mine have been since the fishermen
first built their huts in the lagunes laborers on the
canals and rowers gondolas you are powerful
and rich and courted while i am denounced and
in secret i fear condemned in short you are don
camillo monforte and i am jacopo frontoni 
don camillo was touched for the bravo spoke
without bitterness and in deep sorrow
i would thou wert at the confessional poor ja
copo he said i am little able to give ease to
such a burthen
signore i have lived too long shut out from the
good wishes my fellows and i can bear with it
no longer the accursed senate may cut me off
without warning and then who will stop to look at
my grave signore i must speak or die 
thy case is piteous jacopo thou hast need
 ghostly counsel
here is no priest signore and i carry a weight
past bearing the only man who has shown interest
in me for three long and dreadful years is
gone
but he will return poor jacopo
signore he will never return he is with the
foes the lagunes
by thy hand monster 
by the justice the illustrious republic said
the bravo with a smothered but bitter smile
ha they are then awake to the acts thy
class thy repentance is the fruit fear 
jacopo seemed choked he had evidently counted
on the awakened sympathy his companion
the bravo 
notwithstanding the difference in their situations and
to be thus thrown off again unmanned him he
shuddered and every muscle and nerve appeared
about to yield its power touched by so unequivocal
signs suffering don camillo kept close at his
side reluctant to enter more deeply into the feelings
ojfdne his known character and yet unable to
desert a fellowcreature in so grievous agony
signer duca said the bravo with a pathos in
his voice that went to the heart his auditor leave
me if they ask for a proscribed man let them come
here in the morning they will find my body near
the graves the heretics
speak i will hear thee
jacopo looked up with doubt expressed on his
features
unburden thyself i will listen though thou
recounted the assassination my dearest friend
the oppressed bravo gazed at him as if he still
distrusted his sincerity his face worked and his
look became still more wistful but as don camillo
faced the moon and betrayed the extent his sympathy
the other burst into tears
jacopo i will hear thee i will hear thee poor
jacopo cried don camillo shocked at this exhibition
 distress in one so stern by nature a wave
from the hand the bravo silenced him and jacopo
struggling with himself for a moment spoke
you have saved a soul from perdition signore
he said smothering his emotion if the happy
knew how much power belongs to a single word 
kindness a glance feeling when given to the
despised they would not look so coldly on the miserable
this night must have been my last had
you cast me off without pity but you will hear
my tale signore you will not scorn the confession
 a bravo
d
 the bravo
i have promised be brief for at this moment
i have great care my own
signore i know not the whole your wrongs
but they will not be less likely to be redressed for
this grace
jacopo made an effort to command himself when
he commenced his tale
the course the narrative does not require that
we should accompany this extraordinary man
through the relation the secrets he imparted to
don camillo it is enough for our present purposes
to say that as he proceeded the young calabria n
noble drew nearer to his side and listened with
growing interest the duke sant agata scarcely
breathed while his companion with that energy
 language and feeling which marks italian character
recounted his secret sorrows and the scenes
in which he had been an actor long before he
was done don camillo had forgotten his own private
causes concern and by the time the tale
was finished every shade disgust had given place
to an ungovernable expression pity in short so
eloquent was the speaker and so interesting the
facts with which he dealt that he seemed to play
with the sympathies the listener as the improving
 that region is known to lead captive the
passions the admiring crowd
during the time jacopo was speaking he and his
wondering auditor had passed the limits the despised
cemetery and as the voice the former
ceased they stood on the outer beach the lido
when the low tones the bravo were no longer
audible they were succeeded by the sullen wash 
the adriatic
this surpassed belief don camillo exclaimed
after a long pause which had only been disturbed
by the rush and retreat the waters
signore as holy maria is kind it is true
the bravo 
i doubt you not jacopo poor jacopo i cannot
distrust a tale thus told thou hast indeed been
a victim their hellish duplicity and well mayest
thou say the load was past bearing what is thy
intention
i serve them no longer don camillo i wait
only for the last solemn scene which is now certain
and then i quit this city deceit to seek my
fortune in another region they have blasted my
youth and loaded my name with infamy god may
yet lighten the load
reproach not thyself beyond reason jacopo
for the happiest and most fortunate us all are not
above the power temptation thou knowest that
even my name and rank have not altogether protected
me from their arts
i know them capable signore deluding angels
 their arts are only surpassed by their means
and their pretence virtue by their indifference to
its practice
thou sayest true jacopo the truth is never in
greater danger than when whole communities lend
themselves to the vicious deception seemliness
and without truth there is no virtue this it is to
substitute profession for practice to use the altar
for a worldly purpose and to bestow power without
any other responsibility than that which is exacted
by the selfishness caste jacopo poor
jacopo thou shalt be my servitor i am lord 
my own signifies and once rid this specious
republic i charge myself with the care othy safety
and fortunes be at peace as respects thy conscience
 i have interest near the holy see and thou
shalt not want absolution
the gratitude the bravo was more vivid in
feeling than in expression he kissed the hand 
don camillo but it was with a reservation selfrespect
that belonged to the character the man
 the bravo
a system like this venice continued the
musing noble leaves none us masters our
own acts the wiles such a combination are
stronger than the will it chokes its offences against
right in a thousand specious forms and it enlists the
support every man under the pretence a sacrifice
for the common good we often fancy ourselves
simple dealers in some justifiable state intrigue
when in truth we are deep in sin falsehood
is the parent all crimes and in no case has it a
progeny so numerous as that in which its own
birth is derived from the state i fear i may have
made sacrifices to this treacherous influence i
could wish forgotten
though don camillo soliloquized rather than addressed
his companion it was evident by the train
 his thoughts that the narrative jacopo had
awakened disagreeable reflections on the manner
in which he had pushed his own claims with the
senate perhaps he felt the necessity some apology
to one who though so much his inferior in rank
was so competent to appreciate his conduct and
who had just denounced in the strongest language
his own fatal subserviency to the arts that irresponsible
and meretricious body
jacopo uttered a few words a general nature
but such as had a tendency to quiet the uneasiness
 his companion after which with a readiness
that proved him qualified for the many delicate missions
with which he had been charged he ingeniously
turd the discourse to the recent abduction
 donna violetta with the offer rendering his
new employer all the services in his power to regain
his bride
that thou mayest know all thou hast undertaken
rejoined don camillo listen jacopo and
i will conceal nothing from thy shrewdness
the duke sant agata now briefly but expli
the bravo 
city laid bare to his companion all his own views
and measures with respect to her he loved and all
those events with which the reader has already become
acquainted
the bravo gave great attention to the minutest
parts the detail and more than once as the other
proceeded he smiled to himself like a man who
was able to trace the secret means by which this
or that intrigue had been effected the whole was
just related when the sound a footstep announced
the return gino

pale she look d
yet cheerful though methought once if not twice
she wiped away a tear that would be coming
rogers
the hours passed as if naught had occurred
within the barriers the city to disturb their progress
on the following morning men proceeded to
their several pursuits business or pleasure as
had been done for ages and none stopped to question
his neighbor the scene which might have
taken place during the night some were gay and
others sorrowing some idle and others occupied 
here one toiled there another sported ajpd venice
presented as wont its noiseless suspicious busy
mysterious and yet stirring throngs as it had before
done at a thousand similar risings the sun
the menials lingered around the watergate 
donna violetta s palace with distrustful but cautious
faces scarce whispering among themselves their
secret suspicions the fate their mistress the
 the bravo
residence the signer gradenigo presented its
usual gloomy magnificence while the abode don
camillo monforte betrayed no sign the heavy
disappointment which its master had sustained
the bella sorrentina still lay in the port with a
yard on deck while the crew repaired its sail in the
lazy manner mariners who work without excitement

the lagunes were dotted with the boats fishermen
and travellers arrived and departed from the
city by the wellknown channels fusing and mestre
here some adventurer from the north quitted
the canals on his return towards the alps carrying
with him a pleasing picture the ceremonies he
had witnessed mingled with some crude conjectures
 that power which predominated in the suspected
state and there a countryman the main sought
his little farm satisfied with the pageants and regatta
 the previous day in short all seemed as
usual and the events we have related remained a secret
with the actors and that mysterious council
which had so large a share in their existence
as the day advanced many a sail was spread for
the pillars hercules or the genial levant and
feluccas mystics and golettas went and came as the
land or seabreeze prevailed still the mariner 
calabria lounged beneath the awning which sheltered
his deck or took his siesta on a pile old sails
which were ragged with the force many a hot
sirocco as the sun fell the gondolas the great
and idle began to glide over the water and when
the two squares were cooled by the air the adriatic
the broglio began to fill with those privileged
to pace its vaulted passage among these came the
duke sant agata who though an alien to the
laws the republic being so illustrious descent
and claims so equitable was received among the
senators in their moments ease as a welcome
the bravo 
sharer in this vain distinction he entered the
broglio at the wonted hour and with his usual composure
for he trusted to his secret influence at rome
and something to the success his rivals for impunity
reflection had shown don camillo that as
his plans were known to the council they would
long since have arrested him had such been their
intention and it had also led him to believe that
the most efficient manner avoiding the personal
consequences his adventure was to show confidence
in his own power to withstand them when
he appeared therefore leaning on the arm a high
officer the papal embassy and with an eye that
spoke assurance in himself he was greeted as usual
by all who knew him as was due to his rank and
expectations still don camillo walked among the
patricians the republic with novel sensations
more than once he thought he detected in the wandering
glances those with whom he conversed
signs their knowledge his frustrated attempt
and more than once when he least suspected such
scrutiny his countenance was watched as if the
observer sought some evidence his future intentions
beyond this none might have discovered that
an heiress so much importance had been so near
being lost to the state or on the other hand that a
bridegroom had been robbed his bride habitual
art on the part the state and resolute but wary
intention on the part the young noble concealed
all else from observation
in this manner the day passed not a tongue in
venice beyond those which whispered in secret
making any allusion to the incidents our tale
just as the sun was setting a gondola swept slowly
up to the watergate the ducal palace the gondolier
landed fastened his boat in the usual manner
to the steppingstones and entered the court he
wore a mask for the hour disguise had come and
 the bravo
his attire was so like the ordinary fashion men
 his class as to defeat recognition by its simplicity
glancing an eye about him he entered the building
by a private door
the edifice in which the doges venice dwelt
still stands a gloomy monument the policy the
republic furnishing evidence in itself the specious
character the prince whom it held it is
built around a vast but gloomy court as is usual with
nearly all the principal edifices europe one
 its fronts forms a side the piazzetta so often
mentioned and another lines the quay next the port
the architecture these two exterior faces the
palace renders the structure remarkable a low
portico which forms the broglio sustains a row 
massive oriental windows and above these again
lies a pile masonry slightly relieved by apertures
which reverses the ordinary uses the arts a
third front is nearly concealed by the cathedral 
st mark and the fourth is washed by its canal
the public prison the city forms the other side
 this canal eloquently proclaiming the nature 
the government by the close approximation the
powers legislation and punishment the famous
bridge sighs is the material and we might
add the metaphorical link between the two the
latter edifice stands on the quay also and though
less lofty and spacious in point architectural beauty
it is the superior structure though the quaintness
and unusual style the palace is most apt to attract
attention
the masked gondolier soon reappeared beneath
the arch the watergate and with a hurried step
he sought his boat it required scut a minute to
cross the canal to land on the opposite quay and to
enter the public door the prison it would seem
that he had some secret means satisfying the vigilance
 the different keepers for bolts were drawn
the bravo 
and doors unlocked with little question wherever he
presented himself in this manner he quickly passed
all the outer barriers the palace and reached a
part the building which had the appearance 
being fitted for the accommodation a family
judging from the air all around him those who
dwelt there took the luxury their abode but little
into the account though neither the furniture nor the
rooms were wanting in most the necessaries
suited to people their class and the climate and
in that age
the gondolier had ascended a private stairway
and he was now before a door which had none 
those signs a prison that so freely abounded in
other parts the building he paused to listen
and then tapped with singular caution
who is without asked a gentle female voice
at the same instant that the latch moved and fell
again as if she within waited to be assured the
character her visitor before she opened the door
a friend to thee gelsomina was the answer
nay here all are friends to the keepers if words
can be believed you must name yourself or go
elsewhere for your answer
the gondolier removed the mask a little which
had altered his voice as well as concealed his face
it is i gessina he said using the diminutive 
her name
the bolts grated and the door was hurriedly
opened
it is wonderful that i did not know thea carlo 
said the female with eager simplicity but thou
takes so many disguises late and so counterfeitest
strange voices that thine own mother might have
distrusted her ear
the gondolier paused to make certain they were
alone then laying aside the mask altogether he
exposed the features the bravo
vol ii e
 the bravo
thou knowest the need caution he added
and wilt not judge me harshly
i said not that carlo but thy voice is so familiar
that i thought it wonderful thou could st speak
as a stranger
hast thou aught for me 
the gentle girl for she was both young and gentle
hesitated
hast thou aught new gelsomina repeated the
bravo reading her innocent face with his searching
glance
thou art fortunate in not being sooner in the
prison i have just had a visitor thou would st
not have liked to be seen carlo 
thou knowest i have good reasons for coming
masked i might or i might not have disliked thy
acquaintance as he should have proved
nay now thou judges wrong returned the
female hastily i had no other here but my cousin
annina
dost thou think me jealous said the bravo
smiling in kindness as he took her hand had it
been thy cousin pietro or michele or roberto or
any other youth venice i should have no other
dread than that being known
but it was only annina my cousin annina
whom thou hast never seen and i have no cousins
pietro and michele and roberto we are not
many carlo annina has a brother but he never
comes hither indeed it is long since she has found
it convergent to quit her trade to come to this dreary
place few children sisters see each other so
seldom as annina and i 
thou art a good girl gessina and art always
to be found near thy mother hast thou naught in
particular for my ear
again the soft eyes gelsomina or gessina as
she was familiarly called dropped to the floor but
the bravo 
raising them ere he could note the circumstance she
hurriedly continued the discourse
i fear annina will return or i would go with
thee at once
is this cousin thine still here then asked
the bravo with uneasiness thou knowest i
would not be seen
fear not she cannot enter without touching
that bell for she is above with my poor bedridden
mother thou canst go into the inner room as
usual when she comes and listen to her idle discourse
if thou wilt or but we have not time for
annina comes seldom and i know not why but she
seems to love a sick room little as she never stays
many minutes with her aunt
thou would st have said or i might go on my
errand gessina
i would carlo but i am certain we should be
recalled by my impatient cousin
i can wait i am patient when with thee dearest
gessina
hist tis my cousin s step thou canst
go in
while she spoke a small bell rang and the bravo
withdrew into the inner room like one accustomed
to that place retreat he left the door ajar for
the darkness the closet sufficiently concealed his
person in the mean time gelsomina opened the
outer door for the admission her visitor at the
first sound the latter s voice jacopo who had
little suspected the fact from a name which was so
common recognized the artful daughter the
wineseller
thou art at thy ease here gelsomina cried
the latter entering and throwing herself into a seat
like one fatigued thy mother is better and thou
art truly mistress the house
 the bravo
i would i were not annina for i am young to
have this trust with this affliction
it is not so insupportable gessina to be mistress
within doors at seventeen authority is sweet and
obedience is odious
i have found neither so and i will give up the
first with joy whenever my poor mother shall be
able to take command her own family again
this is well gessina and does credit to the
good father confessor but authority is dear to
woman and so is liberty thou wast not with the
maskers yesterday in the square 
i seldom wear a disguise and i could not quit
my mother
which means that thou w r ould st have been glad
to do it thou hast good reason for thy regrets
since a gayer marriage the sea or a braver
regatta has not been witnessed in venice since
thou wast born but the first was to be seen from
thy window
i saw the galley state sweeping toward the
lido and the train patricians on its deck but
little else
no matter thou shalt have as good an idea
 the pageant as if thou had st played the part 
the doge himself first came the men the guard
with their ancient dresses 
nay this i remember to have often seen for
the same show is kept from year to year
thou art right but venice never witnessed
such a brave regatta thou knowest that the first
trial is always between gondolas many oars
steered by the best esteemed the canals luigi
was there and though he did not win he more than
merited success by the manner in which he directed
his boat thou knowest luigi 
i scarce know any in venice annina for the
long illness my mother and this unhappy office
the bravo 
 my father keep me within when others are on
the canals
true thou art not well placed to make acquaintances
but luigi is second to no gondolier
in skill or reputation and he is much the merriest
rogue them all that put foot on the lido
he was foremost then in the grand race
he should have been but the awkwardness 
his fellows and some unfairness in the crossing
threw him back to be second twas a sight to
behold that many noble watermen struggling to
maintain or to get a name on the canals santa
maria i would thou could st have seen it girl 
i should not have been glad to see a friend
defeated
we must take fortune as it offers but the most il
wonderful sight the day after all though luigi
and his fellows did so well was to see a poor fisherman
named antonio in his bare head and naked
legs a man seventy years and with a boat no
better than that i use to carry liquors to the lido
entering on the second race and carrying off the
prize
he could not have met with powerful rivals 
the best venice though luigi having
strived for the first could not enter for the second
trial tis said too continued annina looking
about her with habitual caution that one who may
scarce be named in venice had the boldness to appear
in that regatta masked and yet the fisherman
won thou hast heard jacopo
the name is common
there is but one who bears it now in venice
all mean the same when they say jacopo
i have heard a monster that name surely
he hath not dared to show himself among the nobles
on such a festa 
gessina we live in an unaccountable country 
e 
 the bravo
the man walks the piazza with a step as lordly as
the doge at his pleasure and yet none say aught to
him i have seen him at noonday leaning against
the triumphal mast or the column san teodoro
with as proud an air as if he were put there to
celebrate a victory the republic 
perhaps he is master some terrible secret
which they fear he will reveal 
thou knowest little venice child holy
maria a secret that kind is a deathwarrant 
itself it is as dangerous to know too much as it
is to know too little when one deals with st mark
but they say jacopo was there standing eye to eye
with the doge and scaring the senators as if he had
sheen an uncalled spectre from the vaults their
fathers nor is this all as i crossed the lagunes
this morning i saw the body a young cavalier
drawn from the water and those who were near it
said it had the mark his fatal hand 
the timid gelsomina shuddered
they who rule she said will have to answer
for this negligence to god if they let the wretch
longer go at large
blessed st mark protect his children they
say there is much this sort sin to answer for
but see the body i did with my own eyes in entering
the canals this morning
and didst thou sleep on the lido that thou
wert abroad so early 
the lido yes nay i slept not but thou
knowest my father had a busy day during the
revels and i am not like thee gessina mistress 
the household to do as i would but i tarry hereto
chat with thee when there is great need industry
at home hast thou the package child
which i trusted to thy keeping at my last visit
it is here answered gelsomina opening a
drawer and handing to her cousin a small but
the bravo 
closely enveloped package which unknown to herself
contained some articles forbidden commerce
and which the other in her indefatigable activity
had been obliged to secrete for a time i had begun
to think that thou hadst forgotten it and was
about to send it to thee
gelsomina if thou lowest me never do o rash
an act my brother guiseppe thou scarce knowest
guiseppe
we have little acquaintance for cousins
thou art fortunate in thy ignorance i cannot
say what i might the child the same parents
but had guiseppe seen this package by any accident
it might have brought thee into great trouble
nay i fear not thy brother nor any else said
the daughter the prisonkeeper with the firmness
 innocence he could do me no harm for dealing
kindly by a relative
thou art right but he might have caused me
great vexation sainted maria if thou knowest
the pain that unthinking and misguided boy gives
his family i he is my brother after all and you
will fancy the rest actio good gessina i hope
thy father will permit thee to come and visit at last
those who so much love thee
actio annina thou knowest i would come
gladly but that i scarce quit the side my poor
mother
the wily daughter the wineseller gave her
guileless and unsuspecting friend a kiss and then
she was let out and departed
carlo said the soft voice gessina thou
canst come forth for we have no further fear 
visits
the bravo appeared but with a paleness deeper
than common on his cheek he looked mournfully
at the gentle and affectionate being who awaited his
return and when he struggled to answer her ingens
the bravo
nous smile the abortive effort gave his features an
expression ghastliness
annina has wearied thee with her idle discourse
 the regatta and murders on the canals thou
wilt not judge her harshly for the manner in which
she spoke giuseppe who may deserve this and
more but i know thy impatience and i will not
increase thy weariness
hold gessina this girl is thy cousin 
have i not told thee so our mothers are sisters

and she is here often
not as often as she could wish i am certain
for her aunt has not quitted her room for many
many months
thou art an excellent daughter kind gessina
and would make all others as virtuous as thyself
and thou hast been to return these visits 
never my father forbids it for they are dealers
in wines and entertain the gondoliers in revelry
but annina is blameless for the trade her parents

no doubt and that package it hath been long
in thy keeping
a month annina left it at her last visit for
she was hurried to cross to the lido but why
these questions you do not like my cousin who
is giddy and given to idle conversation but who i
think must have a good heart thou heard st the
manner in which she spoke the wretched bravo
jacopo and this late murder
i did
thou could st not have shown more horror at
the monster s crime thyself carlo nay annina is
thoughtless and she might be less worldly but she
hath like all us a holy aversion to sin shall i
lead thee to the cell 
goon
the bravo 
thy honest nature revolts carlo at the cold
villany the assassin i have heard much his
murders and the manner in which those up above
bear with him they say in common that his art
surpassed theirs and that the officers wait for
proof that they may not do injustice
is the senate so tender think you asked the
bravo huskily but motioning for his companion to
proceed
the girl looked sad like one who felt the force
 this question and she turned away to open a
private door whence she brought forth a little box
this is the key carlo she said showing him
one a massive bunch and i am now the sole
warder this much at least we have effected the
day may still come when we shall do more
the bravo endeavored to smile as if he appreciated
her kindness but he only succeeded in making
her understand his desire to go on the eye 
the gentlehearted girl lost its gleam hope in an
expression sorrow and she obeyed
chapter iv
but let us to the roof
and when thou hast survey d the sea the land
visit the narrow cells that cluster there
as in a place tombs
st mark s place
we shall not attempt to thread the vaulted galleries
the gloomy corridors and all the apartments
through which the keeper s daughter led her companion
those who have ever entered an extensive
prison will require no description to revive the feels
the bravoing
 pain which it excited by barred windows
creaking hinges grating bolts and all those other
signs which are alike the means and evidence 
incarceration the building unhappily like most
other edifices intended to repress the vices society
was vast strong and intricate within although
as has been already intimated a chaste and simple
beauty externally that might seem to have been
adopted in mockery its destination
gelsomina entered a low narrow and glazed gallery
when she stopped
thou slightest me as wont beneath the watergate
carlo she asked at the usual hour
i should not have entered the prison had i found
thee there for thou knowest i would be little seen
but i bethought me thy mother and crossed the
canal
thou wast wrong my mother rests much as she
has done for many months thou must have seen
that we are not taking the usual route to the cell
i have but as we are not accustomed to meet
in thy father s rooms on this errand i thought this
the necessary direction
hast thou much knowledge the palace and
the prison carlo
more than i could wish good gelsomina but
why am i thus questioned at a moment when i
would be otherwise employed
the timid and conscious girl did not answer her
cheek was never bright for like a flower reared in
the shade it had the delicate hue her secluded
life but at this question it became pale accustomed
to the ingenuous habits the sensitive being at
his side the bravo studied her speaking features intently
he moved swiftly to a window and looking
out his eye fell upon a narrow and gloomy canal
crossing the gallery he cast a glance beneath him
and saw the same dark w t watery passage leading bethe
bravo 
tween the masonry two massive piles to the quay
and the port
gelsomina he cried recoiling from the sight
 this is the bridge sighs 
it is carlo hast thou ever crossed it before
never nor do i understand why i cross it now
i have long thought that it might one day be my fortune
to walk this fatal passage but i could not dream
 such a keeper 
the eye gelsomina brightened and her smile
was cheerful
thou wilt never cross it to thy harm with me
 that i am certain kind gessina he answered
taking her hand but this is a riddle that i
cannot explain art thou in the habit entering
the palace by this gallery
it is little used except by the keepers and the
condemned as doubtless thou hast often heard but
yet they have given me the keys and taught me the
windings the place in order that i might serve
as usual for thy guide
gelsomina i fear i have been too happy in thy
company to note as prudence would have told me
the rare kindness the council in permitting me to
enjoy it
dost thou repent carlo that thou hast known
me
the reproachful melancholy her voice touched
the bravo who kissed the hand he held with
italian fervor
i should then repent me the only hours 
happiness i have known for years he said thou
hast been to me gelsomina like a flower in a desert
a pure spring to a feverish man a gleam 
hope to one suffering under malediction no no 
not for a moment have i repented knowing thee my
gelsomina 
twould not have made my life more happy
 the bravo
carlo to have thought i had added to thy sorrows
i am young and ignorant the world but i know
we should cause joy and not pain to those we
esteem
thy nature would teach thee this gentle lesson
but is it not strange that one like me should be
suffered to visit the prison unattended by any other
keeper
i had not thought it so carlo but surely it is
not common
we have found so much pleasure in each other
dear gessina that we have overlooked what ought
to have caused alarm
alarm carlo
or at least distrust for these wily senators dono
act mercy without a motive but it is now
too late to recall the past if we would and in that
which relates to thee i would not lose the memory
 a moment let us proceed
the slight cloud vanished from the face the mild
auditor the bravo but still she did not move
few pass this bridge they say she added tremulously
 and enter the world again and yet thou
dost not even ask why we are here carlo 
there was a transient gleam distrust in the
hasty glance the bravo as he shot a look at the
undisturbed eye the innocent being who put this
question but it scarcely remained long enough to
change the expression manly interest she was
accustomed to meet in his look
since thou wilt have me curious he said why
hast thou come hither and more than all being here
why dost thou linger
the season is advanced carlo she answered
speaking scarcely above her breath and we should
look in vain among the cells
i understand thee he said we will proceed
gelsomina lingered to gaze wistfully into the face
the bravo 
 her companion but finding no visible sign the
agony he endured she went on jacopo spoke
hoarsely but he was too long accustomed to disguise
to permit the weakness to escape when he
new how much it would pain the sensitive and
faithful being who had yielded her affections to him
with a singleness and devotion which arose nearly
as much from her manner life as from natural
ingenuousness
in order that the reader may be enabled to understand
the allusions which seem to be so plain
to our lovers it may be necessary to explain another
odious feature in the policy the republic 
venice
whatever may be the pretension a state in its
acknowledged theories an unerring clue to its true
character is ever to be found in the machinery 
its practice in those governments which are created
for the good the people force is applied with
caution and reluctance since the protection and not
the injury the weak is their object whereas the
more selfish and exclusive the system becomes the
more severe and ruthless are the coercive means
employed by those in power thus in venice
whose whole political fabric reposed on the narrow
foundation an oligarchy the jealousy the senate
brought the engines despotism in absolute
contact with even the pageantry their titular
prince and the palace the doge himself was polluted
by the presence the dungeons the princely
edifice had its summer and winter efclls the
reader may be ready to believe that mercy had dictated
some slight solace for the miserable in this
arrangement but this would be ascribing pity to
a body which to its latest moment had no tie to
subject it to the weakness humanity so far
from consulting the sufferings the captive his
winter cell was below the level the canals while
vol ii f
 the bravo
his sujrnmers were to be past beneath the leads exposed
to the action the burning sun that climate
as the reader has probably anticipated already
that jacopo was in the prison on an errand
connected with some captive this short explanation
will enable him to understand the secret allusion 
his companion he they sought had in truth been
recently conveyed from the damp cells where he had
passed the winter and spring to the heated chambers
beneath the roof
gelsomina continued to lead the vay with a sadness
 eye and feature that betrayed her strong sympathy
with the sufferings her companion but without
appearing to think further delay necessary she
had communicated a circumstance which weighed
heavily on her own mind and like most her mild
temperament who had dreaded such a duty now
that it was discharged she experienced a sensible
relief they ascended many flights steps opened
and shut numberless doors and threaded several
narrow corridors in silence before reaching
the place destination while gelsomina sought
the key the door before which they stopped
in the large bunch she carried the bravo breathed
the hot air the attic like one who was suffocating

they promised me that this should not be done
again he said but they forget their pledges
fiends as they are 
carlo thou forgettest that this is the palace 
the doge whispered the girl while she threw a
timid glance behind her
i forget nothing that is connected with the republic
it is all here striking his flushed brow what
is not there is in heart 
poor carlo this e anit last for ever there wist
be an 
m thou art right answered the bravo hoarsely
the bravo 
the is nearer than thou thickest no matter
 turn the key that we may go in
the hand gelsomina lingered on the lock but
admonished by his impatient eye she complied and
they entered the cell
father exclaimed the bravo hastening to the
side a pallet that lay on the floor
the attenuated and feeble form an old man roseat
the word and an eye which while it spoke mental
feebleness was at that moment even brighter than
that his son glared on the faces gelsomina and
her companion
thou hast not suffered as i had feared by this
sudden change father continued the latter kneeling
by the side the straw thine eye and cheek
and countenance are better than in the damp caves
below 
i am happy here returned the prisoner
there is light and though they have given me too
much it thou canst never know my boy the joy
 looking at the day after so long a night
he is better gelsomina they have not yet destroyed
him see his eye is bright even and his
cheek has a glow 
they are ever so after passing the winter in the
lower dungeons whispered the gentle girl
hast thou news for me boy what tidings from
thy mother
jacopo bowed his head to conceal the anguish occasioned
by this question which he now heard for
the hundredth time
she is happy father happy as one can be whoso
well loves thee when away from thy side
does she speak me often
the last word that i heard from her lips was
thy name
holy maria bless he i trust she remembers
me in her prayers 
 the bravo
doubt it not father they are the prayers an
angel
and thy patient sister thou hast not named
her son
she too is well father
has she ceased to blame herself for being the
innocent cause my sufferings 
she has
then she pines no longer over a blow that cannot
be helped
the bravo seemed to search for relief in the sympathizing
eye the pale and speechless gelsomina
she has ceased to pine father he uttered with
compelled calmness
thou hast ever loved thy sister boy with manly
tenderness thy heart is kind as i have reason
to know if god has given me grief he has blessed
me in my children
a long pause followed during which the parent
seemed to muse on the past while the child rejoiced
in the suspension questions which harrowed his
soul since those whom the other spoke had long
been the victims family misfortune the old
man for the prisoner was aged as well as feeble
turned his look on the still kneeling bravo thoughtfully
and continued
there is little hope thy sister marrying for
none are fond tying themselves to the proscribed

she wishes it not she wishes it not she is
happy with my mother 
it is a happiness the republic will not begrudge
is there no hope our being able to meet soon
thou wilt meet my mother yes that pleasure
will come at last
it is a weary time since any my blood but
thee have stood in my sight kneel that i may
bless thee
the bravo 
jacopo who had arisen under his mental torture
obeyed and bowed his head in reverence to receive
the paternal benediction the lips the old man
moved and his eyes were turned to heaven but
his language was the heart rather than that 
the tongue gelsomina bent her head to her bosom
and seemed to unite her prayers to those the
prisoner when the silent but solemn ceremony
was ended each made the customary sign the
cross and jacopo kissed the wrinkled hand the
captive
hast thou hope for me the old man asked
this pious and grateful duty done do they still
promise to let me look upon the sun again
they do they promise fair
would that their words were true i have
lived on hope for a weary time i have now been
within these walls more than four years methinks
jacopo did not answer for he knew that his
father named the period only that he himself had
been permitted to see him
i built upon the expectation that the doge
would remember his ancient servant and open my
prisondoors
still jacopo was silent for the doge whom
the other spoke had long been dead
and yet i should be grateful for maria and
the saints have not forgotten me i am not without
my pleasures in captivity
god be praised returned the brave in
what manner dost thou ease thy sorrows father
look hither boy exclaimed the old man
whose eye betrayed a mixture feverish excitement
caused by the recent change in his prison
and the growing imbecility a mind that was
gradually losing its powers for want use dost
thou see the rent in that bit wood it opens with
the heat from time to time and since i have been
f
 the bravo
an inhabitant here that fissure has doubled in length
i sometimes fancy that when it reaches the knot
the hearts the senators will soften and that my
doors will open there is a satisfaction in watching
its increase as it lengthens inch by inch year
after year 
is this all
nay i have other pleasures there was a
spider the past year that wove his web from yonder
beam and he was a companion too that i
loved to see wilt thou look boy if there is hope
 his coming back
i see him not whispered the bravo
well there is always the hope its return
the flies will enter soon and then he will be looking
for his prey they may shut me up on a false
charge and keep me weary years from my wife
and daughter but they cannot rob me all my
happiness 
the aged captive was mute and thoughtful a
childish impatience glowed in his eye and he gazed
from the rent the companion so many solitary
summers to the face his son like one who began
to distrust his enjoyments
well let them take it away he said burying
his head beneath the covering his bed i will
not curse them 
father
the prisoner made no replyfather

jacobin
his turn the bravo was speechless he did
not venture even to steal a glance towards the
breathless and attentive gelsomina though his bosom
heaved with longing to examine her guileless
features
dost thou hear me son continued the prisoner
uncovering his head dost thou really think
the bravo 
they will have the heart to chase the spider from
my cell
they will leave thee this pleasure father for it
touches neither their powder nor their fame so
long as the senate can keep its foot on the neck 
the people and so long as it can keep the seemliness
 a good name it will not envy thee this
blessed maria make me thankful i had my
fears child for it is not pleasant to lose any friend
in a cell
jacopo then proceeded to soothe the mind the
prisoner and he gradually led his thoughts to other
subjects he laid by the bedside a few articles 
food that he was allowed to bring with him and
again holding out the hope eventual liberation
he proposed to take his leave
i will try to believe thee son said the old
man who had good reason to distrust assurances
so often made i will do all i can to believe it
thou wilt tell thy mother that i never cease to
think her and to pray for her and thou wilt
bless thy sister in the name her poor imprisoned
parent
the bravo bowed in acquiescence glad any
means to escape speech at a sign from the old
man he again bent his knee and received the parting
benediction after busying himself in arranging
the scanty furniture the cell and in trying to
open one or two small fissures with a view to admit
more light and air he quitted the place
neither gelsomina nor jacopo spoke as they returned
by the intricate passages through which they
had ascended to the attic until they were again on
the bridge sighs it was seldom that human
foot trod this gallery and the former with female
quickness selected it as a place suited to their further
conference
 the bravo
dost thou find him changed she asked lingering
on the arch
much
thou speakest with a frightful meaning
i have not taught my countenance to lie to thee
gelsomina
but there is hope thou told st him there was
hope thyself
blessed maria forgive the fraud i could not
rob the little life he has its only comfort
carlo carlo why art thou so calm i
have never heard thee speak so calmly thy
father s wrongs and imprisonment
it is because his liberation is near
but this moment he was without hope and thou
speakest now liberation 
the liberation death even the anger the
senate will respect the grave
dost thou think his near i had hot seen
this change
thou art kind good gelsomina and true to thy
friends and without suspicion those crimes 
which thou art so innocent but to one who has
seen as much evil as i a jealous thought comes at
every new event the sufferings my poor father
are near their for nature is worn out but were
it not i can foresee that means w r ould be found to
bring them to a close
thou canst not suspect that any here would do
him harm 
i suspect none that belong to thee both thy
father and thyself gelsomina are placed here by
the interposition the saints that the fiends should
not have too much power on earth
i do not understand thee carlo but thou art
often so thy father used a word today that 
could wish he had not in speaking to thee
the eye the bravo threw a quick uneasy susthe
bravo 
vicious glance at his companion and then averted
its look with haste
he called thee jacopo continued the girl
men often have glimpses their fate by the
kindness their patrons
would st thou say carlo that thy father suspects
the senate will employ the monster he named 
why not they have employed worse men if
report says true he is not unknown to them
can this be so thou art bitter against the republic
because it has done injury to thy family but
thou canst not believe it has ever dealt with the
hired stiletto
i said no more than is whispered daily on the
canals
i would thy father had not called thee by this
terrible name carlo 
thou art too wise to be moved by a word gelsemina
but what thickest thou my unhappy
father
this visit has not been like the others thou hast
made him in my company i know not the reason
but to me thou hast ever seemed to feel the hope
with which thou hast cheered the prisoner while
now thou keenest to have even a frightful pleasure
in despair
thy fears deceive thee returned the bravo
scarce speaking above his breath thy fears deceive
thee and we will say no more the senate
mean to do us justice at last they are honorable
signori illustrious birth and renowned names 
twould be madness to distrust the patricians dost
thou not know girl that he who is born gentle
blood is above the weaknesses and temptations that
beset us base origin they are men placed by
birth above the weaknesses mortals and owing
their account to none they will be sure to do justice
this is reasonable and who can doubt it 
 the bravo
as he ended the bravo laughed bitterly
nay now thou trifles with me carlo none
are above the danger doing wrong but those
whom the saints and kind maria favor
this comes living in a prison and saying
thy prayers night and morning no no silly girl
there are men in the world born wise from generation
to generation born honest virtuous brave incorruptible
and fit in all things to shut up and imprison
those who are born base and ignoble where
hast thou passed thy days foolish gelsomina not to
have felt this truth in the very air thou breathes 
tis clear as the sun s light and palpable ay palpable
as these prison walls 
the timid girl recoiled from his side and there
was a moment when she meditated flight for never
before during their numberless and confidential interviews
had she ever heard so bitter a laugh or
seen so wild a gleam in the eye her companion
i could almost fancy carlo that thy father was
right in using the name he did she said as recovering
herself she turned a reproachful look on his
still excited features
it is the business parents to name their children
but enough i must leave thee good gel
somina and i leave thee with a heavy heart
the unsuspecting gelsomina forgot her alarm
she knew not why but though the imaginary carlo
seldom quitted her that she was not sad she felt a
weight heavier than common on her spirits at this
declaration
thou hast thy affairs and they must not be forgotten
art fortunate with the gondola late
carlo
gold and i are nearly strangers the republic
throws the whole charge the venerable prisoner
on my toil
i have little as thou knowest carlo said gelthe
bravo 
somina in a halfaudible voice but it is thine
my father is not rich as thou canst feel or he would
not live on the sufferings others by holding the
keys the prison
he is better employed than those who set the
duty were the choice given me girl to wear the
horned bonnet to feast in their halls to rest in their
palaces to be the gayest bauble in such a pageant
as that yesterday to plot in their secret councils
and to be the heartless judge to condemn my fellows
to this misery or to be merely the keeper the
keys and turner the bolts i should seize on the
latter office as not only the most innocent but by
far the most honorable 
thou dost not judge as the world judges carlo
i had feared thou might st feel shame at being the
husband a jailer s daughter nay i will not hide
the secret longer since thou speakest so calmly i
have wept that it should be so
then thou hast neither understood the world
nor me were thy father the senate or the
council three could the grievous fact be known
thou would st have cause to sorrow but gelso
mina the canals are getting dusky and i must
leave thee
the reluctant girl saw the truth what he said
and applying a key she opened the door the covered
bridge a few turnings and a short descent
brought the bravo and his companion to the level
 the quays here the former took a hurried leave
and quitted the prison
 the bravo
chapter iv
but they who blunder thus are raw beginners
don juan
the hour had come for the revels the piazza
and for the movement the gondolas maskers
glided along the porticoes as usual the song and cry
were heard anew and venice was again absorbed
in delusive gaiety
when jacopo issued from the prison on the quay
he mingled with the stream human beings that
was setting towards the squares protected from observation
by the privileged mask while crossing
the lower bridge the canal st mark he lingered
an instant to throw a look at the glazed gallery
he had just quitted and then moved forward with
the crowd the image the artless and confiding
gelsomina uppermost in his thoughts as he passed
slowly along the gloomy arches the broglio his
eye sought the person don camillo monforte
they met at the angle the little square and exchanging
secret signs the bravo moved on unnoticed

hundreds boats lay at the foot the piazzetta
among these jacopo sought his own gondola which
he extricated from the floating mass and urged into
the stream a few sweeps the oar and he lay
at the side la bella sorrentina the padrone
paced the deck enjoying the cool the evening
with italian indolence while his people sang or
rather chanted a song those seas grouped on
the forecastle the greetings were blunt and brief
as is usual among men that class but the padrone
appeared to expect the visit for he led his
guest far from the ears his crew to the other extremity
 the felucca
the bravo 
hast thou aught in particular good rodrigo
demanded the mariner who knew the bravo by a
sign and yet who only knew him by that fictitious
name thou seest we have not passed the time
idly though yesterday was a festa
art thou ready for the gulf 
for the levant or the pillars hercules as
shall please the senate we have got our yard aloft
since the sun went behind the mountains and though
we may seem careless delay an hour s notice will
fit us for the outside the lido
then take the notice
master roderigo you bring your news to an
overstocked market i have already been informed
that we shall be wanted tonight
the quick movement suspicion made by the
bravo escaped the observation the padrone whose
eye was running over the felucca s gear with a sailor
s habitual attention to that part his vessel when
there was question its service
thou art right stefano but there is little harm
in repeated caution preparation is the first duty ina
delicate commission
will you look for yourself signor roderigo 
said the mariner in a lower tone la bella serpentine
is not the bucentaur nor a galley the
grand master malta but for her size better
rooms are not to be had in the palace the doge
when they told me there was a lady in the freight
the honor calabria was stirred in her behalf
tis well if they have named to the all the
particulars thou wilt not fail to do thyself credit
i do not say that they have shown me half 
them good signore interrupted stefano the
secrecy your venetian shipments is my greatest
objection to the trade it has more than once happened
to me that i have lain weeks in the canals
with my hold as clean as a friar s conscience when
vol ii g
 the bravo
orders have come to weigh with some such cargo
as a messenger who has got into his berth as we
cleared the port to get out it on the coast dalmatia
or among the greek islands
in such cases thou hast earned thy money easily

diamine master roderigo if i had a friend
in venice to give timely advice the felucca might
be ballasted with articles that would bring a profit
on the other shore what concern is it to the
senate when i do my duty to the nobles faithfully
that i do my duty at the same time to the good woman
and her little brown children left at home in
calabria
there is much reason in what thou sayest sterno
 but thou knowest the republic is a hard master
an affair this nature must be touched with
a gentle hand
none know it better than i for when they sent
the trader with all his movables out the city i
was obliged to throw certain casks into the sea to
make room for his worthless stuffs the senate
owes me just compensation for that loss worthy signor
roderigo 
which thou would st be glad to repair tonight 
santissima maria you may be the doge himself
signore for any thing i know your countenance
 but i could swear at the altar you ought
to be the senate for your sagacity if this lady
will not be burthened with many effects and there
is yet tire i might humor the tastes the dalmatians
with certain the articles that come from the
countries beyond the pillars hercules 
thou art the judge the probability thyself
since they told thee the nature thy errand
san gennaro napoli open my eyes they
said not a word beyond this little fact that a youthful
lady in whom the senate had great interest would
the bravo 
quit the city this night for the eastern coast if it
is at all agreeable to your conscience master roderigo
i should be happy to hear who are to be her
companions
 that thou shalt hear more in proper season
in the meantime i would recommend to thee a cautious
tongue for st mark makes no idle jokes with
those who offend him i am glad to see thee in this
state preparation worthy padrone and wishing
thee a happy night and a prosperous voyage i
commit thee to thy patron but hold ere i quit
thee i would know the hour that the landbreeze
will serve
you are exact as a compass in your own matters
signore but little charity to thy friends
with the burning sun today we should have the
air the alps about the turn the night
tis well my eye shall be on thee once more
actio
cospetto and hou hast said nothing the
cargo
twill not be so weighty in bulk as in value
carelessly answered jacopo shoving his gondola
from the side the felucca the fall his oar into
the water succeeded and as stefano stood meditating
the chances his speculation on his deck the
boat glided away towards the quay with a swift but
easy movement
deceit like the windings that subtle animal the
fox often crosses its own path it consequently
throws out those by whom it is practised as well
as those who are meant to be its victims when
jacopo parted from don camillo it was with an understanding
that he should adopt all the means that
his native sagacity or his experience might suggest
to ascertain in what manner the council intended to
dispose the person donna violetta they had
separated on the lido and as none knew their
 the bravo
interview but him and none would probably suspect
their recent alliance the bravo entered on his new
duty with some chances success that might otherwise
have been lost a change its agents in affairs
 peculiar delicacy was one the ordinary
means taken by the republic to avoid investigation
jacopo had often been its instrument in negotiating
with the mariner who as has been so plainly intimated
had frequently been engaged in carrying into
effect its secret and perhaps justifiable measures 
police but in no instance had it ever been found
necessary to interpose a second agent between the
commencement and the consummation its bargains
except in this he had been ordered to seethe
padrone and to keep him in preparation for immediate
service but since the examination antonio
before the council his employers had neglected
to give him any farther instructions the danger
 leaving the bride within reach the agents 
don camillo was so obvious that this unusual caution
had been considered necessary it was under
this disadvantage therefore that jacopo entered on
the discharge his new and important duties
that cunning as has just been observed is apt to
overreach itself has passed into a proverb and the
case jacopo and his employers was one in point
to prove its truth the unusual silence those who
ordinarily sought him on similar occasions had not
been lost on the agent and the sight the felucca
as he strayed along the quays gave an accidental
directionto his inquiries the manner in which
they were aided by the cupidity the calabria
has just been related
jacopo had no sooner touched the quay and secured
his boat than he hastened again to the broglio
it was now filled by maskers and the idlers
 the piazzetta the patricians had withdrawn to
the scenes their own pleasures or in furtherance
the bravo
 that system mysterious sway which it was
their policy to maintain they did not choose to remain
exposed to the common eye during the hours
 license which were about to follow
it would seem that jacopo had his instructions
for no sooner did he make sure that don camillo
had retired than he threaded the throng with the
air a man whose course was decided by this
time both the squares were full and at least half 
those who spent the night in those places amusement
were masked the step the bravo though
so unhesitating was leisurely and he found time in
passing up the piazzetta to examine the forms and
when circumstances permitted the features all
he met he proceeded in this manner to the point
 junction between the two squares when his elbow
was touched by a light hand
jacopo was not accustomed unnecessarily to
trust his voice in the square st mark and at that
hour but his look inquiry was returned by a sign
to follow he had been stopped by one whose
figure was so completely concealed by a domino
as to baffle all conjecture concerning his true character
perceiving however that the other wished
to lead him to a part the square that was vacant
and which was directly on the course he was about
to pursue the bravo made a gesture compliance
and followed no sooner were the two apart from
the pressure the crowd and in a place where no
eavesdropper could overhear their discourse without
detection than the stranger stopped he appeared
to examine the person stature and dress 
jacopo from beneath his mask with singular caution
closing the whole with a sign that meant recognition
jacopo returned his dumb show but
maintained a rigid silence
just daniel muttered the stranger when he
found that his companion was not disposed to speak 
g
 the bravo
one would think illustrious signore that your
confessor had imposed a penance silence by the
manner in which you refuse to speak to your servant

what would st thou
here am i sent into the piazza among knights
 industry valets gondoliers and all other manner
 revellers that adorn this christian land in search
 the heir one the most ancient and honorable
houses venice
how knowest thou i am he thou meekest
signore there are many signs seen by a wiseman
that escape the unobservant when young
cavaliers have a taste for mingling with the people
in honorable disguise as in the case a certain
patrician this republic they are to be known by
their air if not by their voices
thou art a cunning agent hosea but the
shrewdness thy race is its livelihood
it is its sole defence against the wrongs the
oppressor young noble we are hunted like wolves
and it is not surprising that we sometimes show the
ferocity the beasts you take us for but why
should i tell the wrongs my people to one who
believes life is a masquerade 
and who would not be sorry ingenious hosea
were it composed only hebrews but thy errand
 i have no gage unredeemed nor do i know
that i owe thee gold
righteous samuel you cavaliers the senate
are not always mindful the past signore or
these are words that might have been spared if
your excellency is inclined to forget pledges the
fault is not my seeking but as for the account
that has been so long growing between us there is
not a dealer on the rialto that will dispute the
proofs
the bravo 
well be it so would st thou dun my father s
son in the face the revellers in st mark 
i would do no discredit to any come that
illustrious race signore and therefore we will say
no more the matter always relying that at the
proper moment you will not question your own
hand and seal
i like thy prudence hebrew it is a pledge
thou comest on some errand less ungracious than
common as i am pressed for time twill be a favor
wert thou to name it
hosea examined in a covert but very thorough
manner the vacant spot around them and drawing
nearer to the supposed noble he continued
signore your family is in danger meeting
with a great loss it is known to you that the senate
has altogether and suddenly removed donna violent
from the keeping the faithful and illustrious
senator your father
though jacopo started slightly the movement
was so natural for a disappointed lover that it rather
aided than endangered his disguise
compose yourself young signore continued
hosea these disappointments attend us all in
youth as i know by severe trials leah was not
gained without trouble and next to success in barter
success in love is perhaps the most uncertain
gold is a great make weight in both and it commonly
prevails but you are nearer to losing the
lady your love and her possessions than you may
imagine for i am sent expressly to say that she is
about to be removed from the city
whither demanded jacopo so quickly as todo
credit to his assumed character
that is the point to learn signore thy father
is a sagacious senator and is deep at times in the
secrets the state but judging from his uncertainty
on this occasion i take it he is guided more
 the bravo
by his calculations than by any assurance his
own knowledge just daniel i have seen the moments
when i have suspected that the venerable
patrician himself was a member the council 
three
his house is ancient and his privileges well established
why should he not
i say naught against it signore it is a wise
body that doeth much good and prevented much
harm none speak evil the secret councils oh
the rialto where men are more given to gainful industry
than to wild discussions their rulers acts
but signore be he this or that council or merely
 the senate a heedful hint has fallen from his
lips the danger we are in losing 
we hast thou thoughts donna violetta
hosea
leah and the law forbid if the comely queen
 sheba herself were to tempt me and a frail nature
showed signs weakness i doubt that our
rabbis would find reasons for teaching selfdenial 
besides the daughter levi is no favorer polygamy
nor any other our sex s privileges i
spoke in pluralities signore because the rialto has
some stake in this marriage as well as the house 
gradenigo
i understand thee thou hast fears for thy
gold
had i been easily alarmed signer giacomo in
that particular i might not have parted with it so
readily but though the succession thy illustrious
father will be ample to meet any loan within
my humble means that the late signor tieopolo
will not weaken the security
i admit thy sagacity and feel the importance
 thy warning but it seems to have no other
object or warranty than thy own fears
the bravo 
with certain obscure hints from your honored
father signore
did he say more to the point
he spoke in parables young noble but having
an oriental ear his words were not uttered to the
wind that the rich damsel is about to be conveyed
from venice am i certain and for the benefit 
the little stake i have myself in her movements i
would give the best turquoise in my shop to know
whither
canst thou say with certainty twill be this
night
b giving no pledge for redemption in the event
pr mistake i am so sure young cavalier as to
have many unquiet thoughts
enough i will look to my own interests and
to thine
jacopo waved his hand in adieu and pursued his
walk up the piazza
had i looked more sharply to the latter as became
one accustomed to deal with the accursed
race muttered the hebrew it would be a matter
 no concern to me if the girl married a turk
hosea said a mask at his ear a word with
thee in secret
the jeweller started and found that in his zeal
he had suffered one to approach within sound his
voice unseen the other was in a domino also and
so well enveloped as to be effectually concealed
what would st thou signor mask demanded
the wary jew
a word in friendship and in confidence thou
hast moneys to lend at usury
the question had better be put to the republic s
treasury i have many stones valued much below
their weight and would be glad to put them with
some one more lucky than myself who will be able
to keep them
 the bravo
nay this will not suffice thou art known to be
abounding in sequins one thy race and riches
will never refuse a sure loan with securities ascertain
as the laws venice a thousand ducats
in thy willing hand is no novelty
they who call me rich signor mask are pleased
to joke with the unhappy child a luckless
race that i might have been above want nay
that i am not downright needy may be true but
when they speak a thousand ducats they speak
 affairs too weighty for my burthened shoulders
were it your pleasure to purchase an amethyst or v
a ruby gallant signore there might possibly bie
dealings between us 
i have need gold old man and can spare
thee jewels myself at need my wants are urgent
at this moment and i have little time to lose in
words name thy conditions
one should have good securities signore to be
so peremptory in a matter money
thou hast heard that the laws venice are
not more certain a thousand sequins and that
quickly thou shalt settle the usury with thine own
conscience
hosea thought that this was giving ample room
to the treaty and he began to listen more seriously
signore he said a thousand ducats are not
picked up at pleasure from the pavement the
great square he who would lend them must first
earn them with long and patient toil and he who
would borrow 
waits at thy elbow
should have a name and countenance well
known on the rialto
thou eldest on sufficient pledges to masks
careful hosea or fame belies thy generosity
a sufficient pledge gives me power to see the
way clearly though the borrower should be as
the bravo 
much hidden as those up above but here is none
forthcoming come to me tomorrow masked or
not as may suit your own pleasure for i have no
impertinent desire to pry into any man s secrets
beyond what a regard to my own interests requires
and i will look into my coffers though those no
heirapparent in venice can be emptier
my necessities are too urgent to brook delay
hast thou the gold on condition naming thine
own usury
with sufficient pledges in stones price i
might rake together the sum among our dispersed
people signore but he who goes on the island to
borrow as i shall be obliged to do should be able
to satisfy all doubts concerning the payment
the gold can then be had on that point i maybe
easy
hosea hesitated for he had in vain endeavored
to penetrate the other s disguise and while he
thought his assurance a favorable omen with a
lender s instinct he disliked his impatience
i have said by the friendly aid our people 
he answered with caution
this uncertainty will not answer my need addio
hosea i must seek elsewhere
 signore you could not be more hurried were
the money to pay the cost your nuptials could
i find isaac and aaron within at this late hour i
think i might be safe in saying that part the
money might be had
i cannot trust to this chance
nay signore the chance is but small since
aaron is bedridden and isaac never fails to look
into his affairs after the toil the day is ended
the honest hebrew finds sufficient recreation in the
employment though i marvel at his satisfaction
since nothing but losses have come over our people
the year past
 the bravo
i tell thee jew no doubt must hang over the
negotiation the money with pledges and thine
own conscience for arbiter between us but no equivocal
dealings to be followed by a disappointment
under the pretence that second parties are not
satisfied
just daniel to oblige you signore i think i
may venture the wellknown hebrew levi 
livorno has left with me a sack containing the very
sum which there is question and under the conditions
named i will convert it to my uses and repay
the good jeweller his gold with moneys my
own at a later day
i thank thee for the fact hosea said the other
partially removing his mask but as instantly replacing
it it will greatly shorten our negotiations
thou hast not that sack the jew livorno beneath
thy domino 
hosea was speechless the removal the mask
had taught him two material facts he had been
communicating his distrust the senate s intentions
concerning donna violetta to an unknown
person and possibly to an agent the police and
he had just deprived himself the only argument
he had ever found available in refusing the attempts
 giacomo gradenigo to borrow by admitting to
that very individual that he had in his power the
precise sum required
i trust the face an old customer is not likely
to defeat our bargain hosea demanded the profligate
heir the senator scarce concealing the irony
in which the question was put
father abraham had i known it had been
you signor giacomo we might have greatly shortened
the treaty
by denying that thou hadst the money as thou
hast so often done late 
the bravo 
 nay nay i am not a swallower my own
words young signore but my duty to levi must
not be forgotten the careful hebrew made me
take a vow by the name our tribe that i would
not part with his gold to any that had not the means
 placing its return beyond all chances
this assurance is not wanting since thou art the
borrower thyself to lend to me
signore you place my conscience in an awkward
position you are now my debtor some sixthousand
sequins and were i to make this loan 
money in trust and were you to return it two propositions
i make on supposition a natural love for
my own might cause me to pass the payment to
account whereby i should put the assets levi in
settle that as thou wilt with thy conscience hosea
thou hast confessed to the money and here are
jewels for the pledge i ask only the sequins
it is probable that the appeal giacomo gradenigh
would not have produced much effect on the
flinty nature the hebrew who had all the failings
 a man proscribed by opinion but having recovered
from his surprise he began to explain to his
companion his apprehensions on account donna
violetta whose marriage it will be remembered
was a secret to all but the witnesses and the council
 three when to his great joy he found that the
gold was wanting to advance his own design removing
her to some secret place this immediately
changed the whole face the bargain as the
pledges offered were really worth the sum to be received
hosea thought taking the chances recovering
back his ancient loans from the foreign estates
 the heiress into the account the loan would
be no bad investment the pretended sequins his

the night wore on the strains music again
began to break through the ordinary stillness the
town and the boats the great were once more
in motion on every canal hands waved timidly
in recognition from the windows the little dark
canopies as the gondolas glided by but few paused
to greet each other in that city mystery and suspicion
even the refreshing air the evening was
inhaled under an appearance restraint which
though it might not be at the moment felt was too
much interwoven with the habits the people ever
to be entirely thrown aside
among the lighter and gayer barges the patricians
a gondola more than usual size but 
an exterior so plain as to denote vulgar uses came
sweeping down the great canal its movement was
leisurely and the action the gondoliers that 
men either fatigued or little pressed for time he
who steered guided the boat with consummate skill
but with a single hand while his three fellows from
time to time suffered their oars to trail on the water
in very idleness in short it had the ordinary
listless appearance a boat returning to the city
from an excursion on the brent or to some the
more distant isles
suddenly the gondola diverged from the centre
the bravo 
 the passage down which it rather floated than
pulled and shot into one the least frequented canals
 the city from this moment its movement
became more rapid and regular until it reached a
quarter the town inhabited by the lowest order
 the venetians here it stopped by the side a
warehouse and one its crew ascended to a bridge
the others threw themselves on the thwarts and
seemed to repose
he who quitted the boat threaded a few narrow
but public allies such as are to be found in every
part that confined town and knocked lightly
at a window it was not long before the casement
opened and a female voice demanded the name 
him without
it is i annina returned gino who was not an
unfrequent applicant for admission at that private
portal open the door girl for i have come on a
matter pressing haste
annina complied though not without making sure
that her suitor was alone
thou art come unseasonably gino said the
wineseller s daughter i was about to go to st
mark s to breathe the evening air imy father and
brothers are already departed and i only stay to
make sure the bolts
their gondola will hold a fourth
they have gone by the footways
and thou walked the streets alone at this hour

the neapolitan is a powerful noble annina able
and willing to keep his servitors in respect
he will have need all his interest but why
hast thou come at this unseasonable hour thy
 the bravo
visits are never too welcome gino and when i have
other affairs they are disagreeable
had the passion the gondolier been very deep
or very sensitive this plain dealing might have given
him a shock but gino appeared to take the repulse
as coolly as it was given
i am used to thy caprices annina he said
throwing himself upon a bench like one determined
to remain where he was some young patrician
has kissed his hand to thee as thou hast crossed san
marco or thy father has made a better day it
than common on the lido thy pride always mounts
with thy father s purse
diamine to hear the fellow one would think
he had my troth and that he only waited in the sacristy
for the candles to be lighted to receive my
vows what art thou to me gino telling that thou
takes on thee these sudden airs
and what art thou to me annina that thou
mayest off these wornout caprices on don camillo s
confidant
out upon thee insolent i have no time to waste
in idleness
thou art in much haste tonight annina
to be rid thee now listen to what i say
gino and let every word go to thy heart for they
are the last thou wilt ever hear from me thou
serves a decayed noble one who will shortly be
chased in disgrace from the city and with him will
go all his idle servitors i choose to remain in the
city my birth
the gondolier laughed in real indifference at her
affected scorn but remembering his erf and he
quickly assumed a graver air and endeavored to
still the resentment his fickle mistress by a more
respectful manner
st mark protect me annina he said if weare
not to kneel before the good prior together it
the bravo 
is no reason we should not bargain in wines here
have i come into the dark canals within stone s
throw thy very door with a gondola mellow
lachryma christ such as honest maso thy father
has rarely dealt in and thou greatest me as a dog
that is chased from a church 
i have little time for thee or thy wines tonight
gino hadst thou not stayed me i should already
have been abroad and happy
close thy door girl and make little ceremony
with an old friend said the gondolier officiously
offering to aid her in securing the dwelling annina
took him at his word and as both appeared to work
with good will the house was locked and the wilful
girl and her suitor were soon in the street their
route lay across the bridge already named gino
pointed to the gondola as he said thou art not to
be tempted annina
thy rashness in leading the smugglers to my
father s door will bring us to harm some day silly
fellow
the boldness the act will prevent suspicion
 what vineyard is the liquor
it came from the foot vesuvius and is ripened
by the heat the volcano should my friends
part with it to thy enemy old beppo thy father will
rue the hour
annina who was much addicted to consulting her
interests on all occasions cast a longing glance at
the boat the canopy was closed but it was large
and her willing imagination readily induced her to
fancy it well filled with skins from naples
this will be the last thy visits to our door
gino
as thou shalt please but go down and taste 
annina hesitated and as a woman is said always
to do when she hesitates she complied they reached
the boat with quick steps and without regarding
h
 the bravo
the men who were still lounging on the thwarts annina
glided immediately beneath the canopy a fifth
gondolier was lying at length on the cushions for
unlike a boat devoted to the contraband the canopy
had the usual arrangement a bark the canals
i see nothing to turn me aside exclaimed the
disappointed girl wilt thou aught with me
signore 
thou art welcome we shall not part so readily
as before
the stranger had arisen while speaking and ashe
ended he laid a hand on the shoulder his visitor
who found herself confronted with don camillo
monforte
annina was too much practised in deception to
indulge in any the ordinary female symptoms
either real or affected alarm commanding
her features though in truth her limbs shook she
said with assumed pleasantry
the secret trade is honored in the services 
the noble duke st agata
i am not here to trifle girl as thou wilt see in
the thou hast thy choice before thee frank
confession or my just anger
don camillo spoke calmly but in a manner that
plainly showed annina she had to deal with a resolute
man
what confession would your eccellenza have
from the daughter a poor wineseller she asked
her voice trembling in spite herself
the truth and remember that this time we do
not part until i am satisfied the venetian police
and i are now fairly at issue and thou art the firstfruits
 my plan
signor duca this is a bold step to take in the
heart the canals 
the consequences be mine thy interest will
teach thee to confess
the bravo 
i shall make no great merit signore doing
that which is forced upon me as it is your pleasure
to know the little i can tell you i am happy to
be permitted to relate it
speak then for time presses
signore i shall not pretend to deny you have
been illtreated capper how ill has the council
treated you a noble cavalier a strange country
who the meanest gossip in venice knows has a just
right to the honors the senate to be so treated is
a disgrace to the republic i do not wonder that
your eccellenza is out humor with them blessed
st mark himself would lose his patience to be thus
treated
a truce with this girl and to your facts
my facts signor due a are a thousand times
clearer than the sun and they are all at your excellent
s service i am sure i wish i had more 
them since they give you pleasure
enough this profession speak to the facts
themselves
annina who in the manner most her class
in italy that had been exposed to the intrigues 
the towns had been lavish her words now found
means to cast a glance at the water when she saw
that the boat had already quitted the canals and
was rowing easily out upon the lagunes perceiving
how completely she was in the power don
camillo she began to feel the necessity being
more explicit
your eccellenza has probably suspected that the
council found means to be acquainted with your intention
to fly from the city with donna violetta
all that is known to me
why they chose me to be the servitor the
noble lady is beyond my powers to discover our
lady lorenzo i am not the person to be sent for
when the state wishes to part two lovers 
 the bravo
i have borne with thee annina because i would
let the gondola get beyond the limits the city but
now thou must throw aside thy subterfuge and speak
plainly where didst thou leave my wife 
does your eccellenza then think the state will
admit the marriage to be legal 
girl answer or i will find means to make thee
where didst thou leave my wife
blessed st theodore signore the agents the
republic had little need me and i was put on the
first bridge that the gondola passed
thou strives to deceive me in vain thou wast
on the lagunes till a late hour in the day and i have
notice thy having visited the prison st mark
as the sun was setting and this on thy return from
the boat donna violetta
there was no acting in the wonder annina
santissima maria you are better served signore
than the council thinks 
as thou wilt find to thy cost unless the truth bespoken
from what convent didst thou come
signore from none if your eccellenza has discovered
that the senate has shut up the signora
tiepolo in the prison st mark for safekeeping
it is no fault mine
thy artifice is useless annina observed don
camillo calmly thou wast in the prison in quest
 forbidden articles that thou hadst long left with
thy cousin gelsomina the keeper s daughter who
little suspected thy errand and on whose innocence
and ignorance the world thou hast long successfully
practised donna violetta is no vulgar prisoner
to be immured in a jail
santissima madre di dio 
amazement confined the answer the girl to
this single but strong exclamation
thou seest the impossibility deception i am
acquainted with so much thy movements as to
the bravo 
render it impossible that thou should st lead me far
astray thou art not wont to visit thy cousin but
as thou entered the canals this evening 
a shout on the water caused don camillo to
pause on looking out he saw a dense body 
boats sweeping towards the town as if they were
all impelled by a single set oars a thousand
voices were speaking at once and occasionally a
general and doleful cry proclaimed that the floating
multitude which came on was moved by a common
feeling the singularity the spectacle and
the fact that his own gondola lay directly in the
route the fleet which was composed several
hundred boats drove the examination the girl
momentarily from the thoughts the noble
what have we here jacopo he demanded in
an undertone the gondolier who steered his own
barge
they are fishermen signore and by the manner
in which they come down towards the canals i
doubt they are bent on some disturbance there
has been discontent among them since the refusal 
the doge to liberate the boy their companion from
the galleys
curiosity induced the people don camillo to
linger a minute and then they perceived the necessity
 pulling out the course the floating mass
which came on like a torrent the men sweeping
their boats with that desperate stroke which is so
often seen among the italian oarsmen a menacing
hail with a command to remain admonished don
camillo the necessity downright flight or 
obedience he chose the latter as the least likely
to interfere with his own plans
who art thou demanded one who had assumed
the character a leader if men the
lagunes and christians join your friends and away
with us to st mark for justice 
 the bravo
what means this tumult asked don camillo
whose dress effectually concealed his rank a disguise
that he completed by adopting the venetian
dialect why are you here in these numbers
friends
behold
don camillo turned and he beheld the withered
features and glaring eyes old antonio fixed in
death the explanation was made by a hundred
voices accompanied by oaths so bitter and denunciations
so deep that had not don camillo been
prepared by the tale jacopo he would have found
great difficulty in understanding what he heard
in dragging the lagunes for fish the body 
antonio had been found and the result was first a
consultation on the probable means his death
then a collection the men his calling and
finally the scene described
giustizia exclaimed fifty excited voices as
the grim visage the fisherman was held towards
the light the moon giustizia in palazzo e pane
in piazza
ask it the senate returned jacopo not attempting
to conceal the derision his tones
thickest thou our fellow has suffered for his
boldness yesterday 
stranger things have happened in venice 
they forbid us to cast our nets in the candle
orfano lest the secrets justice should be known
and yet they have grown bold enough to drown
one our own people in the midst our gondolas 
justice justice shouted numberless hoarse
throats
away to st mark s lay the body at the feet
 the doge away brethren antonio s blood is on
their souls 
bent on a wild and undigested scheme asserting
their wrongs the fishermen again plied their
the bravo 
oars and the whole fleet swept away as if it were
composed a single mass
the meeting though so short was accompanied
by cries menaces and all those accustomed signs
 rage which mark a popular tumult among thos
excitable people and it had produced a sensible
effect on the nerves annina don camillo profited
by her evident terror to press his questions for
the hour no longer admitted trifling
the result was that while the agitated mob
swept into the mouth the great canal raising
hoarse shouts the gondola don camillo monforte
glided away across the wide and tranquil surface
 the lagunes

the tranquillity the best ordered society maybe
disturbed at any time by a sudden outbreaks
 the malcontents against such a disaster there
is no more guarding than against the commission
 more vulgar crimes but when a government
trembles for its existence before the turbulence 
popular commotion it is reasonable to infer some
radical defect in its organization men will rally
around their institutions as freely as they rally
around any other cherished interest when they
merit their care and there can be no surer sign 
their hollowness than when the rulers seriously apprehend
the breath the mob no nation ever
exhibited more this symptomatic terror on all
 the bravo
occasions internal disturbance than the pretending
republic venice there was a neverceasing
and a natural tendency to dissolution in her factious
system which was only resisted by the alertness 
her aristocracy and the political buttresses which
their ingenuity had reared much was said the
venerable character her polity and its consequent
security but it is in vain that selfishness contends
with truth all the fallacies with which
man has attempted to gloss his expedients there is
none more evidently false than that which infers the
duration a social system from the length time
it has already lasted it would be quite as reasonable
to affirm that the man seventy has the same
chances for life as the youth fifteen or that the
inevitable fate all things mortal origin was
not destruction there is a period in human existence
when the principle vitality has to contend
with the feebleness infancy but this probationary
state passed the child attains the age when it has
the most reasonable prospect living thus the
social like any other machine which has run just
long enough to prove its fitness is at the precise
period when it is least likely to fail and although he
that is young may not live to become old it is certain
that he who is old was once young the empire
 china was in its time as youthful as our
own republic nor can we see any reason for believing
that it is to outlast us from the decrepitude
which is a natural companion its years
at the period our tale venice boasted much
 her antiquity and dreaded in an equal degree
her she was still strong in her combinations
but they were combinations that had the vicious
error being formed for the benefit the minority
and which like the mimic fortresses and moats
 a scenic representation needed only a strong
light to destroy the illusion the alarm with
the bravo 
which the patricians heard the shouts the fishermen
as they swept by the different palaces on
their way to the great square can be readily imagined
some feared that the final consummation 
their artificial condition which had so long been
anticipated by a secret political instinct was at
length arrived and began to bethink them the
safest means providing for their own security
some listened in admiration for habit had so far
mastered dullness as to have created a species 
identity between the state and far more durable
things and they believed that st mark had gained
a victory in that decline which was never exactly
intelligible to their apathetic capacities but a few
and these were the spirits that accumulated all the
national good which was vulgarly and falsely
ascribed to the system itself intuitively comprehended
the danger with a just appreciation its
magnitude as well as the means to avoid it
but the rioters were unequal to any estimate 
their own force and had little aptitude in measuring
their accidental advantages they acted merely
on impulse the manner in which their aged companion
had triumphed on the preceding day his
cold repulse by the doge and the scene the lido
which in truth led to the death antonio had prepared
their minds for the tumult when the body
was found therefore after the time necessary to
collect their forces on the lagunes they yielded to
passion and moved away towards the palace 
st mark as described without any other definite
object than a simple indulgence feeling
on entering the canal the narrowness the passage
compressed the boats into a mass so dense as
in a measure to impede the use oars and the
progress the crowd was necessarily slow all
were anxious to get as near as possible to the body
 antonio and like all mobs they in some decree
vol ii i
 the bravo
frustrated their own objects by illregulated zeal
once or twice the names offensive senators were
shouted as if the fishermen intended to visit the
crimes the state on its agents but these cries
passed away in the violent breath that was expended
on reaching the bridge the rialto more
than half the multitude landed and took the
shorter course the streets to the point destination
while those in front got on the faster for being
disembarrassed the pressure in the rear as
they drew nearer to the port the boats began to
loosen and to take something the form a
funeral procession
it was during this moment change that a
powerfully manned gondola swept with strong
strokes out a lateral passage into the great
canal accident brought it directly in front the
moving phalanx boats that was coming down
the same channel its crew seemed staggered by
the extraordinary appearance which met their
view and for an instant its course w r as undecided
a gondola the republic shouted fifty fishermen
a single voice added canale orfano 
the bare suspicion such an errand as was
implied by the latter words and at that moment
was sufficient to excite the mob they raised a
cry denunciation and some twenty boats made
a furious demonstration pursuit the menace
however was sufficient for quicker far than the
movements the pursuers the gondoliers the
republic dashed towards the shore and leaping on
one those passages planks which encircle so
many the palaces venice they disappeared
by an alley
encouraged by this success the fishermen seized
the boat as a waif and towed it into their own fleet
filling the air with cries triumph curiosity led
the bravo 
a few to enter the hearselike canopy whence they
immediately reissued dragging forth a priest
who art thou hoarsely demanded he who
took upon himself the authority a leader
a carmelite and a servant god 
dost thou serve st mark hast thou been to
the canale orfano to shrive a wretch 
i am here in attendance on a young and noble
lady who has need my council and prayers the
happy and the miserable the free and the captive
are equally my care 
ha thou art not above thy office thou
wilt say the prayers for the dead in behalf a
poor man s soul 
my son i know no differencein this respect
between the doge and the poorest fisherman still
i would not willingly desert the females
the ladies shall receive no harm come into
my boat for there is need thy holy office
father anselmo the reader will readily anticipate
that it was he entered the canopy said a
few words in explanation to his trembling companions
and complied he was rowed to threading
gondola and by a sign directed to the dead
body
thou see st that corpse father continued his
conductor it is the face one who was an upright
and pious christian
he was
we all knew him as the oldest and the most skilful
fisherman the lagunes and one ever ready
to assist an unlucky companion
i can believe thee 
thou mayest for the holy books are not more
true than my words yesterday he came down
this very canal in triumph for he bore aw r ay the
honors the regatta from the stoutest oars in
venice
 the bravo
i have heard his success
they say that jacopo the bravo he who once
held the best oar in the canals was the party 
santa madonna such a man was too precious to
die
it is the fate all rich and poor strong and
feeble happy and miserable must alike come to this

not to this reverend carmelite for antonio
having given offence to the republic in the matter
 a grandson that is pressed for the galleys has
been sent to purgatory without a christian hope for
his soul
there is an eye that watched on the meanest 
us son we will believe he was not forgotten
cospetto they say that those the senate look
black upon get but little aid from the church wilt
thou pray for him carmelite and make good thy
words 
i will said father anselmo firmly make
room son that no decency my duty be overlooked

the swarthy expressive faces the fishermen
gleamed with satisfaction for in the midst the
rude turmoil they all retained a deep and rooted
respect for the offices the church in which they
had been educated silence was quickly obtained
and the boats moved on with greater order than
before
the spectacle was now striking in front rowed
the gondola which contained the remains the
dead the widening the canal as it approached
the port permitted the rays the moon to fall upon
the rigid features old antonio which were set in
such a look as might be supposed to characterize
the dying thoughts a man so suddenly and so
fearfully destroyed the carmelite bareheaded
with clasped hands and a devout heart bowed his
the bravo 
head at the feet the body with his white robes
flowing in the light the moon a single gondolier
guided the boat and no other noise was audible but
the plash the water as the oars slowly fell and
rose together this silent procession lasted a few
minutes and then the tremulous voice the monk
was heard chanting the prayers for the dead the
practised fishermen for lew in that disciplined
church and that obedient age were ignorant 
those solemn rites took up the responses in a manner
that must be familiar to every ear that has ever
listened to the sounds italy the gentle washing 
the element on which they glided forming a soft
accompaniment casement after casement opened
while they passed and a thousand curious and anxious
faces crowded the balconies as the funeral cortege
swept slowly on
the gondola the republic was towed in the
centre the moving mass by fifty lighter boats for
the fishermen still clung to their prize in this manner
the solemn procession entered the port and
touched the quay at the foot the piazzetta while
numberless eager hands were aiding in bringing the
body antonio to land there arose a shout from
the centre the ducal palace which proclaimed the
presence already the other part their body in
its court
the squares st mark now presented a novel
picture the quaint and oriental church the rows
 massive and rich architecture the giddy pile 
the campanile the columns granite the masts 
triumph and all those peculiar and remarkable fixtures
w r which had witnessed so many scenes violence
 rejoicing mourning and gaiety were
there like landmarks the earth defying time
beautiful and venerable in despite all those varying
exhibitions human passions that were daily
acted around them
 the bravo
but the song the laugh and the jest had ceased
the lights the coffeehouses had disappeared the
revellers had fled to their homes fearful being
confounded with those who braved the anger the
senate while the grotesque the balladsingers and
the buffoon had abandoned their assumed gaiety for
an appearance more in unison with the true feelings
 their hearts
giustizia cried a thousand deep voices as
the body antonio was borne into the court
illustrious doge giustizia in palazzo e pane in
piazza give us justice we are beggars for
justice
the gloomy but vast court was paved with the
swarthy faces and glittering eyes the fishermen
the corpse was laid at the foot the giant s stairs
while the trembling halberdier at the head the
flight scarce commanded himself sufficiently to
maintain that air firmness which was exacted
by disc ipline and professional pride but there was
no other show military force for the politic power
which ruled in venice knew too well its momentary
impotency to irritate when it could not quell
the mob beneath was composed nameless rioters
whose punishment could carry no other consequences
than the suppression immediate danger and for
that those who ruled were not prepared
the council three had been apprized the
arrival the excited fishermen when the mob
entered the court it was consulting in secret conclave
on the probabilities the tumult having a
graver and more determined object than was apparent
in the visible symptoms the routine 
office had not yet dispossessed the men already presented
to the reader their dangerous and despotic
power
are the dalmatians apprized this movement 
asked one the secret tribunal whose nerves were
the bravo 
scarcely equal to the high functions he discharged
we may have occasion for their volleys ere this
riot is appeased
confide in the ordinary authorities for that signore
answered the senator gradenigo i have
only concern lest some conspiracy which may
touch the fidelity the troops lies concealed beneath
the outcry
the evil passions man know no limits what
would the wretches have for a state in the decline
venice is to the last degree prosperous our ships
are thriving the bank flourishes with goodly dividends
 and i do assure you signore that for many
years i have not known so ample revenues for most
 our interests as at this hour all cannot thrive
alike
you are happily connected with flourishing affairs
signore but there are many that are less lucky
our form government is somewhat exclusive and
it is a penalty that we have ever paid for its advantages
to be liable to sudden and malevolent accusations
for any evil turn fortune that besets the
republic
can nothing satisfy these exacting spirits are
they not free are they not happy
it would seem that they want better assurance
 these facts than our own feelings or our words
man is the creature envy the poor desire
to be rich the weak powerful
there is an exception to your rule at least signore
since the rich rarely wish to be poor or the
powerful weak
you deride my sentiments tonight signor gras
i speak i hope as becomes a senator 
venice and in a manner that you are not unaccustomed
to hear
nay the language is not unusual but i fear
me there is something unsuited to a falling fortune
 the bravo
in the exacting and narrow spirit our laws
when a state is eminently flourishing its subjects
overlook general defects in private prosperity but
there is no more fastidious commentator on measures
than your merchant a failing trade
this is their gratitude have we not converted
these muddy isles into a mart for half christendom
and now they are dissatisfied that they cannot retain
all the monopolies that the wisdom our ancestors
has accumulated
they complain much in your own spirit signore
but you are right in saying the present riot
must be looked to let us seek his highness who
will go out to the people with such patricians as
may be present and one our number as a witness 
more than that might expose our character
the secret council withdrew to carry this resolution
into effect just as the fishermen in the court received
the accession those who arrived by water
there is no body so sensible an increase its
members as a mob without discipline and dependent
solely on animal force for its ascendency the
sentiment physical power is blended with its very
existence when they saw the mass living beings
which had assembled within the wall the ducal
palace the most audacious that throng became
more hardy and even the wavering grew strong
this is the reverse the feeling which prevails
among those who are called on to repress this species
 violence who generally gain courage as its exhibition
is least required
the throng in the court was raising one its
loudest and most menacing cries as the train the
doge appeared approaching by one the long open
galleries the principal floor the edifice
the presence the venerable man who nominally
presided over that factitious state and the long
training the fishermen in habits deference to
the bravo 
authority notwithstanding their present tone insubordination
caused a sudden and deep silence a
feeling awe gradually stole over the thousand dark
faces that were gazing upwards as the little cortege
drew near so profound indeed was the stillness
caused by this sentiment that the rustling 
the ducal robes w r as audible as the prince impeded
by his infirmities and consulting the state usual to his
rank slowly advanced the previous violence 
the untutored fishermen and their present deference
to the external state that met their eyes had its origin
in the same causes ignorance and habit were
the parents both
why are ye assembled here my children
asked the doge when he had reached the summit
 the giant s stairs and most all why have
ye come into the palace your prince with these
unbefitting cries 
the tremulous voice the old man was clearly
audible for the lowest its tones was scarcely interrupted
by a breath the fishermen gazed at
each other and all appeared to search for him w t ho
might be bold enough to answer at length one in
the centre the crowded mass and effectually concealed
from observation cried justice
such is our object mildly continued the prince 
and such i will add is our practice why are ye
assembled here in a manner so offensive to the state
and so disrespectful to your prince 
still none anew r red the only spirit their
body which had been capable freeing itself from
the trammels usage and prejudice had deserted
the shell which lay on the lower step the giant s
stairs
will none speak are ye so bold with your
voices when unquestioned and so silent when confronted

speak them fair your highness whispered he
sj
 the bravo
 the council who was commissioned to be a secret
witness the interview the dalmatians are
scarce yet apparelled
the prince bowed to advice which he well knew
must be respected and he assumed his former tone
if none will acquaint me with your wants i must
command you to retire and while my parental heart
grieves 
giustiza repeated the hidden member the
crowd
name thy wants that we may know them
highness deign to look at this 
one bolder than the rest had turned the body 
antonio to the moon in a manner to expose the
ghastly features and as he spoke he pointed towards
the spectacle he had prepared the prince
started at the unexpected sight and slowly descending
the steps closely accompanied by his companions
and his guards he paused over the body
has the assassin done this he asked after
looking at the dead fisherman and crossing himself
what could the one like this profit a bravo 
haply the unfortunate man hath fallen in a broil
 his class
neither illustrious doge we fear that antonio
has suffered for the displeasure st mark 
antonio is this the hardy fisherman who
would have taught us how to rule in the state regatta

eccellenza it is returned the simple laborer
 the lagunes and a better hand with a net ora
truer friend in need never rowed a gondola to
or from the lido diavalo it would have done
your highness pleasure to have seen the poor old
christian among us on a saint s day taking the
lead in our little ceremonies and teaching us the
manner in which our fathers used to do credit to
the craft
the bravo 
or to have been with us illustrious doge cried
another for the ice once broken the tongues a
mob soon grow bold in a merrymaking on the
lido when old antonio was always the foremost in
the laugh and the discreetly in knowing when to
be grave
the doge began to have a dawning the truth
and he cast a glance aside to examine the countenance
 the unknown inquisitor
it is far easier to understand the merits the
unfortunate man than the manner his death he
said finding no explanation in the drilled members
 the face he had scrutinized will any your
party explain the facts 
the principal speaker among the fishermen willingly
took on himself the office and in the desultory
manner one his habits he acquainted the
doge with the circumstances connected with the
finding the body when he had done the prince
again asked explanations with his eye from the senator
at his side for he was ignorant whether the
policy the state required an example or simply a
death
i see nothing in this your highness observed
he the council but the chances a fisherman
the unhappy old man has come to his by accident
and it would be charity to have a few masses
said for his soul
noble senator exclaimed the fisherman doubtingly
 st mark was offended
rumor tells many idle tales the pleasure and
displeasure st mark if we are to believe all
that the wit men can devise in affairs this nature
the criminals are not drowned in the lagunes
but in the canale orfano
true eccellenza and we are forbidden to cast
our nets there on pain sleeping with the eels at
its bottom
 the bravo
so much greater reason for believing that this
old man hath died by accident is there mark 
violence on his body for though the state could
scarcely occupy itself with such as he some other
might hath the condition the body been looked
to
eccellenza it was enough to cast one his
years into the centre the lagunes the stoutest
arm in venice could not save him
there may have been violence in some quarrel
and the proper authority should be vigilant here
is a carmelite father do you know aught 
this
the monk endeavored to answer but his voice
failed he stared wildly about him for the whole
scene resembled some frightful picture the imagination
and then folding his arms on his bosom he
appeared to resume his prayers
thou dost not answer friar observed the
doge w r ho had been as effectually deceived by the
natural and indifferent manner the inquisitor as
any other his auditors where didst thou find
this body
father anselmo briefly explained the manner in
which he had been pressed into the service the
fishermen
at the elbow the prince there stood a young
patrician who at the moment filled no other office
in the state than such as belonged to his birth deceived
like the others by the manner the only
one who knew the real cause antonio s death he
felt a humane and praiseworthy desire to make sure
that no foul play had been exercised towards the
victim
i have heard this antonio said this person
who was called the senator soranzo and who was
gifted by nature with feelings that in any other
form government would have made him a phithe
bravo 
lanthropist and his success in the regatta
was it not said that jacopo the bravo was his
competitor
a low meaning and common murmur ran through
the throng
a man his reputed passions and ferocity
may well have sought to revenge defeat by violence

a second and a louder murmur denoted the effect
this suggestion had produced
eccellenza jacopo deals in the stiletto observed
the halfcredulous but still doubting fisherman

that is as may be necessary a man his art
and character may have recourse to other means to
gratify his malice do you not agree with me signore

the senator soranzo put this question in perfect
good faith to the unknown member the secret
council the latter appeared struck with the probability
 the truth his companion s conjecture
but contented himself with a simple acknowledgment
to that effect by bowing
jacopo jacopo hoarsely repeated voice
after voice in the crowd jacopo has done this 
the best gondolier in venice has been beaten by an
old fisherman and nothing but blood could wipe out
the disgrace
it shall be inquired into my children and
strict justice done said the doge preparing to depart
 officers give money for masses that the soul
 the unhappy man be not the sufferer reverend
carmelite i commend the body to thy care and
thou canst do no better service than to pass the
night in prayer by its side
a thousand caps were waved in commendation
 this gracious command and the whole throng
stood in silent respect as the prince followed by his
vol ii k
 the bravo
retinue retired as he had approached through the
long vaulted gallery above
a secret order the inquisition prevented the
appearance the dalmatians
a few minutes later and all was prepared a
bier and canopy were brought out the adjoining
cathedral and the corpse was placed upon the
former father anselmo then headed the procession
which passed through the principal gate the
palace into the square chanting the usual service
the piazzetta and the piazza were still empty
here and there indeed a curious face belonging to
some agent the police or to some observer more
firm than common looked out from beneath the
arches the porticoes on tho movements the
mob though none ventured to come within its influence

but the fishermen were no longer bent on violence
with the fickleness men little influenced
by reflection and subject to sudden and violent
emotions a temperament which the effect a
selfish system is commonly tortured into the reason
why it should never be improved they had
abandoned all idea revenge on the agents the
police and had turned their thoughts to the religious
services which being commanded by the
prince himself were so flattering to their class
it is true that a few the sterner natures among
them mingled menaces against the bravo with
their prayers for the dead but these had no other
effect on the matter in hand than is commonly produced
by the byplayers on the principal action 
the piece
the great portal the venerable church was
thrown open and the solemn chant was heard issuing
in responses from among the quaint columns
and vaulted roofs within the body the lowly
and sacrificed antonio was borne beneath that arch
the bravo ill
which sustains the precious relics grecian art
and deposited in the nave candies glimmered before
the altar and around the ghastly person the
dead throughout the night and the cathedral 
st mark was pregnant with all the imposing ceremonials
 the catholic ritual until the day once
more appeared
priest succeeded priest in repeating the masses
while the attentive throng listened as if each its
members felt that his own honor and importance
were elevated by this concession to one their
number in the square the maskers gradually reappeared
though the alarm had been too sudden
and violent to admit a speedy return to the levity
which ordinarily was witnessed in that spot between
the setting and the rising the sun
chapter vii
tis a lady in her earliest youth
the very last that illustrious race
rogers
when the fishermen landed on the quay they deserted
the gondola the state to a man donna
violetta and her governess heard the tumultuous
departure their singular captors with alarm for
they were nearly in entire ignorance the motive
which had deprived them the protection father
anselmo and which had so unexpectedly made
them actors in the extraordinary scene the
monk had simply explained that his offices were
required in behalf the dead but the apprehension
 exciting unnecessary terror prevented him
from adding that they were in the power a mob
 the bravo
donna florinda however had ascertained sufficient
by looking from the windows the canopy
and from the cries those around her to get a
glimmering the truth under the circumstances
she saw that the most prudent course was to keep
themselves as much as possible from observation
but when the profound stillness that succeeded the
landing the rioters announced that they were
alone both she and her charge had an intuitive perception
 the favorable chance which fortune had
so strangely thrown in their way
they are gone whispered donna florinda
holding her breath in attention as soon as she had
spoken
and the police will be soon here to seek us 
no further explanation passed for venice was a
town in which even the young and innocent were
taught caution donna florinda stole another look
without
they have disappeared heaven knows where 
let us go
in an instant the trembling fugitives were on the
quay the piazzetta was without a human form
except their own a low murmuring sound arose
from the court palace which resembled the hum 
a disturbed hive but nothing was distinct or intelligible

there is violence meditated again whispered
the governess would to god that father anselmo
were here 
a shuffling footstep caught their ears and both
turned towards a boy in the dress one the
lagunes who approached from the direction the
broglio
a reverend carmelite bid me give you this
said the youth stealing a glance behind him like
one who dreaded detection then putting a small
piece paper in the hand donna florinda he
the bravo 
turned his own swarthy palm in which a small
silver coin glittered to the moon and vanished
by the aid the same light the governess succeeded
in tracing pencilmarks in a hand that had
been well known to her younger days
save thyself florinda there is not an instant
to lose avoid public places and seek a shelter
quickly
but whither asked the bewildered woman
when she had read aloud the scroll
anywhere but here rejoined donna violetta 
follow me
nature frequently more than supplies the advantages
 training and experience by her own gifts
had donna florinda been possessed the natural
decision and firmness her pupil she would not now
have been existing in the isolated condition which is
so little congenial to female habits nor would father
anselmo have been a monk both had sacrificed
inclination to what they considered to be duty and if
the ungenial life the governess was owing to the
tranquil course her ordinary feelings it is probable
that its impunity was to be ascribed to the same
respectable cause not so with violetta she was
ever more ready to act than to reflect and though
in general the advantage might possibly be with
those a more regulated temperament there are
occasions that form exceptions to the rule the
present moment was one those turns in the
chances life when it is always better to do anything
than to do nothing
donna violetta had scarcely spoken before her
person was shadowed beneath the arches the
broglio her governess clung to her side more in
affection than in compliance with the warning the
monk or with the dictates her own reason a
vaguci and romantic intention throwing herself at
the feet the doge who was a collateral descended

 the bravo
ant her own ancient house had flashed across
the mind the youthful bride when she first fled 
but no sooner had they reached the palace than a
cry from the court acquainted them with its situation
and consequently with the impossibility penetrating
to the interior
let us retire by the streets to thy dwelling my
child said donna florinda drawing her mantle
about her in womanly dignity none will offend
females our condition even the senate must in
the respect our sex
this from thee florinda thou who hast so
often trembled for their anger but go if thou wilt
i am no longer the senate s don camillo monforte
has my duty
donna florinda had no intention disputing this
point and as the moment had now arrived when the
most energetic was likely to lead she quietly submitted
herself to the superior decision her pupil
the latter took the way along the portico keeping
always within its shadows in passing the gateway
which opened towards the sea the fugitives had a
glimpse what was passing in the court the
sight quickened their steps and they now flew rather
than ran along the arched passage in a minute
they were on the bridge which crosses the canal 
st mark still flying with all their force a fewmariners
were looking from their feluccas and gazing
in curiosity but the sight two terrified females
seeking refuge from a mob had nothing in itself
likely to attract notice
at this moment a dark mass human bodies
appeared advancing along the quay in the opposite
direction arms glittered in the moonbeams and
the measured tread trained men became audible
the dalmatians were moving down from the arsenal
in a body advance and retreat now seemed equally
impossible to the breathless fugitives as decision
the bravo 
and selfpossession are very different qualities donna
violetta did not understand so readily as the circumstances
required that it was more than probable
the hirelings the republic would consider the flight
perfectly natural as it had appeared to the curious
gazers the port
terror made them blind and as shelter was now
the sole object the fugitives they would probably
have sought it in the chamber doom itself had
there been an opportunity as it was they turned
and entered the first and indeed the only gate which
offered they were met by a girl whose anxious
face betrayed that singular compound selfdevotion
and terror which probably has its rise in the instinct
 feminine sympathies
here is safety noble ladies said the youthful
venetian in the soft accent her native islands 
none will dare do you harm within these walls
into whose palace have i entered demanded
the halfbreathless violetta if its owner has a
name in venice he will not refuse hospitality to a
daughter tiepolo
signora you are welcome returned the gentle
girl curtsying low and still leading the way deeper
within the vast edifice you bear the name an
illustrious house
there are few in the republic note from
whom i may not claim either the kindness ancient
and near services or that kindred dost thou
serve a noble master
the first in venice lady
name him that we may demand his hospitality
as befits us
saint mark
donna violetta and her governess stopped short
have we unconsciously entered a portal the
palace
that were impossible lady since the canal lies
 the bravo
between you and the residence the doge still is
st mark master here i hope you wist not esteem
your safety less because it has been obtained in
the public prison and by the aid its keeper s
daughter
the moment for headlong decision was passed
and that reflection had returned
how art thou called child asked donna florida
moving ahead her pupil and taking the
discourse up where in wonder the other had permitted
it to pause we are truly grateful for the
readiness with which thou threw open the gate for
our admission in a moment such alarm how
art thou called
gelsomina answered the modest girl i am
the keeper s only child and when i saw ladies 
your honorable condition fleeing on the quay with
the dalmatians marching on one side and a mob
shouting on the other i bethought me that even a
prison might be welcome
thy goodness heart did not mislead thee
had i known it was a lady the tiepolo i
should have been even more ready for there are
few that great name now left to do us honor
violetta curtsied to the compliment but she
seemed uneasy that haste and pride rank had led
her so indiscreetly to betray herself
canst thou not lead us to some place less public
she asked observing that her conductor had stopped
in a public corridor to make this explanation
here you will be retired as in your own palaces
great ladies answered gelsomina turning into a
private passage and leading the way towards the
rooms her family from a window which she
had first witnessed the embarrassment her guests
none enter here without cause but my father and
myself and my father is much occupied with his
charge
the bravo 
hast thou no domestic 
none lady a prisonkeeper s daughter should
not be too proud to serve herself
thou sayest well one thy discretion good
gelsomiha must know it is not seemly for females
 condition to be thrown within walls like these
even by accident and thou wilt do us much favor
by taking more than common means to be certain
that we are unseen we give thee much trouble
but it shall not go unrequited here is gold
gelsomina did not answer but as she stood with
her eyes cast to the floor the color stole to her
cheeks until her usually bloodless face was in a soft
glow
nay i have mistaken thy character said donna
florinda secreting the sequins and taking the
unresisting hand the silent girl if i have
pained thee by my indiscretion attribute the offer
to our dread the disgrace being seen in this
place
the glow deepened and the lips the girl
quivered
is it then a disgrace to be innocently within these
walls lady she asked still with an averted eye
i have long suspected this but none has ever before
said it in my hearing 
holy maria pardon me if i have uttered a
syllable to pain thee excellent girl it has been unwittingly
and without intention 
we are poor lady and the needy must submit
to do that which their wishes might lead them to
avoid i understand your feelings and will make
sure your being secret and blessed maria will
pardon a greater sin than any you have committed
here
while the ladies were wondering at witnessing
such proofs delicacy and feeling in so singular a
place the girl withdrew
 the bravo
i had not expected this in a prison exclaimed
violetta
as all is not noble or just in a palace neither
is all to be condemned unheard that we find in a
prison but this is in sooth aa extraordinary girl
for her condition and we are indebted to blessed
st theodore crossing herself for putting her in
our way
can we do better than by making her a confidant
and a friend 
the governess was older and less disposed than
her pupil to confide in appearances but the more
ardent mind and superior rank the latter had
given her an influence that the former did not always
successfully resist gelsomina returned before
there was time to discuss the prudence what
violetta had proposed
thou hast a father gelsomina asked the venetian
heiress taking the hand the gentle girl as
she put her question
holy maria be praised i have still that happiness

it is a happiness for surely a father would not
have the heart to sell his own child to ambition and
mercenary hopes and thy mother 
has long been bedridden lady i believe we
should not have been here but we have no other
place so suitable for her sufferings as this jail
gelsomina thou art happier than i even in thy
prison i am fatherless motherless i could almost
say friendless
and this from a lady the tiepolo 
all is not as it seems in this evil world kind
gelsomina we have had many doges but we
have had much suffering thou mayest have heard
that the house which i come is reduced to a since
youthful girl like thyself who has been left in
e senate s charge
the bravo 
they speak little these matters lady in venice
 and all here none go so seldom into the
square as i still have i heard the beauty and
riches donna violetta the last i hope is true 
the first i now see is so
the daughter tiepolo colored in turn but it
was not in resentment
they have spoken in too much kindness for an
orphan she answered though that fatal wealth
is perhaps not overestimated thou knowest that
the state charges itself with the care and establishment
 all noble females whom providence has
left fatherless
lady i did not it is kind st mark to do it 
thou wilt think differently anon thou art
young gelsomina and hast passed thy time in privacy

true lady it is seldom i go farther than my
mother s room or the cell some suffering prisoner

violetta looked towards her governess with an
expression which seemed to say that she anticipated
her appeal would be made in vain to one so little
exposed to the feelings the world
thou wilt not understand then that a noble female
may have little inclination to comply with all
the senate s wishes in disposing her duties and
affections
gelsomina gazed at the fair speaker but it was
evident that she did not clearly comprehend the
question again violetta looked at the governess
as if asking aid
the duties our sex are often painful said
donna florinda understanding the appeal with
female instinct our attachments may not always
follow the wishes our friends we may not
choose but we cannot always obey
i have heard that noble ladies are not suffered to
 the bravo
see those to whom they are to be wedded signora
if that is what your eccellenza means and to me
the custom has always seemed unjust if not cruel
and are females thy class permitted to make
friends among those who may become dearer at
any other day asked violetta
lady we have that much freedom even in the
prisons
then art thou happier than those the palaces 
i will trust thee generous girl for thou canst not
be unfaithful to the weakness and wrongs thy
sex
gelsomina raised a hand as if to stop the impetuous
confidence her guest and then she listened
intently
few enter here she said but there are
many ways learning secrets within these walls
which are still unknown to me come deeper into
the rooms noble ladies for here is a place that i
have reason to think is safe even from listeners
the keeper s daughter led the way into the little
room in which she was accustomed to converse
with jacopo
you were saying lady that i had a feeling for
the weakness and helplessness our sex and
surely you did me justice
violetta had leisure to reflect an instant in passing
from one room to the other and she began her
communications with more reserve but the sensitive
interest that a being the gentle nature and
secluded habits gelsomina took in her narrative
won upon her own natural frankness and in a
manner nearly imperceptible to herself she made
the keeper s daughter mistress most the circumstances
under which she had entered the prison
the cheek gelsomina became colorless as
she listened and when donna violetta ceased
every limb her slight frame trembled with interest
the bravo 
the senate is a fearful power to resist she
said speaking so low as hardly to be audible
have you reflected lady on the chances what
you do
if i have not it is now too late to change my
intentions i am the wife the duke sant
agata and can never wed another
gest this is true and yet methinks i
would choose to die a nun rather than offend the
council
thou knowest not good girl to what courage
the heart even a young wife is equal thou art
still bound to thy father in the instruction and
habits childhood but thou mayest live to know
that all thy hopes will centre in another
gelsomina ceased to tremble and her mild eye
brightened
the council is terrible she answered but it
must be more terrible to desert one to whom you
have vowed duty and love at the altar 
hast thou the means concealing us kind
girl interrupted donna florinda and canst thou
when this tumult shall be quieted in any manner
help us to farther secrecy or flight 
lady i have none even the streets and
squares venice are nearly strangers to me 
maria what would i give to know the
ways the town as well as my cousin annina
who passes at will from her father s shop to the
lido and from st mark s to the rialto as her
pleasure suits i will send for my cousin who will
counsel us in this fearful strait 
thy cousin hast thou a cousin named an
nina
lady annina my mother s sister s child
the daughter a wineseller called tomaso
forti
do the noble dames the city take such heed
vol ii l
 the bravo
 their inferiors this will charm my cousin for
she has great desires to be noted by the great
and does thy cousin come hither 
rarely lady weare not much intimacy
i suppose annina finds a girl simple and uninstructed
as i unworthy her company but she will
not refuse to aid us in a danger like this i know
she little loves the republic for we have had words
on its acts and my cousin has been bolder 
speech about them than befits one her years in
this prison
gelsomina thy cousin is a secret agent the
police and unworthy thy confidence 
lady
i do not speak without reason trust me she
is employed in duties that are unbecoming her sex
and unworthy thy confidence
noble dames i will not say any thing to do displeasure
to your high rank and present distress but
you should not urge me to think thus my mother
s niece you have been unhappy and you
may have cause to dislike the republic and you are
safe here but i do not desire to hear annina censured

both donna florinda and her less experienced
pupil knew enough human nature to consider
this generous incredulity as a favorable sign the
integrity her who manifested it and they wisely
contented themselves with stipulating that annina
should on no account be made acquainted with
their situation after this understanding the three
discussed more leisurely the prospect the fugitives
being able to quit the place when ready without
detection
at the suggestion the governess a servitor 
the prison was sent out by gelsomina to observe
the state the square he was particularly
charged though in a manner to avoid suspicion to
the bravo 
search for a carmelite the order the barefooted
friars on his return the menial reported
that the mob had quitted the court the palace
and was gone to the cathedral with the body 
the fisherman who had so unexpectedly gained the
prize in the regatta the preceding day
repeat your aves and go to sleep bella gelso
mina concluded the subkeeper for the fishermen
have left off shouting to say their prayers per
diana the bareheaded and barelegged rascals
are as impudent as if st mark were their inheritance
the noble patricians should give them a
lesson in modesty by sending every tenth knave
among them to the galleys miscreants to disturb
the quiet an orderly town with their vulgar complaints
 
but thou hast said nothing the friar is he
with the rioters
there is a carmelite at the altar but my blood
boiled at seeing such vagabonds disturb the peace
 respectable persons and i took little note his
air or years
then thou failed to do the errand on which i
sent thee it is now too late to repair thy fault
thou canst return to thy charge
a million pardons bellissima gelsomina but indignation
is the uppermost feeling when one in office
sees his rights attacked by the multitude send me
to corfu or to candia if you please and i will bring
back the color every stone in their prisons but
do not send me among rebels my gorge rises at
the sight villany
as the keeper s daughter withdrew while her
father s assistant was making this protestation 
loyalty the latter was compelled to give vent to the
rest his indignation in a soliloquy
one the tendencies oppression is to create
a scale tyranny descending from those who rule
 the bravo
a state to those who domineer over a single individual
he who has been much accustomed to
view men need not be told that none are so arrogant
with their inferiors as those who are oppressed by
their superiors for poor human nature has a secret
longing to revenge itself on the weak for all the injuries
it receives from the strong on the other
hand no class is so willing to render that deference
when unexpected which is the proper meed virtue
and experience and intelligence as he who knows
that he is fortified on every side against innovations
on his natural rights thus it is that there is more
security against popular violence and popular insults
in these free states than in any other country on
earth for there is scarcely a citizen so debased as
not to feel that in assuming the appearance a wish
to revenge the chances fortune he is making an
undue admission inferiority
though the torrent may be pent and dammed by
art it is with the constant hazard breaking down
the unnatural barriers but left to its own course it
will become the tranquil and the deep stream until
it finally throws off its superfluous waters into the
common receptacle the ocean
when gelsomina returned to her visitors it was
with a report favorable to their tranquillity the
riot in the court the palace and the movement 
the dalmatians had drawn all eyes in another direction
and although some errant gaze might have
witnessed their entrance into the gate the prison
it was so natural a circumstance that no one would
suspect females their appearance remaining
there an instant longer than was necessary the
momentary absence the few servants the prison
who took little heed those who entered the
open parts the building and who had been drawn
away by curiosity completed their security the
humble room they were in was exclusively devoted
the bravo 
to the use their gentle protector and there was
scarcely a possibility interruption until the council
had obtained the leisure and the means making
use those terrible means which rarely left anything
it wished to know concealed
with this explanation donna violetta and her
companion were greatly satisfied it left them
leisure to devise means for their flight and kindled
a hope in the former being speedily restored to
don camillo still there existed the cruel embarrassment
 not possessing the means acquainting
the latter with their situation as the tumult ceased
they resolved to seek a boat favored by such disguises
as the means gelsomina could supply and
to row to his palace but reflection convinced donna
florinda the danger such a step since the
neapolitan was known to be surrounded by the
agents the police accident which is more effectual
than stratagem in defeating intrigues had
thrown them into a place momentary security
and it would be to lose the vantageground their
situation to cast themselves without the utmost
caution into the hazards the public canals
at length the governess bethought her turning
the services the gentle creature who had already
shown so much sympathy in their behalf to account
during the revelations her pupil the feminine
instinct donna florinda had enabled her to discover
the secret springs which moved the unpractised
feelings their auditor gelsomina had listened
to the manner in which don camillo had thrown
himself into the canal to save the life violetta
with breathless admiration her countenance was a
pure reflection her thoughts when the daughter
 tiepolo spoke the risks he had run to gain her
love and woman glowed in every lineament her
mild face when the youthful bride touched on the
nature the engrossing tie which had united them
l 
 the bravo
and which was far too holy to be severed by the
senate s policy
if we had the means getting our situation
to the ears don camillo said the governess all
might yet be saved else will this happy refuge in
the prison avail us nothing
is the cavalier too stout a heart to shrink before
those up above demanded gelsomina
he would summon the people his confidence
and ere the dawn day we might still be beyond
their power those calculating senators will deal
with the vows my pupil as if they were childish
oaths and set the anger the holy see itself at
defiance when there is question their interest
but the sacrament marriage is not man 
that at least they will respect
believe it not there is no obligation so solemn
as to be respected when their policy is concerned
what are the wishes a girl or what the happiness
 a solitary and helpless female to their fortunes
 that my charge is young is a reason why
their wisdom should interfere though it is none to
touch their hearts with the reflection that the misery
to which they would condemn her is to last the
longer they take no account the solemn obligations
 gratitude the ties affection are so
many means working upon the fears those
they rule but none for forbearance and they laugh
at the devotedness woman s love as a folly to
amuse their leisure or to take off the edge disappointment
in graver concerns
can any thing be more grave than wedlock
lady
to them it is important as it furnishes the
means perpetuating their honors and their proud
names beyond this the councils look little at domestic
interests
they are fathers and husbands 
the bravo 
true for to be legally the first they must become
the last marriage to them is not a tie 
sacred and dear affinity but the means increasing
their riches and sustaining their names
continued the governess watching the effect her
words on the countenance the guileless girl
they call marriages affection children s games
and they deal with the wishes their own daughters
as they would traffic with their commodities
 commerce when a state sets up an idol 
gold as its god few will refuse to sacrifice at its
altar
i would i might serve the noble donna violent

thou art too young good gelsomina and i fear
too little practised in the cunning venice
doubt me not lady for i can do my duty like
another in a good cause
if it were possible to convey to don camillo
monforte a knowledge our situation but thou art
too inexperienced for the service 
believe it not signora interrupted the generous
gelsomina whose pride began to stimulate her natural
sympathies with one so near her own age and
one too like herself subject to that passion which
engrosses a female heart i may be apter than
my appearance would give reason to think
i will trust thee kind girl and if the sainted
virgin protects us thy fortunes shall not be forgotten

the pious gelsomina crossed herself and first
acquainting her companions with her intentions she
went within to prepare herself while donna florinda
penned a note in terms so guarded as to defy
detection in the event accident but which might
suffice to let the lord st agata understand their
present situation
in a few minutes the keeper s daughter reappears
the bravo
ed her ordinary attire which was that a
modest venetian maiden humble condition needed
no concealment and the mask an article 
dress which none in that city were without effectually
disguised her features she then received the
note with the name the street and the palace
she was to seek a description the person the
neapolitan with oftenrepeated cautions to be wary
and departed
chapter viii
which is the wiser here justice or iniquity
measure for measure
in the constant struggle between the innocent and
the artful the latter have the advantage so long as
they confine themselves to familiar interests but
the moment the former conquer their disgust for the
study vice and throw themselves upon the protection
 their own high principles they are far
more effectually concealed from the calculations 
their adversaries than if they practised the most
refined their subtle expedients nature has given
to every man enough frailty to enable him to estimate
the workings selfishness and fraud but her
truly privileged are those who can shroud their motives
and intentions in a degree justice and disinterestedness
which surpass the calculations the
designing millions may bow to the commands 
a conventional right but few indeed are they who
know how to choose in novel and difficult cases
there is often a mystery in virtue while the cunning
 vice is no more than a pitiful imitation 
the bravo 
that art which endeavors to cloke its workings in
the thin veil deception the other in some degree
resembles the sublimity infallible truth
thus men too much practised in the interests 
life constantly overreach themselves when brought
in contact with the simple and intelligent and the
experience every day proves that as there is no
fame permanent which is not founded on virtue so
there is no policy secure which is not bottomed on
the good the whole vulgar minds may control
the concerns a community so long as they are
limited to vulgar views but woe to the people
who confide on great emergencies in any but the
honest the noble the wise and the philanthropic 
for there is no security for success when the meanly
artful control the occasional and providential
events which regenerate a nation more than half
the misery which has defeated as well as disgraced
civilization proceeds from neglecting to use those
great men that are always created by great occasions

treating as we are the vices the venetian
system our pen has run truant with its subject
since the application the moral must be made on
the familiar scale suited to the incidents our story
it has already been seen that gelsomina was intrusted
with certain important keys the prison
for this trust there had been sufficient motive with
the wily guardians the jail who had made their
calculations on her serving their particular orders
without ever suspecting that she was capable so
tar listening to the promptings a generous temper
as might induce her to use them in any manner
prejudicial to their own views the service to
which they were now to be applied proved that the
keepers one which was her own father had not
fully known how to estimate the powers the innocent
and simple
 the bravo
provided with the keys in question gelsomina
took a lamp and passed upward from the mezzinino
in which she dwelt to the first floor the edifice
instead descending to its court door was opened
after door and many a gloomy corridor was
passed by the gentle girl with the confidence one
who knew her motive to be good she soon crossed
the bridge sighs fearless interruption in that
unfrequented gallery and entered the palace here
she made her way to a door that opened on the
common and public dormitories the structure
moving with sufficient care to make impunity from
detection sure she extinguished the light and applied
the key at the next instant she was on the
vast and gloomy stairway it required but a moment
to descend it and to reach the covered gallery
which surrounded the court a halberdier was
within a few feet her he looked at the unknown
female with interest but as it was not his business
to question those who issued from the building nothing
was said gelsomina walked on a halfre
panting but vindictive being was dropping an accusation
in the lion s mouth gelsomina stopped
involuntarily until the secret accuser had done his
treacherous work and departed then when she
was about to proceed she saw that the halberdier
at the head the giant s stairway was smiling at
her indecision like one accustomed to such scenes
is there danger in quitting the palace she
asked the rough mountaineer
corpo di bacco there might have been an
hour since bella donna but the rioters are must
sled and at their prayers 
gelsomina hesitated no longer she descended
the wellknow t n flight down which the head fapiero
had rolled and was soon beneath the arch 
the gate here the timid and unpractised girl again
stopped for she could not venture into the square
the bravo 
without assuring herself like a deer about to quit its
cover the tranquillity the place into which she
was to enter
the agents the police had been too much
alarmed by the rising the fishermen not to call
their usual ingenuity and finesse into play the moment
the disturbance was appeased money had
been given to the mountebanks and balladsingers to
induce them to reappear and groups hirelings
some in masks and others without concealment
were ostentatiously assembled in different parts 
the piazza in short those usual expedients were
resorted to which are constantly used to restore the
confidence a people in those countries in which
civilization is so new that they are not yet considered
sufficiently advanced to be the guardians 
their own security there are few artifices so shallow
that many will not be their dupes the idler the
curious the really discontented the factious the designing
with a suitable mixture the unthinking
and those who only live for the pleasure the
passing hour a class not the least insignificant for
numbers had lent themselves to the views the police
 and when gelsomina was ready to enter the
piazzetta she found both the squares partially filled
a few excited fishermen clustered about the doors
 the cathedral like bees swarming before their
hive but on that side there was no very visible
cause alarm unaccustomed as she was to scenes
like that before her the first glance assured the gentle
girl the real privacy which so singularly distinguishes
the solitude a crowd gathering her
simple mantle more closely about her form and settling
her mask with care she moved with a swift
step into the centre the piazza
we shall not detail the progress our heroine
as avoiding the commonplace gallantry that assailed
and offended her ear she went her way on her
 the bravo
errand kindness young active and impelled by
her intentions the square was soon passed and she
reached the place san nice here was one 
the landings the public gondolas but at the moment
there was no boat in waiting for curiosity or
fear had induced the men to quit their usual stand
gelsomina had ascended the bridge and was on the
crown its arch when a gondolier came sweeping
lazily in from the direction the grand canal
her hesitation and doubting manner attracted his
attention and the maw made the customary sign
which conveyed the offer his services as she
was nearly a stranger to the streets venice labyrinths
that offer greater embarrassment to the uninitiated
than perhaps the passages any other
town its size she gladly availed herself the
offer to descend to the steps to leap into the
boat to utter the word rialto and to conceal
herself in the pavilion was the business a minute
the boat was instantly in motion
gelsomina now believed herself secure effecting
her purpose since there was little to apprehend
from the knowledge or the designs a common
boatman he could not know her object and it
was his interest to carry her in safety to the place
she had commanded but so important was success
that she could not feel secure attaining it
while it was still unaccomplished she soon summoned
sufficient resolution to look out at the palaces
and boats they were passing and she felt the refreshing
air the canal revive her courage then
turning with sensitive distrust to examine the
countenance the gondolier she saw that his features
were concealed beneath a mask that was so
well designed as not to be perceptible to a casual
observer by moonlight
though it was common on occasions for the
servants the great it was not usual for the public
the bravo 
gondoliers to be disguised the circumstance itself
was one justly to excite slight apprehension though
on second thoughts gelsomina saw no more in it
than a return from some expedition pleasure or
some serenade perhaps in which the caution a
lover had compelled his followers to resort to this
species concealment
shall i put you on the public quay signora
demanded the gondolier or shall i see you to the
gate your own palace
the heart gelsomina peat high she liked the
tone the voice though it was necessarily smothered
by the mask but she was little accustomed to
act in the affairs others and less still in any so
great interest that the sounds caused her to tremble
like one less worthily employed
dost thou know the palace a certain don
camillo monforte a lord calabria who dwells
here in venice she asked after a moment s pause
the gondolier sensibly betrayed surprise by the
manner in which he started at the question
would you be rowed there lady
if thou art certain knowing the palazzo
the water stirred and the gondola glided between
high walls gelsomina knew by the sound that they
were in one the smaller canals and she augured
well the boatman s knowledge the town they
soon stopped by the side a watergate and the
man appeared on the step holding an arm to aid
her in ascending after the manner people his
craft gelsomina bade him wait her return and
proceeded
there was a marked derangement in the household
 don camillo that one more practised than
our heroine would have noted the servants seemed
undecided in the manner performing the most
ordinary duties their looks wandered distrustfully
from one to the other and when their halffrightened
vol ii m
 the bravo
visitor entered the vestibule though all arose none
advanced to meet her a female masked was not a
rare sight in venice for few that sex went upon
the canals without using the customary means 
concealment but it would seem by their hesitating
manner that the menials don camillo did not
view the entrance her who now appeared with
the usual indifference
i am in the dwelling the duke st agata
a signore calabria demanded gelsomina who
saw the necessity being firm
signora si 
is your lord in the palace 
signora he is and he is not what beautiful
lady shall i tell him does him this honor 
if he be not at home it will not be necessary to
tell him any thing if he is i could wish to see him
the domestics whom there were several put
their heads together and seemed to dispute on the
propriety receiving the visit at this instant a
gondolier in a flowered jacket entered the vestibule
gelsomina took courage at his goodnatured eye and
frank manner
do you serve don camillo monforte she asked
as he passed her on his way to the canal
with the oar bellissima donna answered
gino touching his cap though scarce looking aside
at the question
and could he be told that a female wishes
earnestly to speak to him in private a female
santa maria bella donna there is no to
females who come on these errands in venice you
might better pay a visit to the statue san theodore
in the piazza than see my master at this moment 
the stone will give you the better reception
and this he commands you to tell all my sex
who come 
diavolo lady you are particular in your
the bravo 
questions perhaps my master might on a strait
receive one the sex i could name but on the
honor a gondolier he is not the most gallant
cavalier venice just at this moment
if there is one to whom he would pay this deference
you are bold for a servitor how know you
i am not that one
gino started he examined the figure the applicant
and lifting his cap he bowed
lady i do not know any thing about it he said 
you may be his highness the doge or the ambassador
 the emperor i pretend to know nothing
in venice late 
the words gino were cut short by a tap on
the shoulder from the public gondolier who had
hastily entered the vestibule the man whispered
in the ear don camillo s servitor
this is riot a moment to refuse any he said
let the stranger go up
gino hesitated no longer with the decision a
favored menial he pushed the groom the chambers
aside and offered to conduct gelsomina himself
to the presence his master as they ascended
the stairs three the inferior servants disappeared
the palace don camiho had an air more
than venetian gloom the rooms were dimly
lighted many the walls had been stripped the
most precious their pictures and in other respects
a jealous eye might have detected evidence
 a secret intention on the part its owner not
to make a permanent residence the dwelling
but these were particulars that gelsomina did not
note as she followed gino through the apartments
into the more private parts the building here
the gondolier unlocked a door and regarding his
companion with an air halfdoubting halfrespect
ful he made a sign for her to enter
my master commonly receives the ladies here
 the bravo
he said enter eccellenza while i run to tell him
 his happiness
gelsomina did not hesitate though she felt a violent
throb at the heart when she heard the key
turning in the lock behind her she was in an antechamber
and inferring from the light which shone
through the door an adjoining room that she
was to proceed she went on no sooner had she
entered the little closet than she found herself alone
with one her own sex
annina burst from the lips the unpractised
prisongirl under the impulse surprise
gelsomina the simple quiet whispering
modest gelsomina returned the other
the words annina admitted but one construction
wounded like the bruised sensitive plant
gelsomina withdrew her mask for air actually
gasping for breath between offended pride and
wonder
thou here she added scarce knowing what
she uttered
thou here repeated annina with such a
laugh as escapes the degraded when they believe
the innocent reduced to their own level
nay i come on an errand pity
santa maria we are both here with the same

annina i know not what thou would st say 
this is surely the palace don camillo monforte 
a noble neapolitan who urges claims to the honors
 the senate
the gayest the handsomest the richest and
the most inconstant cavalier in venice hadst thou
been here a thousand times thou could st not be
better informed 
gelsomina listened in horror her artful cousin
who knew her character to the full extent that vice
can comprehend innocence watched her colorless
the bravo 
cheek and contracting eye with secret triumph
at the first moment she had believed all that she
insinuated but second thoughts and a view the
visible distress the frightened girl gave a new
direction to her suspicions
but i tell thee nothing new she quickly added
i only regret thou should st find me where no
doubt you expected to meet the duca di sans
agata himself
annina this from thee 
thou surely didst not come to his palace to
seek thy cousin 
gelsomina had long been familiar with grief but
until this moment she had never felt the deep humiliation
 shame tears started from her eyes and
she sunk back into a seat in utter inability to stand
i would not distress thee out bearing added
the artful daughter the wineseller but that
we are both in the closet the gayest cavalier 
venice is beyond dispute
i have told thee that pity for another brought
me hither
pity for don camillo
for a noble lady a young a virtuous and a
beautiful wife a daughter the tiepolo the
tiepolo annina 
why should a lady the tiepolo employ a
girl the public prisons 
why because there has been injustice by
those up above there has been a tumult among
the fishermen arid the lady with her governess
were liberated by the rioters and his highness
spoke to them in the great court and the dalmatians
were on the quay and the prison was a refuge
for ladies their quality in a moment so
great terror and the holy church itself has blessed
their love 
gelsomina could utter no more but breathless with
m
 the bravo
the wish to vindicate herself and wounded to the
soul by the strange embarrassment her situation
she sobbed aloud incoherent as had been her language
she had said enough to remove every doubt
from the mind annina privy to the secret marriage
to the rising the fishermen and to the departure
 the ladies from the convent on a distant
island where they had been carried on quitting
their own palace the preceding night and whither
she had been compelled to conduct don camillo
who had ascertained the departure those he
sought without discovering their destination the
daughter the wineseller readily comprehended
not only the errand her cousin but the precise
situation the fugitives
and thou believes this fiction gelsomina 
she said affecting pity for her cousin s credulity
the characters thy pretended daughter tiepolo
and her governess are no secrets to those who
frequent the piazza san marco
hadst thou seen the beauty and innocence 
the lady annina thou would st not say this 
blessed san theodore what is more beautiful
than vice tis the cheapest artifice the devil
to deceive frail sinners this thou hast heard 
thy confessor gelsomina or he is much lighter
discourse than mine
but why should a woman this life enter the
prisons 
they had good reasons to dread the dalmatians
no doubt but it is in my power to tell thee
more these thou hast entertained with such
peril to thine own reputation there are women
in venice who discredit their sex in various ways
and these more particularly she who calls herself
florinda is notorious for her agency in robbing st
mark his revenue she has received a largess
from the neapolitan wanes grown on his galathe
bravo 
brian mountains and wishing to tamper with my
honesty she offered the liquor to me expecting one
like me to forget my duty and to aid her in deceiving
the republic
can this be true annina 
why should i deceive thee are we not sister
s children and though affairs on the lido keep
me much from thy company is not the love between
us natural i complained to the authorities
and the liquors were seized and the pretended noble
ladies were obliged to hide themselves this very
day tis thought they wish to flee the city with
their profligate neapolitan driven to take shelter
they have sent thee to acquaint him with their
hidingplace in order that he may come to their
aid
and why art thou here annina 
i marvel that thou didst not put the question
sooner gino the gondolier don camillo has
long been an unfavorable suitor mine and when
this florinda complained my having what every
honest girl in venice should do exposed her fraud
to the authorities he advised his master to seize me
partly in revenge and partly with the vain hope 
making me retract the complaint i have made thou
hast heard the bold violence these cavaliers
when thwarted in their wills
annina then related the manner her seizure
with sufficient exactitude merely concealing those
facts that it was not her interest to reveal
but there is a lady the tiepolo annina 
as sure as there are cousins like ourselves
santa madre di dio that women so treacherous
and so bold should have met one thy innocence 
it would have been better had they fallen in with
me who am too ignorant for their cunning blessed
st anna knows but who has not to learn their
true characters
 the bravo
they did speak thee annina 
the glance which the wineseller s daughter
threw at her cousin was such as the treacherous
serpent casts at the bird but preserving her selfpossession
she added
not to my favor it would sicken me to hear
words favor from such as they
they are not thy friends annina
 perhaps they told thee child that i was in the
employment the council
indeed they did
no wonder your dishonest people can never
believe one can do an act pure conscience
but here comes the neapolitan note the libertine
gelsomina and thou wilt feel for him the same disgust
as i
time door opened and don camillo monforte entered
there was an appearance distrust in his
manner which proved that he did not expect to
meet his bride gelsomina arose and though bewildered
by the tale her cousin and her own
previous impressions she stood resembling a meek
statue modesty awaiting his approach the
neapolitan was evidently struck by her beauty and
the simplicity her air but his brow was fixed
like that a man who had steeled his feelings
against deceit
thou would st see me he said
i had that wish noble signore but annina 
seeing another thy mind hath changed
signore it has
don camillo looked at her earnestly and with
manly regret
thou art young for thy vocation here is gold
retire as thou earnest but hold dost thou know
this annina
she is my mother s sister s daughter noble
duca
the bravo 
per diana a worthy sisterhood depart together
for i have no need either but mark
me and as he spoke don camillo took annina by
the arm and led her aside when he continued with
a low but menacing voice thou see st i am to
be feared as well as thy councils thou canst not
cross the threshold thy father without my knowledge
if prudent thou wilt teach thy tongue discretion
do as thou wilt i fear thee not but remember
prudence
annina made an humble reverence as if in acknowledgment
 the wisdom his advice and taking
the arm her halfunconscious cousin she again
curtsied and hurried from the room as the presence
 their master in his closet was known to
them none the menials presumed to stop those
who issued from the privileged room gelsomina
who was even more impatient than her wily companion
to escape from a place she believed polluted
was nearly breathless when she reached the gondola
its owner was in waiting on the steps and
in a moment the boat whirled away from a spot
which both those it contained were though for
reasons so very different glad to quit
gelsomina had forgotten her mask in her hurry 
and the gondola was no sooner in the great canal
than she put her face at the window the pavilion
in quest trie evening air the rays the moon
fell upon her guileless eye and a cheek that was
now glowing partly with offended pride and partly
with joy at her escape from a situation she felt
to be so degrading her forehead was touched
with a finger and turning she saw the gondolier
making a sign caution he then slowly lifted
his mask
carlo had half burst from her lips but another
sign suppressed the cry
gelsomina withdrew her head and after her
 the bravo
beating heart had ceased to throb she bowed her
face and murmured thanksgivings at finding herself
at such a moment under the protection one who
possessed all her confidence
the gondolier asked no orders for his direction
the boat moved on taking the direction the port
which appeared perfectly natural to the two females
annina supposed it was returning to the square
the place she would have sought had she been alone
and gelsomina who believed that he whom she
called carlo toiled regularly as a gondolier for support
fancied course that he was taking her to
her ordinary residence
but though the innocent can endure the scorn 
the world it is hard indeed to be suspected by those
they love all that annina had told her the
character don camillo and his associates came
gradually across the mind the gentle gelsomina
and she felt the blood creeping to her temples as she
saw the construction her lover might put on her
conduct a dozen times did the artless girl satisfy
herself with saying inwardly he knows me and
will believe the best and as often did her feelings
prompt her to tell the truth suspense is far more
painful at such moments than even vindication
which in itself is a humiliating duty to the virtuous
pretending a desire to breathe the air she left her
cousin in the canopy annina was net sorry to be
alone for she had need to reflect on all the windings
 the sinuous path on which she had entered
gelsomina succeeded in passing the pavilion and
in gaining the side the gondolier
carlo she said observing that he continued
to row in silence
gelsomina
thou hast not questioned me 
i know thy treacherous cousin and can believe
the bravo 
thou art her dupe the moment to learn the truth
will come
thou didst not know me carlo when i called
thee from the bridge
i did not any fare that would occupy my time
was welcome
why dost thou call annina treacherous
because venice does not hold a more wily heart
or a falser tongue
gelsomina remembered the warning donna
florinda possessed the advantage blood and
that reliance which the inexperienced always place
in the integrity their friends until exposure comes
to destroy the illusion annina had found it easy to
persuade her cousin the unworthiness her
guests but here was one who had all her sympathies
who openly denounced annina herself in
such a dilemma the bewildered girl did what nature
and her feelings suggested she recounted in a low
but rapid voice the incidents the evening and
annina s construction the conduct the females
whom she had left behind in the prison
jacopo listened so intently that his oar dragged in
the water
enough he said when gelsomina blushing
with her own earnestness to stand exculpated in his
eyes had done i understand it all distrust thy
cousin for the senate itself is not more false
the pretended carlo spoke cautiously but in a
firm voice gelsomina took his meaning though
wondering at what she heard and returned to an
nina within the gondola proceeded as if nothing
had occurred
 the bravo

i could be merry now hubert i love thee

jacopo was deeply practised in the windings 
venetian deceit he knew how unceasingly the
eyes the councils through their agents were on
the movements those in whom they took an interest
and he was far from feeling all the advantage
circumstances had seemingly thrown in his way
annina was certainly in his power and it was not
possible that she had yet communicated the intelligence
derived from gelsomina to any her employers
but a gesture a look in passing the prisongates
the appearance dress or an exclamation
might give the alarm to some one the thousand
spies the police the disposal annina s person
in some place safety therefore became the first
and the most material act to return to the palace
 don camillo would be to go into the midst the
hirelings the senate and although the neapolitan
relying on his rank and influence had preferred this
step when little importance was attached to the detention
 the girl and when all she knew had been
revealed the case w r as altered now that she might
become the connecting link in the information necessary
to enable the officers to find the fugitives
the gondola moved on palace after palace was
passed and the impatient annina thrust her head
from a window to note its progress they came
among the shipping the port and her uneasiness
sensibly increased making a pretext similar to that
 gelsomina the wineseller s daughter quitted the
pavilion to steal to the side the gondolier
the bravo 
i would be landed quickly at the watergate 
the doge s palace she said slipping a piece silver
into the hand the boatman
you shall be served bella donna but diamine
 i marvel that a girl thy wit should not
scent the treasures in yonder felucca 
dost thou mean the serpentine 
what other padrone brings as wellflavored
liquors within the lido quiet thy impatience toland
daughter honest old ma so and traffic with
the padrone for the comfort us the canals
how thou knowest me then 
to be the pretty wineseller the lido corpo

why art thou masked thou canst not be

it is little matter whether i am called luigi or
enrico or giorgio i am thy customer and honor
the shortest hair thy eyebrows thou knowest
annina that the young patricians have their frolics
and they swear us gondoliers to keep secret till all
danger detection is over were any impertinent
eyes following me i might be questioned as to the
manner having passed the earlier hours
methinks it would be better to have given thee
gold and to have sent thee at once to thy home
to be followed like a denounced hebrew to my
door when i have confounded my boat with a
thousand others it will be time to uncover wilt
thou to the bella sorrentina 
nay tis not necessary to ask since thou takes
the direction thine own will 
the gondolier laughed and nodded his head as
if he would give his companion to understand that
he was master her secret wishes annina was
hesitating in what manner she should make him
vol ii n
 the bravo
change his purpose when the gondola touched the
felucca s side
we will go up and speak to the padrone
whispered jacopo
it is no avail he is without liquors
trust him not i know the man and his pretences

thou forgettest my cousin
she is an innocent and unsuspecting child
jacopo lifted annina as he spoke on the deck
 the bella sorrentina in a manner between gallantry
and force and leaped after her without
pausing suffering her to rally her thoughts heled
her to the cabin stairs which she descended
wondering at his conduct but determined not to
betray her own secret wrongs on the customs to a
stranger
stefano milanoo was asleep in a sail on deck a
touch aroused him and a sign gave him to understand
that the imaginary roderigo stood before
him
a thousand pardons signore said the gaping
mariner is the freight come 
in part only i have brought thee a certain
annina forti the daughter old commas forti
a wineseller the lido
santa madre does the senate think it necessary
to send one like her from the city in secret 
it does and it lays great stress on her detention
i have come hither with her without suspicion
 my object and she has been prevailed on to
enter thy cabin under a pretence some secret
dealings in wines according to our former understanding
it will be thy business to make sure her
presence
that is easily done returned stefano stepping
forward and closing the cabindoor which he secured
by a bolt she is alone now with the
the bravo 
image our lady and a better occasion to repeat
her aves cannot offer
this is well if thou canst keep her so it is
now time to lift thy anchors and to go beyond the
tiers the vessels with the felucca
signore there wants but five minutes for that
duty since we are ready
then perform it in all speed for much depends
on the management this delicate duty i will be
with thee anon hearkee master stefano take
heed thy prisoner for the senate makes great
account her security
the calabriann made such a gesture as one initiated
uses when he would express a confidence in
his own shrewdness while the pretended roderigo
reentered his gondola stefano began to awaken
his people as the gondola entered the canal 
san marco the sails the felucca fell and the low
calabriann vessel stole along the tiers towards the
clear water beyond
the boat quickly touched the steps the watergate
 the palace gelsomina entered the arch
and glided up the giant s stairway the route by
which she had quitted the palace the halberdier
w r as the same that watched as she went out he
spoke to her in gallantry but offered no impediment
to her entrance
haste noble ladies hasten for the love the
holy virgin exclaimed gelsomina as she burst
into the room in which donna violetta and her
companion awaited her appearance i have endangered
your liberty by my weakness and there
is not a moment to lose follow while you may
nor stop to whisper even a prayer
thou art hurried and breathless returned
donna florinda hast thou seen the duca di
sant agata
nay question me not but follow noble dames
 the bravo
gelsomina seized the lamp and casting a glance
that appealed strongly to her visitors for tacit compliance
she led the way into the corridors it is
scarcely necessary to say that she was followed
the prison was left in safety the bridge 
sighs was passed for it will be remembered that
gelsomina was still mistress the keys and the
party went swiftly by the great stairs the palace
into the open gallery no obstruction was offered to
their progress and they all descended to the court
with the quiet demeanor females who went out
on their ordinary affairs
jacopo awaited at the watergate in less than a
minute he was driving his gondola across the port
following the course the felucca whose white
sail was visible in the moonlight now bellying in
the breeze and now flapping as the mariners
checked her speed gelsomina watched their progress
for a moment in breathless interest and then
she crossed the bridge the quay and entered the
prison by its public gate
hast thou made sure the old maso s daughter
demanded jacopo on reaching the deck 
the bella sorrentina again
she is like shifting ballast master roderigo 
first on one side the cabin and then on the
other but you see the bolt is undrawn
tis well here is more thy freight thou
hast the proper passes for the galley the guard 
all is in excellent order signore when was
stefano milanoo out rule in a matter haste 
diamine let the breeze come and though the
senate should wish us back again it might send all
its spirri after us in vain
excellent stefano fill thy sails then for our
masters watch your movements and set a value on
your diligence
while the calabriann complied jacopo assisted
the bravo 
the females to come up out the gondola in a
moment the heavy yards swung off wing and wing
and the bubbles that appeared to glance past the
sides the bella sorrentina denoted her speed
thou hast noble ladies in thy passengers said
jacopo to the padrone when the latter was released
from the active duties getting his vessel in motion
 and though policy requires that they should
quit the city for a time thou wilt gain favor by consulting
their pleasures
doubt me not master roderigo but thou forgreatest
that i have not yet received my sailing instructions
 a felucca without a course is as badly
off as an owl in the sun
that in good time there will come an officer
 the republic to settle this matter with thee i
would not have these noble ladies know that one
like annina is to be their fellowpassenger while
they are near the port for they might complain 
disrespect thou understands stefano 
cospetto am i a fool a blunderer if so why
does the senate employ me the girl is out hearing
and there let her stay as long as the noble
dames are willing to breathe the night air they
shall have none her company
no fear them the dwellers the land
little relish the pent air thy cabin thou wilt go
without the lido stefano and await my coming
if thou should st not see me before the hour one
bear away for the port ancona where thou wilt
get further tidings
stefano who had often previously received his
instructions from the imaginary roderigo nodded
assent and they parted it is scarcely necessary
to add that the fugitives had been fully instructed in
the conduct they were to maintain
the gondola jacopo never flew faster than
he now urged it towards the land in the constant
n
 the bravo
passage the boats the movements one were
not likely to be remarked and he found when he
reached the quay the square that his passing and
repassing had not been observed he boldly unmasked
and landed it was near the hour when
he had given don camillo a rendezvous in the
piazza and he walked slowly up the smaller square
towards the appointed place meeting
jacopo as has been seen in an earlier chapter
had a practice walking near the columns 
granite in the first hours the night it was the
vulgar impression that he waited there for custom
in his bloody calling as men more innocent lives
take their stands in places mark when seen on
his customary stand he was avoided by all who
were chary their character or scrupulous appearances

the persecuted and yet singularly tolerated
bravo w r as slowly pacing the flags on his way to
the appointed place unwilling to anticipate the moment
when a laquais thrust a paper into his hand
and disappeared as fast as legs would carry him
it has been seen that jacopo could not read for
that was an age when men his class were studiously
kept in ignorance he turned to the first passenger
who had the appearance being likely to
satisfy his wishes and desired him to do the office
 interpreter
he had addressed an honest shopkeeper a
distant quarter the man took the scroll and goodnaturedly
commenced reading its contents aloud
i am called away and cannot meet thee jacopo 
at the name jacopo the tradesman dropped the
paper and fled
the bravo walked slowly back again towards
the quay ruminating on the awkward accident
which had crossed his plans his elbow was touched
and a masker confronted him when he turned
the bravo 
thou art jacopo front said the stranger
none else
thou hast a hand to serve an employer faithfully

i keep my faith
tis well thou wilt find a hundred sequins in
this sack
whose life is set against this gold asked ja

would pay his barber this for letting blood
do thy job thoroughly and the price shall be
doubled

the stranger looked cautiously around him and
raising his mask for an instant he showed the countenance
 giacomo gradenigo
is the pledge sufficient 
signore it is when must this deed be done 
this night nay this hour even
shall i strike a noble his rank in his palace
in his very pleasures
come hither jacopo and thou shalt know more
hast thou a mask
the bravo signified his assent
then keep thy face behind a cloud for it is
not in favor here and seek thy boat i will join
thee
the young patrician whose form was effectually
concealed by his attire quitted his companion with
a view rejoining him anew where his person
should not be known jacopo forced his boat from
among the crowd at the quay and having entered
the open space between the tiers he lay on his oar

well knowing that he was watched and that he
would soon be followed his conjecture was right
for in a few moments a gondola pulled swiftly to
the side his own and two men in masks passed
from thestrange boat into that the bravo without
speaking
to the lido said a voice which jacopo knew
to be that his new employer
he was obeyed the boat giacomo gradenigo
following at a little distance when they were without
the tiers and consequently beyond the danger
 being overheard the two passengers came out 
the pavilion and made a sign to the bravo to cease
rowing
thou wilt accept the service jacopo frontoni
 demanded the profligate heir the old senator
shall i strike the noble in his pleasures signore

it is not necessary we have found means to
lure him from his palace and he is now in thy power
with no other hope than that which may come
from his single arm and courage wilt thou take
the service
gladly signore it is my humor to encounter
the brave
thou wilt be gratified the neapolitan has
thwarted me in my shall i call it love hosea or
hast thou a better name
just daniel signor giacomo you have no respect
for reputations and surety i see no necessity
for a home thrust master jacopo but a smart
wound that may put matrimony out the head 
the duca for a time at least and penitence into its
place would be better 
strike to the heart interrupted giacomo it
is the certainty thy blow which has caused me
to seek thee
this is usurious vengeance signor giacomo
the bravo 
returned the less resolute jew twill be more than
sufficient for our purposes if we cause the neapolitan
to keep house for a month
send him to his grave harkee jacopo a
hundred for thy blow a second for insurance 
its depth a third if the body shall be buried in the
orfano so that the water will never give back the
secret
if the two first must be performed the last will
be prudent caution muttered the jew who was a
wary villain and who greatly preferred such secondary
expedients as might lighten the load on his
conscience you will not trust young signore to
a smart wound
not a sequin twill be heating the fancy 
the girl with hopes and pity dost thou accept the
terms jacopo
i do
then row to the lido among the graves 
hosea s people why dost thou pull at my skirts
jew would st thou hope to deceive a man this
character with a flimsy lie among the graves 
hosea s people thou wilt meet don camillo within
the hour he is deluded by a pretended letter from
the lady our common pursuit and will be alone
in the hopes flight i trust to thee to hasten the
latter so far as the neapolitan is concerned dost
take my meaning 
signore it is plain
tis enough thou knowest me and can take
the steps necessary for thy reward as thou shalt
serve me hosea our affair is ended
giacomo gradenigo made a sign for his gondola
to approach and dropping a sack which contained
the retainer in this bloody business he passed into it
with the indifference one who had been accustomed
to consider such means attaining his object
lawful not so hosea he was a rogue rather than
 the bravo
a villain the preservation his money with the
temptation a large sum which had been promised
him by both father and son in the event the
latter s success with violetta were irresistible temptations
to one who had lived contemned by those
around him and he found his solace for the ruthless
attempt in the acquisition those means 
enjoyment which are sought equally by christian
and jew still his blood curdled at the extremity
to which giacomo would push the affair and he
lingered to utter a parting word to the bravo
thou art said to carry a sure stiletto honest
jacopo he whispered a hand thy practice
must know how to maim as well as to slay strike
the neapolitan smartly but spare his life even the
bearer a public dagger like thine may not fare
the worse at the coming philo for having been
tender his strength on occasion
thou forgettest the gold hosea 
father abraham what a memory am i getting
in my years thou sayest truth mindful jacopo 
the gold shall be forthcoming in any event always
provided that the affair is so managed as to
leave my young friend a successful adventurer with
the heiress
jacopo made an impatient gesture for at that moment
he saw a gondolier pulling rapidly towards a
private part the lido the hebrew joined his
companion and the boat the bravo darted ahead
it was not long ere it lay on the strand the lido
the steps jacopo were rapid as he moved towards
those proscribed graves among which he had
made his confession to the very man he was now
sent to slay
art thou sent to meet me demanded one who
started from behind a rising in the sands but who
took the precaution to bare his rapier as he appeared
the bravo 
signer duca i am returned the bravo unmasking

jacopo this is even better than i had hoped 
hast thou tidings from my bride
follow don camillo and you shall quickly
meet her
words were unnecessary to persuade when there
was such a promise they were both in the gondola
 jacopo and on their way to one the passages
through the lido which conducts to the gulf
before the bravo commenced his explanation this
however was quickly made not forgetting the design
 giacomo gradenigo on the life his auditor
the felucca which had been previously provided
with the necessary pass by the agents the police
itself had quitted the port under easy sail by the
very inlet through which the gondola made its way
into the adriatic the water was smooth the
breeze fresh from the land and in short all things
were favorable to the fugitives donna violetta and
her governess were leaning against a mast watching
with impatient eyes the distant domes and the
midnight beauty venice occasionally strains
 music came to their ears from the canals and
then a touch natural melancholy crossed the feelings
 the former as she feared they might be the
last sounds that nature she should ever hear from
her native town but unalloyed pleasure drove
every regret from her mind when don camillo
leaped from the gondola and folded her in triumph
to his heart
there was little difficulty in persuading stefano
milanoo to abandon for ever the service the senate
for that his feudal lord the promises and
commands the latter were sufficient themselves
to reconcile him to the change and all were convinced
there was no time to lose the felucca soon
spread her canvas to the wind and slid away from
 the bravo
the beach jacopo permitted his gondola to be
towed a league to sea before he prepared to reenter
it
you will steer for ancona signor don camillo
said the bravo leaning on the felucca s side still
unwilling to depart and throw yourself at once
under the protection the cardinal secretary if
stefano keep the sea he may chance meet the galleys
 the senate
distrust us not but thou my excellent jacopo
what wilt thou become in their hands
fear not for me signore god disposes allas
he sees fit i have told your eccellenza that i
cannot yet quit venice if fortune favor me i may
still see your stout castle sant agata
and none will be more welcome within its secure
walls i have much fear for thee jacopo 
signore think not it i am used to danger
and to misery and to hopelessness i have known
a pleasure this night in witnessing the happiness 
two young hearts that god in his anger has long
denied me lady the saints keep you and god
who is above all shield you from harm 
he kissed the hand donna violetta who half
ignorant still his services listened to his words
in wonder
don camillo monforte he continued distrust
venice to your dying day let no promises no
hopes no desire increasing your honors or your
riches ever tempt you to put yourself in her power
none know the falsehood the state better than i
and with my parting words i w r arn you to be wary
thou speakest as if we were to meet no more
worthy jacopo 
the bravo turned and the action brought his
features to the moon there was a melancholy
smile in which deep satisfaction at the success 
the bravo 
the lovers was mingled with serious forebodings for
himself
we are certain only the past he said in a
low voice
touching the hand don camillo he kissed his
own and leaped hastily into his gondola the fast
was thrown loose and the felucca glided away leaving
this extraordinary being alone in the waters
the neapolitan ran to the taffrail and the last he
saw jacopo the bravo was rowing leisurely back
towards that scene violence and deception from
which he himself was so glad to have escaped

my limbs are bow d though not with toil
but rusted with a vile repose

prisoner chillon
when the day dawned on the following morning
the square st mark was empty the priests still
chanted their prayers for the dead near the body
 old antonio and a few fishermen still lingered
in and near the cathedral but half persuaded the
manner in which their companion had come to his
 but as was usual at that hour the day the
city appeared tranquil for though a slight alarm had
passed through the canals at the movement the
rioters it had subsided in that specious and distrustful
quiet which is more or less the unavoidable
vol ii o
 the bravo
consequence a system that is not substantially
based on the willing support the mass
jacopo was again in the attic the doge s
palace accompanied by the gentle gelsomina as
they threaded the windings the building he recounted
to the eager ear his companion all the
details connected with the escape the lovers
omitting as a matter prudence the attempt 
giacomo gradenigo on the life don camillo
the unpractised and singlehearted girl heard him
in breathless attention the color her cheek and
the changeful eye betraying the force her sympathies
at each turn in their hazardous adventure
and dost thou think they can yet escape from
those up above murmured gelsomina for few in
venice would trust their voices by putting such a
question aloud thou knowest the republic hath
at all times its galleys in the adriatic 
we have had thought that and the calabriann
is advised to steer for the mole ancona once
within the states the church the influence 
don camillo and the rights his noble wife will
protect them is there a place here whence we
can look out upon the sea 
gelsomina led the bravo into an empty room 
the attic which commanded a view the port the
lido and the waste water beyond the breeze
came in strong currents over the roofs the
town and causing the masts the port to rock it
lighted on the lagunes without the tiers the
shipping from this point to the barrier sand
it was apparent by the stooping sails and the struggles
 the gondoliers who pulled towards the quay
that the air was swift without the lido itself the
element w r as shadow r ed and fitful while farther in
the distance the troubled waters with their crests
 foam sufficiently proved its power
santa maria be praised exclaimed jacopo
the bravo 
when his understanding eye had run over the near
and distant view they are already far down the
coast and with a wind like this they cannot fail to
reach their haven in a few hours let us go to
the cell
gelsomina smiled when he assured her the
safety the fugitives but her look saddened when
he changed the discourse without reply however
she did as he desired and in a very few moments
they were standing by the side the prisoner
s pallet the latter did not appear to observe
their entrance and jacopo was obliged to announce
himself
father he said with that melancholy pathos
which always crept into his voice when he addressed
the old man it is i
the prisoner turned and though evidently much
enfeebled since the last visit a wan smile gleamed
on his wasted features
and thy mother boy he asked so eagerly as
to cause gelsomina to turn hastily aside
happy father happy
happy without me
she is ever with thee in spirit father she
thinks thee in her prayers thou hast a saint
for an intercessor in my mother father
and thy good sister 
happy too doubt it not father they are
both patient and resigned
the senate boy
is the same soulless selfish and pretending 
answered jacopo sternly then turning away his
face in bitterness heart though without permitting
the words to be audible he cursed them
the noble signori were deceived in believing
me concerned in the attempt to rob their revenues
returned the patient old man one day they will
see and acknowledge their error
 the bravo
jacopo made no answer for unlettered as he
was and curtailed that knowledge which should
be and is bestowed on all by every paternal government
the natural strength his mind had enabled
him to understand that a system which on its
face professed to be founded on the superior acquirements
 a privileged few w r ould be the least
likely to admit the fallacy its theories by confessing
it could err
thou dost the nobles injustice son they are illustrious
patricians and have no motive in oppressing
one like me
none father but the necessity maintaining
the severity the laws which make them senators
and you a prisoner
nay boy i have known worthy gentlemen 
the senate there was the late signor tiepolo
who did me much favor in my youth but for this
false accusation i might now have been one 
the most thriving my craft in venice
father we will pray for the soul the tiepolo

is the senator dead 
so says a gorgeous tomb in the church the
retentive
we must all die at last whispered the old man
crossing himself doge as well as patrician
patrician as well asgondolier jack 
father exclaimed the bravo so suddenly as
to interrupt the coming word then kneeling by the
pallet the prisoner he w r whispered in his ear thou
forgettest there is reason why thou should st not
call me by that name i have told thee often that
if thus ca lied my visits must stop
the prisoner looked bewildered for the failing
 nature rendered that obscure which was once so
evident to his mind after gazing long at his son
the bravo 
his eye wandered between him and the wall and
he smiled childishly
wilt thou look good boy if the spider is come
back
jacopo groaned but he rose to comply
i do not see it father the season is not yet
warm
not warm my veins feel heated to bursting
thou forgettest this is the attic and that these are
the leads and then the sun oh the sun the illustrious
senators do not bethink them the pain
 passing the bleak winter below the canals and
the burning summers beneath hot metal
they think nothing but their power murmured
jacopo that which is wrongfully obtained
must be maintained by merciless injustice but
why should we speak this father hast thou all
thy body needs 
air son air give me that air which god
has made for the meanest living thing
the bravo rushed towards those fissures in the
venerable but polluted pile he had already striven
to open and with frantic force he endeavored to
widen them with his hands the material resisted
though blood flowed from the ends his fingers in
the desperate effort
i the door gelsomina open wide the door he
cried turning away from the spot exhausted with
his fruitless exertions
nay i do not suffer now my child it is when
thou hast left me and when i am alone with my
own thoughts when i see thy weeping mother and
neglected sister that i most feel the want air
are we not in the fervid month august son 
father it is not yet june
i shall then have more heat to bear god s will
be done and blessed santa maria his mother undefiled
 give me strength to endure it
o
 the bravo
the eye jacopo gleamed with a wildness
scarcely less frightful than the ghastly look the
old man his chest heaved his fingers were clenched
and his breathing was audible
no he said in a low but in so determined a
voice as to prove how fiercely his resolution was
set thou shalt not await their torments arise
father and go with me the doors are open the
ways the palace are known to me in the darkest
night and the keys are at hand i will find means
to conceal thee until dark and we will quit the accursed
republic for ever
hope gleamed in the eye the old captive ashe
listened to this frantic proposal but distrust 
the means immediately altered its expression
thou forgettest those up above son
i think only one truly above father
and this girl how canst thou hope to deceive
her
she will take thy place she is with us in heart
and will lend herself to a seeming violence i do
not promise for thee idly kindest gelsomina 
the frightened girl who had never before witnessed
so plain evidence desperation in her companion
had sunk upon an article furniture speechless
the look the prisoner changed from one
to the other and he made an effort to rise but debility
caused him to fall backward and not till then
did jacopo perceive the impracticability on many
accounts what in a moment excitement he
had proposed a long silence followed the hard
breathing jacopo gradually subsided and the expression
 his face changed to its customary settled
and collected look
father he said i must quit thee our misery
draws near a close
thou wilt come to me soon again 
if the saints permit thy blessing father
the bravo 
the old man folded his hands above the head
 jacopo and murmured a prayer when this
pious duty was performed both the bravo and gelsamaria
busied themselves a little time in contributing
to the bodily comforts the prisoner and
then they departed in company
jacopo appeared unwilling to quit the vicinity 
the cell a melancholy presentiment seemed to
possess his mind that these stolen visits were soon
to cease after a little delay however they descended
to the apartments below and as jacopo
desired to quit the palace without reentering the
prisons gelsomina prepared to let him out by the
principal corridorrfii
thou art sadder than common carlo she observed
watching with feminine assiduity his averted
eye methinks thou should st rejoice in the
fortunes the neapolitan and the lady the
tiepolo
that escape is like a gleam sunshine in a
wintry day good girl but we are observed
why is yon spy on our movements 
tis a menial the palace they constantly
cross us in this part the building come hither if
thou art weary the room is little used and we
may again look out upon the sea
jacopo followed his mild conductor into one 
the neglected closets the second floor where in
truth he was glad to catch a glimpse the state
 things in the piazza before he left the palace
his first look was at the water which was still
rolling southward before the gale from the alps
satisfied with this prospect he bent his eye beneath
at the instant an officer the republic issued from
the palace gate preceded by a trumpeter as was
usual when there was occasion to make public proclamation
 the senate s will gelsomina opened
the casement and both leaned forward to listen
 the bravo
when the little procession had reached the front 
the cathedral the trumpet sounded and the voice 
the officer was heard
whereas many wicked and ruthless assassinations
have late been committed on the persons 
divers good citizens venice he proclaimed
the senate in its fatherly care all whom it is
charged to protect has found reason to resort to
extraordinary means preventing the repetition 
crimes so contrary to the laws god and the security
 society the illustrious ten therefore offer
thus publicly a reward one hundred sequins to
him who shall discover the perpetrator any 
these most horrible assasftjns and whereas
during the past night the body a certain antonio
a wellknown fisherman and a worthy citizen much
esteemed by the patricians has been found in the
lagunes and whereas there is but too much reason
to believe that he has come to his death by the hands
 a certain jacopo frontoni who has the reputation
 a common bravo but who has been long watched
in vain by the authorities with the hope detecting
him in the commission some one the
aforesaid horrible assassinations now all good and
honest citizens the republic are enjoined to assist
the authorities in seizing the person the said ja
copo frontoni even though he should take sanctuary
 for venice can no longer endure the presence
 one his sanguinary habits and for the encouragement
 the same the senate in its paternal care
offers the reward three hundred sequins n the
usual words prayer and sovereignty closed the
proclamation
as it was not usual for those who ruled so much
in the dark to make their intentions public all near
listened with wonder and awe to the novel procedure
some trembled lest the mysterious and
muchdreaded power was about to exhibit itself
the bravo 
while most found means making their admiration
 the fatherly interest their rulers audible
none heard the words the officer with more
feeling than gelsomina she bent her body far
from the window in order that not a syllable should
escape her
did st thou hear carlo demanded the eager
girl as she drew back her head they proclaim at
last money for the monster who has committed so
many murders 
jacopo laughed but to the ears his startled
companion the sounds were unnatural
the patriciansariust and what they do is
right he said fpmrre illustrious birth and
cannot err they wilfjo their duty
but here is no other duty than that they owe to
god and to the people
i have heard the duty the people but little
is said the senate s
nay carlo we will not refuse them credit when
in truth they seek to keep the citizens from harm
this jacopo is a monster detested by all and his
bloody deeds have too long been a reproach to
venice thou hearest that the patricians are not
niggard their gold when there is hope his being
taken listen they proclaim again 
the trumpet sounded and the proclamation was
repeated between the granite columns the piazzetta
and quite near to the window occupied by gelsomina
and her unmoved companion
why dost thou mask carlo she asked when
the officer had done it is not usual to be disguised
in the palace at this hour
they will believe it the doge blushing to be an
auditor his own liberal justice or they may mistake
me for one the three itself
they go by the quay to the arsenal thence they
will take boat as is customary for the rialto
 the bravo
thereby giving this redoubtable jacopo timely
notice to secrete himself your judges up above are
mysterious when they should be open and open when
they should be secret i must quit thee gelsomina 
go then back to the room thy father and leave
me to pass out by the court the palace
it may not be carlo thou knowest the permission
 the authorities i have exceeded why should
i wish to conceal it from thee but it was not permitted
to thee to enter at this hour
and thou hast had the courage to transgress the
leave for my sake gelsomina
the abashed girl hungmierjad and the color
which glowed about heijfjff was like the rosy
light her own italy
thou would st have it so she said
a thousand thanks dearest kindest truest gel
somina but doubt not my being able to leave the
palace unseen the danger was in entering they
who go forth do it with the air having authority
none pass the halberdiers masked by day carlo
but they who have the secret word
the bravo appeared struck with this truth and
there was great embarrassment expressed in his
manner the terms his admittance were so well
understood to himself that he distrusted the expediency
 attempting to get upon the quays by the
prison the way he had entered since he had little
doubt that his retreat would be intercepted by those
who kept the outer gate and who were probably by
this time in the secret his true character it now
appeared that egress by the other route was equally
hazardous he had not been surprised so much by
the substance the proclamation as by the publicity
the senate had seen fit to give to its policy and he
had heard himself denounced with a severe pang
it is true but without terror still he had so many
means disguise and the practice personal conthe
bravo 
cement was so general in venice that he had entertained
no great distrust the result until he now
found himself in this awkward dilemma gelsomina
read his indecision in his eye and regretted that she
should have caused him so much uneasiness
it is not so bad as thou keenest to think carlo
she observed they have permitted thee to visit thy
father at stated hours and the permission is a proof
that the senate is not without pity now that i to
oblige thy wishes have forgotten one their injunctions
they will not be so hard heart as to
visit the fault as a crime
jacopo gazed at her with pity for well did he
understand how little she knew the real nature
and wily policy the state
it is time that we should part he said lest
thy innocence should be made to pay the price 
my mistake i am now near the public corridor
and must trust to my fortune to gain the quay
gelsomina hung upon his arm unwilling to trust
him to his own guidance in that fearful building
it will not do carlo thou wilt stumble on a
soldier and thy fault will be known perhaps they
will refuse to let thee come again perhaps altogether
shut the door thy poor father s cell
jacopo made a gesture for her to lead the way
and followed with a beating but still lightened
heart gelsomina glided along the passages carefully
locking each door as wont behind her
when she had passed through it at length they
reached the wellknown bridge sighs the
anxious girl went on with a lighter step when she
found herself approaching her own abode for she
was busy in planning the means concealing her
companion in her father s rooms should there be
hazard in his passing out the prison during the
clay
but a single minute carlo she whispered 
the bravo
plying the key to the door which opened into the
latter building the lock yielded but the hinges refused
to turn gelsomina paled as she added
they have drawn the bolts within 
no matter i will go down by the court the
palace and boldly pass the halberdier unmasked
gelsomina after all saw but little risk his being
known by the mercenaries who served the doge
and anxious to relieve him from so awkward a position
she flew back to the other the gallery
another key was applied to the door by which
they had just entered with the same result gel
somina staggered back and sought support against
the wall
we can neither return nor proceed she exclaimed
frightened she knew not why
i see it all answered jacopo we are prisoners
on the fatal bridge
as he spoke the bravo calmly removed his mask
and showed the countenance a man whose resolution
was at its height
santa madre di dio what can it mean 
that we have passed here once too often love
the council is tender these visits
the bolts both doors grated and the hinges
creaked at the same instant an officer the inquisition
entered armed and bearing manacles gel
somina shrieked but jacopo moved not limb or
muscle while he was fettered and chained
i too cried his frantic companion i am the
most guilty bind me cast me into a cell but let
poor carlo go
carlo echoed an officer laughing unfeelingly
is it such a crime to seek a father in his prison 
they knew his visits they permitted them he
has only mistaken the hour
girl dost thou know for whom thou pleases
for the kindest heart the most faithful son in
the bravo 
venice oh if ye had seen him weep as i have
done over the sufferings the old captive if ye
had seen his very form shivering in agony ye would
have pity on him 
listen returned the officer raising a finger
for attention
the trumpeter sounded on the bridge st
mark immediately beneath them and proclamation
was again made offering gold for the arrest the
bravo
tis the officer the republic bidding for the
head one who carries a common stiletto cried
the halfbreathless gelsomina who little heeded the
ceremony at that instant he merits his fate
then why resist it 
ye speak without meaning 
doting girl this is jacopo frontoni 
gelsomina would have disbelieved her ears but
for the anguished expression jacopo s eye the
horrible truth burst upon her rind and she fell lifeless
at that moment the bravo was hurried from
the bridge
chapter xi
let us lift up the curtain and observe
what passes in that chamber
rogers
there were many rumors uttered in the fearful
and secret manner which characterized the manners
 the town in the streets venice that day
hundreds passed near the granite columns as if
they expected to see the bravo occupying his accustomed
stand in audacious defiance the prov
r ol ii p
 the bravo
exclamation for so long and so mysteriously had he
been permitted to appear in public that men had
difficulty in persuading themselves he would quit
his habits so easily it is needless to say that the
vague expectation was disappointed much was
also said vauntingly in behalf the republic s justice
for the humbled are bold enough in praising
their superiors and he who had been dumb for
years on subjects a public nature now found his
voice like a fearless freeman
but the day passed away without any new occurrence
to call the citizens from their pursuits
the prayers for the dead were continued with little
intermission and masses were said before the
altars half the churches for the repose the
fisherman s soul his comrades a little distrustful
but greatly gratified watched the ceremonies with
jealousy and exultation singularly blended ere
the night set in again they were among the most
obedient those the oligarchy habitually trod upon
for such is the effect this species domination
that it acquires a power to appease by its flattery
the very discontents created by its injustice such
is the human mind a factitious but deeplyseated
sentiment respect is created by the habit submission
which gives the subject its influence a
feeling atonement when he who has long played
the superior comes down from his stilts and confesses
the community human frailties 
the square st mark filled at the usual hour
the patricians deserted the broglio as wont and
the gaieties the place were again uppermost before
the clock had struck the second hour the
night gondolas filled with noble dames appeared
on the canals the blinds the palaces were raised
for the admission the seabreeze and music
began to be heard in the port on the bridges and
under the balconies the fair the course sothe
bravo 
city was not to be arrested merely because the
wronged were unavenged or the innocent suffered
there stood then on the grand canal as there
stand now many palaces scarcely less than royal
magnificence the reader has had occasion to become
acquainted with one or two these splendid
edifices and it has now become our duty to convey
him in imagination to another
the peculiarity construction which is a consequence
 the watery site venice gives the
same general character to all the superior dwellings
 that remarkable town the house to which the
thread the narrative now leads us had its watergate
its vestibule its massive marble stairs its
inner court its magnificent suites rooms above
its pictures its lustres and its floors precious
stones embedded in composition like all those which
we have already found it necessary to describe
the hour was ten according to our own manner
 computing time a small but lovely family picture
presented itself deep within the walls the
patrician abode to which we have alluded there
was a father a gentleman who had scarce attained
the middle age with an eye in which spirit intelligence
philanthropy and at that moment paternal
fondness were equally glowing he tossed in his
arms with parental pride a laughing urchin 
some three or four years who rioted in the amusement
which brought him and the author his being
for a time seemingly on a level a fair venetian
dame with golden locks and glowing cheeks
such as titian loved to paint her sex reclined on a
couch nigh by following the movements both
with the joint feelings mother and wife and
laughing in pure sympathy with the noisy merriment
 her young hope a girl who was the
youthful image herself with tresses that fell to
her waists romped with a crowing infant whose
 the bravo
age was so tender as scarcely to admit the uncertain
evidence its intelligence such was the
scene as the clock the piazza told the hour
struck with the sound the father set down the boy
and consulted his watch
dost thou use thy gondola tonight love he
demanded
with thee paolo
not with me dearest i have affairs which will
employ me until twelve 
nay thou art given to cast me off when thy
caprices are wayward
say not so i have named tonight for an interview
with my agent and i know thy maternal
heart too well to doubt thy being willing to spare
me for that time while i look to the interests 
these dear ones
the donna giulietta rang for her mantle and attendants
the crowing infant and the noisy boy
were dismissed to their beds while the lady and the
eldest child descended to the gondola donna giu
lietta was not permitted to go unattended to her
boat for this was a family in which the inclinations
had fortunately seconded the ordinary calculations
 interest when the nuptial knot was tied her
husband kissed her hand fondly as he assisted her
into the gondola and the boat had glided some distance
from the palace ere he quitted the moist
stones the watergate
hast thou prepared the cabinet for my friends
demanded the signor soranzo for it was the same
senator who had been in company with the doge
when the latter went to meet the fishermen
signore si
and the quiet and the lights as ordered 
eccellenza all will be done
thou hast placed seats for six we shall be
the bravo 
signore there are six armed chairs
t is well when the first my friends arrive
i will join them
eccellenza there are already two cavaliers in
masks within
the signor soranzo started again consulted his
watch and went hastily towards a distant and very
silent part the palace he reached a small door
unattended and closing it found himself at once
in the presence those who evidently awaited his
appearance
a thousand pardons signori cried the master
 the house this is novel duty to me at least
i know not what may be your honorable experience
and the time stole upon me unmarked i
pray for grace messires future diligence shall repair
the present neglect
both the visitors were older men than their host
and it was quite evident by their hardened visages
they were much longer practice in the world
his excuses were received with courtesy and fora
little time the discourse was entirely usage and
convention
we are in secret here signore asked one 
the guests after some little time had been wasted in
this manner
as the tomb none enter here unbidden but
my wife and she has this moment taken boat for
better enjoyment the evening
the world gives you credit signor soranzo
for a happy menage i hope you have duly considered
the necessity shutting the door even against
the donna giulietta tonight 
doubt me not signore the affairs st mark
are paramount
i feel myself thrice happy signori that in drawing
a lot for the secret council my good fortune
hath given me so excellent colleagues believe me
p
 the bravo
i have discharged this awful trust in my day in
less agreeable company
this flattering speech which the wily old senator
had made regularly to all with whom chance had
associated him in the inquisition during a long life
wats well received and it was returned with equal
compliments
it would appear that the worthy signor alessanto
gradenigo was one our predecessors he
continued looking at some papers for though the
actual three were unknown at the time being to all
but a few secretaries and officers the state venetian
policy transmitted their names to their successors
as a matter course a noble gentleman
and one great devotion to the state 
the others assented like men accustomed to speak
with caution
we were about to have entered on our duties
at a troublesome moment signori observed another
 bui it would seem that this tumult the
fishermen has already subsided i understand the
knaves had some reason for their distrust the
state
it is an affair happily settled answered the
senior the three who was long practised in the
expediency forgetting all that policy required
should cease to be remembered after the object was
attained the galleys must be manned else would
st mark quickly hang his head in shame
the signor soranzo who had received some
previous instruction in his new duties looked melancholy
but he too was merely the creature a
system
is there matter pressing import for our reflection
 he demanded
signori there is every reason to believe that the
state has just sustained a grievous loss ye bothwell
know the heiress tiepolo by reputation at
the bravo 
least though her retired manner life may have
kept you from her company
donna giulietta is eloquent in praise her beauty
 said the young husband
we had not a better fortune in venice rejoined
the third inquisitor
excellent in qualities and better in riches as
she is i fear we have lost her signori don camillo
monforte whom god protect until we have no
future use for his influence had come near to prevail
against us but just as the state baffled his welllaid
schemes the lady has been thrown by hazard
into the hands the rioters since which time there
is no account her movements
paolo soranzo secretly hoped she was in the
arms the neapolitan
a secretary has communicated to me the disappearance
 the duca di sans agata also observed
the third nor is the felucca usually employed
in distant and delicate missions any longer
at her anchors
the two old men regarded each other as if the
truth was beginning to dawn upon their suspicions
they saw that the case was hopeless and as theirs
was altogether a practical duty no time was lost in
useless regrets
we have two affairs which press observed the
elder the body the old fisherman must be
laid quietly in the earth with as little risk future
tumult as may be and we have this notorious jas
to dispose 
the latter must first be taken said the signor
soranzo
that has been done already would you think
it sirs he was seized in the very palace the
doge
to the block with him without delay 
the old men again looked at each other and it
 the bravo
was quite apparent that as both them had been
in previous councils they had a secret intelligence
to which their companion was yet a stranger
there was also visible in their glances something
like a design to manage his feelings before they
came more openly to the graver practices their
duties
for the sake blessed st mark signori let
justice be done openly in this instance continued
the unsuspecting member the three what
pity can the bearer a common stiletto claim and
what more lovely exercise our authority than to
make public an act severe and muchrequired
justice
the old senators bowed to this sentiment their
colleague which was uttered with the fervor 
young experience and the frankness an upright
mind for there is a conventional acquiescence in
received morals which is permitted in semblance at
least to adorn the most tortuous
it may be well signore soranzo to do this
homage to the right returned the elder here
have been sundry charges found in different lions
mouths against the neapolitan signor don camillo
monforte i leave it to your wisdom my illustrious
colleagues to decide on their character
an excess malice betrays its own origin
exclaimed the leastpractised member the inquisition
 my life on it signori these accusations
come private spleen and are unworthy the
state s attention i have consorted much with the
young lord sans agata and a more worthy gentleman
does not dwell among us
still hath he designs on the hand old tiepolo s
daughter 
is it a crime in youth to seek beauty he did
great service to the lady in her need and that youth
should feel these sympathies is nothing strange
the bravo 
venice hath her sympathies as well as the
youngest us all signore
but venice cannot wed the heiress 
true st mark must be satisfied with playing
the prudent father s part you are yet young signore
soranzo and the donna giulietta is rare
beauty as life wears upon ye both ye will see the
fortunes kingdoms as well as families differently 
but we waste our breath uselessly in this matter
since our agents have not yet reported their success
in the pursuit the most pressing affair just now
is the disposition the bravo hath his highness
shown you the letter the sovereign pontiff in the
question the intercepted dispatches signore
he hath a fair answer was returned by our
predecessors and it must rest there
we will then look freely into the matter 
jacopo frontoni there will be necessity our
assembling in the chamber the inquisition that
we may have the prisoner confronted to his accusers
tis a grave trial signori and venice would lose in
men s estimation were not the highest tribunal to
take an interest in its decision
to the block with the villain again exclaimed
the signor soranzo
he may haply meet with that fate or even with
the punishment the wheel a mature examination
will enlighten us much on the course which
policy may dictate
there can be but one policy when the protection
 the lives our citizens is in question i have
never before felt impatience to shorten the life 
man but in this trial i can scarce brook delay
your honorable impatience shall be gratified
signor soranzo for foreseeing the urgency the
case my colleague the worthy senator who is joined
with us in this high duty and myself have already
issued the commands necessary to that object the
 the bravo
hour is near and we will repair to the chamber 
the inquisition in time to our duty
the discourse then turned on subjects a more
general concern this secret and extraordinary
tribunal which was obliged to confine its meetings
to no particular place which could decide on its
decrees equally in the piazza or the palace amidst
the revelries the masquerade or before the altar 
in the assemblies the gay or in their own closets
had necessity much ordinary matter submitted to
its inspection as the chances birth entered into
its original composition and god hath not made
all alike fit for so heartless a duty it sometimes
happened as in the present instance that the more
worldly its members had to overcome the generous
disposition a colleague before the action 
the terrible machine could go on
it is worthy remark that communities always
establish a higher standard justice and truth than
is exercised by their individual members the reason
is not to be sought for since nature hath left to
all a perception that right which is abandoned
only under the stronger impulses personal temptation
we commend the virtue we cannot imitate
thus it fe that those countries in which public opinion
has most influence are always the purest public
practice it follows as a corollary from this proposition
that a representation should be as real as possible
for its tendency will be inevitably to elevate
national morals miserable indeed is the condition
 that people whose maxims and measures public
policy are below the standard its private integrity
for the fact not only proves it is not the master
 its own destinies but the still more dangerous
truth that the collective power is employed in the
fatal service undermining those very qualities
which are necessary to virtue and which have
enough to do at all times in resisting the attacks 
the bravo 
immediate selfishness a strict legal representation
 all its interests is far more necessary to a worldly
than to a simple people since responsibility which
is the essence a free government is more likely
to keep the agents a nation near to its own standard
 virtue than any other means the common
opinion that a republic cannot exist without an extraordinary
degree virtue in its citizens is so flattering
to our own actual condition that we seldom
take the trouble to inquire into its truth but to us
it seems quite apparent that effect is here mistaken
for the cause it is said as the people are virtually
masters in a republic that the people ought to be
virtuous to rule well so far as this proposition is
confined to degrees it is just as true a republic as
 any other form government but kings do
rule and surely all have not been virtuous and that
aristocracies have ruled with the very minimum 
that quality the subject our tale sufficiently shows
that other things being equal the citizens a republic
will have a higher standard private virtue
than the subjects any other form government
is true as an effect we can readily believe for responsibility
to public opinion existing in all the
branches its administration that conventional
morality which characterizes the common sentiment
will be left to act on the mass and will not be
perverted into a terrible engine exemption as is
the case when factitious institutions give a false
direction to its influence
the case before us was in proof the truth 
what has here been said the signer soranzo
was a man great natural excellence character
and the charities his domestic circle had assisted
in confirming his original dispositions like
others his rank and expectations he had from
time to time made the history and polity the
selfstyled republic his study and the power colts
the bravo
elective interests and specious necessities had made
him admit sundry theories which presented in another
form he would have repulsed with indignation
still the signor soranzo was far from understanding
the full effects that system which he
was born to uphold even venice paid that homage
to public opinion which there has just been question
and held forth to the world but a false picture
 her true state maxims still many those which
were too apparent to be concealed were difficult
 acceptance with one whose mind was yet untainted
with practice and the young senator rather
shut his eyes on their tendency or as he felt their
influence in every interest which environed him
but that poor neglected abstract virtue whose
rewards were so remote he was fain to seek out
some palliative or some specious and indirect good
as the excuse for his acquiescence
in this state mind the signor soranzo was unexpectedly
admitted a member the council 
three often in the daydreams his youth had
he contemplated the possession this very irresponsible
power as the consummation his wishes
a thousand pictures the good he would perform
had crossed his brain and it was only as he advanced
in life and came to have a near view the
wiles which beset the bestintentioned that he could
bring himself to believe most that which he meditated
was impracticable as it was he entered
into the council with doubts and misgivings had
he lived in a later age under his own system modified
by the knowledge which has been a consequence
 the art printing it is probable that the
signor soranzo would have been a noble in opposition
now supporting with ardor some measure 
public benevolence and now yielding gracefully to
the suggestions a sterner policy and always influenced
by the positive advantages he w r as born to
the bravo 
possess though scarcely conscious himself he was
not all he professed to be the fault however was
not so much that the patrician as that circumstances
which by placing interest in opposition to
duty lures many a benevolent mind into still greater
weaknesses
the companions the signer soranzo however
had a more difficult task to prepare him for
the duties the statesman which were so very
different from those he was accustomed to perform
as a man than they had anticipated they were
like two trained elephants the east possessing
themselves all the finer instincts and generous qualities
 the noble animal but disciplined by a force
quite foreign to their natural condition into creatures
 mere convention placed one on each side
 a younger brother fresh from the plains and
whom it was their duty to teach new services for
the trunk new affections and haply the manner in
which to carry with dignity the howdah a
rajah
with many allusions to their policy but with no
direct intimation their own intention the seniors
 the council continued the conversation until the
hour for the meeting in the doge s palace drew
nigh they then separated as privately as they
had come together in order that no vulgar eye
might penetrate the mystery their official character

the most practised the three appeared in an
assembly the patricians which noble and beautiful
dames graced with their presence from which
he disappeared in a manner to leave no clue to his
motions the other visited the deathbed a
friend where he discoursed long and well with a
friar the immortality the soul and the hopes
 a christian when he departed the godly man
vol ii q
 the bravo
bestowing his blessing and the family he left being
loud and eloquent in his praise
the signor soranzo clung to the enjoyments 
his own family circle until the last moment the
donna giulietta had returned fresher and more
lovely than ever from the invigorating seabreeze
and her soft voice with the melodious laugh his
firstborn the blooming ringletcovered girl described
still rang in his ears when his gondolier
landed him beneath the bridge the rialto here
he masked and drawing his cloak about him he
moved with the current towards the square st
mark by means the narrow streets once in
the crowd there was little danger impertinent
observation disguise was as often useful to the
oligarchy venice as it was absolutely necessary
to elude its despotism and to render the town tolerable
to the citizen paolo saw swarthy barelegged
men the lagunes entering occasionally
into the cathedral he followed and found himself
standing near the dimlylighted altar at which
masses were still saying for the soul antonio
this is one thy fellows he asked a fisherman
whose dark eye glittered in that light like
the organ a basilisk
signore he was a more honest or a more
just man did not cast his net in the gulf
he has fallen a victim to his craft
cospetto di bacco none know in what manner
he came by his some say st mark was impatient
to see him in paradise and some pretend
he has fallen by the hand a common bravo
named jacopo frontoni
why should a bravo take the life one like
this
by having the goodness to answer your own
question signore you will spare me some trouble
why should he sure enough they say jacopo is
the bravo 
revengeful and that shame and anger at his defeat
in the late regatta by one old as this was the reason

is he so jealous his honor with the oar 
diamine i have seen the time when jacopo
would sooner die than lose a race but that was
before he carried a stiletto had he kept to his
oar the thing might have happened but once known
for the hired blow it seems unreasonable he should
set his heart so strongly on the prizes the canals
may not the man have fallen into the lagunes
by accident
no doubt signore this happens to some 
us daily but then we think it wiser to swim to the
boat than to sink old antonio had an arm in
youth to carry him from the quay to the lido
but he may have been struck in falling and
rendered unable to do himself this good office
there would be marks to show this were it
true signore 
would not jacopo have used the stiletto
perhaps not on one like antonio the gondola
 the old man was found in the mouth the
grand canal half a league from the body and
against the wind we note these things signore
for they are within our knowledge
a happy night to thee fisherman
a most happy night eccellenza said the laborer
 the lagunes gratified with having so long
occupied the attention one he rightly believed so
much his superior the disguised senator passed
on he had no difficulty in quitting the cathedral
unobserved and he had his private means entering
the palace without attracting any impertinent
eye to his movements here he quickly joined his
colleagues the fearful tribunal
 the bravo
chapter xl
there the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice 
the oppressor job
the manner in which the council three held
its more public meetings if aught connected with
that mysterious body could be called public has already
been seen on the present occasion there
were the same robes the same disguises and the
same officers the inquisition as in the scene related
in a previous chapter the only change was
in the character the judges and in that the
accused by a peculiar arrangement the lamp
too most the light was thrown upon the spot it
was intended the prisoner should occupy while the
side the apartment on which the inquisitors sate
was left in a dimness that well accorded with their
gloomy and secret duties previously to the opening
 the door by which the person to be examined
was to appear there was audible the clanking
 chains the certain evidence that the affair in
hand was considered serious the hinges turned
and the bravo stood in presence those unknown
men who were to decide on his fate
as jacopo had often been before the council
though not as a prisoner he betrayed neither surprise
nor alarm at the black aspect all his eye
beheld his features were composed though pale
his limbs immovable and his mien decent when
the little bustle his entrance had subsided there
reigned a stillness in the room
thou art called jacopo frontoni said the
secretary who acted as the mouthpiece the
three on this occasion
i am
the bravo 
thou art the son a certain ricardo fronting
a man well known as having been concerned in
robbing the republic s customs and who is thought
to have been banished to the distant islands or to
be otherwise punished 
signore or otherwise punished
thou wert a gondolier in thy youth
i was a gondolier
thy mother is 
dead said jacopo perceiving the other paused
to examine his notes
the depth the tone in which this word was
uttered caused a silence that the secretary did not
interrupt until he had thrown a glance backward
at the judges
she was not accused thy father s crime 
had she been signore she is long since beyond
the power the republic
shortly after thy father fell under the displeasure
 the state thou quitted thy business a
gondolier 
signore i did
thou art accused jacopo having laid aside
the oar foy the stiletto
signore i am
for several years the rumors thy bloody
deeds have been growing in venice until late
none have met with an untimely fate that the blow
has not been attributed to thy hand 
this is too true signor secretary i would it
were not 
the ears his highness and the councils
have not been closed to these reports but they have
long attended to the rumors with the earnestness
which becomes a paternal and careful government
if they have suffered thee to go at large it hath
only been that there might be no hazard sullying
q
 the bravo
the ermine justice with a premature and not sufficiently
supported judgment
jacopo bent his head but without speaking a
smile so wild and meaning however gleamed on
his face at this declaration that the permanent officer
 the secret tribunal he who served as its organ
 communication bowed nearly to the paper
he held as it might be to look deeper into his documents
let not the reader turn back to this page
in surprise when he shall have reached the explanation
 the tale for mysticism quite as palpable
if not so ruthless a character have been publicly
acted by political bodies in his own times
there is now a specific and a frightful charge
brought against thee jacopo frontoni continued
the secretary and in tenderness the citizen s
life the dreaded council itself hath taken the matter
in hand didst thou know a certain antonio vec
clio a fisherman here in our lagunes 
signore i knew him well late and much regret
that it was only late
thou knowest too that his body hath been
found drowned in the bay
jacopo shuddered signifying his assent merely
by a sign the effect this tacit acknowledgment
on the youngest the three was apparent
for he turned to his companions like one struck by
the confession it implied his colleagues made dignified
inclinations in return and the silent communication
ceased
his death has excited discontent among his fellows
and its cause has become a serious subject 
inquiry for the illustrious council
the death the meanest man in venice should
call forth the care the patricians signore
dost thou know jacopo that thou art accused
 being his murderer
signore i do
time bravo 
it is said that thou earnest among the gondoliers
in the late regatta and that but for this aged
fisherman thou would st have been winner the
prize
in that rumor hath not lied signore
thou dost not then deny the charge said the
examiner in evident surprise
it is certain that but for the fisherman i should
have been the winner
and thou wished it jacopo 
signore greatly returned the accused with a
show emotion that had not hitherto escaped
him i was a man condemned his fellows and
the oar had been my pride from childhood to that
hour
another movement the third inquisitor betrayed
equally his interest and his surprise
dost thou confess the crime
jacopo smiled but more in derision than with any
other feeling
if the illustrious senators here present will unmask
i may answer that question haply with greater
confidence he said
thy request is bold and out rule none
know the persons the patricians who preside over
the destinies the state dost thou confess the
crime
the entrance an officer in some haste prevented
a reply the man placed a written report
in the hands the inquisitor in red and withdrew
after a short pause the guards were ordered to retire
with their prisoner
great senators said jacopo advancing earnestly
towards the table as if he would seize the
moment to urge what he was about to say
mercy grant me your authority to visit one in
the prisons beneath the leads i have weighty 
the bravo
sons for the wish and i pray you as men and fathers
to grant it
the interest the two who were consulting
apart on the new intelligence prevented them from
listening to what he urged the other inquisitor
who was the signor soranzo had drawn near the
lamp anxious to read the lineaments one so notorious
and was gazing at his striking countenance
touched by the pathos his voice and agreeably
disappointed in the lineaments he studied he took
upon himself the power to grant the request
humor his wish he said to the halberdiers 
but have him in readiness to reappear
jacopo looked his gratitude but fearful that the
others might still interfere to prevent his wish he
hurried from the room
the march the little procession which proceeded
from the chamber the inquisition to the
summer cells its victims w r as sadly characteristic
 the place and the government
it went through gloomy and secret corridors
that were hid from the vulgar eye while thin partitions
only separated it from the apartments 
the doge which like the specious aspect the
state concealed the nakedness and misery within
by their gorgeousness and splendor on reaching
the attic jacopo stopped and turned to his conductors

if you are beings god s forming he said
take off these clanking chains though it be but fora
moment
the keepers regarded each other in surprise neither
offering to do the charitable office
i go to visit probably for the last time continued
the prisoner a bedridden i may say a
dying father who knows nothing my situation
will ye that he should see me thus
the appeal which was made more with the voice
the bravo 
and manner than in the words had its effect a
keeper removed the chains and bade him proceed
with a cautious tread jacopo advanced and when
the door was opened he entered the room alone
for none there had sufficient interest in an interview
between a common bravo and his father to
endure the glowing warmth the place the while
the door was closed after him and the room became
dark
notwithstanding his assumed firmness jacopo
hesitated when he found himself so suddenly introduced
to the silent misery the forlorn captive
a hard breathing told him the situation the
pallet but the walls which were solid on the side
 the corridor effectually prevented the admission
 light
father said jacopo with gentleness
he got no answer
father he repeated in a stronger voice
the breathing became more audible and then the
captive spoke
holy maria hears my prayers he said feebly
god hath sent thee son to close my eyes 
doth thy strength fail thee father
greatly my time is come i had hoped to seethe
light the day again to bless thy dear mother
and sister god s will be done 
they pray for us both father they are beyond
the power the senate
jacopo i do not understand thee
my mother and sister are dead they are saints
in heaven father
the old man groaned for the tie earth had
not yet been entirely severed jacopo heard him
murmuring a prayer and he knelt by the side his
pallet
this is a sudden blow whispered the old
man we depart together
 the bravo
they are long dead father
why hast thou not told me this before ja
copo
hadst thou not sorrows enough without this
now that thou art about to join them it will be
pleasant to know that they have so long been
happy
and thou thou wilt be alone give me thy
hand poor jacopo 
the bravo reached forth and took the feeble
member his parent it was clammy and cold
jacopo continued the captive whose mind still
sustained the body i have prayed thrice within
the hour once for my own soul once for the
peace thy mother lastly for thee 
bless thee father bless thee i have need
 prayer
i have asked god favor in thy behalf i
have bethought me all thy love and care 
all thy devotion to my age and sufferings when
thou wert a child jacopo tenderness for thee
tempted me to acts weakness i trembled lest
thy manhood might bring upon me pain and repentance
thou hast not known the yearnings 
a parent for his offspring but thou hast well requited
them kneel jacopo that i may ask god
once more to remember thee
i am at thy side father
the old man raised his feeble arms and with a
voice whose force appeared reviving he pronounced
a fervent and solemn benediction
the blessing a dying parent will sweeten
thy life jacopo he added after a pause and
give peace to thy last moments
it will do the latter father
a rude summons at the door interrupted them
come forth jacopo said a keeper the
council seeks thee 
the bravo 
jacopo felt the convulsive start his father but
he did not answer
will they not leave thee a few minutes longer
whispered the old men i shall not keep
thee long
the door opened and a gleam from the lamp fell
on the group in the cell the keeper had the humanity
to shut it again leaving all in obscurity
the glance which jacopo obtained by that passing
light was the last look he had his father s countenance
death was fearfully on it but the eyes
were turned in unutterable affection on his own
the man is merciful he will not shut thee
out murmured the parent
they cannot leave thee to die alone father 
son i am with my god yet i would gladly
have thee by my side didst thou say thy mother
and thy sister were dead 
dead
thy young sister too t 
father both they are saints in heaven
the old man breathed thick and there was silence
jacopo felt a hand moving in the darkness
as if in quest him he aided the effort and laid
the member in reverence on his own head
maria undefiled and her son who is god 
bless thee jacopo whispered a voice that to the
excited imagination the kneeling bravo appeared
to hover in the air the solemn words were followed
by a quivering sigh jacopo hid his face in
the blanket and prayed after which there was
deep quiet
father he asked trembling at his own
smothered voice
he was unanswered stretching out a hand it
touched the features a corpse with a firmness
that had the quality desperation he again bowed
 the bravo
his head and uttered fervently a prayer for the
dead
when the door the cell opened jacopo appeared
to the keeper with a dignity air that
belongs only to character and which was heightened
by the scene in which he had just been an
actor he raised his hands and stood immovable
while the manacles were replaced this office
done they walked away together in the direction
 the secret chamber it was not long ere all
were again in their places before the council 
three
jacopo frontoni resumed the secretary
thou art suspected being privy to another dark
deed that hath had place late within our city
hast thou any knowledge a noble calabriann
who hath high claim to the senate s honors and
who hath long had his abode in venice
signore i have
hast thou had aught concern with him 
signore yes
a movement common interest made itself apparent
among the auditors
dost thou know where the don camillo monforte
is at present
jacopo hesitated he so well understood the
means intelligence possessed by the council that
he doubted how far it might be prudent to deny his
connexion with the flight the lovers besides
at that moment his mind was deeply impressed with
a holy sentiment truth
canst thou say why the young duce is not to
be found in his palace repeated the secretary
illustrissimo he hath quitted venice for ever
how canst thou know this would he make
a confidant a common bravo 
the smile which crossed the features jacopo
was full superiority it caused the conscious
the bravo 
agent the secret tribunal to look closely at his
papers like one who felt its power
art thou his confidant i ask again
signore in this i am i have the assurance
from the mouth don camillo monforte himself
that he will not return
this is impossible since it would involve a loss
 all his fair hopes and illustrious fortunes
he consoled himself signore with the possession
 the heiress tiepolo s love and with her
riches
again there was a movement among the three
which all their practised restraint and the conventional
dignity their mysterious functions could
not prevent
let the keepers withdraw said the inquisitor
 the scarlet robe so soon as the prisoner was
alone with the three and their permanent officer
the examination continued the senators themselves
trusting to the effect produced by their masks and
some feints speaking as occasion offered
this is important intelligence that thou hast
communicated jacopo continued he the robe
 flame it may yet redeem thy life wert thou
wise enough to turn it to account
what would your eccellenza at my hands it
is plain that the council know the flight don
camillo nor will i believe that eyes which so seldom
are closed have not yet missed the daughter
 the tiepolo
both are true jacopo but what hast thou to
say the means remember that as thou findest
favor with the council thine own fate will be
decided
the prisoner suffered another those freezing
gleams to cross his face which invariably caused
his examiners to bend their looks aside
the means escape cannot be wanting to a
vol ii r
 the bravo
bold lover signore he replied don camillo is
rich and might employ a thousand agents had he
need them
thou art equivocating t will be the worse for
thee that thou trifles with the council who are
these agents 
he had a generous household eccellenza 
many hardy gondoliers and servitors all conditions

 these we have nothing to learn he hath
escaped by other means or art thou sure he hath
escaped at all 
signore is he in venice 
nay that we ask thee here is an accusation
found in the lion s mouth which charges thee
with his assassination
and the donna violetta s too eccellenza 
 her we have heard nothing what answer
dost make to the charge 
signore why should i betray my ow r n secrets 
ha art thou equivocating and faithless remember
that we have a prisoner beneath the leads
who can extract the truth from thee
jacopo raised his form to such an altitude as one
might fancy to express the mounting a liberated
spirit still his eye was sad and spite an effort
to the contrary his voice melancholy
senators he said your prisoner beneath the
leads is free
how thou art trifling in thy despair 
i speak truth the liberation so long delayed
hath come at last 
thy father 
is dead interrupted jacopo solemnly
the two elder members the council looked at
each other in surprise while their junior colleague
listened with the interest one who was just entering
on a noviciate secret and embarrassing
the bravo 
duties the former consulted together and then
they communicated as much their opinions to the
signor soranzo as they deemed necessary to the
occasion
wilt thou consult thine own safety jacopo and
reveal all thou knowest this affair the neapolitan
 continued the inquisitor when this byplay
was ended
jacopo betrayed no weakness at the menace implied
by the words the senator but after a moment
s reflection he answered with as much frankness
as he could have used at the confessional
it is known to you illustrious senator he said
that the state had a desire to match the heiress 
tiepolo to its own advantage that she was beloved
 the neapolitan noble and that as is wont
between young and virtuous hearts she returned
his love as became a maiden her high condition
and tender years is there any thing extraordinary
in the circumstance that two so illustrious hopes
should struggle to prevent their own misery signori
the night that old antonio died i was alone
among the graves the lido with many melancholy
and bitter thoughts and life had become a
burthen to me had the evil spirit which was then
uppermost maintained its mastery i might have
died the death a homeless suicide god sent don
camillo monforte to my succor praised be the
immaculate maria and her blessed son for the
mercy it was there i learned the wishes the
neapolitan and enlisted myself in his service i
swore to him senators venice to be true to die
in his cause should it be necessary and to help
him to his bride this pledge have i redeemed
the happy lovers are now in the states the
church and under the puissant protection the
cardinal secretary don camillo s mother s brother
 the bravo
fool why didst thou this hadst thou no
thought for thyself 
eccellenza but little i thought more finding
a human bosom to pour out my sufferings to
than your high displeasure i have not known
so sweet a moment in years as that in which i saw
the lord sant agata fold his beautiful and weeping
bride to his heart 
the inquisitors were struck with the quiet enthusiasm
 the bravo and surprise once more held
them in suspense at length the elder the three
resumed the examination
wilt thou impart the manner this escape
jacopo he demanded remember thou hast
still a life to redeem 
signore it is scarce worth the trouble but todo
you pleasure nothing shall be concealed
jacopo then recounted in simple and undisguised
terms the entire means employed by don camillo
in effecting his escape his hopes his disappointments
and his final success in this narrative nothing
was concealed but the place in which the
ladies had temporarily taken refuge and the name
 gelsomina even the attempt giacomo gras
on the life the neapolitan and the agency
 the hebrew were fully exposed none listened
to this explanation so intently as the young husband
notwithstanding his public duties his pulses quickened
as the prisoner dwelt on the different chances
 the lovers and when their final union was proclaimed
he felt his heart bound with delight on
the other hand his more practised colleagues heard
the detail the bravo with politic coolness the
effect all factitious systems is to render the feelings
subservient to expediency convention and
fiction take place passion and truth and like the
mussulman with his doctrine predestination there
is no one more acquiescent in defeat than he who
the bravo 
has obtained an advantage in the face nature and
justice his resignation being in common as perfect
as his previous arrogance was insupportable
the two old senators perceived at once that don
camillo and his fair companion were completely
beyond the reach their power and they instantly
admitted the wisdom making a merit necessity
having no farther occasion for jacopo they summoned
the keepers and dismissed him to his cell
it will be seemly to send letters congratulation
to the cardinal secretary on the union his
nephew with so rich an heiress our city said
the inquisitor the ten as the door closed on the
retiring group so great an interest as that the
neapolitan should be propitiated
but should he urge the state s resistance to his
hopes returned the signor soranzo in feeble objection
to so bold a scheme
we will excuse it as the act a former council
these misconceptions are the unavoidable consequences
 the caprices liberty signore the
steed that ranges the plains in the freedom nature
cannot be held to perfect command like the dull
beast that draws the car this is the first your
sittings in the three but experience will show you
that excellent as we are in system we are not quite
perfect in practice this is grave matter the
young gradenigo signori
i have long known his unworthiness returned
his more aged colleague it is a thousand pities
that so honorable and so noble a patrician should
have produced so ignoble a child but neither the
state nor the city can tolerate assassination
would it were less frequent exclaimed the
signore soranzo in perfect sincerity
would it were indeed there are hints in our
secret information which tend to confirm the charge
r
 the bravo
 jacopo though long experience has taught us
to put full faith in his reports
how is jacopo then an agent the police
 that more at our leisure signor soranzo at
present we must look to this attempt on the life 
one protected by our laws
the three then entered into a serious discussion
 the case the two delinquents venice like all
despotic governments had the merit great efficiency
in its criminal police when it was disposed
to exert it justice was sure enough in those instances
in which the interests the government
itself were not involved or in which bribery could
not well be used as to the latter through the
jealousy the state and the constant agency 
those who were removed from temptation by being
already in possession a monopoly benefits it
was by no means as frequent as in some other communities
in which the affluent were less interested
the signor soranzo had now a fair occasion for the
exercise his generous feelings though related
to the house gradenigo he was not backward in
decrying the conduct its heir his first impulses
were to make a terrible example the accused and
to show the world that no station brought with it in
venice impunity for crime from this view the
case however he was gradually enticed by his companions
who reminded him that the law commonly
made a distinction between the intention and the
execution an offence driven from his first determination
by the cooler heads his colleagues
the young inquisitor next proposed that the case
should be sent to the ordinary tribunals for judgment
instances had not been wanting in which the aristocracy
 venice sacrificed one its body to the
seemliness justice for when such cases were
managed with discretion they rather strengthened
than weakened their ascendency but the present
the bravo 
crime was known to be too common to permit so
lavish an expenditure their immunities and the
old inquisitors opposed the wish their younger
colleague with great plausibility and with some
show reason it was finally resolved that they
should themselves decide on the case
the next question was the degree punishment
the wily senior the council began by proposing
a banishment for a few months for giacomo gradenigh
was already obnoxious to the anger the
state on more accounts than one but this punishment
was resisted by the signor soranzo with the
ardor an uncorrupted and generous mind the
latter gradually prevailed his companions taking
care that their compliance should have the air a
concession to his arguments the result all this
management was that the heir gradenigo was
condemned to ten years retirement in the provinces
and hosea to banishment for life should the reader
be opinion that strict justice was not meted out to
the offenders he should remember that the hebrewought
to be glad to have escaped as he did
we must not conceal this judgment nor its
motive observed the inquisitor the ten when
the affair was concluded the state is never a
loser for letting its justice be known
nor for its exercise i should hope returned
the signor soranzo as our affairs are ended for
the night is it your pleasures signori that we return
to our palaces 
nay we have this matter jacopo
him may we now surely turn over to the ordinary
tribunals 
as you may decide signori is this your pleasure

both the others bowed assent and the usual preparations
were made for departure
ere the two seniors the council left the palace
 the bravo
however they held a long and secret conference
together the result was a private order to the
criminal judge and then they returned each to his
own abode like men who had the approbationof
their own consciences
on the other hand the signor soranzo hastened
to his own luxurious and happy dwelling for the
first time in his life he entered it with a distrust 
himself without being conscious the reason
he felt sad for he had taken the first step in that
tortuous and corrupting path which eventually
leads to the destruction all those generous and
noble sentiments which can only flourish apart
from the sophistry and fictions selfishness he
would have rejoiced to have been as light heart
as at the moment he handed his fairhaired partner
into the gondola that night but his head had pressed
the pillow for many hours before sleep drew a
veil over the solemn trifling with the most serious
 our duties in which he had been an actor
chapter xiii
art thou not guilty no indeed i am not
rogers
the following morning brought the funeral 
antonio the agents the police took the precaution
to circulate in the city that the senate permitted
this honor to the memory the old fisherman
on account his success in the regatta and
as some atonement for his unmerited and mysterious
death all the men the lagunes were assembled
in the square at the appointed hour in decent
guise flattered with the notice that their craft
the bravo 
received and more than half disposed to forget
their former anger in the present favor thus easy
is it for those who are elevated above their fellowcreatures
by the accident birth or by the opinions
 a factitious social organization to repair the
wrongs they do in deeds by small concessions 
their conventional superiority
masses were still chanted for the soul old
antonio before the altar st mark foremost
among the priests was the good carmelite who
had scarce known hunger or fatigue in his pious
desire to do the offices the church in behalf 
one whose fate he might be said to have witnessed
his zeal however in that moment excitement
passed unnoticed by all but those whose business it
was to suffer no unusual display character nor
any unwonted circumstance to have place without
attracting their suspicion as the carmelite finally
withdrew from the altar previously to the removal
 the body he felt the sleeve his robe slightly
drawn aside and yielding to the impulse he quickly
found himself among the columns that gloomy
church alone with a stranger
father thou hast shrived many a parting soul i 
observed rather than asked the other
it is the duty my holy office son
the state will note thy services there will be
need thee when the body this fisherman is
committed to the earth
the monk shuddered but making the sign the
cross he bowed his pale face in signification his
readiness to discharge the duty at that moment
the bearers lifted the body and the procession issued
upon the great square first marched the
usual lay underlings the cathedral who were
followed by those who chanted the offices the
occasion among the latter the carmelite hastened
to take his station next came the corpse without
 the bravo
a coffin for that is a luxury the grave even now
unknown to the italians old antonio s degree
the body was clad in the holiday vestments a
fisherman the hands and feet being naked a cross
lay on the breast the gray hairs were blowing
about in the air and in frightful adornment the
ghastliness death a bouquet flowers was
placed upon the mouth the bier was rich in gilding
and carving another melancholy evidence 
the lingering wishes and false direction human
vanity
next to this characteristic equipage the dead
walked a lad whose brown cheek halfnaked body
and dark roving eye announced the grandson 
the fisherman venice knew when to yield gracefully
and the boy was liberated unconditionally
from the galleys in pity as it was whispered for
the untimely fate his parent there was the aspiring
look the dauntless spirit and the rigid honesty
 antonio in the bearing the lad but these
qualities were now smothered by a natural grief
and as in the case him whose funeral escort he
followed something obscured by the rude chances
 his lot from time to time the bosom the
generous boy heaved as they marched along the
quay taking the route the arsenal and there
were moments that his lips quivered grief threatening
to overcome his manhood
still not a tear wetted his cheek until the body
disappeared from his view then nature triumphed
and straying from out the circle he took a seat apart
and wept as one his years and simplicity would
be apt to weep at finding himself a solitary wanderer
in the wilderness the world
thus terminated the incident antonio vecchio
the fisherman whose name soon ceased to be mentioned
in that city mysteries except on the lagunes
where the men his craft long vaunted his
the bravo 
merit with the net and the manner in which he bore
away the prize from the best oars venice his
descendant lived and toiled like others his condition
and we will here dismiss him by saying that
he so far inherited the native qualities his ancestor
that he forbore to appear a few hours later in
the crowd which curiosity and vengeance drew
into the piazzetta
father anselmo took boat to return to the canals
and when he landed at the quay the smaller
square it was with the hope that he would now be
permitted to seek those whose fate he was still
ignorant but in whom he felt so deep an interest
not so however the individual who had addressed
him in the cathedral was apparently in waiting
and knowing the uselessness as well as the danger
 remonstrance where the state was concerned
the carmelite permitted himself to be conducted
whither his guide pleased they took a devious
route but it led them to the public prisons here
the priest was shown into the keeper s apartment
where he was desired to wait a summons from his
companion
our business now leads us to the cell jacopo
on quitting the presence the three he had been
remanded to his gloomy room where he passed the
night like others similarly situated with the appearance
 the dawn the bravo had been led before
those who ostensibly discharged the duties 
his judges we say ostensibly for justice never
was yet pure under a system in which the governors
have an interest in the least separated from that
 the governed for in all cases which involve the
ascendency the existing authorities the instinct
 selfpreservation is as certain to bias their decision
as that life is to cause man to shun danger
if such is the fact in countries milder sway the
reader will easily believe in its existence in a state
 the bravo
like that venice as may have been anticipated
those who sat in judgment on jacopo had their instructions
arid the trial that he sustained was rather
a concession to appearances than an homage to
the laws all the records were duly made witnesses
were examined or said to be examined and
care was had to spread the rumor in the city that
the tribunals were at length occupied in deciding on
the case the extraordinary man who had so
long been permitted to exercise his bloody profession
with impunity even in the centre the canals
during the morning the credulous tradesmen were
much engaged in recounting to each other the different
flagrant deeds that in the course the last
three or four years had been imputed to his hand
one spoke the body a stranger that had been
found near the gaminghouses frequented by those
who visited venice another recalled the fate 
the young noble who had fallen by the assassin s
blow even on the rialto and another went into the
details a murder which had deprived a mother
 her only son and the daughter a patrician 
her love in this manner as one after another contributed
to the list a little group assembled on the
quay enumerated no less than fiveandtwenty lives
which were believed to have been taken by the
hand jacopo without including the vindictive
and useless assassination him whose funeral rites
had just been celebrated happily perhaps for his
peace mind the subject all these rumors and
 the maledictions which they drew upon his head
knew nothing either before his judges he had
made no defence whatever firmly refusing to answer
their interrogatories
ye know what i have done messires he said
haughtily and what i have not done ye know
as for yourselves look to your own interests
when again in his cell he demanded food and
the bravo 
ate tranquilly though with moderation every instrument
which could possibly be used against his
life was then removed his irons were finally and
carefully examined and he was left to his thoughts
it was in this situation that the prisoner heard the
approach footsteps to his cell the bolts turned
and the door opened the form a priest appeared
between him and the day the latter however
held a lamp which as the cell was again shut and
secured he placed on the low shelf that held the
jug and loaf the prisoner
jacopo received his visitor calmly but with the
deep respect one who reverenced his holy office
he arose crossed himself and advanced as far as
the chains permitted to do him honor
thou art welcome father he said in cutting
me off from earth the council i see does not wish
to cut me off from god
that would exceed their power son he who
died for them shed his blood for thee if thou wilt
not reject his grace but heaven knows i say it
with reluctance thou art not to think that one 
thy sins jacopo can have hope without deep and
heartfelt repentance 
father have any
the carmelite started for the point the question
and the tranquil tones the speaker had a
strange effect in such an interview
thou art not what i had supposed thee ja
copo he answered thy mind is not altogether
obscured in darkness and thy crimes have been
committed against the consciousness their enormity

i fear this is true reverend monk
thou must feel their weight in the poignancy 
grief in the father anselmo stopped for a sob
at that moment apprized them that they were
not alone moving aside in a little alarm the acvol
ii s
 the bravo
tion discovered the figure the shrinking gelso
mina who had entered the cell favored by the
keepers and concealed by the robes the carmelite
jacopo groaned when he beheld her form
and turning away he leaned against the wall
daughter why art thou here and who art
thou demanded the monk
tis the child the principal keeper said ja
copo perceiving that she was unable to answer
one known to me in my frequent adventures in
this prison
the eye father anselmo wandered from one
to the other at first its expression was severe
and then as it saw each countenance in turn it became
less unkind until it softened at the exhibition
 their mutual agony
this comes human passions he said in a
tone between consolation and reproof such are
ever the fruits crime
father said jacopo with earnestness i may
deserve the word but the angels in heaven are
scarce purer than this weeping girl 
i rejoice to hear it i will believe thee unfortunate
man and glad am i that thy soul is relieved
from the sin having corrupted one so youthful
the bosom the prisoner heaved while gelso
mina shuddered
why hast thou yielded to the weakness nature
and entered the cell asked the good carmelite
endeavoring to throw into his eye a reproof
that the pathos and kindness his tones contradicted
 didst thou know the character the man
thou loved
immaculate maria exclaimed the girl no
no no
and now that thou hast learned the truth surely
thou art no longer the victim wayward fancies

the bravo 
the gaze gelsomina was bewildered but anguish
prevailed over all other expression she
bowed her head partly in shame but more in sorrow
without answering
i know not children what this interview
can answer continued the monk i am sent
hither to receive the last confession a bravo and
surely one who has so much cause to condemn the
deception he has practised would not wish to hear
the details such a life
no no no murmured gelsomina again
enforcing her words with a wild gesture the
hand
it is better father that she should believe me
all that her fancy can imagine as monstrous said
jacopo in a thick voice she will then learn to
hate my memory
gelsomina did not speak but the negative gesture
was repeated franticly
the heart the poor child hath been sorely
touched said the carmelite with concern we
must not treat so tender a flower rudely hearken
to me daughter and consult thy reason more than
thy weakness
question her not father let her curse me
and depart
carlo shrieked gelsomina
a long pause succeeded the monk perceived
that human passion was superior to his art and
that the case must be left to time while the prisoner
maintained within himself a struggle more fierce
than any which it had yet been his fate to endure
the lingering desires the world conquered and
he broke silence
father he said advancing to the length his
chain and speaking both solemnly and with dignity
i had hoped i had prayed that this unhappy but
innocent creature might have turned from her own
 the bravo
weakness with nothing when she came to know
that the man she loved was a bravo but i did
injustice to the heart woman tell me gelso
mina and as thou values thy salvation deceive me
not canst thou look at me without horror
gelsomina trembled but she raised her eyes and
smiled on him as the weeping infant returns the
earnest and tender regard its mother the effect
 that glance on jacopo was so powerful that his
sinewy frame shook until the wondering carmelite
heard the clanking his chains
tis enough he said struggling to command
himself gelsomina thou shalt hear my confession
thou hast long been mistress one great secret
none other shall be hid from thee
antonio gasped the girl carlo carlo
what had that aged fisherman done that thy hand
should seek his life
antonio echoed the monk dost thou stand
charged with his death my son 
it is the crime for which i am condemned to
die
the carmelite sank upon the stool the prisoner
and sat motionless looking with an eye horror
from the countenance the unmoved jacopo
to that his trembling companion the truth began
to dawn upon him though his mind was still
enveloped in the web venetian mystery
here is some horrible mistake he whispered
i will hasten to thy judges and undeceive them
the prisoner smiled calmly as he reached out a
hand to arrest the zealous movement the simple
carmelite
twill be useless he said it is the pleasure
 the three that i should suffer for old antonio s
death
then wilt thou die unjustly i am a witness
that he fell by other hands
the bravo 
father shrieked gelsomina oh repeat the
words say that carlo could not do the cruel deed 
 that murder at least is he innocent
gelsomina said jacopo struggling to stretch
forth his arms towards her and yielding to a full
heart arid every other 
a cry wild delight burst from the lips the
girl who in the next instant lay senseless on his
bosom
we draw the veil before the scene that followed
near an hour must pass before we can again remove
it the cell then exhibited a group in its centre
over which the lamp shed its feeble light marking
the countenances the different personages with
strong tints and deep shadows in a manner to bring
forth all the force italian expression the carmelite
was seated on the stool while jacopo and
gelsomina knelt beside him the former the two
last was speaking earnestly while his auditors
caught each syllable that issued from his lips as
if interest in his innocence were still stronger than
curiosity
i have told you father he continued that a
false accusation having wronged the customs
brought my unhappy parent under the senate s displeasure
and that he was many years an innocent
inhabitant one these accursed cells while we
believed him in exile among the islands at length
we succeeded in getting such proof before the council
as ought to have satisfied the patricians their
own injustice i am afraid that when men pretend
that the chosen the earth exercise authority they
are not ready to admit their errors for it would be
proof against the merit their system the council
delayed a weary time to do us justice so long
that my poor mother sank under her sufferings my
sister a girl gelsomina s years followed her
soon for the only reason given by the state when
s
 the bravo
pressed for proof was the suspicion that one who
sought her love was guilty the crime for which
my unhappy father perished
and did they refuse to repair their injustice
exclaimed the carmelite
they could not do it father without publishing
their fallibility the credit certain great patricians
was concerned and i fear there is a morality
in these councils which separates the deed the
man from those the senators putting policy before
justice
this may be true son for when a community
is grounded on false principles its interests must 
necessity be maintained by sophisms god will
view this act with a different eye 
else would the world be hopeless father after
years prayers and interest i was under a solemn
oath secrecy admitted to my father s cell there
was happiness in being able to administer to his
wants in hearing his voice in kneeling for his
blessing gelsomina was then a child approaching
womanhood i knew not their motive though afterthoughts
left it no secret and i was permitted to see
my father through her means when they believed
that i was sufficiently caught in their toils i was led
into that fatal error which has destroyed my hopes
and brought me to this condition
thou hast affirmed thy innocence my son 
innocent shedding blood father but not 
lending myself to their artifices i will not weary
you holy monk with the history the means by
which they worked upon my nature i was sworn
to serve the state as its secret agent for a certain
time the reward was to be my father s freedom
had they taken me in the world and in my senses
their arts would not have triumphed but a daily
witness the sufferings him who had given me
life and who was now all that was left me in the
the bravo 
world they were too strong for my weakness they
whispered to me racks and wheels and i was
shown paintings dying martyrs that i might understand
the agony they could inflict assassinations
were frequent and called for the care the
police in short father jacopo hid his face in the
dress gelsomina i consented to let them circulate
such tales as might draw the eye the public
on me i need not add that he who lends himself to
his own infamy will soon attain his object
with what was this miserable falsehood
invented
father i was applied to as to a public bravo
and my reports in more ways than one answered
their designs that i saved some lives is at least
a consolation for the error or crime into which
i fell
i understand thee jacopo i have heard that
venice did not hesitate to use the ardent and brave
in this manner holy st mark can deceit like
this be practised under the sanction thy blessed
name
father it is and more i had other duties connected
with the interests the republic and 
course i was practised in their discharge the
citizens marvelled that one like me should go at
large while the vindictive and revengeful took the
circumstance as a proof address when rumor
grew too strong for appearances the three took
measures to direct it to other things and when it
grew too faint for their wishes it was fanned in
short for three long and bitter years did i pass the
life the damned sustained only by the hope 
liberating my father and cheered by the love this
innocent
poor jacopo thou art to be pitied i will remember
thee in my prayers
and thou gelsomina
 the bravo
the keeper s daughter did not answer her ears
had drunk in each syllable that fell from his lips and
now that the whole truth began to dawn on her
mind there was a bright radiance in her eye that
appeared almost supernatural to those who witnessed
it
if i have failed in convincing thee gelsomina
continued jacopo that i am not the wretch i
seemed would that i had been dumb 
she stretched a hand towards him and dropping
her head on his bosom wept
i see all thy temptations poor carlo she said
softly i know how strong was thy love for thy
father
dost thou forgive me dearest gelsomina for the
deception on thy innocence
there was no deception i believed thee a son
ready to die for his father and i find thee what i
thought thee
the good carmelite regarded this scene with
eyes interest and indulgence tears wetted his
cheeks
thy affection for each other children he said
is such as angels might indulge has thy intercourse
been long date
it has lasted years father
and thou daughter hast been with jacopo in
the cell his parent
i was his constant guide on these holy errands
father
the monk mused deeply after a silence 
several minutes he proceeded to the duties his
holy office receiving the spiritual confession 
the prisoner he gave the absolution with a fervor
which proved how deeply his sympathies were enlisted
in behalf the youthful pair this duty
done he gave gelsomina his hand and there was a
the bravo 
mild confidence in his countenance as he took leave
 jacopo
we quit thee he said but be heart son
i cannot think that even venice will be deaf to a
tale like thine trust first to thy god and believe
that neither this faithful girl nor i will abandon thee
without an effort
jacopo received this assurance like one accustomed
to exist in extreme jeopardy the smile which
accompanied his own adieux had in it as much 
incredulity as melancholy it was however
full the joy a lightened heart
chapter xiv
your heart
is free and quick with virtuous wrath to accuse
appearances and views a criminal
in innocence s shadow
werner
the carmelite and gelsomina found the keepers
in waiting and when they quitted the cell its door
was secured for the night as they had no farther
concerns with the jailers they passed on unquestioned
but when the the corridor which led
towards the apartments the keeper was reached
the monk stopped
art thou equal to a great effort in order that
the innocent shall not die he suddenly asked
though with a solemnity that denoted the influence
 a high and absorbing motive
father
i would know if thy love for the youth can 
the bravo
tain thee in a trying scene for without this effort
he will surely perish 
i would die to save jacopo a pang 
deceive not thyself daughter canst thou forget
thy habits overstep the diffidence thy years
and condition stand and speak fearlessly in the
presence the great and dreaded
reverend carmelite i speak daily without fear
though not without awe to one more to be dreaded
than any in venice
the monk looked in admiration at the gentle being
whose countenance was glowing with the mild
resolution innocence and affection and he motioned
for her to follow
we will go then before the proudest and the
most fearful earth should there be occasion he
resumed we will do our duty to both parties to
the oppressor and the oppressed that the sin 
omission lie not on our souls
father anselmo without further explanation led
the obedient girl into that part the palace which
was known to be appropriated to the private uses 
the titular head the republic
the jealousy the veneti an patricians on the
subject their doge is matter history he
was by situation a puppet in the hands the nobles
who only tolerated his existence because the
theory their government required a seeming agent
in the imposing ceremonies that formed part their
specious system and in their intercourse with other
states he dwelt in his palace like the queenbee
in the hive pampered and honored to the eye butin
truth devoted to the objects those who alone
possess the power to injure and perhaps we might
add like the insect named known for consuming
more than a usual portion the fruits the common
industry
father anselmo was indebted to his own decisive
bravo 
ion and to the confidence his manner in reaching
the private apartments a prince thus secluded
and watched he was permitted to pass by
various sentinels who imagined from his holy calling
and calm step that he was some friar employed
in his usual and privileged office by this easy
quiet method did the carmelite and his companion
penetrate to the very antechamber the sovereign
a spot that thousands had been defeated in attempting
to reach by means more elaborate
there were merely two or three drowsy inferior
officers the household in waiting one arose
quickly at the unexpected appearance these unknown
visitors expressing by the surprise and the
confusion his eye the wonder into which he was
thrown by so unlookedfor guests
his highness waits for us i fear simply observed
father anselmo who had known how to
quiet his concern in a look passive courtesy
santa maria holy father you should know
best but 
we will not lose more time in idle words son
when there has already been this delay show us
to the closet his highness
it is forbidden to usher any unannounced into
the presence 
thou seest this is not an ordinary visit go
inform the doge that the carmelite he expects and
the youthful maiden in whom his princely bosom
feels so parental an interest await his pleasure
his highness has then commanded 
tell him moreover that time presses for the
hour is near when innocence is condemned to suffer

the usher was deceived by the gravity and assurance
 the monk he hesitated and then throwing
open a door he showed the visitors into an
inner room where he requested them to await his
 the bravo
return after this he went on the desired commission
to the closet his master
it has already been shown that the reigning doge
if such a title can be used a prince who was
merely a tool the aristocracy was a man advanced
in years he had thrown aside the cares
 the day and in the retirement his privacy
was endeavoring to indulge those human sympathies
that had so little play in the ordinary duties
 his factitious condition by holding intercourse with
the mind one the classics his country his
state was laid aside for lighter ease and personal
freedom the monk could not have chosen a happier
moment for his object since the man was undefended
by the usual appliances his rank and
he was softened by communion with one who had
known how to mould and temper the feelings his
readers at will so entire was the abstraction 
the doge at the moment that the usher entered unheeded
and had stood in respectful attention to his
sovereign s pleasure near a minute before he was
seen
what would st thou marco demanded the
prince when his eye rose from the page
signore returned the officer using the familiar
manner in which those nearest to the persons
 princes are permitted to indulge here are the
reverend carmelite and the young girl in waiting
how sayest thou a carmelite and a girl 
signore the same those whom your highness
expects
what bold pretence is this 
signore i do but repeat the words the monk
tell his highness said the father that the carmelite
he wishes to see and the young girl in
whose happiness his princely bosom feels so parental
an interest await his pleasure 
there passed a glow in which indignation was
the bravo 
brighter than shame over the wasted cheek the
old prince and his eye kindled
and this to me even in my palace 
pardon signore this is no shameless priest
like so many that disgrace the tonsure both monk
and girl have innocent and harmless looks and i
do suspect your highness may have forgotten
the bright spots disappeared from the prince s
cheeks and his eye regained its paternal expression
but age and experience in his delicate duties
had taught the doge venice caution he
well knew that memory had not failed him and heat
once saw that a hidden meaning lay concealed
beneath an application so unusual there might bea
device his enemies who were numerous and
active or in truth there might be some justifiable
motive to warrant the applicant in resorting to a
measure so hardy
did the carmelite way more good marco he
asked after deep reflection
signore he said there was great urgency as
the hour was near when the innocent might suffer
i doubt not that he comes with a petition in behalf
 some young indiscreet for there are said to be
several young nobles arrested for their follies in the
carnival the female may be a sister disguised
bid one thy companions come hither and
when i touch my bell do thou usher these visitors
to my presence
the attendant withdrew taking care to pass into
the antechamber by doors that rendered it unnecessary
to show himself too soon to those who expected
his return the second usher quickly made
his appearance and was immediately dispatched inquest
 one the three who was occupied with
important papers in an adjoining closet the senator
was not slow to obey the summons for he apvol
ii t
 the bravo
feared there as a friend the prince having been
admitted publicly and with the customary honors
here are visitors an unusual character signore
said the doge rising to receive him whom
he had summoned in precaution to himself and i
would have a witness their requests
your highness does well to make us the senate
share your labors though if any mistaken opinion
 the necessity has led you to conceive it important
to call a counsellor each time a guest enters
the palace 
it is well signore mildly interrupted the
prince touching the bell i hope my importunity
has not deranged you but here come those i expect

father anselmo and gelsomina entered the closet
together the first glance convinced the doge that
he received strangers he exchanged looks with
the member the secret council and each saw in
the other s eye that the surprise was mutual
when fairly in the presence the carmelite threw
back his cowl entirely exposing the whole his
ascetic features while gelsomina awed by the rank
 him whoreceived them shrunk abashed partly
concealed by his robes
what means this visit demanded the prince
whose finger pointed to the shrinking form the
girl while his eye rested steadily on that the
monk and that unusual companion neither the
hour nor the mode is customary
father anselmo stood before the venetian sovereign
for the first time accustomed like all 
that region and more especially in that age to calculate
his chances success warily before venturing
to disburse his mind the monk fastened a
penetrating look on his interrogator
illustrious prince he said we come petitioners
for justice they who are thus commissioned had
the bravo 
need be bold lest they do their own character and
their righteous office discredit
justice is the glory st mark and the happiness
 his subjects thy course father is not according
to established rules and wholesome restraints
but it may have its apology name thy errand

there is one in the cells condemned the public
tribunals and he must die with the return 
day unless your princely authority interfere to save
him
one condemned the tribunals may merit his
fate
i am the ghostly adviser the unhappy youth
and in the execution my sacred office i have
learned that he is innocent
didst thou say condemned the common
judges father 
sentenced to die highness by a decree the
criminal tribunals
the prince appeared relieved so long as the
affair had been public there was at least reason to
believe he might indulge his love the species by
listening farther without offence to the tortuous
policy the state glancing his eye at the motionless
inquisitor as if to seek approbation he advanced
a step nearer to the carmelite with increasing
interest in the application
by what authority reverend priest dost thou
impeach the decision the judges he demanded
signore as i have just said in virtue knowledge
gained in the exercise my holy office he has
laid bare his soul to me as one whose feet were in
the grave and though offending like all born 
woman towards his god he is guiltless as respects
the state
thickest thou father that the law would ever
reach its victim were we to listen only to selfaccuses
the bravo
nations i am old monk and have long worn that
troublesome cap pointing to the horned bonnet
which lay near his hand the symbol his state
and in my day i do not recall the criminal that
has not fancied himself the victim untoward circumstances

that men apply this treacherous solace to their
consciences one my vocation has not to learn
our chief task is to show the delusion those
who while condemning their own sins by words
 confession and selfabasement make a merit 
humility but doge venice there is still a virtue
in the sacred rite i have this evening been required
to perform which can overcome the mounting 
the most exalted spirit many attempt to deceive
themselves at the confessional while by the pow r er
 god few succeed
praised be the blessed mother and the incarnate
son that it is so returned the prince struck by
the mild faith the monk and crossing himself
reverently father thou hast forgotten to name
the condemned 
it is a certain jacopo frontoni a reputed
bravo
the start the changing color and the glance 
the prince venice w r ere full natural surprise
tallest thou the bloodiest stiletto that ever disgraced
the city the weapon a reputed bravo 
the arts the monster have prevailed over thy experience
monk the true confession such a
wretch would be but a history bloody and revolting
crimes
i entered his cell with this opinion but i left it
convinced that the public sentiment has done him
wrong if your highness will deign hear his tale
you will think him a fit subject for your pity rather
than for punishment
 all the criminals my reign this is the
the bravo 
last in whose favor i could have imagined there
was aught to be said speak freely carmelite 
for curiosity is as strong as wonder
so truly did the doge give utterance to his feelings
that he momentarily forgot the presence 
the inquisitor whose countenance might have
shown him that the subject was getting to be grave
the monk ejaculated a thanksgiving for it was
not always easy in that city mystery to bring truth
to the ears the great when men live under a
system duplicity more or less the quality gets
interwoven with the habits the most ingenuous
although they may remain themselves unconscious
 the taint thus father anselmo as he proceeded
with the desired explanation touched more tenderly
on the practices the state and used more
 reserve in alluding to those usages and opinions
which one his holy calling and honest nature
under other circumstances would have fearlesslycondemned

it may not be known to one your high condition
sovereign prince resumed the carmelite
that an humble but laborious mechanic this city
a certain francesco frontoni was long since condemned
for frauds against the republic s revenue
this is a crime st mark never fails to visit with
his heavy displeasure for when men place the
goods the world before all other considerations
they mistake the objects which have brought them
together in social union
father thou wert speaking a certain francesco
frontoni 
highness such was his name the unhappy
man had taken into his confidence and friendship
one who pretending to his daughter s love might
appear to be the master his secrets when this
false suitor stood on the verge detection for offences
against the customs he laid a snare 

 the bravo
caption which while he was permitted to escape
drew the anger the state on his too confiding
friend francesco was condemned to the cells until
he might reveal facts which never had an existence

this is a hard fate reverend friar could it be
but proved
tis the evil secrecy and intrigue great doge
in managing the common interests 
hast thou more this francesco monk
his history is short signore for at the age when
most men are active in looking to their welfare he
was pining in a prison
i remember to have heard some such accusation
but it occurred in the reign the last doge
did it not father
and he has endured to near the close the
reign this highness 
how the senate when apprized the error
 its judgment was not slow to repair the wrong 
the monk regarded the prince earnestly as if he
would make certain whether the surprise he witnessed
was not a piece consummate acting he felt
convinced that the affair was one that class 
acts w which however oppressive unjust and destructive
 personal happiness had not sufficient
importance to come before them who govern under
systems which care more for their own preservation
than for the good the ruled signor
doge he said the state is discreet in matters that
touch its own reputation there are reasons that i
shall not presume to examine why the cell poor
francesco was kept closed long after the death and
confession his accuser left his innocence beyond
dispute
the prince mused and then he bethought him to
consult the countenance his companion the
marble the pilaster against which he leaned was
the bravo 
not more cold and unmoved than the face the inquisitor
the man had learned to smother every
natural impulse in the assumed and factitious duties
 his office
and what has this case francesco to do with
the execution the bravo demanded the doge
after a pause in which he had in vain struggled to
assume the indifference his counsellor
that i shall leave this prisonkeeper s daughter
to explain stand forth child and relate what you
know remembering if you speak before the prince
 venice that you also speak before the king 
heaven
gelsomina trembled for one her habits however
supported by her motives could not overcome
a nature so retiring without a struggle but faithful
to her promise and sustained by her affection for
the condemned she advanced a step and stood no
longer concealed by the robes the carmelite
thou art the daughter the prisonkeeper 
asked the prince mildly though surprise was strongly
painted in his eye
highness we are poor and we are unfortunate 
we serve the state for bread
ye serve a noble master child dost thou know
aught this bravo
dread sovereign they that call him thus know
not his heart one more true to his friends more
faithful to his word or more suppliant with the saints
than jacopo frontoni is not in venice 
this is a character which art might appropriate
even to a bravo but we waste the moments
what have these frontoni in common
highness they are father and son when jacopo
came to be an age to understand the misfortunes
 his family he wearied the senators with applications
in his father s behalf until they commanded the
door the cell to be secretly opened to a child so
 the bravo
pious i well know great prince that they who rule
cannot have all seeing eyes else could this wrong
never have happened but francesco wasted years
in cells chill and damp in winter and scorching in
summer before the falsehood the accusation was
known then as some relief to sufferings so little
merited jacopo was admitted
with what object girl 
highness was it not in pity they promised
too that in good time the service the son should
buy the father s liberty the patricians were slow
to be convinced and they made terms with poor
jacopo who agreed to undergo a hard service that
his father might breathe free air before he died
thou dearest in enigmas
i am little used great doge to speak in such a
presence or on such subjects but this i know that
for three weary years hath jacopo been admitted to
his father s cell and that those up above consented
to the visits else would my father have denied them
i was his companion in the holy act and will call
the blessed maria and the saints 
girl didst thou know him for a bravo 
oh highness no to me he seemed a dutiful
child fearing god and honoring his parent i hope
never to feel another pang like that which chilled
my heart when they said he i had known as the
kind carlo was hunted in venice as the abhorred
jacopo but it is passed the mother god be
praised 
thou art betrothed to this condemned man
the color did not deepen on the cheek gelso
mina at this abrupt question for the tie between her
and jacopo had become too sacred for the ordinary
weaknesses her sex
highness yes we were to be married should
it have pleased god and those great senators who
the bravo 
have so much influence over the happiness the
poor to permit it
and thou art still willing knowing the man to
pledge thy vows to one like jacopo 
it is because i do know him to be as he is that
i most reverence him great doge he has sold his
time and his good name to the state in order to
save his imprisoned father and in that i see nothing
to frighten one he loves
this affair needs explanation carmelite the
girl has a heated fancy and she renders that obscure
she should explain
illustrious prince she would say that the republic
was content to grant the son the indulgence
 visiting the captive with some encouragement
 his release on condition that the youth might
serve the police by bearing a bravo s reputation
and for this incredible tale father you have the
word a condemned criminal 
with the near view death before his eyes
there are means rendering truth evident familiar
to those who are often near the dying penitents
that are unknown to those the world
in any case signore the matter is worthy investigation

in that thou art right is the hour named for
the execution
with the morning light prince
and the father
is dead
a prisoner carmelite 
a prisoner prince venice
there was a pause
hast thou heard the death one named
antonio
signore yes by the sacred nature my holy
office do i affirm that this crime is jacopo innocent
 i shrived the fisherman
 the bravo
the doge turned away for the truth began to
dawn upon him and the flush which glowed on his
aged cheek contained a confession that might not
be observed by every eye he sought the glance
 his companion but his own expression human
feeling was met by the disciplined features 
the other as light is coldly repelled from polished
stone
highness added a tremulous voice
what would st thou child
there is a god for the republic as well as for
the gondolier your highness will turn this great
crime from venice 
thou art plain speech girl 
the danger carlo has made me bold you
are much beloved by the people and none speak
 you that they do not speak your goodness
and your desire to serve the poor you are the
root a rich and happy family and you will not
nay you cannot if you would think it a crime
for a son to devote all to a father you are our
father and we have a right to come to you even
for mercy but highness i ask only for justice
justice is the motto venice
they who live in the high favor providence
do not always know what the unhappy undergo
it has pleased god to afflict my own poor mother
who has griefs that but for her patience and christian
faith would have been hard to bear the
little care i had it in my power to show first caught
jacopo s eye for his heart was then full the duty
 the child would your highness consent to see
poor carlo or to command him to be brought hither
his simple tale would give the lie to every foul slander
they have dared to say against him
it is unnecessary it is unnecessary thy faith
in his innocence girl is more eloquent than any
words his can prove
the bravo 
a gleam joy irradiated the face gelsomina
who turned eagerly to the listening monk as she
continued
his highness listens she said and we shall
prevail father they menace in venice and
alarm the timid but they will never do the deed we
feared is not the god jacopo my god and
your god the god the senate and the doge 
 the council and the republic i would the
secret members the three could have seen poor
jacopo as i have seen him coming from his toil
weary with labor and heartbroken with delay enter
the winter or the summer cell chilling or scorching
as the season might be and struggling to be cheerful
that the falsely accused might not feel a greater
weight misery oh venerable and kind prince
you little know the burthen that the feeble are often
made to carry for to you life has been sunshine 
but there are millions who are condemned to do
that they lethe that they may not do that they
dread
child thou tell st me nothing new
except in convincing you highness that jack
po is not the monster they would have him i do
not know the secret reasons the councils for
wishing the youth to lend himself to a deception
that had nigh proved so fatal but all is explained
we have naught now to fear come father we
will leave the good and just doge to go to rest as
suits his years and we will return to gladden the
heart jacopo with our success and thank the
blessed maria for her favor
stay exclaimed the halfstifled old man is
this true that thou tallest me girl father can it
be so
signore i have said all that truth and my conscience
have prompted
the prince seemed bewildered turning his look
 the bravo
from the motionless girl to the equally immovable
member the three
come hither child he said his once trembling
as he spoke come hither that i may bless thee
gelsomina sprang forward and knelt at the feet 
her sovereignfather anselmo never uttered a
clearer or more fervent benediction than that which
fell from the lips the prince venice he
raised the daughter the prisonkeeper and motioned
for both his visitors to withdraw gelsomi
na willingly complied for her heart was already in
the cell jacopo in the eagerness to communicate
her success but the carmelite lingered to cast a
look behind like one better acquainted with the
effects worldly policy when connected with the
interests those who pervert governments to the
advantage the privileged as he passed through
the door however he felt his hopes revive for he
saw the aged prince unable any longer to suppress
his feelings hastening towards his still silent companions
with both hands extended eyes moistening
with tears and a look that betrayed the emotions
 one anxious to find relief in human sympathies
chapter xvi
on on
it is our knell or that venice on
marino falter
another morning called the venetians to their
affairs agents the police had been active in
preparing the public mind and as the sun rose
above the narrow sea the squares began to fill
there were present the curious citizen in his cloak
the bravo 
and cap barelegged laborers in wondering awe
the circumspect hebrew in his gaberdine and
beard masked gentlemen and many an attentive
stranger from among the thousands who still frequented
that declining mart it was rumored that
an act retributive justice was about to take place
for the peace the town and the protection the
citizen in short curiosity idleness and revenge
with all the usual train human feelings had
drawn together a multitude eager to witness the
agonies a fellowcreature
the dalmatians were drawn up near the sea ina
manner to inclose the two granite columns the
piazzetta their grave and disciplined faces fronted
inwards towards the african pillars those wellknown
landmarks death a few grim warriors
 higher rank paced the flags before the troops
while a dense crowd filled the exterior space by
special favor more than a hundred fishermen were
grouped within the armed men witnesses that their
class had revenge between the lofty pedestals 
st theodore and the winged lion lay the block 
ax the basket and the sawdust the usual accompaniments
 justice in that day by their side
stood the executioner
at length a movement in the living mass drew
every eye towards the gate the palace a murmur
arose the multitude waved and a small body
 the sbirri came into view their steps were
swift like the march destiny the dalmatians
opened to receive these ministers fate into their
bosom and closing their ranks again appeared to
preclude the world with its hopes from the condemned
on reaching the block between the columns
the sbirri fell off in files waiting at a little
distance while jacopo was left before the engines
 death attended by his ghostly counsellor the
vol ii u
 the bravo
carmelite the action left them open to the gaze
 the throng
father anselmo was in the usual attire a barefooted
friar his order the cowl the holy man
was thrown back exposing his mortified lineaments
and selfexamining eye to those around the expression
 his countenance was that bewildered
uncertainty relieved by frequent but fitful glimmerings
 hope though his lips moved constantly
in prayer his looks wandered by an irrepressible
impulse from one window the doge s palace to
another he took his station near the condemned
however and thrice crossed himself fervently
jacopo had tranquilly placed his person before
the block his head was bare his cheek colorless
his throat and neck uncovered to the shoulders his
body in its linen and the rest his form was clad
in the ordinary dress a gondolier he kneeled
with his face bowed to the block repeated a prayer
and rising he faced the multitude with dignity arid
composure as his eye moved slowly over the
array human countenances by which he was environed
a hectic glowed on his features for not
one them all betrayed sympathy in his sufferings
his breast heaved and those nearest to his person
thought the selfcommand the miserable man was
about to fail him the result disappointed expectation
there was a shudder and the limbs settled
into repose
thou hast looked in vain among the multitude
for a friendly eye said the carmelite whose attention
had been drawn to the convulsive movement

none here have pity for an assassin
remember thy redeemer son he suffered
ignominy and death for a race that denied his godhead
and derided his sorrows
the bravo 
jacopo crossed himself and bowed his head in
reverence
hast thou more prayers to repeat father demanded
the chief the sbirri he who was particularly
charged with the duty the hour
though the illustrious councils are so sure in justice
they are merciful to the souls sinners
are thy orders peremptory asked the monk
unconsciously fixing his eye again on the windows
 the palace is it certain that the prisoner is to
die
the officer smiled at the simplicity the question
but with the apathy one too much familiarized
with human suffering to admit compassion
do any doubt it he rejoined it is the lot
 man reverend monk and more especially is it
the lot those on whom the judgment st mark
has alighted it were better that your penitent looked
to his soul
surely thou hast thy private and express commands
 they have named a minute when this
bloody work is to be performed
holy carmelite i have the time will not be
weary and you will do w r ell to make the most it
unless you have faith already in the prisoner s condition

as he spoke the officer threw a glance at the
dial the square and walked coolly away the
action left the priest and the prisoner again alone
between the columns it was evident that the former
could not yet believe in the reality the execution

hast thou no hope jacopo he asked
carmelite in my god
they cannot commit this wrong i shrived
antonio i witnessed his fate and the prince knows
it
what is a prince and his justice where the selfe
the bravo
illness a few rules father them art new in the
senate s service
i shall not presume to say that god will blast
those who do this deed for we cannot trace the
mysteries his wisdom this life and all this
world can offer are but specks in his omniscient
eye and what to us seems evil may be pregnant
with good hast thou faith in thy redeemer jas
 
the prisoner laid his hand upon his heart and
smiled with the calm assurance that none but those
who are thus sustained can feel
we will again pray my son
the carmelite and jacopo kneeled side by side
the latter bowing his head to the block while the
monk uttered a final appeal to the mercy the
deity the former arose but the latter continued
in the suppliant attitude the monk was so full 
holy thoughts that forgetting his former wishes he
was nearly content the prisoner should pass into the
fruition that hope which elevated his own mind
the officer and executioner drew near the former
touching the arm father anselmo and pointing
towards the distant dial
the moment is near he whispered more
from habit than in any tenderness to the prisoner
the carmelite turned instinctively towards the
palace forgetting in the sudden impulse all but his
sense earthly justice there were forms at the
windows and he fancied a signal to stay the impending
blow was about to be given
hold he exclaimed for the love maria
 most pure memory be not too hasty 
the exclamation was repeated by a shrill female
voice and then gelsomina eluding every effort to
arrest her rushed through the dalmatians and
reached the group between the granite columns
rae bravo 
wonder and curiosity agitated the multitude and a
deep murmur ran through the square
tis a maniac cried one
t is a victim his arts said another for
when men have a reputation for any particular vice
the world seldom fails to attribute all the rest
gelsomina seized the bonds jacopo and endeavored
frantically to release his arms
i had hoped thou would st have been spared
this sight poor gessina said the condemned
be not alarmed she answered gasping for
breath they do it in mockery t is one their
wiles to mislead but they cannot no they dare
not harm a hair thy head carlo 
dearest gelsomina 
nay do not hold me i will speak to the citizens
and tell them all they are angry now but
when they know the truth they will love thee carlo
as i do
bless thee bless thee i would thou hadst
not come 
fear not for me i am little used to such a
crowd but thou wilt see that i shall dare to speak
them fair and to make known the truth boldly i
want but breath
dearest thou hast a mother a father to
share thy tenderness duty to them will make thee
happy 
now i can speak and thou shalt see how i
will vindicate thy name
she arose from the arms her lover who notwithstanding
his bonds released his hold her
slight form with a reluctance greater than that with
which he parted with life the struggle in the
mind jacopo seemed over he bowed his head
passively to the block before which he was kneeling
and it is probable by the manner in which his
hands were clasped that he prayed for her who
u
 the bravo
left him not so gelsomina parting her hair over
her spotless forehead with both hands she advanced
towards the fishermen who were familiar to her eye
by their red caps and bare limbs her smile was
like that which the imagination would bestow on the
blessed in their intercourse love
venetians she said i cannot blame you yeare
here to witness the death one whom ye believe
unfit to live 
the murderer old antonio muttered several
 the group
ay even the murderer that aged and excellent
man but when you hear the truth when you
come to know that he whom you have believed an
assassin was a pious child a faithful servant the
republic a gentle gondolier and a true heart you
will change your bloody purpose for a wish for
justice
a common murmur drowned her voice which
was so trembling and low as to need deep stillness
to render the words audible the carmelite had
advanced to her side and he motioned earnestly for
silence
hear her men the lagunes he said she
utters holy truth
this reverend and pious monk with heaven is
my witness when you shall know carlo better
and have heard his tale ye will be the first to cry
out for his release i tell you this that when the
doge shall appear at yon window and make the signal
 mercy you need not be angry and believe
that your class has been wronged poor carlo 
the girl raves interrupted the moody fishermen
 here is no carlo but jacopo frontoni a
common bravo
gelsomina smiled in the security the innocent
and regaining her breath which nervous agitation
still disturbed she resumed
the bravo 
carlo or jacopo jacopo or carlo it matters
little
ha there is a sign from the palace shouted
the carmelite stretching both his arms in that direction
as if to grasp a boon the clarion sounded
and another wave stirred the multitude gelso
mina uttered a cry delight and turned to throw
herself upon the bosom the reprieved the ax
glittered before her eyes and the head jacopo
rolled upon the stones as if to meet her a general
movement in the living mass denoted the 
the dalmatians wheeled into column the sbirri
pushed aside the throng on their way to their
haunts the water the bay was dashed upon the
flags the clotted sawdust was gathered the head
and trunk block basket ax and executioner disappeared
and the crowd circulated around the
fatal spot
during this horrible and brief moment neither
father anselmo nor gelsomina moved all was
over and still the entire scene appeared to be delusion

take away this maniac said an officer the
police pointing to gelsomina as he spoke
he was obeyed with venetian readiness but his
words proved prophetic before his servitors had
quitted the square the carmelite scarce breathed
he gazed at the moving multitude at the windows
 the palace and at the sun which shone so gloriously
in the heavens
thou art lost in this crowd whispered one at
his elbow reverend carmelite you will do well
to follow me
the monk was too much subdued to hesitate his
conductor led him by many secret ways to a quay
where he instantly embarked in a gondola for the
main before the sun reached the meridian the
thoughtful and trembling monk was on his journey
 the bravo
towards the states the church and ere long he
became established in the castle sant agata
at the usual hour the sun fell behind the mountains
 the tyrol and the moon reappeared above
the lido the narrow streets venice again
poured out their thousands upon the squares the
mild light fell athwart the quaint architecture and
the giddy tower throwing a deceptive glory on the
city islands
the porticoes became brilliant with lamps the
gay laughed the reckless trifled the masker pursued
his hidden purpose the cantatrice and the grotesque
acted their parts and the million existed in that vacant
enjoyment which distinguishes the pleasures 
the thoughtless and the idle each lived for himself
while the state venice held its vicious sway corrupting
alike the ruler and the ruled by its mockery
 those sacred principles which are alone founded
in truth and natural justice

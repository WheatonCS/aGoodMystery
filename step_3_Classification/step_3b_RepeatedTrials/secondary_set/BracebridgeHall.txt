master simon has a most devout abhorrence
mingled with awe for this ancient spinster he
told me the other day in a whisper that she was
a cursed brimstone in fact he added another
epithet which i would not repeat for the world
i have remarked however that he is always
extremely civil to her when they meet

 hunting
on the skirts the neighbouring village there
lives a kind small potentate who for aught i
know is a representative one the most ancient
legitimate lines the present day for the
empire over which he reigns has belonged to his
family time out mind his territories comprise
a considerable number good fat acres
and his seat power is in an old farm house
where he enjoys unmolested the stout oaken
chair his ancestors the personage to whom
 ready money jack
i allude is a sturdy old yeoman the name 
john tibbets or rather ready money jack
tibbets as he is called throughout the neighbourhood

the first place where he attracted my attention
was in the churchyard on sunday where
he sat on a tombstone after the service with his
hat a little on one side holding forth to a small
circle auditors and as i presumed expounding
the law and the prophets until on drawing
a little nearer i found he was only expatiating
on the merits a brown horse he presented
such a picture a substantial english yeoman
as he is often described in books mingled with
some little finery peculiar to himself that i
could not but take note his whole appearance

he was between fifty and sixty a strong
muscular frame and at least six feet high with
a physiognomy as grave as a lion's and set off
with short curling iron gray locks his shirt
collar was turned down and displayed a neck
covered with the same short curling hair and he
ready money jack 
wore a coloured silk neckcloth tied very loosely
and tucked in at the bosom with a green paste
broach on the knot his coat was dark green
cloth with silver buttons on each which was engraved
a stag with his own name john tibbets
underneath he had an inner waistcoat figured
chintz between which and his coat was another
 scarlet cloth unbuttoned his breeches
were also left unbuttoned at the knees not from
any slovenliness but to show a broad pair scarlet
garters his stockings were blue with white
clocks he wore large silver shoe buckles a
broad paste buckle in his hat band his sleeve buttons
were gold seven shilling pieces and he had
two or three guineas hanging as ornaments to his
watch chain
on making some inquiries about him i gathered
that he was descended from a line farmers
that had always lived on the same spot and
owned the same property and that half the
churchyard was taken up with the tombstones 
his race he has all his life been an important
character in the place when a youngster he
 ready money jack
was one the most roaring blades the neighbourhood
no one could match him at wrestling
pitching the bar cudgel play and other athletic
exercises like the renowned pinner 
wakefield he was the village champion carried
off the prizes at all the fairs and threw his gauntlet
at the country round even to this day the
old people talk his prowess and undervalue
in comparison all heroes the green that have
succeeded him nay they say that if ready
money jack were to take the field even now
there is no one could stand before him
when jack's father died the neighbours shook
their heads and predicted that young hopeful
would soon make way with the old homestead 
but jack falsified all their predictions the
moment he succeeded to the paternal farm he
assumed a new character took a wife attended
resolutely to his affairs and became an industrious
thrifty farmer with the family property
he inherited a set old family maxims to which
he steadily adhered he saw to every thing
himself put his own hand to the plough workready
money jack 
ed hard eat heartily slept soundly paid for
every thing in cash down and never danced except
he could do it to the music his own money
in both pockets he has never been without
a hundred or two pounds in golden guineas by
him and never allows a debt to stand against
him this has gained him his current name 
which by the bye he is a little proud and has
caused him to be looked upon as a very wealthy
man by all the village
notwithstanding his thrift however he has
never denied himself the amusements life 
but has taken a share in every passing pleasure
it is his maxim that he that works hard can
afford to play he is therefore an attendant
at all the country fairs and wakes and has signalized
himself by feats strength and prowess
on every village green in the shire he often
makes his appearance at horse races and sports
his half guinea and even his guinea at a time 
keeps a good horse for his own riding and to
this day is fond following the hounds and is
generally in at the death he keeps up the rusvol
i 
 ready money jack
tic revels and hospitalities too for which his
paternal farm house has always been noted has
plenty good cheer and dancing at harvest home
and above all keeps the merry night as it is
termed at christmas
with all his love amusement jack is by no
means a boisterous jovial companion he is
seldom known to laugh in the midst his gayety 
but maintains the same lionlike demeanour
he is very slow at comprehending a joke and
is apt to sit puzzling at it with a perplexed look
while the rest the company are in a roar
this gravity has perhaps grown on him with the
growing weight his character for he is gradually
growing into patriarchal dignity in his
native place though he no longer takes an
active part in athletic sports yet he always presides
at them and is appealed to on all occasions
as umpire he maintains the peace on the vilmerry
night a rustic merry making in a farm house about
christmas there is abundance homely fare tea cakes fruit and
ale various feats agility amusing games romping dancing and
kissing withal they commonly break up at midnight
ready money jack 
lage green at holyday games and quells all
brawls and quarrels by collaring the parties and
shaking them heartily if refractory no one
ever pretends to raise a hand against him or to
contend against his decisions the young men
having grown up in habitual awe his prowess
and in implicit deference to him as the champion
and lord the green
he is a regular frequenter the village tavern
 the landlady having been a sweetheart 
his in early life and he having always continued
on kind terms with her he seldom however
drinks any thing but a draught ale smokes
his pipe and pays his reckoning before leaving
the bar room here he gives his little senate
laws decides bets which are generally referred
to him determines upon the characters and
qualities horses and indeed plays now and
then the part a judge in settling petty disputes
between neighbours which otherwise might
have been nursed by country attorneys into tolerable
lawsuits jack is very candid and impartial
in his decisions but he has not a head to carse
ready money jack
ry a long argument and is very apt to get perplexed
and out patience if there is much pleading
he generally breaks through the argument
with a strong voice and brings matters to a
summary conclusion by pronouncing what he
calls the upshot the business or in other
words the long and the short the matter
jack once made a journey to london a great
many years since which has furnished him with
topics conversation ever since he saw the
old king on the terrace at windsor who stopped
and pointed him out to one the princesses
being probably struck with jack's truly yeomanlike
appearance this is a favourite anecdote
with him and has no doubt had a great effect in
making him a most loyal subject ever since in
spite taxes and poor's rates he was also at
bartholomew fair where he had half the buttons
cut off his coat and a gang pickpockets attracted
by his external show gold and silver
made a regular attempt to hustle him as he was
gazing at a show but for once they found that
they had caught a tartar for jack enacted as
ready money jack 
great wonders among the gang as samson did
among the philistines one his neighbours
who had accompanied him to town and was
with him at the fair brought back an account
 his exploits which raised the pride the
whole village who considered their champion
as having subdued all london and eclipsed the
achievements friar tuck or even the renowned
robin hood himself
 late years the old fellow has seemed to
take things more easily works less and indulges
in greater leisure his son having grownup
and succeeded to him both in the labours 
the farm and the exploits the green like
all sons distinguished men however his father's
renown is a disadvantage to him he can
never come up to public expectation though
a fine active fellow threeandtwenty and
quite the cock the walk yet the old people
declare he is nothing like what ready money
jack was at his time life the youngster
himself acknowledges his inferiority and
has a wonderful opinion the old man who
 ready money jack
indeed taught him all his athletic accomplishments
and holds such a sway over him that i
am told even to this day he would have no
hesitation to take him in hands if he rebelled
against paternal government
the squire holds jack in very high esteem
and shows him to all his visitors as a specimen
 old english heart oak he frequently
calls at his house and tastes some his home
brewed which is excellent he made jack a
present old tusser's hundredth points 
good husbandry which has furnished him with
reading ever since and is his text and manual
in all agricultural and domestic concerns
he has made dog's ears at the most favourite
passages and knows many the poetical maxims
by heart
tibbets though not a man to be daunted or
fluttered by high acquaintances and though he
cherishes a sturdy independence mind and
manner yet is evidently gratified by the attentions
 the squire whom he has known from
boyhood and pronounces a true gentleman
ready money jack 
every inch him he is also on excellent
terms with master simon who is a kind privy
counsellor to the family but his great favourite
is the oxonian whom he taught to wrestle and
play at quarterstaff when a boy and considers
the most promising young gentleman in the
whole county
bachelors
the bachelor most joyfully
in pleasant plight doth pass his daies 
good fellowship and companie
he doth maintain and kepe always
evans old ballads
there is no character in the comedy human
life that is more difficult to play well than
that an old bachelor when a single gentleman
therefore arrives at that critical period when
he begins to consider it an impertinent question
be asked his age i would advise him to look
well to his ways this period it is true is much
later with some men than with others i have
witnessed more than once the meeting two
wrinkled old lads this kind who had not seen
each other for several years and have been
amused by the amicable exchange compliments
on each other's appearance that takes
bachelors 
place on such occasions there is always one
invariable observation why bless my soul 
you look younger than when last i saw you 
whenever a man's friends begin to compliment
him about looking young he may be sure that
they think he is growing old
i am led to make these remarks by the conduct
 master simon and the general who have
become great cronies as the former is the
youngest by many years he is regarded as quite
a youthful blade by the general who moreover
looks upon him as a man great wit and prodigious
acquirements i have already hinted
that master simon is a family beau and considered
rather a young fellow by all the elderly ladies
 the connexion for an old bachelor in an old
family connexion is something like an actor ina
regular company who seems to flourish in
immortal youth and will continue to play the
romeos and rangers for half a century together
master simon too is a little the camelion
and takes a different hue with every different
companion he is very attentive and courteous
vol i 
 bachelors
and somewhat sentimental with lady lillycraft 
copies out little namby namby ditties and love
songs for her and draws quivers and doves and
darts and cupids to be worked on the corners
 her pocket handkerchiefs he indulges however
in very considerable latitude with the other
married ladies the family and has many sly
pleasantries to whisper to them that provoke an
equivocal laugh and a tap the fan but when
he gets among the young company such as
frank bracebridge the oxonian and the general
he is apt to put on the madwag and to talk
in a very bachelorlike strain about the sex
in this he has been encouraged by the example
 the general whom he looks up to as a
man the ton that has seen the world the
general in fact tells shocking stories after dinner
when the ladies are gone which he gives as
some the choice things that are served up at
a knot bon vivants in london called the mule
club he also repeats a great many
fat jokes old major slings the wit the
dub which the general can hardly relate for
bachelors 
laughing though they always make the squire
look grave who has a great antipathy to a bawdy
jest in a word the general is a complete instance
 that declension in gay life by which a
young man pleasure is apt to cool down into
an obscene old gentleman
i saw him and master simon an evening or
two since conversing with a buxom milkmaid ina
meadow and from their elbowing each other
now and then and the general's shaking his
shoulders blowing up his cheeks and breaking
out into a short fit irrepressible laughter i had
no doubt that they were playing the mischief
with the girl
as i looked at them through a hedge i could
not but think they would have made a tolerable
group for a modern picture susanna and the
two elders it is true the girl seemed in no wise
alarmed at the force the enemy and i question
had either them been alone whether she
would not have been more than they would have
ventured to encounter such veteran oysters
are daring wags when together and will put
 bachelors
any female to the blush with their jokes but they
are as quiet as lambs when they fall singly into
the clutches a fine woman
in spite the general's years he evidently
is a little vain his person and ambitious 
conquests i have observed him on sunday in
church eying the country girls most suspiciously
and have even seen him leer upon them with a
downright amorous look even when he has been
gallantry lady lillycraft with great ceremony
through the churchyard the general in fact
is a veteran in the service cupid rather than
mars having signalized himself in all the garrison
towns and country quarters and seen service
in every ball room england not a celebrated
beauty but he has laid siege to and if his
word may be taken in a matter wherein no man
is apt to be veracious it is incredible the success
he has had with the fair at present he is like a
wornout warrior retired from service but who
still cocks his beaver with a military air and
talks stoutly fighting whenever he comes
within the smell gunpowder
bachelors 
i have heard him speak his mind very freely
over his bottle about the folly the captain intaking
a wife as he thinks a young soldier should
care for nothing but his bottle and kind landlady
 but in fact he says the service on the
continent has played the mischief with the young
men they have been ruined by light wines and
french quadrilles they've nothing he says 
the spirit the old service there are none 
your sixbottle men left that were the souls a
mess dinner and used to play the very deuce
among the women
as to a bachelor the general affirms that he
is a free and easy man with no baggage to take
care but his portmanteau but a married
man with his wife hanging on his arm always
puts him in mind a chamber candlestick with
its extinguisher hitched to it
i should not mind all this if it were merelyconfined
to the general but i fear he will bethe
ruin my friend master simon who already
begins to echo his heresies and to talk in the
style a gentleman that has seen life and
 bachelors
lived upon the town indeed he seems to have
taken master simon in hand and talks showing
him the lions in london next season and 
introducing him to the mulligatawney club ashe
is continually quoting the sayings this
club i have been curious to learn something
about it i find it is composed a knot old
nabobs officers and other choice spirits that
have seen service in india and been burnt outwith
curry and touched with the liver complaint
they meet regularly to eat mulligatawney soup
smoke the hookah talk about tippoo saib
and seringapatam and be tediously agreeable
in each others company
wives
believe me man there is no greater bliss
than is the quiet joy loving wife
which whoso wants half himselfe doth miss
friend without change playfellow without strife
food without fulness counsaile without strife
is this sweet doubling our single life
sir p sidney
it is a great pity that plays and novels should
always at the wedding and should not give
us another act and another volume to let us
know how the hero and heroine conducted themselves
when married their main object seems
to be to instruct young ladies how to get husbands
 but not how to keep them now this last
it appears to me is a desideratum in modem
married life it is appalling to those who have
not yet ventured into the state to see how soon
the flame romantic love burns out or is quenched
wives
ed in matrimony and the passionate poetic lover
declines into the phlegmatic prosaic husband
i am inclined to attribute this very much
to the defect i have just mentioned in the plays
and novels which form the principal study our
young ladies and which teach them how to be
heroines but leave them totally at a loss when
they come to be wives i have lately however
met with an exception to this practice in an old
writer who has bravely attempted to support
dramatic interest in favour a woman even after
she was married i was looking over an
album the fair julia's when i found a series
 poetical extracts in the squire's handwriting
which might have been intended as matrimonial
advice to his ward i was so much struck with
the beauty several them that i took the
liberty making a copy they are from the
old play the city nightcap in which is
drawn out and exemplified in the part abates
a character a patient and faithful wife 
by thomas davenport 
wives 
which i think might vie with that the renowned
griselda though i fear it would stand almost
as little chance being adopted as a model
the following is a commendation her to
her husband lorenzo 
she's modest but not sullen and loves silence
not that she wants apt words for when she speaks
she inflames love with wonder but because
she calls wise silence the soul's harmony
she's truly chaste yet such a foe to coyness
the poorest call her courteous and which is excellent
though fair and young she shuns to expose herself
to the opinion strange eyes she either seldom
or never walks abroad but in your company j
and then with such sweet bashfulness as if
she were venturing on crack'd ice and takes delight
to step into the print your foot hath made
and will follow you whole fields so she will drive
tediousness out time with her sweet character
notwithstanding all this excellence abstemious
the misfortune to incur the unmerited jealousy
 her husband instead however resenting
his harsh treatment with clamorous upbraiding
and the stormy violence high windy
virtue by which the sparks anger are so often
blown into a flame she endures it with the
meekness conscious but patient virtue and
vol i 
 wives
makes a beautiful appeal to a friend who has
witnessed her long suffering 
hast thou not seen me
bear all his injuries as the ocean suffers
the angry bark to plough thorough her bosom
and yet is presently so smooth the eye
cannot perceive where the wide wound was made
lorenzo being wrought on by false representations
at length repudiates her to the last
however she maintains her patient sweetness
and her love for him in spite his cruelty she
deplores his error even more than his unkindness
and laments the delusion which has turned his
very affection into a source bitterness there
is a moving pathos in her parting address to lorenzo
after their divorce 
farewell lorenzo
whom my soul doth love if you e'er marry
may you meet a good wife so good that you
may not suspect her nor may she be worthy
 your suspicion and if you hear hereafter
that i am dead inquire but my last words
and you shall know that to the last i lov'd you
and when you walk forth with your second choice
into the pleasant fields and by chance talk me
imagine that you see me lean and pale
wives 
strewing your path with flowers
but may she never live to pay my debts weeps
if but in thought she wrong you may she die
in the conception the injury
pray make me wealthy with one kiss farewell sir 
let it not grieve you when you shall remember
that i was innocent nor this forget
though innocence here suffer sigh and groan
she walks but thorow thorns to find a throne
in a short time lorenzo discovers his error 
and the innocence his injured wife in the
transports his repentance he calls to mind all
her feminine excellence her gentle uncomplaining
womanly fortitude under wrongs and sorrows

oh abstemia 
how lovely thou loosest now now thou appeared
chaster than is the morning's modesty
that rises with blush over whose bosom
the western wind creeps softly now i remember
how when she sat at table her obedient eye
would dwell on mine as if it were not well
unless it looked when i looked oh how proud
she was when she could cross herself to please me 
but where now is this fair soul like a silver cloud
she hath wept herself i fear into the dead sea
and will be found no more
 
it is but doing right by the reader if interested
in the fate abstemia by the preceding
 wives
extracts to say that she was restored to the
arms and affections her husband rendered
fonder than ever by that disposition in every
good heart to atone for past injustice by an
overflowing measure returning kindness 
the wealth worth more than kingdoms i am now
confirmed past all suspicion thou art far
sweeter in thy sincere truth than a sacrifice
decked up for death with garlands the indian winds
that blow from off the coast and cheer the sailor
with the sweet savour their spices want
the delight flows in thee
i have been more affected and interested by
this little dramatic picture than by many a
popular love tale though as i said before i do
not think it likely either abstemia or patient
grizzle stand much chance being taken fora
model still i like to see poetry now and then
extending its views beyond the wedding day and
teaching a lady how to make herself attractive
even after marriage
there is no great need enforcing on an unmarried
lady the necessity being agreeable 
wives 
nor is there any great art requisite in a youthful
beauty to enable her to please nature has multiplied
attractions round her youth is in itself
attractive the freshness budding beauty
needs no foreign aid to set it off it pleases merely
because it is fresh and budding and beautiful
but it is for the married state that a woman
needs the most instruction and in which she
should be most on her guard to maintain her
powers pleasing no woman can expect
to be to her husband all that he fancied her
when he was a lover men are always doomed
to be duped not so much by the arts the sex
as by their own imaginations they are always
wooing goddesses and marrying mere mortals
a woman should therefore ascertain what was
the charm that rendered her so fascinating when
a girl and endeavour to keep it up when she has
become a wife one great thing undoubtedly
was the chariness herself and her conduct
which an unmarried female always observes
she should maintain the same niceness and re
 wives
serve in her person and habits and endeavour
still to preserve a freshness and virgin delicacy
in the eye her husband she should remember
that the province woman is to be wooed
not to woo to be caressed not to caress man
is an ungrateful being in love bounty loses instead
 winning him the secret a woman's
power does not consist so much in giving as in
withholding a woman may give up too much
even to her husband it is to a thousand little
delicacies conduct that she must trust to keep
alive passion and to protect herself from that
dangerous familiarity that thorough acquaintance
with every weakness and imperfection incident
to matrimony by these means she may still
maintain her power though she has surrendered
her person and may continue the romance 
love even beyond the honey moon
she that hath a wise husband says jeremy
taylor must entice him to an eternal dearness
by the veil modesty and the grave robes
 chastity the ornament meekness and the
wives 
jewels faith and charity she must have no
painting but blushing her brightness must be
purity and she must shine round about with
sweetness and friendship and she shall be
pleasant while she lives and desired when she
dies
 v
i have wandered into a rambling series remarks
on a trite subject and a dangerous one fora
bachelor to meddle with that i may not
however appear to confine my observations entirely
to the wife i will conclude with another
quotation from jeremy taylor in which the
duties both parties are mentioned while i
would recommend his sermon on the marriage
ring to all those who wiser than myself are
about entering the happy state wedlock
there is scarce any matter duty but it
concerns them both alike and is only distinguished
by names and hath its variety by circumstances
and little accidents and what in one is
called love in the other is called reverence and
what in the wife is obedience the same in the
 wives
man is duty he provides and she dispenses 
he gives commandments and she rules by them 
he rules her by authority and she rules him by
love she ought by all means to please him and
he must by no means displease her
a literary antiquary
printed books he contemn as a novelty this latter age but a
manuscript he pores on everlastingly especially if the cover be all
motheaten and the dust make a parenthesis between every syllable
mlcocosmographie 
in the account my christmas visit to the
hall i made some mention the parson who
is a kind family chaplain to the squire and
was his chum at oxford a farther acquaintance
with the little man has increased my esteem
for him he is a scholar without arrogance
or pedantry very ignorant the world
having lived almost entirely among books and
those too old books so that his mind is as antiquated
as the squire's garden where one
finds formal flower beds and peacocks cut in
yew
his taste for literary antiquities was first imbibed
when a student at oxford where he
vol i 
 a literary antiquary
spent the chief his leisure hours in the bodleian
library foraging among the old manuscripts

in the course his life he has visited most
 the curious libraries in england and has
ransacked many the cathedrals though in
general quiet and rather dry yet on his favourite
theme he kindles up and becomes almost
eloquent no fox hunter relating his last day's
sport could be more animated than i have seen
the worthy parson when relating his search
after a curious document which he had traced
from library to library until he fairly earthed
it in the dusty chapter house a cathedral
when too he describes some venerable manuscript
with its rich illuminations its thick
creamy vellum its glossy ink and the odour
 the cloisters that seems to exhale from it
he rivals the enthusiasm a parisian epicure
expatiating on the merits a pate de strasbourg
he has a great desire however to
read works in the old libraries and chapter
houses to which they belong for he thinks a
a literary antiquary 
black letter volume reads best in one these
old chambers where the light struggles through
dusty lancet windows and painted glass and
that it loses half its zest if taken away from the
neighbourhood the curiously carved oaken
 case and gothic reading desk
the parson i am told has been for a longtime
meditating a commentary on struts brand
and douce in which he means to detect them
in sundry dangerous errors with respect to popular
games and superstitions he is also a
casual contributor to that long established
repository national customs and antiquities
the gentleman's magazine and is one those
that every now and then make an inquiry concerning
some obsolete custom or rare legend 
nay it is said that several his communications
have been at least six inches in length
he frequently receives parcels by coach
from different parts the kingdom containing
mouldy volumes and almost illegible manuscripts
it is singular what an active correspondence
is kept up among literary antiquaries
 a literary antiquary
and how soon the fame any rare volume or
unique copy just discovered among the rubbish
 a library is circulated among them the
parson is more busy than common just now
being a little flurried by an advertisement a
work preparing for the press on the mythology
 the middle ages the little man has long
been gathering together all the hobgoblin tales
he could collect illustrative the superstitions
 former times and he is in a complete fever
lest this formidable rival should take the field
before him shortly after my arrival at the
hall i called at the parsonage in company
with mr bracebridge and the general the
parson had not been seen for several days
which was a matter some surprise as he
was an almost daily visiter at the hall we
found him in his study a small dusky chamber
lighted by a lattice window that looked into the
church yard and was overshadowed by a yew
tree his chair was surrounded by folios and
quartos piled upon the floor and his table was
covered with books and manuscripts the
a literary antiquary 
cause his seclusion was a work which he
had recently received and with which he had
retired in rapture from the world and shut himself
up to enjoy a literary honey moon undisturbed
never did boarding school girl devour
the pages a sentimental novel or don quixote
a chivalrous romance with more intense delight
than did the little man banquet on the
pages this delicious work it was dibdin's
bibliographical tour a work calculated to have
as powerful an effect on the imaginations literary
antiquaries as the tales the early
american adventurers had on the spanish
dons filling them with dreams mexican
and peruvian mines and the golden realm
 el dorado
the good parson had long been looking forward
to the fruits this bibliographical crusade 
which had far greater importance in his eyes
than the expeditions to africa or the north pole
the work had realized all his anticipations
he had been transported in idea to the libraries
 the old german convents and universities 
 a literary antiquary
his mind's eye had feasted on vellum manuscripts
and exquisitely illuminated missals his brain
was haunted with lovesick dreams about gorgeous
old works in silk linings triple gold
bands and tinted leather locked up in wire
cases and secured from the vulgar hands the
mere reader and to continue the happy expressions
 an ingenious w r river dazzling
one's eyes like eastern beauties peering through
their jealousies
when the parson had finished a rapturous
eulogy on this most curious and entertaining
work he drew forth from a little drawer a
manuscript lately received from a correspondent
which had perplexed him sadly it was written
in norman french in very ancient characters
and so faded and smouldered away as to be almost
illegible it was apparently an old norman
drinking song that might have been brought
over by one william the conqueror's carousing
followers the writing was just legible
disraeli's curiosities literature
a literary antiquary ill
enough to keep a keen antiquity hunter on a
doubtful chace here and there would be a few
words so plainly written as to put him on the
scent again in this way he had been led on
for a whole day until he had found himself completely
at fault
the squire endeavoured to assist him but
was equally baffled the old general listened
for some time to the discussion and then asked
the parson if he had read captain morris or
george stevens or anacreon moore's bacchanalian
songs on the other's replying in the negative
 oh then said the general with infinite
bon homme if you want a drinking song
i can furnish you with the latest collection
i did not know you had a turn for those kind 
things and i can lend you the encyclopaedia
 wit into the bargain i never travel without
them they're excellent reading at an inn
it would be difficult to describe the odd look
 surprise and perplexity the parson on
this proposal or the difficulty that the squire
had in making the general comprehend that
 a literary antiquary
though a jovial song the present day was
totally abhorrent to the ears wisdom and
beneath the notice a learned man yet a
trowel written by a tosspot several hundred
years since was a matter worthy the gravest
research and enough to set whole colleges by
the ears
the farm house
love and hay
are thick sown but come up full thistles
beaumont and fletcher
i was so much pleased with the anecdotes
which were told me ready money jack gibbets
that i got master simon a day or two since
to take me to his house it was an old fashioned
farm house built brick with curiously twisted
chimneys it stood at a little distance from the
road with a southern exposure looking upon a
soft green slope meadow there was a small
garden in front with a row beehives humming
among beds sweet herbs and flowers
well scoured milking tubs with bright copper
hoops hung on the garden paling fruit trees
were trained up against the cottage and pots 
vol i 
 the farm house
flowers stood in the windows a fat superannuated
mastiff lay in the sunshine at the door 
with a sleek cat sleeping peacefully across him
tibbets was from home at the time our
calling but we were received with hearty and
homely welcome by his wife a notable motherly
woman and a complete pattern for wives since
according to master simon's account she never
contradicts honest jack and yet manages to have
her own way and to control him in everything

she received us in the main room the house
a kind parlour and hall with great brown
beams timber across it which tibbets is apt
to point out with some exultation observing that
they don't put such timber in houses nowadays
the furniture was old fashioned strong and
highly polished the walls were hung with coloured
prints the story the prodigal son
who was represented in a red coat and leather
breeches over the fireplace was a blunderbuss
and a hard favoured likeness ready money
jack taken when he was a young man by the
the farm house 
same artist that painted the tavern sign his mother
having taken a notion that the tibbets had
as much right to have a gallery family portraits
as the folks at the hall
the good dame pressed us very much to take
some refreshment and tempted us with a variety
 household dainties so that we were glad to
compound by tasting some her homemade
wines while we were there the son and heir
apparent came home a good looking young fellow
and something a rustic beau he took
us over the premises and showed us the whole
establishment an air homely but substantial
plenty prevailed throughout every thing
was the jest materials and in the best condition
nothing was out place or ill made 
and you saw every where the signs a man
that took care to have the worth his money
and that paid as he went
the farm yard was well stocked under a
shed was a taxed cart in trim order in which
ready money jack took his wife about the country
his wellfed horse neighed from the stag
the farm house
able and when led into the yard to use the words
 young jack he shone like a bottle for he
said the old man made it a rule that every thing
about him should fare as well as he did himself
i was pleased to see the pride which the young
fellow seemed to have his father he gave
us several particulars concerning his habits which
were pretty much to the effect those i have
already mentioned he had never suffered an
account to stand in his life always providing the
money before he purchased any thing and if
possible paying in gold and silver he had a
great dislike to paper money and seldom went
without a considerable sum in gold about him
on my observing that it was a wonder he had
never been waylaid and robbed the young fellow
smiled at the idea any one venturing upon
such an exploit for i believe he thinks the old
man would be a match for robin hood and all
his gang
i have noticed that master simon seldom goes
into any house without having a world private
talk with some one or other the family being
the farm house 
a kind universal counsellor and confidant
we had not been long at the farm before the
old dame got him into a corner her parlour
where they had a long whispering conference
together in which i saw by his shrugs that there
were some dubious matters discussed and by his
nods that he agreed with every thing she said
after we had come out the young man accompanied
us a little distance and then drawing
master simon aside into a green lane they walked
and talked together for nearly half an hour
master simon who has the usual propensity 
confidants to blab every thing to the next friend
they meet with let me know that there was a
love affair in question the young fellow having
been smitten with the charms phoebe wilkins
the pretty niece the housekeeper at the hall
like most other love concerns it had brought
its troubles and perplexities dame tibbets
had long been on intimate gossiping terms with
the housekeeper who often visited the farmhouse
but when the neighbours spoke to her
 the likelihood a match between her son and
 the farm house
phoebe wilkins marry come up she scouted
the very idea the girl had acted as lady's
maid and it was beneath the blood the gibbets
who had lived on their own lands time out
 mind and owed reverence and thanks to nobody
to have the heir apparent marry a servant

these vapourings had faithfully been carried
to the housekeeper's ear by one their mutual
gobetween friends the old housekeeper's
blood if not as ancient was as quick as that 
dame tibbets she had been accustomed to
carry a high head at the hall and among the
villagers and her faded brocade rustled with
indignation at the slight cast upon her alliance
by the wife a petty farmer she maintained
that her niece had been a companion rather thana
waiting maid to the young ladies thank
heaven she was not obliged to work for her
living and was as idle as any young lady in the
land and when somebody died would receive
something that would be worth the notice 
some folks with all their ready money
the farm house 
a bitter feud had thus taken place between
the two worthy dames and the young people
were forbidden to think one another as to
young jack he was too much in love to reason
upon the matter and being a little heady and
not standing in much awe his mother was
ready to sacrifice the whole dignity the gibbets
to his passion he had lately however
had a violent quarrel with his mistress in consequence
 some coquetry on her part and at
present stood aloof the politic mother was
exerting all her ingenuity to widen this accidental
breach but as is most commonly the case the
more she meddled with this perverse inclination
 her son's the stronger it grew in the meantime
old ready money was kept completely in
the dark both parties were in awe and uncertainty
as to what might be his way taking the
matter and dreaded to awaken the sleeping lion
between father and son therefore the worthy
mrs tibbets was full business and at her
wit's it is true there was no great danger
 honest ready money's finding the thing out
i
 the farm house
if left to himself for he was a most unsuspicious
temper and by no means quick apprehension
 but there was daily risk his attention
being aroused by those cobwebs which his wife
was continually spinning about his nose
such is the distracted state politics in the
domestic empire ready money jack which
only shows the intrigues and internal dangers to
which the best regulated governments are liable
in this perplexed situation their affairs both
mother and son have applied to master simon
for counsel and with all his experience in meddling
with other people's concerns he finds it an
exceedingly difficult part to play to agree with
both parties seeing that their opinions and wishes
are so diametrically opposite
story telling
a favourite evening pastime at the hall and
one which the worthy squire is fond promoting
is story telling a good old fashioned
fireside amusement as he terms it indeed i
believe he promotes it chiefly because it was
one the choice recreations in those days 
yore when ladies and gentlemen were not
much in the habit reading be this as it
may he will often at supper table when conversation
flags call upon some one or other
 the company for a story as it was formerly
the custom to call for a song and it is edifying
to see the exemplary patience and even satisfaction
with which the good old gentleman will sit
and listen to some hackneyed tale that he has
heard for at least an hundred times
in this way one evening the current 
anecdotes and stories ran upon mysterious per
vol i 
 story telling
songes that have figured at different times and
filled the world with doubt and conjecture such
as the wandering jew the man with the iron
mask who tormented the curiosity all europe
the invisible girl and last though not
least the pigfaced lady
at length one the company was called
upon that had the most unpromising physiognomy
for a story teller that i had ever seen
he was a thin pale weakenfaced man extremely
nervous that had sat at one corner
 the table shrunk up as it were into himself
and almost swallowed up in the cape his
coat as a turtle in its shell
the very demand seemed to throw him into
a nervous agitation yet he did not refuse
he emerged his head out his shell made a
few odd grimaces and gesticulations before he
could get his muscles into order or his voice
under command and then offered to give some
account a mysterious personage that he had
recently encountered in the course his travels
story telling 
and one whom he thought fully entitled to be
classed with the man with the iron mask
i was so much struck with his extraordinary
narrative that i have written it out to the best
 my recollection for the amusement the
reader i think it has in it all the elements
 that mysterious and romantic narrative so
greedily sought after at the present day
the stout gentleman
a tale mystery
ill cross it though it blast me 
hamlet
it was a rainy sunday in the gloomy month
 november i had been detained in the
course a journey by a slight indisposition
from which i was recovering but i was still
feverish and was obliged to keep within doors
all day in an inn the small town derby
a wet sunday in a country inn whoever has
had the luck to experience one can alone judge
 my situation the rain pattered against
the casements the bells tolled for church
with a melancholy sound i went to the windows
in quest something to amuse the eye 
but it seemed as if i had been placed completely

the stout gentleman 
out the reach all amusement the windows
 my bed room looked out among tiled
roofs and stacks chimneys while those 
my sitting room commanded a full view the
stable yard i know nothing more calculated
to make a man sick this world than a stable
yard on a rainy day the place was littered
with wet straw that had been kicked about
by travellers and stable boys in one corner
was a stagnant pool water surrounding
an island muck there were several half
drowned fowls crowded together under a cart
among which was a miserable crestfallen
cock drenched out all life and spirit his
drooping tail matted as it were into a single
feather along which the water trickled from
his back near the cart was a halfdozing
cow chewing the cud and standing patiently
to be rained on with wreaths vapour
rising from her reeking hide a walleyed horse
tired the loneliness the stable was poking
his spectral head out a window with the rain
dripping on it from the eaves an unhappy cur
the stout gentleman
chained to a dog house hard by uttered something
every now and then between a bark and
a yelp a drab a kitchen wench tramped
backwards and forwards through the yard in
patterns looking as sulky as the weather itself
every thing in short was comfortless and forlorn
excepting a crew harddrinking ducks
assembled like boon companions round a puddle
and making a riotous noise over their liquor
i was lonely and listless and wanted amusement
my room soon became insupportable i
abandoned it and sought what is technically called
the traveller's room this is a public room
set apart at most inns for the accomodation 
a class wayfarers called travellers or riders 
a kind commercial knights errant who are
incessantly scouring the kingdom in gigs on
horseback or by coach they are the only
successors that i know at the present day
to the knights errant yore they lead the
same kind roving adventurous life only
changing the lance for a whip the buckler fora
pattern card and the coat mail for an
the stout gentleman 
upper benjamin instead vindicating the
charms peerless beauty they rove about
spreading the fame and standing some substantial
tradesman or manufacturer arid are
ready at any time to bargain in his name it
being the fashion nowadays to trade instead 
fight with one another as the room the
hostel in the good old fighting times would
be hung round at night with the armour 
wayworn warriors such as coats mail falchions
and yawning helmets so the traveller's
room is garnished with the harnessing their
successors with box coats whips all kinds
spurs gaiters and oil cloth covered hats
i was in hopes finding some these
worthies to talk with but was disappointed
there were indeed two or three in the
room but i could make nothing them one
was just finishing his breakfast quarrelling
with his bread and butter and huffing the
waiter another buttoned on a pair gaiters
with many execrations at boots for not
having cleaned his shoes well a third sat
 the stout gentleman
drumming on the table with his fingers and
looking at the rain as it streamed down the
window glass they all appeared infected by
the weather and disappeared one after the
other without exchanging a word
i sauntered to the window and stood gazing
at the people picking their way to church with
petticoats hoisted midleg high and dripping umbrellas
the bell ceased to toll and the streets
became silent i then amused myself with
watching the daughters a tradesman opposite
 who being confined to the house for fear
 wetting their sunday finery played off their
charms at the front windows to fascinate the
chance tenants the inn they at length
were summoned away by a vigilant vinegarfaced
mother and i had nothing farther from
without to amuse me
what was i to do to pass away the longlived
day i was sadly nervous and lonely 
and every thing about an inn seems calculated to
make a dull day ten times duller old newspapers
smelling beer and tobacco smoke and
the stout gentleman 
which i had already read half a dozen times
good for nothing books that were worse than
the rainy weather i bored myself to death
with an old volume the lady's magazine
i read all the common placed names ambitious
travellers scrawled on the panes glass 
the eternal families the smiths and the
browns and the jacksons and the johnson
and all the other sons and i deciphered several
scraps fatiguing innwindow poetry that
i have met with in all parts the world
the day continued lowering and gloomy 
the slovenly ragged spongy clouds drifted
heavily along in the air there was no variety
even in the rain it was one dull continued
monotonous patter patter patter excepting that
now and then i was enlivened by the idea a
brisk shower from the rattling the drops
upon a passing umbrella it was quite refreshing
if i may be allowed a hackneyed phrase
 the day when in the course the morning
a horn blew and a stage coach whirled through
the street with outside passengers stuck all
vol i 
 the stout gentleman
over it cowering under cotton umbrellas and
seethed together and reeking with the steams
 wet box coats and upper benjamins
the sound brought out from their lurking
places a crew vagabond boys and vagabond
dogs with the carrots headed hostler and that
non rescript animal ycleped boots and all the
other vagabond race that infest the purlieus 
an inn but the bustle was transient the coach
again whirled on its way and boy and dog
and hostler and boots all slunk back again to
their holes and the street again became silent
and the rain continued to rain on in fact there
was no hope its clearing up the barometer
pointed to rainy weather mine hostess tortoiseshell
cat sat by the fire washing her face and
rubbing her paws over her ears and on referring
to the almanac i found a direful prediction
stretching from the top the page to the
bottom through the whole month 

i was dreadfully hipped the hours seemed
as if they would never creep by the very
ticking the clock became irksome at length
the stout gentleman 
the stillness the house was interrupted by the
ringing a bell shortly after i heard the
voice a waiter at the bar the stout gentleman
in no wants his breakfast tea
and bread and butter with ham and eggs the
eggs not to be too much done
in such a situation as mine every incident is
 importance here was a subject speculation
presented to my mind and ample exercise
for my imagination i am prone to paint
pictures to myself and on this occasion i had
some materials to work upon had the guest
up stairs been mentioned as mr smith or
mr brown or mr jackson or mr johnson
or merely as the gentleman in no it would
have been a perfect blank to me i should have
thought nothing it but the stout gentleman
 the very name had something in it
 the picturesque it at once gave the size it
embodied the personage to my mind's eye and
my fancy did the rest he was stoutor as
some term it lusty in all probability therefore
he was advanced in life some people expanding
 the stout gentleman
as they grow old by his breakfasting rather
late and in his own room he must be a man
accustomed to live at his ease and above the
necessity early rising no doubt abound rosy
lusty old gentleman
there was another violent ringing the stout
gentleman was impatient for his breakfast he
was evidently a man importance well todo
in the world accustomed to be promptly
waited upon a keen appetite and a little cross
when hungry perhaps thought i he maybe
some london alderman or who knows but
he may be a member parliament 
 the breakfast was sent up and there was a
short interval silence he was doubtless making
the tea presently there was a violent ringing
and before it could be answered another
ringing still more violent bless me what a
choleric old gentleman the waiter came
down in a huff the butter was rancid the
eggs were overdone the ham was too salt the
stout gentleman was evidently nice in his eating
one those who eat and growl and keep the
the stout gentleman v 
waiter on the trot and live in a state militant
with the household
the hostess got into a fume i should observe
that she was a brisk coquettish woman a
little a shrew and something a slammerkin
but very pretty withal with a nincompoop
for a husband as shrews are apt to have she
rated the servants roundly for their negligence
in sending up so bad a breakfast but said not a
word against the stout gentleman by which i
clearly perceived that he must be a man consequence
 entitled to make a noise and to give
trouble at a country inn other eggs and ham
and bread and butter were sent they appeared
to be more graciously received at least there
was no further complaint
i had not made many turns about the traveller's
room when there was another ringing
shortly afterwards there was a stir and an inquest
about the house the stout gentleman
wanted the times or the chronicle newspaper
i set him down therefore for a whig or rather
from his being so absolute and lordly where he
j the stout gentleman
had a chance i suspected him being a radical
hunt i had heard was a large man who
knows thought i but it is hunt himself
my curiosity began to be awakened i inquired
 the waiter who was this stout gentleman
that was making all this stir but i could
get no information nobody seemed to know
his name the landlords bustling inns seldom
trouble their heads about the names their
transient guests the colour a coat the
shape or sifee the person is enough to suggest a
travelling name it is either the tall gentleman
or the short gentleman or the gentleman in
black or the gentleman in snuff colour or as in
the present instance the stout gentleman a designation
 the kind once hit on answers every
purpose and saves all farther inquiry
rain rain rain pitiless ceaseless rain no
such thing as putting a foot out doors and no
occupation or amusement within by and bye
i heard some one walking over head it was in
the stout gentleman's room he evidently was
a large man by the heaviness his tread and
the stout gentleman 
an old man from his wearing such creaking
soles he is doubtless thought i some
rich old square toes regular habits and is now
taking exercise after breakfast
i now read all the advertisements coaches
and hotels that were stuck about the mantlepiece
the lady's magazine had become an
abomination to me it was as tedious as the day
itself i wandered out not knowing what todo
and ascended again to my room i had not
been there long when there was a squall from a
neighbouring bed room a door opened and
slammed violently a chambermaid that i had
remarked for a ruddy good humoured face went
down stairs in a violent flurry the stout gentleman
had been rude to her
this sent a whole host my deductions to
the deuce in a moment this unknown personage
could not be an old gentleman for old gentlemen
are not apt to be so obstreperous to chambermaids
he could not be a young gentleman
 for young gentleman are not apt to inspire
such indignation he must be a middle aged
 the stout gentleman
man and confoundedly ugly into the bargain or
the girl would not have taken the matter in such
terrible dudgeon i confess i was sorely puzzled
in a few minutes i heard the voice my
landlady i caught a glance her as she came
tramping up stairs her face glowing her cap
flaring her tongue wagging the whole way
she'd have no such doings in her house she'd
warrant if gentlemen did spend their money
freely it was no rule she'd have no servant
maids her's treated in that way when they
were about their work that's what she wouldn't
as i hate squabbles particularly with women
and above all with pretty women i slunk back
into my room and partly closed the door but
my curiosity was too much excited not to listen
the landlady marched intrepidly to the enemy's
citadel and entered it with a storm the door
closed after her i heard her voice in high windy
clamour for a moment or two then it gradually
subsided like a gust wind in a garret
then there was a laugh then i heard nothing
more after a little while my landlady came
the stout gentleman 
out with an odd smile on her face adjusting her
cap which was a little on one side as she went
down stairs i heard the landlord ask her what
was the matter she said nothing at all
only the girl's a fool i was more than ever
perplexed what to make this unaccountable
personage who could put a goodnatured chambermaid
in a passion and send away a termagant
landlady in smiles he could npt be so
old nor cross nor ugly either
i had to go to work at his picture again and
to paint him entirely different i now set him
down for one those stout gentlemen that are
frequently met with swaggering about the doors
 country inns moist merry fellows in bel
cher handkerchiefs whose bulk is a little assisted
by malt liquors men who have seen the world
and been sworn at highgate who are used
to tavern life up to all the tricks tapsters
and knowing in the ways sinful publicans
free livers on a small scale who are prodigal
within the compass a guinea who call all the
waiters by name tousle the maids gossip with
vol i
 the stout gentleman
the landlady at the bar and prose over a pint 
port or a glass negus after dinner
the morning wore away in forming these and
similar surmises as fast as i wove one system
 belief some movement the unknown would
completely overturn it and throw all my thoughts
again into confusion such are the solitary operations
 a feverish mind i was as i have
said extremely nervous and the continual meditation
on the concerns this invisible personage
began to have its effect i was getting a fit 
the fidgets
dinner time came i hoped the stout gentleman
might dine in the traveller's room and that
i might at length get a view his person but
no he had dinner served in his own room
what could be the meaning this solitude and
mystery he could not be a radical there
was something too aristocratical in thus keeping
himself apart from the rest the world and
condemning himself to his own dull company
throughout a rainy day and then too he lived
i 
too well for a discontented politician he seemed
the stout gentleman 
to expatiate on a variety dishes and to sit
over his wine like a jolly friend good living
indeed my doubts on this head were soon at
an for he could not have finished his first
bottle before i could faintly hear him humming
a tune and on listening i found it to be god
save the king twas plain then he was no
radical but a faithful subject one that grew
loyal over his bottle and was ready to stand by
king and constitution when he could stand by
nothing else but who could he be my
conjectures began to run wild was he not some
personage distinction travelling incog
god knows said i at my wit's it
may be one the royal family for aught i
know for they are all stout gentlemen 
the weather continued rainy the mysterious
unknown kept his room and as far as i could
judge his chair for i did not hear him move
in the mean time as the day advanced the traveller's
room began to be frequented some
who had just arrived came in buttoned up in
box coats others came home who had been
 the stout gentleman
dispersed about the town some took their dinners
and some their tea had i been in a different
mood i should have found entertainment
in studying this peculiar class men there
were two especially who were regular wags 
the road and up to all the standing jokes travellers
they had a thousand sly things to say
to the waiting maid whom they called louisa
and ethelinda and a dozen other fine names 
changing the name every time and chuckling
amazingly at their own waggery my mind
however had become completely engrossed by
the stout gentleman he had kept my fancy in
chace during a long day and it was not now to
be diverted from the scent
the evening gradually wore away the
travellers read the papers two or three times over
some drew round the fire and told long stories
about their horses about their adventures their
overturns and breaking down they discussed
the credits different merchants and different
inns and the two wags told several choice anecdotes
 pretty chambermaids and kind landladies
the stout gentleman 
all this passed as they were quietly taking what
they called their night caps that is to say
strong glasses brandy and water with sugar or
some other mixture the kind after which they
one after another rang for boots and the chambermaid
and walked up to bed in old shoes cut
down into marvellously uncomfortable slippers
there was only one man left a short legged
longbodied plethoric fellow with a very large
sandy head he sat by himself with a glass 
port wine negus and a spoon sipping and stirring
until nothing was left but the spoon he
gradually fell asleep bolt upright in his chair
with the empty glass standing before him and
the candle seemed to fall asleep too for the wick
grew long and black and cabbaged at the 
and dimmed the little light that remained in the
chamber
the gloom that now prevailed was contagious
around hung the shapeless and almost
spectral box coats departed travellers long
since buried in deep sleep i only heard the
ticking the clock with the deepdrawn breathe
the stout gentleman
kings the sleeping toper and the drippings 
the rain dropdropdrop from the ears the
house
the church bells chimed midnight all at
once the stout gentleman began to walk overhead
pacing slowly backwards and forwards
there was something extremely awful in all this
especially to one in my state nerves these
ghastly greatcoats these guttural breathing and
the creaking footsteps this mysterious being
his steps grew fainter and fainter and at length
died away i could bear it no longer i was
wound up to the desperation a hero romance
 be he who or what he may said i
to myself i'll have a sight him i seized
a chamber candle and hurried up to no 
the door stood ajar i hesitated i entered the
room was deserted there stood a large broad
bottomed elbow chair at a table on which was
an empty tumbler and a times newspaper
and the room smelt powerfully stilton
cheese
the mysterious stranger had evidently but
just retired i turned off to my room sorely disthe
stout gentleman 
appointed as i went along the corridor i saw
a large pair boots with dirty waxed tops
standing at the door a bed chamber they
doubtless belonged to the unknown but it would
not do to disturb so redoubtable a personage in
his den he might discharge a pistol or something
worse at my head i went to bed therefore
and lay awake half the night in a terribly
nervous state and even when i fell asleep i was
still haunted in my dreams by the idea the
stout gentleman and his waxtopped boots
i slept rather late the next morning and was
awakened by some stir and bustle in the house
which i could not at first comprehend until
getting more awake i found there was a mail
coach starting from the door suddenly there
was a cry from below 
the gentleman has forgot his umbrella
look for the gentleman's umbrella in no 
i heard an immediate scampering a chambermaid
along the passage and a shrill reply
as she ran here it is here's the gentleman's
umbrella 
 the stout gentleman
the mysterious stranger then was on the
point setting off this was the only chance
i should ever have knowing him i sprang
out bed scrambled to the window snatched
aside the curtains and just caught a glimpse 
the rear a person getting in at the coach door
the skirts a brown coat parted behind and
gave me a full view the broad disk a pair
 drab breeches the door closed all right
was the word the coach whirled off and that
was all i ever saw the stout gentleman 
forest trees
a living gallery aged trees
one the favourite themes boasting with
the squire is the noble trees on his estate which
in truth has some the finest that i have seen
in england
there is something august and solemn in the
great avenues stately oaks that gather their
branches together high in the air and seem to reduce
the pedestrians between them to mere pig
mies
an avenue oaks or elms the squire observes
 is the true colonnade that should lead
to a gentleman's house as to stone and marble
any one can rear them at once they are the
work the day but commend me to the covol
i 
 forest trees
colonnades that have grown old and great with the
family and tell by their grandeur how long the
family has endured
the squire has great reverence for certain
venerable trees gray with moss which he considers
as the ancient nobility his domain
there is the ruin an enormous oak which
has been so much battered by time and tempest
that scarce any thing is left though he says
christy recollects when in his boyhood it was
healthy and flourishing until it was struck by
lightning it is now a mere trunk with one
twisted bough stretching up into the air bearing
a green branch at the it this sturdy
wreck is much valued by the squire he calls
it his standard bearer and compares it to a veteran
warrior beaten down in the battle but bearing
up his banner to the last he has actually
had a fence built round it to protect it as much
as possible from farther injury
it is with great difficulty that the squire can
be brought to have any tree cut down on his estate
to some he looks with reverence as havforest
trees 
ing been planted by his ancestors to others with
a kind paternal affection as having been
planted by himself and he feels a degree awe
in bringing down with a few strokes the axe
what it has cost centuries to build up i confess
i cannot but sympathize in some degree
with the good squire on the subject
though brought up in a country overrun with
forests where trees are apt to be considered
mere incumbrances and to be laid low without
hesitation or remorse yet i could never see a fine
tree hewn down without concern the poets
who are naturally lovers trees as they are 
every thing that is beautiful have artfully awakened
great interest in their favour by representing
them as the habitations sylvan deities 
insomuch that every great tree had its tutelar
genius or a nymph whose existence was limited
to its duration evelyn in his sylva makes several
pleasing and fanciful allusions to this superstition
 as the fall says he a very
aged oak giving a crack like thunder has often
been heard at many miles distance constrained
 forest trees
as i often am to fell them with reluctancy i do
not at any time remember to have heard the
groans those nymphs grieving to be dispossessed
 their ancient habitations without some
emotion and pity and again in alluding to a
violent storm that had devastated the woodlands
he says methinks i still hear sure i am that i
still feel the dismal groans our forests the
late dreadful hurricane having subverted so many
thousands goodly oaks prostrating the trees
laying them in ghastly postures like whole regiments
fallen in battle by the sword the conqueror
and crushing all that grew beneath them
the public accounts he adds reckon no less
than three thousand brave oaks in one part only
 the forest dean blown down
i have paused more than once in the wilderness
 america to contemplate the traces 
some blast wind which seemed to have rushed
down from the clouds and ripped its way
through the bosom the woodlands rooting
up shivering and splintering the stoutest trees
and leaving a long track desolation
forest trees 
there was something awful in the vast havoc
made among these gigantic plants and in considering
their magnificent remains so rudely
torn and mangled and hurled down to perish
prematurely on their native soil i was conscious
 a strong movement the sympathy so feelingly
expressed by evelyn i recollect also
hearing a traveller poetical temperament expressing
the kind horror which he felt on beholding
on the banks the missouri an oak 
prodigious size which had been in a manner
overpowered by an enormous wild grape vine
the vine had clasped its huge folds round the
trunk and from thence had wound about every
branch and twig until the mighty tree had
withered in its embrace it seemed like laocoon
struggling ineffectually in the hideous coils
 the monster python it was the lion trees
perishing in the embraces a vegetable boa
i am fond listening to the conversation 
english gentlemen on rural concerns and noticing
with what taste and discrimination and
what strong unaffected interest they will 
forest trees
cuss topics which in other countries are abandoned
to mere woodmen or rustic cultivators i
have heard a noble earl descant on park and forest
scenery with the science and feeling a
painter he dwelt on the shape and beauty 
particular trees on his estate with as much pride
and technical precision as though he had been
discussing the merits statues in his collection
i found that he had even gone considerable
distances to examine trees which were celebrated
among rural amateurs for it seems that
trees like houses have their established points
 excellence and that there are some in england
which enjoy very extensive celebrity from
being perfect in their kind
there is something nobly simple and pure in
such a taste it argues think a sweet and
generous nature to have this strong relish for
the beauties vegetation and this friendship
for the hardy and glorious sons the forest
there is a grandeur thought connected with
this part rural economy it is if may be
allowed the figure the heroic line husbandry
forest trees 
it is worthy liberal and free born and aspiring
men he who plants an oak looks forward
to future ages and plants for posterity
nothing can be less selfish than this he cannot
expect to sit in its shade nor enjoy its shelter
but he exults in the idea that the acorn
which he has buried in the earth shall grow up
into a lofty pile and shall keep on flourishing
and increasing and benefiting mankind long after
he shall have ceased to tread his paternal
fields
indeed it is the nature such occupations
to lift the thought above mere worldliness as
the leaves trees are said to absorb all noxious
qualities the air and to breathe forth a purer
atmosphere so it seems to me as if they drew
from us all sordid and angry passions and
breathed forth peace and philanthropy there
is a serene and settled majesty in woodland
scenery that enters into the soul and dilates
and elevates it and fills it with noble inclinations
the ancient and hereditary groves too
that embower this island are most them full
 forest trees
 story they are haunted by the recollections
 great spirits past ages who have
sought for relaxation among them from the
tumult arms or the toils state or have
wooed the muse beneath their shade
who can walk with soul unmoved among the
stately groves penshurst where the gallant
the amiable the elegant sir philip sidney passed
his boyhood or can look without fondness
upon the tree that is said to have been planted
on his birth day or can ramble among the
classic bowers harley treading in the footsteps
 a pope and a littleton or can pause
among the solitudes windsor forest and look
at the oaks around huge gray and timeworn
like the old castle towers and not feel as if he
were surrounded by so many monuments long
enduring glory it is when viewed in this
light that planted groves and stately avenues
and cultivated parks have an advantage over
the more luxuriant beauties unassisted nature
it is that they teem with moral associations and
keep up the ever interesting story human
existence
forest trees 
it is becoming then for the high and generous
spirits an ancient nation to cherish these
sacred groves that surround their ancestral mansions
and to perpetuate them to their descendants
brought up as i have been in republican
habits and principles i can feel nothing 
the servile reverence for titled rank merely because
it is titled but i trust i am neither
churl nor bigot in my creed i do see and feel
how hereditary distinction when it falls to the
lot a generous mind may elevate that mind
into true nobility it is one the effects 
hereditary rank when it falls thus happily that
it multiplies the duties and as it were extends
the existence the possessor he does not
feel himself a mere individual link in creation
responsible only for his own brief term being
he carries back his existence in proud recollection
and he extends it forward in honourable
anticipation he lives with his ancestry and
he lives with his posterity to both does he
consider himself involved in deep responsibilities
as he has received much from those that have
vol i 
 forest trees
gone before so he feels bound to transmit much
to those who are to come after him
his domestic undertakings seem to imply a
longer existence than those ordinary men
none are so apt to build and plant for future centuries
as noble spirited men who have received
their heritages from foregone ages
i can easily imagine therefore the fondness
and pride with which i have noticed english
gentlemen generous temperaments but high
aristocratic feelings contemplating those magnificent
trees which rise like towers and pyramids
from the midst their paternal lands
there is an affinity between all natures animate
and inanimate the oak in the pride and lustihood
 its growth seems to me to take its
range with the lion and the eagle and to assimilate
in the grandeur its attributes to heroic
and intellectual man
with its mighty pillar rising straight and direct
toward heaven bearing up its leafy honours
from the impurities earth and supporting
them aloft in free air and glorious sunforest
trees 
shine it is an emblem what a true nobleman
should be a refuge for the weak a shelter for
the oppressed a defence for the defenceless 
warding off from them the pelting the storm
or the scorching rays arbitrary power he
who is this is an ornament and a blessing to
his native land he who is otherwise abuses
his eminent advantages abuses the grandeur
and prosperity which he has drawn from the
bosom his country should tempests arise
and he be laid prostrate by the storm who
would mourn over his fall should he be borne
down by the oppressive hand power who
would murmur at his fate why cumbered
he the ground 
horsemanship
indeed a coach was a strange monster in those days and the
sight one put both horse and man into amazement some said it
was a great crab shell brought out china and some imagined it to
be one the pagan temples in which the cannibals adored the divell
taylor the water poet
i have made casual mention more than once
 one the squire's antiquated retainers old
christy the huntsman i find that his crusty
crabbed humours are a source much entertainment
among the young gentlemen the family
especially the oxonian who takes a mischievous
pleasure now and then in slyly rubbing the old
man against the grain and then amuses himself
with smoothing him down again for the old
fellow is as ready to bristle up his back as a
porcupine he rides an old hunter called pepper
which is a counterpart himself a most
horsemanship 
wrathful headstrong animal that frets the flesh
off its bones bites kicks and plays all kinds
 villanous tricks
he is as tough and nearly as old as his rider
who has ridden him time out mind and is indeed
the only one that can do any thing with
him sometimes however they have a complete
quarrel and a dispute for mastery and then i am
told it is as good as a farce to see the heat they
both get into and the wrong headed contest that
ensues for they are quite knowing in each other's
ways and in the art teasing and fretting
each other notwithstanding these doughty
brawls however there is nothing that nettles old
christy sooner than to question the merits his
horse which he will uphold as tenaciously asa
faithful husband will vindicate the virtues 
the termagant spouse that gives him a curtain
lecture every night his life
the young men call old christy their professor
 equitation arid in explaining this
phrase they let me into some particulars the
squire's mode bringing up his children
 horsemanship
there is an odd mixture eccentricity any
good sense in all the opinions my worthy
host his mind is like modern gothic where
plain brick work is set off with pointed arches
and quaint tracery though the main groundwork
 his opinions is correct yet he has a
thousand little notions picked up from old books
which stand out whimsically on the surface 
his mind
thus in rearing his boys pelham markham
and such like old english writers were his
manuals at an early age he took his lads out
 their mother's hands w ho was disposed as
mothers are apt to be to make fine orderly children
 them that should keep out sun and
rain and never soil their hands nor tear their
clothes in place this the squire turned them
loose to run free and wild about the park without
heeding wind or weather he was also
particularly attentive in making them bold and
expert horsemen and these were the days when
old christy the huntsman enjoyed great importance
 as the lads were put under his care to
horsemanship 
practise them at the leaping bars and to keep
an eye upon them in the chase
the squire always objected to their riding in
carriages any kind and is still a little tenacious
on this point he often rails against the
universal use carriages and quotes the words
 honest nashe to that effect it was thought
says nashe in his quaternio a kind solecism
and to savour effeminacy for a young
gentleman in the flourishing time his age to
creep into his coach and to shroud himself
from wind and weather our great delight was
to outbrave the blustering boreas upon a great
horse to arm and prepare ourselves to go with
mars and bellona into the field was our sport
and pastime coaches and arches we left unto
them for whom they were first invented for ladies
and gentlemen and decrepid age and impotent
people
the squire insists that the english gentlemen
have lost much their hardiness and manhood
since the introduction carriages compare
he will say the fine gentleman 
horsemanship
mer times ever on horseback booted and
spurred and travel stained but open frank
manly and chivalrous with the fine gentleman
 the present day full affectation and effeminacy
rolling along a turnpike in his voluptuous
vehicle the young men those days
were rendered brave and lofty and generous in
their notions by almost living in their saddles
and having their foaming steeds like proud
seas under them there is something he
adds in bestriding a fine horse that makes a
man feel more than mortal he seems to have
doubled his nature and to have added to his
own courage and sagacity the power the speed
and stateliness the superb animal on which
he is mounted
it is a great delight says old nashe to see
a young gentleman with his skill and cunning
by his voice rod and spur better to manage
and to command the great bucephalus than the
strongest milo with all his strength one while
to see him make him tread trot and gallop the
ling and one after to see him make him gather
horsemanship 
up roundly to bear his head steadily to run a
full career swiftly to stop a sudden lightly anon
after to see him make him advance to yorke to
go back and sidelong to turn on either hand 
to gallop the gallop galliard to do the capriole
the chambetta and dance the corvette
in conformity to these ideas the squire had
them all on horseback at an early age and made
them ride slap dash about the country without
flinching at hedge or ditch or stone wall to the
imminent danger their necks
even the fair julia was partially included in
this system arid under the instruction old
christy has become one the best horsewomen
in the county the squire says it is better than
all the cosmetics and sweeteners the breath
that ever were invented he extols the horsemanship
 the ladies in former times when queen
elizabeth would scarcely suffer the rain to stop her
accustomed ride and then think he will say
what nobler and sweeter beings it made them
what a difference must there be both in mind
and body between a joyous high spirited dame

 horsemanship
 those days glowing with health and exercise
freshened by every breeze that blows seated
loftily and gracefully in her saddle with plume
on head and hawk on hand and her descendant
 the present day the pale victim modern
routs and ball rooms sunk languidly in one corner
 an enervating carriage
the good squire's equestrian system has had
a happy effect for his sons having passed through
the whole course instruction without breaking
nei k or limb are now healthful spirited and
active and have the true englishman's love fora
horse if their manliness and frankness are
praised in their father's hearing he quotes the
old persian maxim and says they have been
taught to ride to shoot and to speak the
truth
it is true the oxonian has now and then practised
the old gentleman's doctrines a little in the
extreme he is a wild youngster rather fonder
 his horse than his with a little dash 
the dandy though the ladies all pronounced
him to be the flower the flock
horsemanship 
the first year that he was sent to oxford he
had a private tutor appointed to overlook him 
a dry chip the university when he returned
home in the vacation the squire made many
inquiries about how he liked his college and
his studies and his tutor
oh as to my tutor sir i've parted with
him 
you have and pray why so 
oh sir hunting was all the go at our college 
so i discharged my tutor and kept a horse you
know
ah i was not aware that tom said the
squire mildly when tom returned to college
his allowance was doubled to enable him to
keep both horse and tutor

i will now begin to sigh read poets look pale go neatly and be
most apparently in love
marston
i should not be surprised if we should have
another brace turtles at the hall for master
simon has informed me in great confidence that
he suspects the general some design upon the
susceptible heart lady lillycraft i have
indeed noticed a growing attention and courtesy
in the veteran toward her ladyship he
softens very much in her company sits by herat
table and entertains her with long stories
about seringapatam and pleasant anecdotes 
the mulligatawney club i have even seen him
present her with a full blown rose from the hothouse
in a style the most captivating gallantlove
symptoms 
ry and it was accepted with great suavity and
graciousness for her ladyship delights in receiving
the homage and attention the sex
indeed the general was one the earliest admirers
that dangled in her train during her short
reign beauty and they flirted together for half
a season in london some thirty or forty years
since she reminded him lately in the course
 conversation about former days the time
when he used to ride a white horse in hyde
park and to canter so gallantly by the side 
her carriage whereupon i have remarked that
the veteran has regularly escorted her since
when she rides out on horseback and i suspect
he almost persuades himself that he makes
as captivating an appearance as in his youthful
days
it would be an amusing event in the history
 faithful love if this spark the tender
passion after lying dormant such a length 
time should again be fanned into a flame from
among the ashes two burnt out hearts it
may however be nothing but a little venerable
 love symptoms
flirtation the general being a veteran dangler
and the good lady habituated to these kind 
attentions master simon however thinks the
general now that he is growing old is desirous
 getting into warm winter quarters and i
doubt whether the former with all his admiration
 the veteran would be pleased at his
winning the lady as he looks upon lady lilly
craft's house as one his strong holds
among other symptoms that look suspicious
i have observed that the general has lately been
very assiduous in his attentions to her ladyship's
dogs and has several times exposed his fingers
to imminent jeopardy in attempting to pat beauty
on the head it is to be hoped his advances
to the mistress will be more favourably received
as all his overtures toward a caress are greeted
by the pestilent little cur with a wary kindling
 the eye and a most venomous growl
he has moreover been very complaisant toward
my lady's gentlewoman the immaculate
mrs hannah whom he used to speak in a
way that i do not choose to mention whether
love symptoms 
she has the same suspicions with master simon
or not i cannot say but she receives his
civilities with no better grace than the implacable
beauty unscrewing her mouth into the
most acid smile and looking as though she
could bite a piece out him in short the
poor general seems to have as formidable foes
to contend with as a hero ancient fairy tale 
who had to fight his way to his enchanted princess
through ferocious monsters every kind 
and to encounter the brimstone terrors some
fiery dragon
there is still another circumstance which inclines
me to give very considerable credit to
master simon's suspicions lady lillycraft is
very fond quoting poetry and the conversation
often turns upon it on which occasions
the general is thrown completely out it happened
the other day that spenser's fairy queen
was the theme for the great part the morning
 and the poor general sat perfectly silent
i found him not long after in the library with
spectacles on nose a in his hand and
 love symptoms
fast asleep on my approach he awoke slipped
the spectacles into his pocket and began to
read very attentively after a little while he
put a piece paper in the place and laid the
volume aside which i perceived was the fairy
queen i had the curiosity to watch how he
got on in his poetical studies but though i have
repeatedly seen him with the in his hand
yet i find the paper has not advanced above
three or four pages the general being extremely
apt to fall asleep when he reads
falconry
s t e is there hawk which mantle her on perch
whether high tow'ring or accosting low
but i the measure her flight doe search
and all her prey and all her diet know
spenser
among the many recreations the good old
times which the squire has endeavoured to revive
on his estate is that hawking he decries
shooting as a skulking solitary treacherous
sport in comparison but hawking he says was
the noble art hunting carried into the skies
it was the stately amusement gentlemen for
in old times he says according to the welsh saying
 you might know a gentleman by his hawk
horse and greyhound indeed a cavalier was
seldom seen abroad without his hawk on his fist
and even a stately dame did not think herself
vol i 
 falconry
completely equipped in riding forth unless she
had her tasseledhawk held by jesses on her delicate
hand it was thought in those excellent
days says an old writer quite sufficient for a
nobleman to wind their horn and to carry their
hawke fair and leave study and learning to the
children mean people
in pursuance this notion the squire and
his faithful coadjutor master simon have bestowed
unwearied pains in endeavouring to reclaim
as it is termed and to train up hawks for
the sport a bounty has been given for all hawks
that could be brought to them alive and the hall
has been well stocked with vermin the kind
they have studied the st albans and
markham and various other books that have
treated falconry but they have more especially
studied some old tapestry in the house whereon
is represented a party ladies and gentlemen in
ancient dresses with doublets and caps and
flaunting feathers mounted on horse with attendants
on foot all in animated pursuit the
game they have met however continual checks
falconry 
and disappointments in endeavouring to bring
this project into operation their feathered
school has turned out the most untractable and
graceless scholars and then they have had so
much trouble in drilling the hangers on who
were to take charge the hawks old christy
and the game keeper both set their faces against
it for a time christy having been nettled at hearing
what he terms a wild goose chase put on a
par with a fox hunt and the gamekeeper having
always been accustomed to look upon hawks as
highway robbers which it was his duty to
shoot down and nail in terrorem against the outhouses

christy has at length taken the matter in
hand but has done still more mischief by his
intermeddling he is as positive and wrongheaded
as he is about hunting master simon
has continual disputes with him as to feeding
and training the hawks he reads to him long
passages from the st albans but
christy who cannot read has a sovereign contempt
for all knowledge and persists in
 falconry
treating the hawks as if they were game cocks
the consequence is between these jarring systems
the poor birds have had a sad time it
many have fallen victims to christy's feeding and
to master simon's physicking for the latter has
gone to work secundum autem and given them
all the vomiting and cowering laid down in
the books never were poor hawks so fed and
physicked before others have been lost by
being but half reclaimed for on being taken
ir'o the field they have raked after the game
quite out all hearing the call and never
returned to school
all these have been petty but sore grievances
to the squire and have led him to despond about
success he has lately however been rejoiced
by the receipt a fine welch falcon
which master simon terms a li stately high
flyer it is a present from his friend sir watt
williams wynne and has soared many a
time about the pure airs snowdon and the
brow penmanmaur
ever since the squire has received this inva
falconry 
liable present he has been as impatient to sally
forth and make proof it as was don quixote
to assay his rusty armour there have been
some demurs as to whether the bird was in proper
health and training or whether it was the
proper season for the sport but all these have
been overruled by the vehement desire to play
with a new toy and it has been determined
right or w long in season or out season to
have a day's sport in hawking tomorrow
the hall as usual whenever the squire is
about to make some new sally on his hobby
is all agog with the thing miss templeton
who is brought up in reverence for all her guardian's
humours has proposed to be the party
and lady lillycraft has determined to ride out
to the scene action and look on this has
gratified the old gentleman extremely he hails
it as an auspicious omen the revival falconry
 and does not despair but the time will
come when it again will be the pride a fine
lady to carry about a noble falcon in preference
to a parrot or a lap dog
 falconry
i have amused myself with the bustling preparations
 that busy spirit master simon
and the continual thwarting he receives from
the genuine son a pepperbox old christy
they have had half a dozen consultations about
how the hawk is to be prepared for the morning's
sport old nimrod as usual has always
got in a pet upon which master simon has invariably
given up the point observing in a good
humoured tone well well have it your own
way christy only don't put yourself in a passion
a reply which always nettles the old
man ten times more than ever
hawking
the soaring hawk from fist that flies
her falconer doth constrain
sometimes to range the ground about
to find her out again
and if by sight or sound bell
his falcon he may see
wo ho be cries with cheerful voice
the gladdest man is he
handful pleasant desires
at an early hour this morning the hall was
in a bustle preparing for the sport the day i
heard master simon whistling and singing a
ditty under my window at sunrise as he was
preparing some jesses for the hawk's legs a
hearty breakfast well flanked by cold meats
was served up in the great hall all the retainers
and hangers on were in motion the
horses were led up and down before the door 
there was a direful yelping dogs some that
were to accompany us eager to set out and others
 hawking
that were to stay at home being whipped back
to their kennels at length there was a general
turning out the chivalry the fair julia was
dressed in a picturesque hunting dress with a
light plume feathers in her riding hat as
she mounted her favourite galloway i remarked
with pleasure that old christy unbent from his
usual crustiness and hastened to adjust her saddle
and bridle he touched his jockey cap as she
smiled on him and thanked him and then looking
round at the other attendants gave a knowing
motion with his head in which i read pride
and exultation at the charming appearance 
his pupil
lady lillycraft had likewise determined to
witness the sport she was dressed in her
broad white beaver tied under the chin and a
riding habit the last century she rode her
sleek ambling pony whose motion was as easy
as a rocking chair and was gallantly escorted
by the general who looked not unlike one 
the doughty heroes in the old prints the battle
 blenheim
hawking 
the parson likewise accompanied her on the
other side for this was a learned amusement in
which he took great interest and indeed had
given much counsel from his knowledge old
customs at length every thing was arranged
and off we set from the hall
the exercise on horseback puts one in fine
spirits and the scene was gay and animating
the young men the family accompanied miss
templeton she sat lightly and gracefully in
her saddle her plumes dancing and waving in
the air and the group had a charming effect as
they appeared and disappeared among the trees
cantering along with the bounding animation 
youth
the squire and master simon rode together
accompanied by old christy mounted on pepper
the latter bore the hawk on his fist as he insisted
the bird was most accustomed to him there
was a rabble rout on foot composed retainers
from the hall and some idlers from the village
with two or three spaniels for the purpose
 starting the game
vol t 
 hawkins
a kind corps de reserve came on quietly
in the rear composed lady liflycraft general
harbottle the parson and a fat footman
her ladyship ambled gently along on her sleek
pony while the general mounted on a tall hunter
looked down upon her with an air the most
protecting gallantry for my part being no
sportsman i kept with this last party or rather
lagged behind that i might take in the whole
picture and the parson occasionally slackened
his pace and jogged on in company with me
the sport led us at some distance from the
hall in a soft meadow reeking with the moist
verdure spring a little river ran through it
bordered by willows which had put forth their
tender early foliage the sportsmen were inquest
 herons which were said to keep about
this stream
i saw that there was some disputing already
among the leaders the sport the squire
master simon and old christy came every now
and then to a pause to consult together like the
field officers an army and i saw by certain
hawking 
motions the head that christy was as positive
as any old wrong headed german commander

as we were prancing up this quiet meadow
every sound we made was answered by a distinct
echo from the sunny wall an old building
that lay on the opposite margin the stream
the circumstance brought to my mind and i
could not help quoting aloud the description 
an echo on webster's duchess malay 
yond side o th river lies a wall
piece cloister which in my opinion
gives the best echo that you ever heard
so plain is the distinction our words
that many have supposed it is a spirit
that answers
upon hearing this quotation the parson mentioned
a beautiful appellation which the jews
had old for the echo which they called bathcool
that is to say the daughter the
voice
note they spid it was an oracle supplying in the second temple
the want the urim and thummim with which the first temple
was honoured
beaker le monde enchants
 hawking
we had not proceeded very far when a flight
 crows that had been regaling themselves in
the meadow alarmed by the noise we made
suddenly rose old christy all in a flurry
from previous disputing and present surprise
slipped off the hood the hawk and let her
fly immediately there was a bawling and
shouting and yelping and barking that baffles
all description
the crows flew screaming in all directions 
while the hawk soared into the air my attention
however was attracted for a time to the
party in the meadow riding along in the direction
that the bird flew their bright beaming
faces turned up to the bright skies as they
watched the game the men on foot scampered
along looking up and calling out the dogs
bounding and yelping with joyous sympathy i
was delighted with the graceful figure the
fair julia her eye beaming as blue as the sky
she was contemplating her gallant lover rode
close by her side and lady liilycraft who
watched them more than the hawk would every
hawking 
now and then exclaim oh the charming couple

i had paused on a rising ground close by her
ladyship from whence i had a good view the
sport the hawk had singled out a quarry from
among the carrion crew it was in vain old
christy called and whistled and endeavoured
to lure her down she paid no regard to him and
indeed his calls were drowned in the shouts and
yelps the army militia that he had brought
into the field
it was curious to see the efforts the two
birds to get above each other one to make the
fatal swoop the other to avoid it now they
crossed athwart a bright feathery cloud and now
they were against the clear blue sky i confess
being no sportsman i was more interested for
the poor bird that was striving for its life than
for the hawk that was playing the part a mercenary
soldier at length the hawk got the upper
hand and made a rushing stoop at her quarry
but the latter made as sudden a surge downwards
and slanting up again evaded the blow
 hawking
screaming and making the best his way for a
dry tree on the brow a neighbouring hill
the poor crow however began to flag the
falcon was again getting above him i felt more
and more interested when an exclamation from
lady liliycraft made me turn my head
i beheld a complete confusion among the
sportsmen in the little vale below us they
were gal lopping and running towards the edge 
a bank and i was shocked to see miss templeton's
horse galloping along without his rider
i rode to the place to which the others were
hurrying and when i reached the bank which
almost overhung the stream i saw at the foot 
it the fair julia pale bleeding and apparently
lifeless supported in the arms her frantic
lover
in galloping heedlessly along with her eyes
turned upwards she had unwarily approached
too near the bank it had given way with her
and she and her horse had been precipitated to
the pebbled margin the river
i never saw greater consternation the caphawking
ribs
tain was distracted lady lillycraft fainting
the squire in dismay and master simon at
his wit's ends the only one that had real presence
 mind was old christy who ran to the
stream dipped his jockey cap full water and
threw some in her face the beautiful creature
at length showed signs returning life she
opened her eyes looked around her upon the
agonized group and comprehending in a moment
the nature the scene gave a sweet smile
and putting her hand in her lover's exclaimed
feebly i am not much hurt guy i could
have taken her to my heart for that single exclamation
it was found indeed that she had
escaped almost miraculously with a contusion
 the head a sprained ancle and some slight
bruises after her wound was stanched she
was taken to a neighbouring cottage until a carriage
could be summoned to take her home
when the cavalcade which had issued forth so
gayly on this enterprize returned slowly and
pensively to the hall
i had been charmed by the generous spirit
 hawking
shown by this young creature who amidst paiii
and danger had been anxious only to relieve
the distress those around her i was gratified
therefore by the universal concern displayed
by the domestics on our return they
came crowding down the avenue each eager
to render some assistance the butler stood
ready with some curiously delicate cordial
the old housekeeper was provided with half a
dozen nostrums prepared by her own hands
according to the family recipe while her
niece the melting phoebe having no other way
 assisting stood wringing her hands and weeping
aloud
the most material effect that is likely to follow
this accident is a little delay the nuptials
which were close at hand though i
commiserate the impatience the captain on
that account yet i shall not otherwise be sorry
as i shall have a better opportunity studying
the characters here assembled with which i
grow more and more entertained
i cannot but perceive that the squire is quite
hawking 
disconcerted at this unlucky result his hawking
experiment and this unfortunate illustration 
his eulogy on female equitation old christy
too is very waspish having been sorely twitted
by master simon for having let his hawk fly
at carrion as to the falcon in the confusion
occasioned by the fair julia's disaster the bird
was totally forgotten i make no doubt she has
made the best her way back to the hospitable
hall sir watkyn williams wynne and may
very possibly be pluming her wings at this present

the conversation this evening at supper table
took a curious turn on the subject a superstition
formerly very prevalent in this part the
country relative to the present night the year
which is the eve st mark's it was believed
the parson informed us that if any one would
watch in the church porch on this eve for three
successive years from eleven till one o'clock at
night he would see on the third year the shades
 those the parish who were to die in the
st mark's eve 
course the year pass by him into the church
clad in their usual apparel
dismal as such a sight would be he assured
us it was formerly a frequent thing for persons
to make the necessary vigils he had known
more than one instance in his time one old
woman who pretended to have seen this phantom
procession was an object great awe
for the whole year afterwards and caused much
uneasiness and mischief if she shook her head
mysteriously at a person it was like a death warrant
and she had nearly caused the death a
sick person by looking ruefully in at the window

there was also an old man not many years
since a sullen melancholy temperament who
had kept two vigils and began to excite some
talk in the village when fortunately for public
comfort he died shortly after his third watching 
no doubt from a cold which he had taken as the
night was tempestuous it was reported about
the village however that he had seen his own
phantom pass by him into the church
 st mark t s eve
this led to the mention another superstition
 an equally strange and melancholy kind
which however is chiefly confined to wales
it is respecting what are called corpse candles
little wandering fires a pale bluish light that
move about like tapers in the open air and are
supposed to designate the way some corpse is to
go one was seen at lanylar late at night
hovering up and down along the bank the ista
r wish and was watched by the neighbours until
they were tired and went to bed not long
afterwards there came a comely country lass
from montgomeryshire to see her friends who
dwelt on the opposite side the river she
thought to ford the stream at the very place
where the light had been first seen but was
dissuaded on account the height the flood
she walked to and fro along the bank just where
the candle had moved waiting for the subsiding
 the water she at length endeavoured
to cross but the poor girl w r as drowned in the
attempt

there was something mournful in this little
anecdote rural superstition that seemed to
affect all the listeners indeed it is curious to
remark how completely a conversation the
kind will absorb the attention a circle and
sober down its gayety however boisterous by
degrees i noticed that every one was leaning
forward over the table with their eyes fixed
upon the parson and at the mention corpse
candles which had been seen about the chamber
 a young lady who died on the eve 
her wedding day lady lillycraft turned pale
i have witnessed the introduction stories 
the kind into various evening circles they were
often commenced in jest and listened to with
smiles but i never knew the most gay or the
most enlightened audiences that were not if
the conversation continued for any length time
completely and solemnly interested in it there
is i believe a degree superstition lurking in
every mind and i doubt if any one can thoroughly
examine all his secret notions and impulses
without detecting it hidden perhaps even from
 st mark's eve
himself it seems in fact to be a part our
nature like instinct animals acting independently
 our reason it is often found existing
in lofty natures especially those that are poetical
and aspiring a great and extraordinary poet
 our day whose life and writings evince a mind
subject to powerful exaltation is said to believe
in omens and secret intimations caesar it is
well known was greatly under the influence 
such belief and napoleon had his good and evil
days and his presiding star
i am now alone in my chamber but these
themes have taken such hold my imagination
that i cannot sleep the room in which i sit is
just fitted to foster such a state mind the
walls are hung with tapestry the figures which
are faded and look like unsubstantial shapes melting
away from sight over the fireplace is the
portrait a lady who according to the housekeeper's
tradition pined to death for the loss 
her lover in the battle blenheim she has a
most pale and plaintive countenance and seems to
fix her eyes mournfully upon me the family
st mark's eve 
have long since retired i have heard their steps
die away and the distant doors clap to after them
the murmur voices and the peal remote
laughter no longer reach the ear the clock
from the church in which so many the former
inhabitants this house lie buried has chimed
the awful hour midnight
i have sat by the window and mused upon
the dusky landscape watching the lights disappearing
one by one from the distant village and
the moon rising in her silent majesty and leading
up all the silver pomp heaven as i have
gazed upon these quiet groves and shadowy
lawns silvered over and imperfectly lighted by
streaks dewy moonshine my mind has been
crowded by thick coming fancies concerning
those spiritual beings which
walk the earth
unseen both when we wake and when we sleep
are there indeed such beings is this space between
us and the deity filled up by innumerable
orders spiritual beings forming the same gras
st mark's eve
relations between the human soul and divine perfection
that we see prevailing from humanity
down to the meanest insect it is a sublime and
beautiful doctrine inculcated by the early fathers
that there are guardian angels appointed to watch
over cities and nations to take care the welfare
 good men and to guard and guide the
steps helpless infancy nothing says st
jerome gives us a greater idea the dignity
 our souls than that god has given each us
at the moment our birth an angel to have care
 it
even the doctrine departed spirits returning
to visit the scenes and beings which were dear
to them during the bodies existence though it
has been debased by the absurd superstitions 
the vulgar in itself is awfully solemn and sublime

however lightly it may be ridiculed yet the
attention involuntarily yielded to it whenever it
is made the subject serious discussion its prevalence
in all ages and countries and even
among newly discovered nations that have had
st mark's eve 
no previous interchange thought with other
parts the world prove it to be one those
mysterious and almost instinctive beliefs to
which if left to ourselves we should naturally
incline
in spite all the pride reason and philosophy
a vague doubt will still lurk in the mind 
and perhaps will never be perfectly eradicated
as it is a matter that does not admit positive
demonstration who yet has been able to comprehend
and describe the nature the soul its
mysterious connexion with the body or in
what part the frame it is situated we
know merely that it does exist but whence it
came and when it entered into us and how it
is retained and where it is seated and how it
operates are all matters mere speculation and
contradictory theories if then we are thus ignorant
 this spiritual essence even while it
forms a part ourselves and is continually present
to our consciousness how can we pretend
to ascertain or to deny its powers and operations
when released from its fleshy prison house 
vol i 
 st mark's eve
every thing connected with our spiritual nature
is full doubt and difficulty we are fearfully
and wonderfully made we are surrounded
by mysteries and we are mysteries even to ourselves
it is more the manner in which this superstition
has been degraded than its intrinsic
absurdity that has brought it into contempt
raise it above the frivolous purposes to which it
has been applied strip it the gloom and horror
with which it has been enveloped and there
is none the whole circle visionary creeds
that could more delightfully elevate the imagination
or more tenderly affect the heart it would
become a sovereign comfort at the bed death
soothing the bitter tear wrung from us by the
agony our mortal separation what could
be more consoling than the idea that the souls 
those we once loved were permitted to return
and watch over our welfare that affectionate
and guardian spirits sat by our pillows when we
slept keeping a vigil over our most helpless
hours that beauty and innocence which had
languished into the tomb yet smiled unseen
st mark's eve 
around us revealing themselves in those blest
dreams wherein we live over again the hours 
past endearments a belief this kind would
i should think be a new incentive to virtue rendering
us circumspect even in our most secret
moments from the idea that those we once
loved and honoured were invisible witnesses 
all our actions
it would take away too from that loneliness
and destitution which we are apt to feel
more and more as we get on in our pilgrimage
through the wilderness this world and find
that those who set forward with us lovingly
and cheerily on the journey have one by one
dropped away from our side place the superstition
in this light and i confess i should like to
be a believer in it i see nothing in it that is incompatible
with the tender and merciful nature
 our religion nor revolting to the wishes and
affections the heart
there are departed beings that i have loved
as i never again shall love in this world that
have loved me as i never again shall be loved
 st mark's eve
if such beings do ever retain in their blessed
spheres the attachments which they felt on
earth if they take an interest in the poor concerns
 transient mortality and are permitted
to hold communion with those whom they
have loved on earth i feel as if now at this
deep hour night in this silence and solitude
i could receive their visitation with the most
solemn but unalloyed delight
in truth such visitations would be too happy
for this world they would take away from
the bounds and barriers that hem us in and keep
us from each other our existence is doomed
to be made up transient embraces and long
separations the most intimate friendship 
what brief and scattered portions time does
it consist we take each other by the hand
and we exchange a few words and looks 
kindness and we rejoice together for a few short
moments and then days months years intervene
and we have no intercourse with each
other or if we dwell together for a season
the grave soon closes its gates and cuts off all
st mark's eve 
further communion and our spirits must remain
in separation and widowhood until they
meet again in that more perfect state being
where soul shall dwell with soul and there
shall be no such thing as death or absence or
any other interruption our union

i have mentioned some peculiarities the
squire in the education his sons but i would
not have it thought that his instructions were
directed chiefly to their personal accomplishments
he took great pains also to form their
minds and to inculcate what he calls good old
english principles such as are laid down in the
writings pelham and his contemporaries
there is one author whom he cannot speak
without indignation which is chesterfield heavers
that he did much for a time to injure the
true national character and to introduce instead
 open manly sincerity a hollow perfidious
true gentlemen 
courtliness his maxims he affirms were
calculated to chill the delightful enthusiasm 
youth to make them ashamed that romance
which is the dawn generous manhood and to
impart to them a cold polish and a premature
worldliness
many lord chesterfield's maxims would
make a young man a mere man pleasure but
an english gentleman should not be a mere man
 pleasure he has no right to such selfish
indulgence his ease his leisure his opulence
are debts due to his country he should be a
man at all points simple frank and courteous 
intelligent accomplished and informed upright y
intrepid and disinterested one that can mingle
among freemen that can cope with statesmen 
that can champion his country and its rights
either at home or abroad
in a country like england where there is
such free and unbounded scope for the exertion
 intellect and where opinion and example
have such weight with the people every gentleman
 fortune and leisure should feel himself
 true gentlemen
bound to employ himself in some way towards
promoting the prosperity or glory the nation

in a country where intellect and action are
trammelled and restrained men rank and fortune
may become idlers and triflers with impunity 
but an english coxcomb is inexcusable and this
perhaps is the reason why he is the most offensive
and insupportable coxcomb in the world
the squire as frank bracebridge informs me
would often hold forth in this manner to his sons
when they were about leaving the paternal roof
one to travel abroad one to go to the army and
one to the university he used to have them
with him in the library which is hung with the
portraits sydney surrey raleigh what and
others
look at those models true english gentlemen
my sons he would say with enthusiasm
those were men that w r reached the graces 
the most delicate and refined taste around the
hardy virtues the soldier that mingled
what was gentle and gracious with what was
true gentlemen 
hardy and manly that possessed the true chivalry
 spirit which is the exalted essence manhood
they are the lights by which the youth
 this country should array themselves they
were the patterns and the idols their country
at home they were the illustrators its dignity
abroad surrey says camden was the first
nobleman that illustrated his high birth with the
beauty learning he was acknowledged to
be the gallants man the politest lover and the
completest gentleman his time and as to
what his friend surrey most amiably testifies
 him that his person was majestic and beautiful
his visage stern and mild that he sang
and played the lute with remarkable sweetness 
spoke the foreign languages with grace and
fluency and possessed an inexhaustible fund 
wit and see what a high commendation is
passed upon these illustrious friends
they were the two chieftains who having
travelled into italy and there tasted the sweet
and stately measures and style italian poetry
greatly polished our rude and homely manner
vol i 
true gentlemen
 vulgar poetry from what it had been before
and therefore may be justly called the reformers
 our english poetry and style and sir philip
sydney who has left us such monuments 
elegant thought and generous sentiment and
who illustrated his chivalrous spirit so gloriously
in the field and sir walter raleigh
the elegant courtier the intrepid soldier the
enterprizing discoverer the enlightened philosopher
the magnanimous martyr these are
the men for english gentlemen to study chesterfield
with his cold and courtly maxims
would have chilled and impoverished such spirits
he would have blighted all the budding
romance their temperaments sydney would
never have written his arcadia nor surrey
have challenged the world in vindication the
beauties his geraldine these are the
men my sons the squire will continue u that
show to what our national character may be
exalted when its strong and powerful qualities
are duly wrought up and refined the solidtrue
gentlemen 
est bodies are capable the highest polish
and there is no character that may be wrought
to a more exquisite and unsullied brightness
than that the true english gentleman

when guy was about to depart for the army
the squire again took him aside and gave him a
long exhortation he warned him against that
affectation cool blooded indifference which he
was told was prevalent among the young british
officers among whom it was a study to sink
the soldier in the mere man fashion a soldier
said he without pride and enthusiasm in
his profession is a mere sanguinary hireling
nothing distinguishes him from the mercenary
bravo but a spirit patriotism or a thirst for
glory it is the fashion nowadays my son
said he to laugh at the spirit chivalry 
when that spirit is really extinct the profession
 the soldier becomes a mere trade blood
he then set before him the conduct edward
the black prince who is his mirror chivalry 
valiant generous affable humane gallant in
 true gentlemen
the field but when he came to dwell on his
courtesy towards his prisoner the king france 
how he received him into his tent rather as a conqueror
than as a captive attended on him at table
like one his retinue rode uncovered beside
him on his entry into london mounted on a
common palfrey while his prisoner was mounted
in state on a white steed stately beauty the
tears enthusiasm stood in the old gentleman's
eyes
finally on taking leave the good squire put
in his son's hands as a manual one his favourite
old volumes the life the chevalier bayard
by godefroy on a blank page which he had
written an extract from the morte arthur
containing the eulogy sir actor over the body
 sir lancelot the lake which the squire
considers as comprising the excellencies a true
soldier
ah sir launcelot thou wert head all
christian knights now there holiest thou wert
never matched none earthly knight's hands
and thou wert the furthest knight that ever bare
true gentlemen 
shield and thou wert the truest friend to thy
lover that ever bestrode horse and thou wert the
truest lover a simple man that ever loved woman
 and thou wert the kindest man that ever
strook with sword and thou wert the goodliest
person that ever came among the presse 
knights and thou wert the meekest man and the
gentlest that ever late in hall among ladies 
and thou wert the sternest knight to thy mortal
foe that ever put spare in rest

as i was walking one evening with the oxon
man master simon and the general in a meadow
not far from the village we heard the sound
 a fiddle rudely played and looking in the
direction whence it came we saw a thread
 smoke curling up from among the trees the
sound music is always attractive for wherever
there is music there is good humour or goodwill
we passed along a foot path and had a
peep through a break in the hedge at the musician
and his party when the oxonian gave us a
wink and told us that if we would follow him
we should have some sport t
fortune telling 
ft proved to be a gipsy encampment consisting
 three or four little cabins or tents made 
blankets and sail cloth spread over hoops that
were stuck in the ground it was on one side
 a green lane close under a hawthorn hedge
with a broad beech tree spreading above it a
small rill tinkled along close by through the
fresh sward that looked like a carpet
a tea kettle was hanging by a crooked piece
 iron over a fire made from dry sticks and
leaves and two old gipsies in red cloaks sat
crouched on the grass gossipping over an evening
cup tea for these creatures though they
live in the open air have their ideas fireside
comforts there were two or three children
sleeping on the straw with which the tents were
littered a couple donkeys were grazing in
the lane and a thievish looking dog was lying
before the fire some the younger gipsies
were dancing to the music a fiddle played
by a tall slender stripling in an old frock coat
with a peacock's feather stuck in his hatband
as we approached a gipsy girl with a pair 
 fortune telling
fine roguish eyes came up and as usual offered
to tell our fortunes i could not but admire
a certain degree slattern elegance about the
baggage her long black silken hair was curiously
plaited in numerous small braids and
negligently put up in a picturesque style that a
painter might have been proud to have devised
her dress was figured chintz rather ragged
and not over clean but a variety most
harmonious and agreeable colours for these
beings have a singularly fine eye for colours
her straw hat was in her hand and a red cloak
thrown over one arm
the oxonian offered at once to have his fortune
told and the girl began with the usual volubility
 her race but he drew her on one
side near the hedge as he said he had no idea 
having his secrets overheard i saw he was
talking to her instead she to him and by his
glancing toward us now and then that he was
giving the baggage some private hints
when they returned to us he assumed a very
serious air zounds said he it's very asfortune
telling 
astonishing how these creatures come by their
knowledge this girl has told me some things
that i thought no one knew but myself
the girl now assailed the general come
your honour said she i see by your face
you're a lucky man but you're not happy in
your mind you're not indeed sir but have a
good heart and give me a good piece silver
and i'll tell you a nice fortune
the general had received all her approaches
with a banter and had suffered her to get hold
 his hand but at the mention the piece 
silver he hemmed looked grave and turning tous
asked if we had not better continue our
walk come my master said the girl archly
you'd not be in such a hurry if you knew all
that i could tell you about a fair lady that has a
notion for you come sir old love burns strong
there's many a one comes to see weddings that
go away brides themselves here the girl whispered
something in a low voice at which the
general coloured up was a little fluttered and
suffered himself to be drawn aside under the

hedge where he appeared to listen to her with
great earnestness and at the paid her half a
crown with the air a man that has got the
worth his money
the girl next made her attack upon master
simon who however was too old a bird to be
caught knowing that it would in an attack
upon his purse about which he is a little sensitive
as he has a great notion however 
being considered a royster he chucked her under
the chin played her off with rather broad jokes
and put on something the rakehelly air that
we see now and then assumed on the stage by
the sadboy gentleman the old school ah
your honour said the girl with a malicious
leer you were not in such a tantrum last year
when i told you about the widow you know
who but if you had taken a friend's advice you'd
never have come away from doncaster races
with a flea in your ear
there was a secret sting in this speech that
seemed quite to disconcert master simon he
jerked away his hand in a pet smacked his
fortune telling
whip whistled to his dogs and intimated that
it was high time to go home the girl however
was determined not to lose her harvest
she made an attack upon me and as i have a
weakness spirit where there is a pretty face
concerned she soon wheedled me out my
money and in return read me a fortune which
if it prove true and i am determined to believe
it will make me one the luckiest men in the
chronicles cupid
i saw that the oxonian was at the bottom 
all this oracular mystery and was disposed to
amuse himself with the general whose tender
approaches to the widow have attracted the
notice the wag i was a little curious however
to know the meaning the dark hints
which had so suddenly disconcerted master simon
 and took occasion to fall in the rear with
the oxonian on our way home when he laughed
heartily at my questions and gave me ample information
on the subject
the truth the matter is that master simon
has met with a sad rebuff since my christfortune
telling
mas visit to the hall he used at that time to
be joked about a widow a fine dashing woman
as he privately informed me i had supposed the
pleasure he betrayed on these occasions resulted
from the usual fondness old bachelors for
being teased about getting married and about
flirting and being fickle and false hearted i
am assured however that master simon had
really persuaded himself the widow had a
kindness for him in consequence which he
had been at some extraordinary expense in new
clothes and had actually got frank bracebridge
to order him a coat from stilts he began to
throw out hints about the importance a man's
settling himself in life before he grew old he
would look grave whenever the widow and
matrimony were mentioned in the same sentence
 and privately asked the opinion 
the squire and parson about the prudence
 marrying a widow with a rich jointure but
who had several children
an important member a great family connexion
cannot harp much upon the theme 
fortune telling 
matrimony without its taking wind and it soon
got buzzed about that mr simon bracebridge
was actually gone to doncaster races with a
new horse but that he meant to return in a
curricle with a lady by his side master simon
did indeed go to the races and that with a new
horse and the dashing widow did make her
appearance in her curricle but it was unfortunately
driven by a strapping young irish dragoon
 with whom even master simon's selfcom
placenta would not allow him to venture into
competition and to whom she was married shortly
after
it was a matter sore chagrin to master simon
for several months having never before
been so fully committed the dullest head in
the family had a joke upon him and there is no
one that likes less to be bantered than an absolute
joker
he took refuge for a time at old lady lillycraft's
until the matter should blow over and
occupied himself by overlooking her accounts
regulating the village choir and teaching a bullfinch
to whistle god save the king
 fortune telling
he has now pretty nearly recovered from the
mortification holds up his head and laughs as
much as any one affects to pity married men
and is particularly facetious about widows when
lady lillycraft is not by his only time 
trial is when the general gets hold him who
is infinitely heavy and persevering in his waggery
and will interweave a dull joke through
the various topics a whole dinner time master
simon often parries these attacks by a stanza
from his old work cupid's solicitor for
love
tis in vain to woo a widow over long
in once or twice her mind you may perceive 
widows are subtle be they old or young
and by their wiles young men they will deceive

come do not weep my girl
forget him pretty pensiveness there will
come others every day as good as he
sir j suckling
the approach a wedding in a family is
always an event great importance but particularly
so in a household like this in a retired
part the country master simon who is a
pervading spirit and through means the butler
and housekeeper knows every thing that
goes forward tells me that the maid servants are
continually trying their fortunes and that the
servants hall has late been quite a scene 
incantation it is amusing to notice how the
oddities the head a family flow down
through all the branches the squire in the
indulgence his love every thing that
 love charms
smacks old times has held so many grave
conversations with the parson at table about
popular superstitions and traditional rites that
they have been carried from the parlour to the
kitchen by the listening domestics and being
apparently sanctioned by such highauthority
the whole house has become infected by them
the servants are all versed in the common
modes trying luck and the charms to ensure
constancy they read their fortunes by drawing
strokes in the ashes or by repeating a form
 words and looking in a pail water st
mark's eve i am told was a busy time with
them being an appointed night for certain mystic
ceremonies several them sowed hemp
seed to be reaped by their true lovers they
even ventured upon the solemn and fearful preparation
 the dumb cake this must be done
fasting and in silence the ingredients are
handed down in traditional form an eggshell
full salt an egg shell full malt and
an egg shell full barley meal when the
cake is ready it is put upon a pan over the fire
love charms 
and the future husband will appear turn the
cake and retire but if a word is spoken or a
fast is broken during this awful ceremony
there is no knowing what horrible consequences
would ensue the experiments in the present
instance came to no result they that sowed the
hemp seed forgot the magic rhyme that they
were to pronounce so the true lover never appeared
 and as to the dumb cake what between
the awful stillness they had to keep and the
awfulness the midnight hour their hearts
failed them when they had put the cake on the
pan and seized with a sudden panic they all
ran out the room and did not return until
morning when they found the mystic cake
burnt to a cinder
the most persevering at these spells however
is phoebe wilkins the housekeeper's niece
as she is a kind privileged personage and
rather idle she has more time to occupy herself
with these matters she has always had her
head full love and matrimony she knows
the dream by heart and is quite an oracle

among the little girls the family who always
come to her to interpret their dreams in the
mornings
during the present gayety the house however
the poor girl has gone about with a face
full trouble and to use the housekeeper's
words has fallen into a sad hysterics way
lately it seems that she was born and brought
up in the village where her father was parish
clerk and she was an early playmate and
sweetheart young jack tibbets since she
has come to live at the hall however her head
has been a little turned being very pretty
and naturally genteel she has been much noticed
and indulged and being the housekeeper's
niece she has held an equivocal station between
a servant and a companion she has learned
something fashions and notions among the
young ladies which have effected quite a metamorphosis
 insomuch that her finery at church
on sundays has given mortal offence to her former
intimates in the village this has occasioned
the misrepresentations which have away
charms 
kened the implacable family pride dame
tibbets but what is worse phoebe having a
spice coquetry in her disposition showed it
on one or two occasions to her lover which produced
a downright quarrel and jack being very
proud and fiery has absolutely turned his back
upon her for several successive sundays
the poor girl is full sorrow and repentance
and would fain make up with her lover 
but he feels his security and stands aloof in
this he is doubtless encouraged by his mother 
who is continually reminding him what he owes
to his family for this same family pride seems
doomed to be the eternal bane lovers as 
hate to see a pretty face in trouble i have felt
quite concerned for poor phoebe ever since i
have heard her story am told that the coolness
 young ready money is very heavy at
her heart instead singing about the house
as formerly she goes about pale and sighing
and is very apt to break into tears when her
companions are full merriment
mrs hannah the vestal gentlewoman my
 love charms
lady lillycraft has had long talks with phoebe
and has endeavoured to squeeze some her
own verjuice into the other one's milky nature
she speaks with contempt and abhorrence the
whole sex and advises phoebe to despise all the
men as she does but phoebe's loving temper
is not to be curdled there is no such thing as
hatred or contempt for mankind in her whole
composition her only thoughts are how to
conciliate and reclaim her lover
the spells and love charms which are matters
 sport to the other domestics are serious concerns
with this lovestricken lass she is continually
trying her fortune in a variety ways
i am told that she has absolutely fasted for six
wednesdays and three fridays successively
having understood that it was a sovereign charm
to ensure being married to one's liking within
the year she carries about also a lock her
sweetheart's hair and a ribband he once gave
her being a mode producing constancy in
love she even went so far as to try her fortune
by the moon which has always had much to do
love charms
with lovers dreams and fancies for this purpose
she went out in the night the full moon
knelt on a stone in the meadow and repeated the
old traditional rhyme 
all hail to thee moon all hail to thee
i pray thee good moon now show to me
the youth who my future husband shall be
when she came back to the house she was faint
and pale and went immediately to bed the next
morning she told her companions that she had
seen some one close by the hedge in the meadow
which she was sure was young tibbets at any
rate she had dreamt him all night both 
which she was assured were most happy signs
it has since turned out that the person in the
meadow was old christy the huntsman who
was walking his nightly rounds with the great
stag hound so that phoebe's faith in the charm
is completely shaken

yesterday the fair julia made her first appearance
down stairs since her accident and the
sight her spread a universal cheerfulness
through die household she was extremely
pale however and could not walk without pain
and difficulty she was assisted therefore to a
sopha in the library which is pleasant and retired
looking out among trees and so quiet that the
little birds came hopping upon the windows and
peering curiously into the apartment
here several the family gathered round and
devised ways to amuse her and make the day pass
pleasantly lady lillycraft lamented the want
 some new novel to while away the time and
was almost in a pet because the author 
waverley had not produced a work for the last
three months
there was a motion made to call on the parson

for some his old legends or ghost stories but

at length the captain bethought himself and
said he believed he had a manuscript tale lying
in one corner his campaigning trunk which if
he could find and the company were desirous
he would read to them the offer was eagerly
accepted he retired and soon returned with a
roll blotted manuscript in a very gentlemanlike
but nearly illegible hand and a great part
written on cartridge paper
it is one the scribbling said he u 
my poor friend charles lightly the dragoons
he was a curious romantic studious
fanciful fellow the favourite and often the
unconscious butt his fellow officers who entertained
themselves with his eccentricities he
 the library
was in some the hardest service on the peninsula
and distinguished himself by his gallantry
when the intervals duty permitted he
was fond roving about the country visiting
noted places and was extremely curious about
moorish ruins when at his quarters he was a
great scribbler and passed much his leisure
with his pen in his hand
as i was a much younger officer and a
very young man he took me in a manner
under his care and we became close friends he
used often to read his writings to me having a
great confidence in my taste for i always
praised them poor fellow he was shot
down close by me at waterloo we lay wounded
together for some time during a hard contest
that took place near at hand as i was least
hurt i tried to relieve him and to stanch the
blood which flowed from a wound in his breast
he lay with his head in my lap and looked up
thankfully in my face but shook his head faintly
and made a sign that it was all over with
him and indeed he died a few minutes afterthe
library 
wards just as our men had repulsed the enemy
and came to our relief i have his favourite
dog and his pistols to this day and several 
his manuscripts which he gave to me at different
times the one i am now going to read
is a tale which he told me he wrote in spain
during the time that he lay ill a wound received
at salamanca
we now arranged ourselves to hear the story
the captain seated himself on the sofa beside
the fair julia who i had noticed to be somewhat
affected by the picture he had carelessly
drawn wounds and dangers in a field battle
she now leaned her arm fondly on his
shoulder and her eye glistened as it rested on
the manuscript the poor literary dragoon
lady lillycraft had a deep wellcushioned elbow
chair wheeled up for her accommodation
her dogs were nestled on soft mats at her feet 
and the gallant general took his station in an
arm chair at her side and toyed with her ladyship's

once upon a time in the ancient city granada
there sojourned a young student salamanca
 the name antonio de castro he
was pursuing a course reading in the library
 the university and at the same time indulging
his curiosity by examining those remains 
moorish magnificence for which granada is renowned
while occupied in his studies he frequently
noticed an old man singular appearance
who was likewise a visiter at the library
 

 the student salamanca
he was lean and withered apparently more from
study than age his eyes though bright and
visionary were sunk in his head and thrown into
shade by overhanging eyebrows his dress was
always the same a black doublet a short
black cloak very rusty and threadbare red
stockings a small ruff and a large overshadowing
hat
his appetite for knowledge seemed insatiable
he would pass whole days in the library absorbed
in study consulting a multiplicity authors
 as though he were pursuing some interesting
subject through all its ramifications so
that in general when evening came he was
almost buried among books and manuscripts
the curiosity antonio was excited and hei
inquired the attendants concerning the stranger
no one could give him any information
excepting that he had been for some time past a
casual frequenter the library that his reading
lay chiefly among works treating the occult
sciences and that he was particularly curious
in his inquiries after arabian manuscripts they
added that he never held communication with
o
the student salamanca 
any one excepting to ask for particular works 
that after a fit studious application he would
disappear for several days and even weeks and
when he revisited the library he would look more
withered and haggard than ever
the student felt interested by this account 
he was leading rather a desultory life and had
all that capricious curiosity which springs up in
idleness he determined to make himself acquainted
with this bookworm and find out who
and what he was
the next time that he saw the old man at the
library he commenced his approaches by requesting
permission to peruse one the volumes with
which the unknown appeared to have finished
the latter merely bowed his head in token 
assent after pretending to look through the
volume with great attention he returned it with
many acknowledgments the stranger made
no reply
may i ask senor said antonio with some
hesitation may i ask what you are searching
after in all these books 
 the student salamanca
the old man raised his head with an expression
 surprise at having his studies interrupted
for the first time arid by so intrusive a question
he surveyed the student with a side glance from
head to foot wisdom my son said he calmly
 and the search requires every moment 
my attention he then cast his eyes upon his
 and resumed his studies but father
said antonio cannot you spare a moment to
point out the road to others it is to experienced
travellers like you that we strangers in the paths
 knowledge must look for directions on our
journey
the stranger looked disturbed i have not
time enough my son to learn said he much
less to teach i am ignorant myself the path
 true knowledge how then can i show it to
others 
well but father 
senor said the old man mildly but earnestly
you must see that i have but few steps
more to the grave in that short space have i
to accomplish the whole business my existence
the student salamanca 
i have no time for words every word is as one
grain sand my glass wasted suffer me to
be alone
there was no replying to so complete a closing
 the door intimacy the student found
himself calmly but totally repulsed though
curious and inquisitive yet he was naturally
modest and on after thoughts he blushed at his
own intrusion his mind soon became occupied
by other objects he passed several days wandering
among the mouldering piles moorish
architecture those melancholy monuments an
elegant and voluptuous people he paced the
deserted halls the alhambra the paradise 
the moorish kings he visited the great court
 the lions famous for the perfidious massacre
 the gallant abencerrages he gazed with
admiration at its mosaic cupolas gorgeously
painted in gold and azure its basins marble 
its alabaster vase supported by lions and storied
with inscriptions
his imagination kindled as he wandered
among these scenes they were calculated to
awaken all the enthusiasm a youthful mind
 the student salamanca
most the halls have anciently been beautified
by fountains the fine taste the arabs delighted
in the sparkling purity and reviving
freshness water and they erected as it were
altars on every side to that delicate element
poetry mingles with architecture in the al alhambra
it breathes along the very walls whereever
antonio turned his eye he beheld inscriptions
in arabic wherein the perpetuity moorish
power and splendour within these walls was
confidently predicted alas how had the prophecy
been falsified many the basins where
the fountains had once thrown up their sparkling
showers were dry and dusty some the
palaces were turned into gloomy convents and
the barefoot monk paced through those courts
which had once glittered with the array and
echoed to the music moorish chivalry
in the course his rambles the student more
than once encountered the old man the library
he was always alone and so full 
thought as not to notice any one about him
he appeared to be intent upon studying those
the student salamanca 
half buried inscriptions which are found here
and there among the moorish ruins and seem
to murmur from the earth the tale former
greatness the greater part these have since
been translated but they were supposed by
many at the time to contain symbolical revelations
and golden maxims the arabian sages
and astrologers
as antonio saw the stranger apparently decy
peering these inscriptions he felt an eager longing
to make his acquaintance and to participate
in his curious researches but the repulse he had
met with at the library deterred him from making
any farther advances
he had directed his steps one evening to the
sacred mount which overlooks the beautiful valley
watered by the darro the fertile plain the
vega and all that rich diversity vale and
mountain that surrounds granada with an earthly
paradise it was twilight when he found himself
at the place where at the present day are
situated the chapels known by the name the
sacred furnaces they are so called from
vol i 
 the student salamanca
grottoes in which some the primitive saints
are said to have been burnt at the time antonio's
visit the place was an object much
curiosity in an excavation these grottoes
several manuscripts had recently been discovered
engraved on plates lead they were written
in the arabian language excepting one which
was in unknown characters the pope had
issued a bull forbidding any one under pain 
excommunication to speak these manuscripts
the prohibition had only excited the greater
curiosity and many reports were whispered
about that these manuscripts contained treasures
 dark and forbidden knowledge
as antonio was examining the place from
whence these mysterious manuscripts had been
drawn he again observed the old man the
library wandering among the ruins his curiosity
was now fully awakened the time and
place served to stimulate it he resolved to watch
this unknown groper after secret and forgotten
lore and to trace him to his habitation there
was something like adventure in the thing that
the student salamanca 
charmed his romantic disposition he followed
the stranger therefore at a little distance at
first cautiously but he soon observed him to be
so wrapped in his own thoughts as to take little
heed external objects they passed along
the skirts the mountain and then by the shady
banks the darro they pursued their way
for some distance from granada along a lonely
road that led among the hills the gloom 
evening was gathering and it was quite dark
when the stranger stopped at the portal a solitary
mansion
it appeared to be a mere wing or ruined fragment
 what had once been a pile some consequence
the walls were great thickness
the windows narrow and generally secured by
iron bars the door was planks studded
with iron spikes and had been great strength
though at present it was much decayed atone
 the mansion was a ruinous tower in
the moorish style architecture the edifice
had probably been a country retreat or castle 
pleasure during the occupation granada by
 the student salamanca
the moors and rendered sufficiently strong to
withstand any casual assault in those warlike
times
the old man knocked at the portal a light appeared
at a small window just above it and a
female head looked out it might have served
as a model for one raphael's saints the
hair was beautifully braided and gathered in a
silken net and the complexion as well as could
be judged from the light was that soft rich brunette
so becoming in southern beauty
it is i my child said the old man the
face instantly disappeared and soon after a
wicket door in the large portal opened antonio
who had ventured near to the building caught a
transient sight a delicate female form a pair
 fine black eyes darted a look surprise at
seeing a stranger hovering near and the door
was precipitately closed
there was something in this sudden gleam 
beauty that wonderfully struck the imagination
 the student it was like a brilliant flashing
from its dark casket he sauntered about re
tee student salamanca 
harding the gloomy pile with increasing interest
a few simple wild notes from among some rocks
and trees at a little distance attracted his attention
he found there a group giants a
vagabond gipsy race that at that time abounded
in spain and lived in hovels and caves the
hills about the neighbourhood granada some
were busy about a fire others were listening to
the uncouth music which one their companions
seated on a ledge the rock was making
with a split reed
antonio endeavoured to obtain some information
 them concerning the old building and its
inhabitants
the one who appeared to be their spokesman
was a gaunt fellow with a subtle gait a whispering
voice and a sinister roll the eye he
shrugged his shoulders on the student's inquiries
and said that all was not right in that building
an old man inhabited it whom nobody knew
and whose family appeared to be only his daughter
and a female servant he and his companions
he added lived up among the neighbouring
 the student salamanca
hills and as they had been about at night they
had often seen strange lights and heard strange
sounds from the tower some the country
people who worked in the vineyards among the
hills believed the old man to be one that dealt in
the black art and were not over fond passing
near the tower at night but for our parts
said the gitano we are not a people that trouble
ourselves much with fears that kind
the student endeavoured to gain more precise
information but they had none to furnish
him they began to be solicitous for a compensation
for what they had already imparted and
recollecting the loneliness the place and the
vagabond character his companions he was
glad to give them a gratuity and to hasten homewards

he sat down to his studies but his brain was
too full what he had seen and heard his eye
was upon the page but his fancy still returned to
the tower and he was continually picturing the
little window with the beautiful head peeping
out or the door half open and the nymphlike
form within
the student salamanca 
he retired to bed but the same objects
haunted his dreams he was young and susceptible
 and the excited state his feelings from
wandering among the abodes departed grace
and gallantry had predisposed him for a sudden
impression from female beauty
the next morning he strolled again in the direction
 the tower it was still more forlorn
by the broad glare day than in the gloom 
evening the walls were crumbling and weeds
and moss were growing in every crevice it
had the look a prison rather than a dwelling
house in one angle however he remarked a
window which seemed an exception to the surrounding
squalidness there w z as a curtain
drawn within it and flowers standing on the
window stone whilst he was looking at it the
curtain was partially withdrawn and a delicate
white arm the most beautiful roundness was
put forth to water the flowers
the student made a noise to attract the attention
 the fair florist he succeeded the
curtain was farther drawn and he had a glance
 the student salamanca
 the same face he had seen the evening before
 it was but a mere glance the curtain
again fell and the casement closed all this
was calculated to excite the feelings a romantic
youth had he seen the unknown under
other circumstances it is probable that he would
not have been struck with her beauty but this
appearance being shut up and kept apart
gave her the value a treasured gem he passed
and repassed before the house several times
in the course the day but saw nothing more
he was there again in the evening the whole
aspect the house was dreary the narrow
windows emitted no rays cheerful light to indicate
that there was social life within antonio
listened at the portal but no sound voices
reached his ear just then he heard the clapping
to a distant door and fearing to be detected
in the unworthy act eavesdropping
he precipitately drew off to the opposite side 
the road and stood in the shadow a ruined
archway
he now remarked a light from a window in
the student salamanca 
the tower it was fitful and changeable commonly
feeble and yellowish as if from a lamp
with an occasional glare some vivid metallic
colour followed by a dusky glow a column
 dense smoke would now and then rise in the
air and hang like a canopy over the tower
there was altogether such a loneliness and
seeming mystery about the building and its inhabitants
that antonio was half inclined to indulge
the country people's notions and to fancy it the
den some powerful sorcerer and the fair damsel
he had seen some spellbound beauty
after some time had elapsed a light appeared
in the window where he had seen the beautiful
arm the curtain was down but it was so
thin that he could perceive the shadow someone
passing and repassing between it and the
light he fancied that he could distinguish
that the form was delicate and from the alacrity
 its movements it was evidently youthful
he had not a doubt but this was the bed chamber
 his beautiful unknown
presently he heard the sound a guitar and
vol i 
 the student salamanca
a female voice singing he drew near cautiously
and listened it was a plaintive moorish
ballad and he recognized in it the lamentations
 one the abencerrages on leaving the
walls lovely granada it was full passion
ad tenderness it spoke the delights
 early life the hours love it had enjoyed
on the banks the darro and among the
blissful abodes the alhambra it bewailed
the fallen honours the abencerrages and imprecated
vengeance on their oppressors antonio
was affected by the music it singularly
coincided with the place it was like the voice
 past times echoed in the present and breathing
among the monuments its departed glories

the voice ceased after a time the light disappeared
and all was still she sleeps said
antonio fondly he lingered about the building
with the devotion with which a lover lingers
about the bower sleeping beauty the rising
moon threw its silver beams on the gray
walls and glittered on the casement the
the student salamanca 
late gloomy landscape gradually became flooded
with its radiance finding therefore that he
could no longer move about in obscurity and
fearful that his loitering might be observed he
reluctantly retired
the curiosity which had at first drawn the
young man to the tower was now seconded by
feelings a more romantic kind his studies
were almost entirely abandoned he maintained
a kind blockade the old mansion he
would take a with him and pass a great
part the day under the trees in its vicinity 
keeping a vigilant eye upon it and endeavouring
to ascertain what were the walks his mysterious
charmer he found however that she
never went out except to mass when she was
accompanied by her father he waited at the
door the church and offered her the holy
water in the hopes touching her hand a little
office gallantry common in catholic countries
she however modestly declined without raising
her eyes to see who made the offer and always
took it herself from the font she was attentive
 the student salamanca
in her devotion her eyes were never taken from
the altar or the priest and on returning home
her countenance was almost entirely concealed
by her mantilla
antonio had now carried on the pursuit for
several days and was hourly getting more and
more interested in the pursuit but never a step
nearer to the game his lurking about the
house had probably been noticed for he no longer
saw the fair face at the window nor the white
arm put forth to water the flowers
his only consolation was to repair nightly to
his post observation listen to her warbling
and if by chance he could catch a sight her
shadow passing and repassing before the window
he thought himself most fortunate
as he was indulging in one these evening
vigils which were complete revels the imagination
the sound approaching footsteps made
him withdraw into the deep shadow the ruined
archway opposite to the tower a cavalier
approached wrapped in a large spanish cloak
he paused under the window the tower
the student op salamanca 
after a little while began a serenade accompanied
by his guitar in the usual style spanish
gallantry his voice was rich and manly he
touched the instrument with skill and sang
with amorous and impassioned eloquence
the plume his hat was buckled by jewels
that sparkled in the moon beams and as he
played on the guitar his cloak falling off from
one shoulder showed him to be richly dressed
it was evident that he was a person rank
the idea now flashed across antonio's mind
that the affections his unknown beauty might
be engaged she was young and doubtless susceptible
and it was not in the nature spanish
females to be deaf and insensible to music and
admiration the surmise brought with it a
feeling dreariness there vas a pleasant
dream several days suddenly dispelled he
had never before experienced any thing the
tender passion and as its morning dreams are
always delightful he would fain have continued
in the delusion
u but what have i to do with her attached
the student salamanca
ments thought he i have no claim on her
heart nor even on her acquaintance how do
i know that she is worthy affection or if
she is must not so gallant a lover as this with
his jewels his rank and his detestable music
have completely captivated her what idle
humour is this that i have fallen into i must
again to my books study study will soon
chase away all these idle fancies
the more he thought however the more he
became entangled in the spell which his lively
imagination had woven round him and now
that a rival had appeared in addition to the
other obstacles that environed this enchanted
beauty she appeared ten times more lovely and
desirable it was some slight consolation to
him to perceive that the gallantry the unknown
met with no apparent return from the
tower the light at the window was extinguished
 the curtain remained undrawn and
none the customary signals were given to
intimate that the serenade was accepted
the cavalier lingered for some time about the
the student salamanca 
place and sang several other tender airs with a
taste and feeling that made antonio's heartache
at length he slowly retired the student
remained with folded arms leaning against the
ruined arch endeavouring to summon up resolution
enough to depart but there was a romantic
fascination that still enchained him to the
place it is the last time said he willing to
compromise between his feelings and his judgment
 it is the last time then let me enjoy
the dream a few moments longer
as his eye ranged about the old building to
take a farewell look he observed the strange
light in the tower which he had noticed on a
former occasion it kept beaming up and declining
as before a pillar smoke rose in the
air and hung in sable volumes it was evident
the old man was busied in some those operations
that had gained him the reputation a
sorcerer throughout the neighbourhood
suddenly an intense and brilliant glare shone
through the casement followed by a loud report
and then a fierce and ruddy glow a figure 
the student salamanca
feared at the window uttering cries agony or
alarm but immediately disappeared and a body
 smoke and flame whirled out the narrow
aperture antonio rushed to the portal and
knocked at it with vehemence he was only
answered by loud shrieks and found that the
females were ready in helpless consternation
with an exertion desperate strength he forced
the wicket from its hinges and rushed into the
house
he found himself in a small vaulted hall and
by the light the moon which entered at the
door he saw a stairs to the left he hurried up
it to a narrow corridor through which was ruling
a volume smoke he found here the
two females in a frantic state alarm one 
them clasped her hands and implored him to save
her father
the corridor terminated in a small spiral staircase
leading up to the tower he sprang up it
to a small door through the chinks which
came a glow light and smoke was spurning
out he burst it open and found himself in an
he student salamanca 
antique vaulted chamber furnished with furnace
and various chemical apparatus a shattered
retort lay on the stone floor a quantity combustibles
nearly consumed with various half
burnt books and papers were sending up an expiring
flame and filling the chamber with stifling
smoke just within the threshold lay the reputed
conjurer he was bleeding his clothes
were scorched and he appeared lifeless antonio
caught him up and bore him down the
stairs to a chamber in which there was a light
and laid him on a bed
the female domestic was despatched for such
appliances as the house afforded but the daughter
threw herself frantically beside her parent
and could not be reasoned out her alarm her
dress was all in disorder her dishevelled hair
hung in rich confusion about her neck and bosom
 and never was there beheld a lovelier picture
 terror and affliction
the skilful assiduities the scholar soon produced
signs returning animation in his patient
the old man's wounds though severe
vol j 
 the student salamanca
were not dangerous they bad evidently been
produced by the bursting the retort in his
bewilderment he had been enveloped in the stifling
metallic vapours which had overpowered
his feeble frame and had not antonio arrived to
his assistance it is probable he would never have
recovered
by slow degrees he came to his senses he
looked about with a bewildered air at the chamber
the agitated group around and the student
who was leaning over him
where am i said he wildly at the
sound his voice his daughter uttered a faint
exclamation delight my poor inez said
he embracing her then putting his hand to his
head and taking it away stained with blood he
seemed suddenly to recollect himself and to be
overcome with emotion
aye cried he all is over with me all
gone all vanished gone in a moment the
labour a lifetime lost
his daughter attempted to soothe him but he
became slightly delirious and raved incoherently
the student salamanca 
about malignant demons and about the habitation
 the green lion being destroyed his
wounds being dressed and such other remedies
administered as his situation required he sank
into a state quiet antonio now turned his
attention to the daughter whose sufferings had
been little inferior to those her father having
with great difficulty succeeded in tranquillizing
her fears he endeavoured to prevail upon
her to retire and seek the repose so necessary to
her frame proffering to remain by her father
until morning i am a stranger said he it is
true and my offer may appear intrusive but
i see you are lonely and helpless and i cannot
help venturing over the limits mere ceremony
should you feel any scruple or doubt however
say but a word and i will instantly retire
there was a frankness a kindness and a
modesty mingled in antonio's deportment that
inspired instant confidence and his simple scholar's
garb was a recommendation in the house
 poverty the females consented to resign the
sufferer to his care as they would be the better
able to attend to him on the morrow
 the student salamanca
on retiring the old domestic was profuse in
her benedictions the daughter only looked her
thanks but as they shone through the tears
that filled her fine black eyes the student
thought them a thousand times the most eloquent

here then he was by a singular turn 
chance completely housed within this mysterious
mansion when left to himself and the bustle
 the scene was over his heart throbbed as he
looked round the chamber in which he was sitting
it was the daughter's room the promised
land towards which he had cast so many a longing
gaze the furniture was old and had probably
belonged to the building in its prosperous
days but every thing was arranged with propriety
the flowers that he had seen her attend stood
in the window a guitar leaned against a table
on which stood a crucifix and before it lay a
missal and a rosary there reigned an air 
purity and serenity about this little nestling place
 innocence it was the emblem a chaste
and quiet mind some few articles female
the student op salamanca 
dress lay on the chairs and there was the very
bed on which she had slept the pillow on which
her soft cheek had reclined the poor scholar
was treading enchanted ground for what fairyland
has more magic in it than the bed chamber
 innocence and beauty 
from various expressions the old man in
his ravings and from what he had noticed on a
subsequent visit to the tower to see that the fire
was extinguished antonio had gathered that
his patient was an alchymist the philosopher's
stone was an object eagerly sought after by visionaries
in those days but in consequence 

the superstitious prejudices the times and the
frequent persecutions its votaries they were
apt to pursue their experiments in secret in
lonely houses in caverns and ruins or in the
privacy cloistered cells
in the course the night the old man had
several fits restlessness and delirium he would
call out upon theophrastus and geber and
albertus magnus and other sages his art 
and anon would murmur about fermentation
 the student salamanca
and x projection until towards daylight he once
more sank into a salutary sleep
when the morning sun darted his rays into
the casement the fair inez attended by the female
domestic came blushing into the chamber
the student now took his leave having himself
need repose but obtained ready permission to
return and inquire after the sufferer when he
called again he found the alchymist languid
and in pain but apparently suffering more in
mind than in body his delirium had left him
and he had been informed the particulars 
his deliverance and the subsequent attentions
 the scholar he could do little more than
look his thanks but antonio did not require
them his own heart repaid him for all that he
had done and he almost rejoiced in the disaster
that had gained him an entrance into this mysterious
habitation
the alchymist was so helpless as to need
much assistance antonio remained with him
therefore the greater part the day he repeated
his visit the next day and the next
the student salamanca 
every day his company seemed more pleasing
to the invalid and every day he felt his interest
in the latter increasing perhaps the presence
 the daughter might have been at the
bottom this solicitude
he had frequent and long conversations with
the alchymist he found him as men his
pursuits were apt to be a mixture enthusiasm
and simplicity curious and extensive
reading on points little utility with great
inattention to the every day occurrences life
and profound ignorance the world he was
deeply versed in singular and obscure branches
 knowledge and much given to visionary
speculations antonio whose mind was a
romantic cast had himself given some attention
to the occult sciences and entered upon
those themes with an ardour that delighted the
philosopher their conversations frequently
turned upon astrology divination and the great
secret the old man would forget his aches
and wounds rise up like a spectre in his bed
and kindle into eloquence on his favourite 
the student salamanca
pics when gently admonished his situation
it would but prompt him to another sally
 thought alas r my son he would say
is not this very decrepitude and suffering
another proof the importance those secrets
with which we are surrounded why
are we trammelled by disease withered by old
age and our spirits quenched as it were within
us but because we have lost those secrets 
life and youth which were known to our parents
before their fall to regain these have philosophers
been ever since aspiring but just as
they are on the point securing the precious
secrets for ever the brief period life is at an
 they die and with them all their wisdom
and experience nothing as de nuysment
observes nothing is wanting for man's perfection
but a longer life less crost with sorrows
and maladies to the attaining the full
and perfect knowledge things
at length antonio so far gained on the heart
 his patient as to draw from him the outlines
 his story
the student salamanca 
felix de vasquez the alchymist was a native
 castile and an ancient and honourable
line early in life he had married a beautiful
female the descendant one the moorish
families the marriage displeased his father
who considered the pure spanish blood contaminated
by this foreign mixture it is true
the lady traced her descent from one the
abencerrages the most gallant moorish cavaliers
who had embraced the christian faith
on being exiled from the walls granada
the injured pride the father however was
not to be appeased he never saw his son
afterwards and on dying left him but a scanty
portion his estate bequeathing the residue
in the piety and bitterness his heart to the
erection convents and the performance 
masses for souls in purgatory don felix resided
for a long time in the neighbourhood 
valladolid in a state embarrassment and obscurity
he devoted himself to intense study 
having while at the university salamanca
imbibed a taste for the secret sciences he was
vol r 
 the student salamanca
enthusiastic and speculative he went on from
one branch knowledge to another until he
became zealous in the search after the grand
arcanum
he had at first engaged in the pursuit with the
hopes raising himself from his present obscurity
and resuming the rank arid dignity to which
his birth entitled him but as usual it ended in
absorbing every thought and becoming the business
 his existence he was at length aroused
from this mental abstraction by the calamities 
his household a malignant fever swept off his
wife and all his children excepting an infant
daughter these losses for a time overwhelmed
and stupefied him his home had in a manner
died away from around him and he felt lonely
and forlorn when his spirit revived within him
he determined to abandon the scene his humiliation
and disaster to bear away the child
that was still left him beyond the scene contagion
 and never to return to castile until he
should be enabled to reclaim the honour his
line
the student salamanca 
he had ever since been wandering and unsettled
in his abode sometimes the resident populous
cities at other times absolute solitudes
he had searched libraries meditated on inscriptions
 visited adepts different countries and
sought to gather and concentrate the raps which
had been thrown by various minds upon the secrets
 alchymy he had at one time travelled
quite to padua to search for the manuscripts 
pietro d'abano and to inspect an urn which
had been dug up near este supposed to have
been buried by maximus olibius and to have
contained the great elixir
while at padua he had met with an adept
versed in arabian lore who talked the invaluable
this urn was found in it contained a lesser one
in which was a burning lamp betwixt two small vials the one 
gold the other silver both them full a very clear liquor on
the largest was an inscription stating that maximus olibius shut up in
this small vessel elements which he had prepared with great toil
there were many disquisitions among the learned on the subject it
was the most received opinion that this maximus olibius was an inhabitant
 padua that he had discovered the great secret and that
these vessels contained liquor one to transmute metals to gold the
other to silver the peasants who found thee urns imagining this
precious liquor to be common water spilt every drop so that the art
 transmuting metals remains as much a secret as ever
 the student salamanca
able manuscripts that must remain in the spanish
libraries preserved from the spoils the
moorish academies and universities the probability
 meeting with precious unpublished
writings geber and alfarabius and avicenna
the great physicians the arabian schools who
it was well known had treated much alchymy
 but above all he spoke the arabian
tablets lead which had recently been dug up
in the neighbourhood granada and which
contained the lost secrets the art
the indefatigable alchymist once more bent
his steps for spain full renovated hope he
had made his way to granada he had wearied
himself in the study arabic in decyphering
inscriptions in rummaging libraries and exploring
every possible trace left by the arabian
sages
in all his wanderings he had been accompanied
by inez through the rough and the smooth the
pleasant and the adverse never complaining but
rather seeking to sooth his cares by her innocent
and playful caresses her instruction had been
the student salamanca 
the employment and the delight his hours 
relaxation she had grown up while they were
wandering and had scarcely ever known any
home but by his side he was family friends
home every thing to her he had carried her
in his arms when they first began their wayfaring 
had nestled her as an eagle does its young
among the rocky heights the sierra morea
she had sported about him in childhood in the
solitudes the bateucas had followed him asa
lamb does the shepherd over the rugged pyrenees
and into the fair plains languedoc and
now she was grown up to support his feeble steps
among the ruined abodes her maternal ancestors

his property had gradually wasted away in
the course his travels and his experiments
still hope the constant attendant the alchymist
led him on ever on the point reaping
the reward his labours and ever disappointed
with the credulity that often attended his art
he attributed many his disappointments to the
machinations the malignant spirits that beset
 the student salamanca
the path the alchymist and torment him in his
solitary labours
it is their constant endeavour he observed to
close up every avenue to those sublime truths
which would enable man to rise above the abject
state into which he had fallen and to return to
his original perfection to the evil offices 
these demons he attributed his late disaster he
had been on the very verge the glorious discovery
 never were the indications more completely
auspicious all was going on prosperously
when at the critical moment which should
have crowned all his labours with success and
have placed him at the very summit human
power and felicity the bursting a retort had
reduced his laboratory and himself to ruin
i must now said he give up at the very
threshold success my books and papers are
burnt my apparatus is broken i am too old
to bear up against these evils the ardour that
once inspired me is gone my poor frame is exhausted
by study and watchfulness and this last
misfortune has hurried me towards the grave
the student salamanca 
he concluded in a tone deep dejection
antonio endeavoured to comfort and reassure
him but the poor alchymist had for once
awakened to a consciousness the worldly ills
that were gathering around him and had sunk
into despondency after a pause and some
thoughtfulness and perplexity brow antonio
ventured to make a proposal
i have long said he been filled with a
love for the secret sciences but have felt too ignorant
and diffident to give myself up to them
you have acquired experience you have amassed
the knowledge a lifetime it were a 
should be thrown away you say you are too
old to renew the toils the laboratory suffer
me to undertake them add your knowledge
to my youth and activity and what shall we not
accomplish as a probationary fee and a fund
on which to proceed i will bring into the common
stock a sum gold the residue a legacy
which has enabled me to complete my education
a poor scholar cannot boast much but i
trust we shall soon put ourselves beyond the
 the student salamanca
reach want and if we should fail why 
must depend like other scholars upon my brains
to carry me through the world
the philosopher's spirits were however
more depressed than the student had imagined
this last shock following in the rear so
many disappointments had almost destroyed
the reaction his mind the fire an enthusiast
however is never so low but that it maybe
blown again into a flame by degrees the
old man was cheered and reanimated by the
buoyancy and ardour his sanguine companion
he at length agreed to accept the services 
the student and once more to renew his experiments
he objected however to using the
student's gold notwithstanding that his own
was nearly exhausted but this objection was
soon overcome the student insisted on making
it a common stock and common cause and
then how absurd was any delicacy about such
a trifle with men who looked forward to discovering
the philosopher's stone
while therefore the alchymist was slowly
the student salamanca 
recovering the student busied himself in getting
the laboratory once more in order it was
strewed with the wrecks retorts and alembics
 with old crucibles boxes and phials 
powders and tinctures and half burnt books
and manuscripts
as soon as the old man was sufficiently recovered
the studies and experiments were renewed
the student became a privileged and
frequent visiter and was indefatigable in his
toils in the laboratory the philosopher daily
derived new zeal and spirits from the animation
 his disciple he was now enabled to prosecute
the enterprise with continued exertion
having so active a coadjutor to divide the toil
while he was poring over the writings sands
and philalethes and dominus de nuys
ment and endeavouring to comprehend the symbolical
language in which they have locked up
their inscrutable mysteries antonio would occupy
himself among the retorts and crucibles
and keep the furnace in a perpetual glow
with all his zeal however for the discovery
vol i 
 the student salamanca
 the golden art the feelings the student had
not cooled as to the object that first drew him
to this ruinous mansion during the old man's
illness he had frequent opportunities being
near the daughter and every day made him
more sensible to her charms there was a pure
simplicity and an almost passive gentleness in
her manners yet with all this was mingled something
whether mere maiden shyness or a consciousness
 high descent or a dash castilian
pride or perhaps all united which prevented
undue familiarity and made her difficult approach

the danger her father and the measures to
be taken for his relief had at first overcome this
coyness and reserve but as he recovered and her
alarm subsided she seemed to shrink from the
familiarity she had indulged with the youthful
stranger and to become every day more shy
and silent
antonio had read many books but this was
the first volume woman kind that he had
ever studied he had been captivated with the
the student salamanca 
very title page but the farther he read the
more he was delighted she seemed formed to
love her soft black eye rolled languidly under
its long silken lashes and wherever it turned it
would linger and repose there was tenderness
in every beam to him alone she was reserved
and distant now that the common cares 
the sick room were at an he saw little
more her than before his admission to the
house sometimes he met her on his way to
and from the laboratory and at such times there
was ever a smile and a blush but after a simple
salutation she glided on and disappeared
tis plain thought antonio my presence
is indifferent if not irksome to her she
has noticed my admiration and is determined to
discourage it nothing but a feeling gratitude
prevents her treating me with marked distaste
 and then has she not another lover rich
gallant splendid musical how can i suppose
she would turn her eyes from so brilliant a cavalier
to a poor obscure student raking among the
cinders her father's laboratory 
 the student salamanca
indeed the idea the amorous serenader
continually haunted his mind he felt convinced
that he was a favoured lover yet if so
why did he not frequent the tower why did
he not make his approaches by noonday 
there was mystery in this eavesdropping and
musical courtship surely inez could not be
encouraging a secret intrigue oh no she was
too artless too pure too ingenuous but then
the spanish females were so prone to love and
intrigue and music and moonlight were so seductive
 and inez had such a tender soul languishing
in every look oh would the
poor scholar exclaim clasping his hands if i
could but once behold those lovely eyes beaming
on me with affection
it is incredible to those who have not experienced
it on what scanty aliment human life and
human love may be supported a dry crust
thrown now and then to a starving man will
give him a new lease existence and a faint
smile or a kind look bestowed at casual intervals
will keep a lover loving on when a man in
his sober senses would despair
the student salamanca 
when antonio found himself alone in the laboratory
his mind would be haunted by one 
these looks or smiles which he had received in
passing he would set it in every possible light
and argue on it with all the selfpleasing selfteasing
logic a lover
the country around him was enough to
awaken that voluptuousness feeling so favourable
to the growth passion the window
 the tower rose above the trees the romantic
valley the darro and looked down
upon some the loveliest scenery the vega 
where the groves citrons and orange were refreshed
by cool springs and brooks the purest
water the xenel and the darro wound their
shining streams along the plain and gleamed
from among its bowers the surrounding hills
were covered with vineyards and the mountains
crowned with snow seemed to melt into the blue
sky the delicate airs that played about the
tower were perfumed by the fragrance myrtle
and orange blossoms and the ear was charmed
with the fond warbling the nightingale which
 the student salamanca
in these happy regions sings the whole day
long sometimes too there was the idle song
 the muleteer sauntering along the solitary
road or the notes the guitar from some
group peasants dancing in the shade all
these were enough to fill the head a young
lover with poetic fancies and antonio would
picture to himself how he could live among those
happy groves and wander by those gentle rivers
and love away his life with inez
he felt at times impatient at his own weakness
and would endeavour to brush away these
cobwebs the mind he would turn his
thoughts with sudden effort to his occult studies
 or occupy himself in some perplexing process
 but often when he had partially succeeded
in fixing his attention the sound inez lute
or the soft notes her voice would come stealing
upon the stillness the chamber and as it
were floating round the tower there was no
great art in her performance but antonio thought
he had never heard music comparable to this
it was perfect witchcraft to hear her warble forth
the student salamanca 
some her national melodies those little spanish
romances and moorish ballads that transport
the hearer in idea to the banks the
guadalquiver or the walls alhambra and
make him dream beauties and balconies and
moonlight serenades
never was poor student more sadly beset than
antonio love is a troublesome companion ina
study at the best times but in the laboratory
 an alchymist his intrusion is terribly disastrous
instead attending to the retorts and
crucibles and watching the process some experiment
entrusted to his charge the student
would get entranced in one these love dreams
from which he would often be aroused by some
fatal catastrophe the philosopher on returning
from his researches in the libraries would
find every thing gone wrong and antonio in despair
over the ruins the whole day's work
the old man however took all quietly for his
had been a life experiments and failure
we must have patience my son would he
say as all the great masters that have gone 
the student salamanca
fore us have had errors arid accidents and
delays are what we have to contend with did
not pontus err two hundred times before he
could obtain even the matter on which to found
his experiments the great flame too did
he not labour four and twenty years before he
ascertained the first agent what difficulties
and hardships did not cartilages encounter
at the very threshold his discoveries and
bernard de trees even after he had attained
a knowledge all the requisites was he not
delayed full three years what you consider
accidents my son are the machinations our
invisible enemies the treasures and golden
secrets nature are surrounded by spirits hostile
to man the air about us teems with them
they lurk in the fire the furnace in the bottom
 the crucible and the alembic and are
ever on the alert to take advantage those
moments when our minds are wandering from
the intense meditation on the great truths that
we are seeking we must only strive the more
to purify ourselves from those gross and earthly
the student salamanca 
feelings which becloud the soul and prevent
her from piercing into nature's arcana
alas thought antonio if to be purified
from all earthly feeling requires that i should
cease to love inez i fear i shall never discover
the philosopher's stone 
in this way matters went on for some time at
the alchymist's day after day was sending the
student's gold in vapour up the chimney every
blast the furnace made him a ducat the
poorer without apparently helping him a jot
nearer the golden secret still the young man
stood by and saw piece after piece disappearing
without a murmur he had daily an opportunity
 seeing inez he felt as if her favour would
be better than silver or gold and that every smile
was worth a ducat
sometimes in the cool the evening when
the toils the laboratory happened to be suspended
he would walk with the alchymist in
what had once been a garden belonging to the
mansion there were still the remains terraces
and balustrades and here and there a
vol i 
 the student salamanca
marble urn or mutilated statue overturned and
buried among weeds and flowers run wild
it was the favourite resort the alchymist in
his hours relaxation where he would give full
scope to his visionary flights his mind was
tinctured with the rosycrucian doctrines he
believed in elementary beings some favourable
others adverse to his pursuits and in the exaltation
 his fancy had often imagined that he
held communion with them in his solitary walks
about the whispering groves and echoing walls
 this old garden when accompanied by antonio
he would prolong these evening recreations
indeed he sometimes did it out consideration
for his disciple for he feared his too close application
and his incessant seclusion in the tower
would be injurious to his health he was delighted
and surprised by this extraordinary zealand
perseverance in so young a tyro and looked
upon him as destined to be one the great luminaries
 the art lest the student should
repine at the time lost in these relaxations the
good alchymist would fill them up with wholethe
student salamanca 
some knowledge in matters connected with their
pursuit and would walk up and down the alleys
with his disciple imparting oral instruction like
an ancient philosopher
in all his visionary schemes there breathed a
spirit lofty though chimerical philanthropy
that won the admiration the scholar
nothing sordid nothing sensual nothing petty
or selfish seemed to enter into his views in respect
to the grand discoveries he was anticipating
on the contrary his imagination kindled
with conceptions widely dispensed happiness
he looked forward to the time when he
should be able to go about the earth relieving the
indigent comforting the distressed and by his
unlimited means devising and executing plans
for the complete extirpation poverty and all its
attendant sufferings and crimes never were
grander schemes for universal good for the distribution
 boundless wealth and universal competence
devised than by this poor indigent alchemist
in his ruined tower
antonio would attend these peripatetic 
the student salamanca
turns with all the ardour a devotee but there
was another circumstance which may have given
a secret charm to them the garden was the
resort also inez where she took her walks 
recreation the only exercise that her secluded
life permitted
as antonio was duteously pacing by the side
 his instructor he would often catch a glimpse
 the daughter walking pensively about the alleys
in the soft twilight sometimes they would
meet her unexpectedly and the heart the
student would throb with agitation a blush
too would crimson the cheek inez but still
she passed on and never joined them
he had remained one evening until rather a
late hour with the alchymist in this favourite
resort it was a delightful night after a sultry
day and the balmy air the garden was peculiarly
reviving the old man was seated on a
fragment a pedestal looking like a part 
the ruin on which he sat he was edifying his
pupil by reading long lessons wisdom from
the stars as they shone out with brilliant lustre
the student op salamanca 
in the dark blue vault a southern sky and
by quoting by memory from behmen and other
 the rosycrucians concerning the signature 
earthly things and passing events which may be
discerned in the heavens the power the
stars over corporeal beings and their influence
in the fortunes the sons men
by degrees the moon arose and shed her
gleaming light among the chequered groves
antonio apparently listened with fixed attention
to the sage but his ear was drinking in the melody
 inez voice who was singing to her lute
in one the moonlight glades the garden
the old man having exhausted his theme sat
gazing in silent reverie at the heavens antonio
could not resist an inclination to steal a look at
this coy beauty that was playing the part the
nightingale so sequestered and musical leaving
the alchymist in his celestial reverie he stole
gently along one the alleys the music had
ceased and he thought he heard the sound 
voices he came to an angle a copse that
had screened a kind green recess ornamented
 the student salamanca
by a marble fountain the moon shone full
upon the place and by its light he beheld his unknown
serenading rival at the feet inez he
was detaining her by the hand which he covered
with kisses but at the sight antonio he started
up and half drew his sword while inez disengaged
fled back to the house
all the jealous doubts and fears antonio
were now confirmed he did not remain to encounter
the resentment his happy rival at
being thus interrupted but turned from the place
with sudden wretchedness heart that inez
should love another would have been misery
enough but that she should be capable a
dishonourable amour shocked him in the extreme
the idea deception in so young and
apparently artless a being brought with it that
sudden distrust in human nature so sickening to
a youthful and ingenuous mind but when he
thought the kind simple parent she was deceiving
whose affections all centered in her he
felt for a moment a sentiment indignation
and almost aversion
the student salamanca 
he found the alchymist still seated in visionary
contemplation the moon come hither
m on said he with his usual enthusiasm
come read with me this vast volume wisdom
thus nightly unfolded before us wisely
did the chaldean sages affirm that the heaven
is as a mystic page uttering speech to those
who can rightly understand warning them 
good and evil and instructing them in the
secret decrees late
the student's heart ached for his venerable
master and for a time he felt the futility all
his occult wisdom alas poor old man
thought he little dost thou dream while busied
in airy speculations among the stars what a
treason against thy happiness is going on under
thine eye as it were in thy very bosom oh
inez inez where shall we look for truth and
innocence where shall we repose in confidence
in woman if even you can deceive 
it was a trite apostrophe such as every lover
makes when he finds his mistress not quite
such a goddess as he had painted her with
 the student salamanca
the student however it sprang from honest
anguish heart he returned to his lodgings
in pitiable confusion mind he now deplored
the infatuation that had led him on until
his feelings were so thoroughly engaged he
resolved to abandon his pursuits at the tower
and trust to absence to dispel the fascination by
which he had been spell bound he no longer
thirsted after the discovery the grand elixir 
the dream alchymy was over for without
inez what was the value the philosopher's
stone 
he rose after a sleepless night with the determination
 taking his leave the alchymist
and tearing himself from granada for
several days did he rise with the same resolution
and every night saw him come back
to his pillow to repine at his want resolution
and to make fresh determinations for the
morrow in the meanwhile he saw less inez
than ever she no longer walked in the garden
but remained almost entirely in her apartment
when she met him she blushed more
the student salamanca 
than usual and once hesitated as if she would
have spoken but after a temporary embarrassment
and still deeper blushes she made some
casual observation and retired antonio read
in this confusion a consciousness fault and
 that fault's being discovered what could
she have wished to communicate perhaps to
account for the scene in the garden but how
can she account for it or why should she account
for it to me what am i to her or
rather what is she to me exclaimed he impatiently
with a new resolution to break through
these entanglements the heart and fly from
this enchanted spot for ever
he was returning that very night to his lodgings
full these excellent determinations
when in a shadowy part the road he
passed a person whom he recognized by his
height and form for his rival he was going
in the direction the tower if any lingering
doubts remained here was an opportunity 
settling them completely he determined to
follow this unknown cavalier and under favol
i 
 the student salamanca
your the darkness observe his movements
if he obtained access to the tower or in anyway
a favourable reception antonio felt as if it
would be a relief to his mind and would enable
him to fix his waveringesolution
the unknown as he came near the tower
was more cautious and stealthy in his approaches
he was joined under a clump trees by
another person and they had much whispering
together a light was burning in the chamber
 inez the curtain was drawn but the casement
was left open as the night was warm after
some time the light was extinguished a considerable
interval elapsed the cavalier and his
companion remained under covert the trees
as if keeping watch at length they approached
the tower with silent and cautious steps the
cavalier received a dark lanthorn from his companion
and threw off his cloak the other then
softly brought something from the clump trees
which antonio perceived to be a light ladder
he placed it against the wall and the serenade
gently ascended a sickening sensation came
over antonio here was indeed a confirmathe
student salamanca 
tion every fear he was about to leave the
place never to return when he heard a stifled
shriek from inez chamber
in an instant the fellow that stood at the foot
 the ladder lay prostrate on the ground antonio
wrested a stiletto from his nerveless hand
and hurried up the ladder he sprang in at the
window and found inez struggling in the grasp
 his fancied rival the latter disturbed from
his prey caught up his lanthorn turned its light
full upon antonio and drawing his sword made
a furious assault luckily the student saw the
light gleam along the blade and parried the
thrust with the stiletto a fierce but unequal
combat ensued antonio fought exposed to the
full glare the light while his antagonist was
in shadow his stiletto too was but a poor defence
against a rapier he saw that nothing
w r ould save him but closing with his adversary
and getting within his weapon he rushed furiously
upon him and gave him a severe blow with
the stiletto but received a wound in return from
the shortened sword at the same moment a
 the student salamanca
blow was inflicted from behind by the confederate
who had ascended the ladder it felled
him to the floor and his antagonists made their
escape
by this time the cries inez had brought
her father and the domestic to the room antonio
was found weltering in his blood and
senseless he was conveyed to the chamber
 the alchymist who now repaid in kind
the attentions which the student had once bestowed
upon him among his varied knowledge
he possessed some skill in surgery which at
this moment was more value than even his
chronical lore he stanched and dressed the
wounds his disciple which on examination
proved less desperate than he had at first apprehended

for a few days however his case was anxious
and attended with danger the old man
watched over him with the affection a parent
he felt a double debt gratitude towards
him on account his daughter and himself
he loved him too as a faithful and zealous
the student salamanca 
disciple and he dreaded lest the world should
be deprived the promising talents so aspiring
an alchymist
an excellent constitution soon medicine his
wounds and there was a balsam in the looks
and words inez that had a healing effect on
still severer wounds which he carried in his
heart she displayed the strongest interest in
his safety she called him her deliverer her
preserver it seemed as if her grateful disposition
sought in the warmth its acknowledgments
to repay him for past coldness
but what most contributed to antonio's recovery
was her explanation concerning his supposed
rival it was some time since he had
first beheld her at church and he had ever since
persecuted her with his attentions
he had beset her in her walks until she had
been obliged to confine herself to the house except
when accompanied by her father he had
besieged her with letters serenades and every
art by which he could urge a vehement but
clandestine and dishonourable suit the scene
 the student salamanca
in the garden was as much a surprise to her as
to antonio her persecutor had been attracted
by her voice and had found his way over a
ruined part the wall he had come upon her
unawares was detaining her by force and pleading
his insulting passion when the appearance
 the student interrupted him and enabled her
to make her escape she had forborne to mention
to her father the persecution which she
suffered she wished to spare him unavailing
anxiety and distress and had determined to confine
herself more rigorously to the house though
it appeared that even here she had not been
safe from his daring enterprize
antonio inquired whether she knew the name
 this impetuous admirer she replied that he
had made his advances under a fictitious name
but that she had heard him once called by the
name don ambrosio de loxia
antonio knew him by report for one the
most determined and dangerous libertines in all
granada artful accomplished and if he chose
to be so insinuating but daring and headlong
the student salamanca 
in the pursuit his pleasures violent and implacable
in his resentments he rejoiced to find
that inez had been proof against his seductions
and had been inspired with loathing by his splendid
profligacy but he trembled to think the
dangers she had run and he felt solicitude about
the dangers that must yet environ her
at present however it was probable the enemy
had a temporary quietus the traces blood
had been found for some distance from the ladder
until they were lost among thickets and as
nothing had been heard or seen him since
it was concluded thathe had been seriously
wounded
as the student recovered from his wounds he
was enabled to join inez and her father in their
domestic intercourse the chamber in which
they usually met had probably been a saloon 
state in former times the floor was marble
 the walls partially covered with the remains
 tapestry the chairs richly carved and covered
with tarnished and tattered brocade against
the wall hung a long rusty rapier the only re
 the student salamanca
pique that the old man retained the chivalry 
his ancestors there might have been something
to provoke a smile in the contrast between the
mansion and its inhabitants between present
poverty and the traces departed grandeur 
but the fancy the student had thrown so
much romance about the edifice and its inmates
that every thing was clothed with charms the
philosopher with his broken down pride and his
strange pursuits seemed to comport with the
melancholy ruin he inhabited and there was a
native elegance spirit about the daughter that
showed she would have graced the mansion in
its happier days
what delicious moments were these to the
student inez was no longer coy and reserved
she was naturally artless and confiding though
the kind persecution she had experienced
from one admirer had rendered her for a time
suspicious and circumspect she now felt an
entire confidence in the sincerity and w r orth 
antonio mingled with an overflowing gratitude
when her eyes met his they beamed with symthe
student salamanca 
path and kindness and antonio no longer
haunted by the idea a favoured rival once
more aspired to success
at these domestic meetings however he had
little opportunity paying his court except by
looks the alchymist supposing him like himself
absorbed in the study alchymy endeavoured
to cheer the tediousness his recovery
by long conversations on the art he even
brought several his half burnt volumes that
the student had once rescued from the flames
and entertained him by the hour by reading copious
chapters the old man delighted in the
mystic phrases and symbolical jargon in which
the writers that have treated alchymy have
wrapped their communications rendering them
unintelligible except to the initiated with
what rapture would he elevate his voice at a
triumphant passage announcing the grand discovery
 thou shall see would he exclaim in
the words henry kuhnrade the stone the
philosophers our king go forth thebedcham
amphitheatre the eternal wisdom
vol i 
 the student salamanca
ber his glassy sepulchre into the theatre this
world that is to say regenerated and made perfect
a shining carbuncle a most temperate splendour
whose most subtle and depurated parts
re inseparable united into one with a concordia
mixture exceeding equal transparent as
chrystal shining red like a ruby permanently
colouring or ringing fixt in all temptations or
tryals yea in the examination the burning
sulphur itself and the devouring waters and in
the most vehement persecution the fire always
incombustible and permanent as a salamander

the student had a high veneration for the
fathers alchymy and a profound respect for
his instructor but what was henry kuhnrade
geber lully or even albertus magnus himself
compared to the countenance inez
which presented such a page beauty to his
perusal while therefore the good alchymist
was doling out knowledge by the hour his disciple
would forget books alchymy every thing
but the lovely object before him
the student salamanca 
inez too unpractised in the science the
heart was gradually becoming fascinated by
the silent attentions her lover day by day
she seemed more and more perplexed by the
kindling and strangely pleasing emotions her
bosom her eye was often cast down in
thought blushes stole to her cheek without
any apparent cause and light half suppressed
sighs would follow these short fits musing
her little ballads though the same that she had
always sung yet breathed a more tender spirit
either the tones her voice were most soft and
touching or some passages were delivered with
a feeling which she had never before given them
antonio beside his love for the abstruse sciences
had a pretty turn for music and never did philosopher
touch the guitar more tastefully as
by degrees he conquered the mutual embarrassment
that kept them asunder he ventured to
accompany her in some her songs he had
a voice full fire and tenderness as he sang
one would have thought from the kindling
blushes his companion that he had been
 the student salamanca
pleading his own passion in her ear let those
who would keep two youthful hearts asunder
beware music oh this leaning over chairs
and conning the same music and entwining
 voices and melting away in harmonies 
the german waltz is nothing to it the worthy
alchymist saw nothing all this his mind
could admit no idea that was not connected
with the discovery the grand arcanum and
he supposed his youthful coadjutor equally devoted
he was a mere child as to human nature
 and as to the passion love whatever
he might once have felt it he had long since
forgotten that there was such an idle passion
in existence but while he dreamed the silent
amour went on the very quiet and seclusion
 the place was favourable to the growth 
romantic passion the opening bud love
was able to put forth leaf by leaf without an
adverse wind to check its growth there was
neither officious friendship to chill by its advice
nor insidious envy to wither by its sneers nor
an observing world to look on and stare it out
the student salamanca 
 countenance there was neither declaration
nor vow nor any other form cupid's canting
school their hearts mingled together and understood
each other without the aid language
they lapsed into the full current affection
unconscious its depth and thoughtless the
rocks that might lurk beneath its surface happy
lovers who wanted nothing to make their
felicity complete but the discovery the philosopher's
stone 
at length antonio's health was sufficiently restored
to enable him to return to his lodgings in
granada he felt uneasy however at leaving
the tower while lurking danger might surround
its almost defenceless inmates he dreaded lest
don ambrosio recovered from his wounds
might plot some new attempt by secret art or
open violence from all that he had heard he
knew him to be too implacable to suffer his defeat
to pass unrevenged and too rash and fearless
when his arts were unavailing to stop at
any daring deed in the accomplishment his
purposes he urged his apprehensions to the
 the student salamanca
alchymist and his daughter and proposed that
they should abandon the dangerous vicinity

went on to paint the beauties and delights va

paints the fields and groves which he is picturing
as the future scenes his happiness his eloquence
backed by the apprehensions inez
was successful with the alchymist who indeed 
had led too unsettled a life to be particular about
the place his residence and it was determined
that as soon as antonio's health was perfectly
restored they should abandon the tower and
seek the neighbourhood valencia
to recruit his strength the student suspended
his toils in the laboratory and spent the few remaining
days before departure in taking a farewell
look at the enchanting environs granada
he felt returning health and vigour as he in
the student salamanca 
haled the pure temperate breezes that play
about its hills and the happy state his mind
contributed to his rapid recovery inez was often
the companion his walks her descent by the
mother's side from one the ancient moorish
families gave her an interest in this once favourite
seat arabian power she gazed
with enthusiasm upon its magnificent monuments
and her memory was filled with the traditional
tales and ballads moorish chivalry
indeed the solitary life she had led and the
visionary turn her father's mind had produced
an effect upon her character and given it a tinge
 what in modern days would be called romance
all this was called into full force by
this new passion for when a woman first begins
to love life is all romance to her
in one their evening strolls they had ascended
to the mountain the sun where is
situated the generalise the palace pleasure
in the days moorish dominion but now
a gloomy convent capuchins they had
wandered about its garden among groves 
 the student salamanca
orange citron and cypresses where the waters
leaping in torrents or gushing in fountains
or tossed aloft in sparkling jets fill the
air with music and freshness still there is a
melancholy mingled with all the beauties this
garden that gradually stole over the feelings
 the lovers the place is full the sad
story past times it was the favourite abode
 the lovely queen granada where she
was surrounded by the delights a gay and
voluptuous court it was here too amidst her
own bowers roses that her slanderers laid
the base story her dishonour and struck a
fatal blow to the line the gallant abencer
rages
the whole garden has a look ruin and neglect
many the fountains are dry and
broken the streams have wandered from their
marble channels and are choked by weeds and
yellow leaves the reed whistles to the wind
where it had once sported among roses and
shaken perfume from the orange blossom the
convent bell flings its sullen sound or the drown

sy vesper hymn floats along these solitudes
which once resounded with the song and the
dance and the lover's serenade well may
the moors lament over the loss this earthly
paradise well may they remember it in their
prayers and beseech heaven to restore it to the
faithful well may their ambassadors smite their
breasts when they wander among these monuments
 their race and sit down and weep
among the fading glories granada 
it is impossible to wander among these scenes
 departed love and gayety and not feel the
tenderness the heart awakened it was then
that antonio first ventured to breathe his passion
arid to express by words what his eyes had
long since so eloquently revealed he made
his avowal with fervour but with frankness
he had no gay prospects to hold out he was a
poor scholar dependent on his good spirits to
feed and clothe him but a woman in love is
no interested calculator inez listened to him
with downcast eyes but in them was a humid
gleam that showed her heart was with him
vol j 
 the student salamanca
she had no prudery in her nature and she had
not been sufficiently in society to acquire it
she loved him with all the absence worldliness
 a genuine woman and amidst timid
smiles and blushes he drew from her a modest
acknowledgment her affection they wandered
about the garden with sweet intoxication
 the soul which none but happy lovers know
the world about them was all fairy land and
indeed it spread forth one its fairest scenes
before their eyes as if to fulfil their dream 
earthly happiness they looked out from between
groves orange upon the towers granada
below them the magnificent plain the
vega beyond streaked with evening sunshine
and the distant hills tinted with rosy and purple
hues it seemed an emblem the happy future
that love and hope was decking out for them
as if to make the scene complete a group 
andalusians struck up a dance in one the
vistas the garden to the notes the guitars
 two wandering musicians the spanish
music is wild and plaintive yet the people dance
the student salamanca 
to it with enthusiasm the picturesque figures
 the dancers the girls with their hair in silken
nets that hung in knots and tassels down their
backs their mantillas floating round their airy
figures their slender feet and ankles peeping
from under their basquines their arms thrown
up in the air to play the castanets had a beautiful
effect on this airy height with the rich
evening landscape spreading out below them
in a little while the dance ceased two the
parties approached antonio and inez and began
a soft and tender moorish ballad accompanied
by the lute it alluded to the story the garden
 the wrongs the fair queen granada
and the misfortunes the abencerrages it
was one those old ballads that abound in
andalusia and seem to e like echoes about
the ruins moorish greatness the tears rose
into the eyes inez as she listened to the tale 
her heart was open to every tender impression
the singer approached her and suddenly
varying her manner sang impending danger
and treachery the manner the look the gest
the student salamanca
circulation the singer was such as to make it
pointed arid startling she was about to ask
the meaning this evidently personal application
 the song when she was interrupted by
antonio who gently drew her from the place
while she had been lost in attention to the music
he had remarked a group men in the
shadow the trees whispering together they
were enveloped in the broad hats and great
cloaks so much worn by the spanish and while
they were regarding himself and inez attentively
seemed anxious to avoid observation
not knowing what might be their character or
intention he hastened to quit a place where the
gathering shadows evening might expose
them to intrusion and insult on their way
down the hill as they passed through the woods
 elms mingled with poplars and oleanders
that skirt the road leading from the alhambra
he again saw these men apparently following
at a distance and he afterwards caught sight 
them among the trees on the banks the varro
he said nothing on the subject to inez nor
the student salamanca 
her father for he would not awaken unnecessary
alarm but he felt at a loss how to ascertain
or to avert any machinations that might
be devising again the helpless inhabitants the
tower
he took his leave them at night full this
perplexity as he left the dreary old pile he
saw some one lurking in the shadow the wall
apparently watching his movements he hastened
after the figure but it glided away and
disappeared among some ruins shortly after he
heard a low whistle which was answered from a
little distance he had no longer a doubt but
that some mischief was on foot and turned to
hasten back to the tower and put its inmates on
their guard he had scarcely turned however
before he found himself suddenly seized from
behind by some one herculean strength his
struggles were in vain he was surrounded byarmed
men one threw a mantle over him that
stifled his cries and enveloped him in its folds
and he was hurried off with irresistible rapidity
the next day passed without the appearance
 the student salamanca
 antonio at the alchymist's another and
another day succeeded and yet he did not come
nor had any thing been heard him at his lodgings
his absence caused at first surprise and
conjecture and at length alarm inez recollected
the singular intimations the ballad
singer upon the mountain which seemed to warn
her impending danger and her mind was full
 vague forebodings she sat listening to every
sound at the gate or tread on the stairs she
would take up her guitar and strike a few notes
but it would not do her heart was sickening with
suspense and anxiety she had never before
felt what it was to be really lonely she now
was conscious the force that attachment
which had taken possession her breast for
never do we know how much we love never do
we know how necessary the object our love
is to our happiness until we experience the
weary void separation
the philosopher too felt the absence his
disciple almost as sensibly as did his daughter
the animating buoyancy the youth had in
the student salamanca 
spired him with new ardour and had given to
his labours the charm full companionship
however he had resources and consolations 
which his daughter was destitute his pursuits
were a nature to occupy every thought and
keep the spirits in a state continual excitement
certain indications too had lately manifested
themselves the most favourable nature
forty days and forty nights had the process gone
on successfully the old man's hopes were constantly
rising and he now considered the glorious
moment once more at hand when he should
obtain not merely the major lunaria but likewise
the tincture salaries the means multiplying
gold and prolonging existence he
remained therefore continually shut up in his
laboratory watching his furnace for a moment's
inadvertency might once more defeat all his expectations

he was sitting one evening at one his solitary
vigils wrapped up in meditation the hour
was late and his neighbour the owl was hooting
from the battlements the tower when he
 the student salamanca
heard the door open behind him supposing
it to be his daughter coming to take her leave 
him for the night as was her frequent practice
he called her by name but a harsh voice met his
ear in reply he was grasped by the arms and
looking up perceived three strange men in the
chamber he attempted to shake them off butin
vain he called for help but they scoffed
at his cries
peace dotard cried one think'st thou
the servants the most holy inquisition are to
be daunted by thy clamours comrades away
with him 
without heeding his remonstrances and entreaties
they seized upon his books and papers
took some note the apartment and the utensils
and then bore him off a prisoner
inez left to herself had passed a sad and
lonely evening by a casement which looked into
a garden she had pensively watched star after
star sparkle out the blue depths the sky
and was indulging a crowd anxious thoughts
about her lover until the rising tears began to
the student salamanca 
flow she was suddenly alarmed by the sound
 voices that seemed to come from a distant
part the mansion there was not long after
a noise several persons descending the stairs 
surprised at these unusual sounds in their lonely
habitation she remained for a few moments in a
state trembling yet indistinct apprehension 
when the servant rushed into the room with terror
in her countenance and informed her that
her father was carried off by armed men inez
did not stop to hear farther but flew down stairs
to overtake them she had scarcely passed the
threshold when she found herself in the grasp 
strangers
away away cried she wildly do not
stop me let me follow my father
we are come to conduct you to him senora
said one the men respectfully
where is he then 
he is gone to granada replied the man
an unexpected circumstance requires his presence
there immediately but he is among
friends
vol i 
 the student salamanca
we have no friends in granada said inez
drawing back but then the idea antonio
rushed to her mind something relating to him
might have called her father thither is senor
antonio de castro with him demanded she
with agitation
i know not senora replied the man it is
very possible i only know that he is among
friends and is anxious for you to follow him
let us go then cried she eagerly the men
led her a little distance to where a mule was
waiting and assisting her to mount they conducted
her slowly towards the city
granada was on that evening a scene fanciful
revel it was one the festivals the
maestranza an association the nobility to
keep up some the gallant customs ancient
chivalry there had been a representation 
a tournament in one the squares the streets
would still occasionally resound with the beat
 a solitary drum or the bray a trumpet
from some straggling party revellers sometimes
they were met by cavaliers richly dressed
in ancient costumes attended by their squires
the student salamanca 
and at one time they passed in sight a
palace brilliantly illuminated from whence
came the mingled sounds music and the
dance shortly after they came to the square
where the mock tournament had been held it
was thronged by the populace recreating themselves
among booths and stalls where refreshments
were sold and the glare torches
showed the temporary galleries and gay coloured
awnings and armorial trophies and other
paraphernalia the show the conductors 
inez endeavoured to keep out observation and
to traverse a gloomy part the square but they
were detained at one place by the pressure a
crowd surrounding a party wandering musicians
singing one those ballads which the
spanish populace are so passionately fond the
torches which were held by some the crowd
threw a strong mass light upon inez and the
sight so beautiful a being without mantilla
or veil looking so bewildered and conducted
by men who seemed to take no gratification in
the surrounding gayety occasioned expressions
 the student salamanca
 curiosity one the ballad singers approached
and striking her guitar with peculiar
earnestness began to sing a doleful air full 
sinister forebodings inez started with surprise
it was the same ballad singer that had addressed
her in the gardens generalise she was
young and beautiful with an air wildness and
melancholy
it was the same air that she had then sung
it spoke impending dangers they seemed
indeed to be thickening around her she was
anxious to speak with this girl and to ascertain
whether indeed she had a knowledge any definite
evil that was threatening her but as she
attempted to address her the mule on which she
rode was suddenly seized and led forcibly through
the throng by one her conductors while she
saw another addressing menacing words to the
ballad singer the latter raised her hand with
a warning gesture as inez lost sight her
while inez was yet lost in perplexity caused
by this singular occurrence they stopped at the
gate a large mansion one her attendants
the student salamanca 
knocked the door was opened and they entered
a paved court where are we demanded
inez with anxiety at the house a friend
senora replied the man ascend this staircase
with me and in a moment you will meet
your father they ascended the staircase that
led to a suite splendid apartments they
passed through several until they came to an
inner chamber the door opened some one
approached but what was her terror at perceiving
not her father but don ambrosio the
men who had seized upon the alchymist had at
least been more honest in their professions they
were indeed familiars the inquisition he
was conducted in silence to the gloomy prison 
that terrible tribunal it was a mansion whose
every aspect withered joy and almost shut out
hope it was one those hideous abodes which
the bad passions men conjure up in this fair
world to rival the fancied dens demons and
the accursed
day after day went heavily by without anything
to mark the lapse time but the decline
 the student salamanca
and reappearance the light that feebly glimmered
through the narrow window the dungeon
in which the unfortunate alchymist was
buried rather than confined his mind was harassed
with uncertainties and fears about his
daughter so helpless and inexperienced he
endeavoured to gather tidings her from the
man who brought his daily portion food the
fellow stared as if astonished at being asked a
question in that mansion silence arid mystery 
but departed without saying a word every
succeeding attempt was equally fruitless
the poor alchymist was oppressed by many
griefs and it was not the least that he had been
again interrupted in his labours on the very point
 success never was alchymist so near attaining
the golden secret a little longer and all his
hopes would have been realized the thoughts
 these disappointments afflicted him more even
than the fear all that he might suffer from the
merciless inquisition his waking thoughts
would follow him into his dreams he would be
transported in fancy to his laboratory busied
the student salamanca 
again among retorts and alembics and surrounded
by lully by d'abano by olibius and the other
masters the sublime art the moment 
projection would arrive a seraphic form would
arise out the furnace holding forth a vessel
containing the precious elixir but before he
could grasp the prize he would awake and find
himself in a dungeon
all the devices inquisitorial ingenuity were
employed to ensnare the old man and to draw
from him evidence that might be brought against
himself and might corroborate certain secret information
that had been given against him he
had been accused practising necromancy and
judicial astrology and a cloud evidence had
been secretly brought forward to substantiate
the charge it would be tedious to enumerate
all the circumstances apparently corroborative
which had been industriously cited by the secret
accuser the silence which prevailed about the
tower its desolateness the very quiet its inhabitants
had been adduced as proofs that something
sinister was perpetrated within
 the student salamanca
the alchymist's conversations and soliloquies
in the garden had been overheard and misrepresented
the lights and strange appearances at
night in the tower were given with violent exaggerations
shrieks and yells were said to have
been heard from thence at midnight when it
was confidently asserted the old man raised
familiar spirits by his incantations and even
compelled the dead to rise from their graves and
answer to his questionings
the alchymist according to the custom the
inquisition was kept in complete ignorance 
his accuser the witnesses produced against
him even the crimes which he was accused
he was examined generally whether he knew
why he was arrested and was conscious any
guilt that might deserve the notice the holy
office he was examined as to his country 
his life his habits his pursuits his actions and
opinions
the old man was frank and simple in his replies
 he was conscious no guilt capable no
art practised in no dissimulation after receiving
the student salamanca 
a general admonition to bethink himself whether
he had not committed any act deserving punishment
and to prepare by confession to secure the
wellknown mercy the tribunal he was remanded
to his cell
he was now visited in his dungeon by crafty
familiars the inquisition who under pretence
 sympathy and kindness came to beguile the
tediousness his imprisonment with friendly
conversation they casually introduced the
subject alchymy on which they touched with
great caution and pretended indifference there
was no need such craftiness the honest enthusiast
had no suspicion in his nature the moment
they touched upon his favourite theme he
forgot his misfortunes and imprisonment and
broke forth into rhapsodies about the divine
science
the conversation was artfully turned to the
discussion elementary beings the alchymist
readily avowed his belief in them and
that there had been instances their attending
upon philosophers and administering to their
vol i 
 the student salamanca
wishes he related many miracles said to
have been performed by apologies thanes
through the aid spirits or demons insomuch
that he was set up by the heathens in opposition
to the messiah and was even regarded with
reverence by many christians the familiars
eagerly demanded whether he believed apollo
ninus to be a true and worthy philosopher the
unaffected piety the alchymist protected him
even in the midst his simplicity for he condemned
apologies as a sorcerer and an impostor
no art could ever draw from him an admission
that he had ever employed or invoked
spiritual agencies in the prosecution his pursuits
though he believed himself to have been
frequently impeded by them
the inquisitors were baffled and disappointed
in not being able to inveigle him into a confession
 a criminal nature they attributed it to
craft to obstinacy to every cause but the right
one namely that the harmless visionary had
nothing guilty to confess
they had abundant proof a secret nature
the student salamanca 
against him but it was the practice the inquisition
to endeavour to procure confession
from the prisoners
an autodafe was at hand the worthy fathers
were eager for his conviction for they were always
anxious to have a good number culprits
condemned to the stake to grace their
solemn triumphs he was at length brought
to a final examination
the chamber trial was spacious and
gloomy at one was a huge crucifix the
standard the inquisition a long table extended
through the centre the room at which
sat the inquisitors and their secretary at the
other a stool was placed for the prisoner
he was brought in according to custom bareheaded
and bare legged he was enfeebled by
confinement and affliction by constantly brooding
over the unknown fate his child and the
disastrous interruption his experiments he
sat bowed down and listless his head sunk
upon his breast his whole appearance that 
one past hope abandoned and by himself
given over
 the student salamanca
the accusation alleged again him was now
brought forward in a specific form he was
called upon by name felix de vasquez formerly
 castile to answer to the charges 
necromancy and demonology he was told that
the charges were amply substantiated and
was asked whether he was ready by ample confession
to throw himself upon the wellknown
mercy the holy inquisition
the philosopher testified some slight surprise
at the accusation but simply replied am
innocent
what proof have you to give your innocence
 it rather remains for you to prove
your charges cried the old man i am a
stranger and a sojourner in the land and know
no one out the doors my dwelling i can
give nothing in my vindication but the word 
a nobleman and a castilian
the inquisitor shook his head and went onto
repeat the various inquiries that had before
been made as to his mode life and pursuit
the poor alchymist was too feeble and weary
at heart to make any but brief replies he re
the student salamanca 
quested that some man science might examine
his laboratory and all his books and papers 
by which it would be made abundantly evident
that he w r as merely engaged in the study alchymy

to this the inquisitor observed that alchymy
had become a mere covert for secret and deadly
sins that the practises it were known to
scruple at no means to satisfy their inordinate
greediness gold some had been known to
use spells and impious ceremonies to conjure
the aid evil spirits nay even to sell their souls
to the enemy mankind so that they might
riot in boundless wealth while living
o
the poor alchymist had heard all patiently or
at least passively he had disdained to vindicate
his name otherwise than by his word he
had smiled at the accusations sorcery when
applied merely to himself but when the sublime
art which had been the study and passion his
life was assailed he could no longer listen in
silence his head gradually rose from his bosom
a hectic colour came in faint streaks to his
 the student salamanca
cheeks played about there disappeared returned
 and at length kindled into a burning glow
the clammy dampness dried from his forehead 
his eyes which had been nearly extinguished
lightedup again and burned with their wonted
and visionary fires
he entered into a vindication his favourite
art his voice at first was feeble and broken
but it gathered strength as he proceeded until
it rolled in a deep and sonorous volume he
gradually rose from his seat as he rose with his
subject he threw back the scanty black mantle
which had hitherto wrapped his limbs the very
uncouthness his form and looks gave an impressive
effect to what he uttered it was as
though a corpse had become suddenly animated
he repelled with scorn the aspersions cast upon
alchymy by the ignorant and vulgar he assumed
it to be the mother all art and science citing
the opinions paracelsus sandivogius
raymond lully and others in support his
assertions he maintained that it was pure and
innocent and honourable both in its purposes
the student salamanca 
and means what were its objects the perpetuation
 life and youth and the production 
gold the elixir vitae said he is no
charmed potion but merely a concentration 
those elements vitality which nature has scattered
through her works the philosopher's
stone or tincture or powder as it is variously
called is no necromantic talisman but consists
simply those particles which gold contains
within itself for its reproduction for gold like
other things has its seed within itself though
bound up with inconceivable firmness from the
vigour innate fixed salts and sulphur
in seeking to discover the elixir life then
continued he we seek only to apply some 
nature's own specifics against the disease and
decay to which our bodies are subjected and
what else does the physician when he tasks his
art and uses subtle compounds and cunning distillations
to revive our languishing powers and
avert the stroke death for a season 
 in seeking to multiply the precious metals
also we seek but to germinate and multiply by

employed the latest hour their life

gaze what a glorious reverse will there be in
his condition how will he emerge from his
solitary retreat like the sun breaking forth from

here he was interrupted by the inquisitor
who had suffered him to go on thus far in hopes 
gathering something from his unguarded enthu
the student salamanca
siam senor said he this is all rambling
visionary talk you are charged with sorcery
and in defence you give us a rhapsody about alchymy
have you nothing better than this to
offer in your defence 
the old man slowly resumed his seat but did
not deign a reply the fire that had beamed
in his eye gradually expired his cheek resumed
its wonted paleness but he did not relapse
into inanity he sat with a serene steady patient
look like one prepared not to contend but
to suffer
his trial continued for a long time with cruel
mockery justice for no witnesses were ever in
this court confronted with the accused and the
latter had continually to defend himself in the
dark some unknown and powerful enemy
had alleged charges against the unfortunate alchymist
but who he could not imagine stranger
and sojourner as he was in the land solitary
and harmless in his pursuits how could he have
provoked such hostility the tide secret testimony
however was too strong against him he
the student salamanca 
was convicted the crime magic and condemned
to expiate his sins at the stake at the
approaching autodafe
while the alchymist was undergoing his trial
at the inquisition his unhappy daughter was
exposed to trials no less severe don ambrosio
into whose hands she had fallen was as has
before been intimated one the most daring and
lawless profligates in all granada he was a
man hot blood and headlong passions that
stopped at nothing in pursuit his desires yet
with all these he possessed manners address and
accomplishments that had made him eminently
successful with the sex he was sated however
with easy conquests and wearied with a life 
continual and prompt gratification there had
been a degree difficulty and enterprize in the
pursuit inez that he had never before experienced
it had aroused him from the monotony
 mere sensual life and stimulated him
with all the charm adventure now that he
had her in his power he was determined to protract
the pleasure pursuit he was vain 
 the student salamanca
his person and address and it was a kind trial
 skill to endeavour to gain by art and ingenuity
what he could at any time obtain by violence
he affected to treat her with respect and
kindness he endeavoured to soothe her alarms
concerning her father by assurances his safety
and that she should soon be restored to him
every means was lavished to calm and soften
her and if possible to dispose her mind to favourable
impressions the house resounded
with soft music the apartments breathed perfumes
 all about her enticed to pleasure and voluptuousness
 but the heart inez turned with
distaste from the cruel mockery and if eves
don ambrosio deceived by the mute dejection
into which she would sometimes sink would attempt
to plead his passion she recoiled from
him with loathing and detestation
the vanity don ambrosio was at length
incensed at this inflexible scorn from one whom
he considered so far beneath him and who
ought to have felt honoured by his admiration
still he was determined that his triumph should
the student salamanca 
be by artifice and that she should be in a manner
accessary to her own dishonour since all
his arts seduction were no avail he endeavoured
to conquer her through her fears
he now informed her her father's confinement
in the prison the inquisition that his
case was desperate that it depended upon the
evidence don ambrosio and others who were
at his beck either to save or destroy him but
i am wrong added he it is with you beautiful
inez to say the word life or death
one kind word and you will behold me at your
feet your father at liberty and in affluence and
we shall all be happy
inez listened to him with scorn and disbelief
she looked upon it as another his deceptions
my father exclaimed she is too inoffensive
to attract persecution he is too innocent and
good to be suspected crime tis a base a
cruel artifice don ambrosio repeated what he
had said with solemn protestations its truth
but she turned from him with indignation and
he felt awed and surprised at the pride and
 the student salamanca
loftiness her demeanour he had now gone
too far to retrace his steps and resume the affectation
 kindness a few days after he brought
her the proclamation the approaching 
in which the prisoners were enumerated
she glanced her eye over it and saw her father's
name condemned to the stake for sorcery
for a moment her brain reeled she stood transfixed
with horror the artful ambrosio seized
upon the transient calm think now beautiful
inez said he with a tone affected tenderness
 his life is yet in your hands one word
from you and i can save him
monster wretch murderer exclaimed
she recoiling with shuddering abhorrence
then clasping her hands with frantic violence
oh my father my father cried she in a
tone frantic agony
the perfidious ambrosio saw the torture 
her soul and anticipated from it a triumph he
saw she was in no mood during her present paroxysm
to listen to his words but he trusted
that a night agony would subdue her stubborn
resolution
the student salamanca 
tomorrow said he as he left the room
is to be the autodafe one night more have
you to reflect tomorrow you will hear the
very tumult the procession that carries your
father to his death you will almost hear the
groans from his funeral pile i leave you to
yourself think whether you can stand all this
without shrinking think whether you can
endure the reflection that you were the cause 
his death and that merely from a perversity in
refusing proffered happiness
what a night was it to inez her heart
already harassed and almost broken by repeated
and protracted anxieties and terrors her form
wasted and nearly exhausted on every side
horrors surrounded her there seemed to be no
escape from misery and perdition is there no
relief from man no pity in heaven exclaimed
she what what have we done that we should
be thus wretched all night long she paced
her chamber her mind in a whirl anguish and
dismay as the dawn approached she heard
the distant tread footsteps in the street and the
vol i 
 the student salamanca
confused murmur voices she fancied it the
early stir the populace always eager in spain
for this horrid ceremony at sunrise the great
bell the cathedral began to toll its awful notes
 funeral preparation every stroke seemed to
beat upon her heart and inflict an absolute corporeal
pang her blood grew hot in her veins 
her tongue was parched she panted and gasped
rather than breathed blessed virgin exclaimed
she clasping her hands and turning up

her strained eyes look down with pity and
support me in this hour agony 
all granada was in agitation on the morning
 this dismal day the heavy bell the cathedral
continued to utter its clanging tones that
pervaded every part the city summoning all
persons to the tremendous spectacle that was
about to be exhibited the streets through
which the procession was to pass were crowded
with the populace the windows the roofs
every place that would admit a face or a foothold
was alive with spectators in the great
square a spacious scaffolding like an amphitheatre
student salamanca 
tre was erected where the sentences the prisoners
were to be read and the sermon faith
to be preached and close by were the stakes
prepared where the condemned were to be
burnt to death seats were arranged for the
great the gay the beautiful for such is the
horrible curiosity human nature that this
cruel sacrifice was attended with more eagerness
than a theatre or even a ball feast
as the day advanced the scaffolds and balconies
were filled with expecting multitudes the
sun shone brightly upon fair faces and gallant
dresses one would have thought it some scene
 elegant festivity instead an exhibition 
human agony and death but what a different
spectacle and ceremony was this from those
which granada exhibited in the days her
moorish splendour her galas her tournaments
her sports the ring her fetes st
john her music her umbras and admirable
tilts with canes her serenades her concerts
her songs in generalise the costly liveries
 the abencerrages their exquisite inventions 
 the student salamanca
the skill and valour the alabeces the superb
dresses the series mazas and gomez 
all these were at an the days chivalry
were over instead the prancing cavalcade
with neighing steed and lively trumpet with
burnished lance and helm and buckler with
rich confusion plume and scarf and banner
where purple and scarlet and green and orange
and every gay colour were mingled with cloth
 gold and fair embroidery instead this
crept on the gloomy pageant superstition in
cowl and sackcloth with cross and coffin and
frightful symbols human suffering in place
 the frank hardy knight open and brave with
his lady s favour in his casque and amorous
motto on his shield looking by gallant deeds to
the smile beauty came the shaven unmanly
monk with downcast eyes and head and heart
bleached in the cold cloister secretly exulting
in this bigot triumph
the sound the bells gave notice that the
road's civil wars granada
the student salamanca 
dismal procession was advancing it passed
slowly through the principal streets the city
bearing in advance the awful banner the holy
office the prisoners walked singly attended
by confessors and guarded by familiars the
inquisition they were clad in different garments
according to the nature their punishments
 those who were to suffer death wore
the hideous samaria painted with flames and
demons the procession was swelled by choirs
 boys by different religious orders and public
dignitaries and above all by the fathers 
the faith moving with slow pace and profound
gravity truly triumphing as becomes the
principal generals that great victory
as the much dreaded banner the inquisition
advanced the countless throng sunk on
their knees before it they bowed their faces to
the very earth as it passed and then slowly rose
again like a great undulating billow a murmur
 tongues prevailed as the prisoners approached
 and eager eyes we're strained and
gonsalvius p 
 the student salamanca
fingers pointed to distinguish the different orders
 penitents whose habits denoted the degree
 punishment they were to undergo but
as those drew near whose frightful garb marked
them as destined to the flames the noise the
rabble subsided they seemed almost to hold in
their breaths filled with that strange and dismal
interest with which we contemplate a human
being on the verge suffering and death
it is an awful thing a voiceless noiseless
multitude the hushed and gazing stillness 
the surrounding thousands heaped on walls
and gates and roofs and hanging as it were in
clusters heightened the effect the pageant that
moved drearily on the low murmuring the
priests could now be heard in prayer and exhortation
with the faint responses the prisoners
and now and then the voices the choir at a
distance chanting the litanies the saints
the faces the prisoners were ghastly and
disconsolate even those who had been pardoned
and wore the sanbenito or penitential garment
bare traces the horrors they had underthe
student salamanca 
gone some were feeble and tottering from long
confinement some crippled and distorted by various
tortures every countenance was a dismal
page on which might be read the secrets their
prison house but in the looks those condemned
to death there was something fierce and
eager they seemed men harrowed up by
the past and desperate as to the future they
were anticipating with spirits fevered by despair
and fixed and clenched determination the
vehement struggle with agony and death which
they were shortly to undergo some cast now
and then a wild and anguished look about them
upon the shining day the sunlight palaces 
the gay the beautiful world which they w r ere
soon to quit for ever or a glance sudden indignation
at the thronging thousands happy in
liberty and life who seemed in contemplating
their frightful situation to exult in their own
comparative security
one among the condemned however was
an exception to these remarks he was an
aged man somewhat bowed down with a serene
 the student salamanca
though dejected countenance and a beaming
melancholy eye it was the alchymist the
populace looked upon him with a degree compassion
which they were not prone to feel towards
criminals condemned by the inquisition 
but when they were told he was convicted the
crime magic they drew back with awe and
abhorrence
the procession had reached the grand square
the first part had already mounted the scaffold
and the condemned were approaching the
press the populace became excessive and was
repelled as it were in billows by the guards
just as the condemned were entering the square
a shrieking was heard among the crowd a
female pale frantic dishevelled was seen struggling
through the multitude my father my
father was all the cry she uttered but it
thrilled through every heart the crowd instinctively
drew back and made way for her as she
advanced
the poor alchymist had made his peace with
heaven and by hard struggle had closed his
the student salamanca 
heart upon the world when the voice his
child called him once more back to worldly
thought and agony he turned towards the
wellknown voice his knees smote together he
endeavoured to stretch forth his pinioned arms
and felt himself clasped in the embraces his
child the emotions both were too agonizing
for utterance convulsive sobs and broken exclamations
and embraces more anguish than
tenderness were all that passed between them
the procession was interrupted for a moment
the astonished monks and familiars were filled
with involuntary respect at this agony natural
affection ejaculations pity broke from the
crowd touched by the filial piety the extraordinary
and hopeless anguish so young and
beautiful a being
every attempt to soothe her and prevail on
her to retire was unheeded at length they endeavoured
to separate her from her father by
force the movement roused her from her temporary
abandonment
with a sudden paroxysm fury she snatched
vol i 
 the student salamanca
a sword from one the familiars her late
pale countenance was flushed with rage and fire
flashed from her once soft and languishing eyes
the guards shrunk back with awe there
was something in this filial frenzy this feminine
tenderness wrought up to desperation that
touched even their hardened hearts they endeavoured
to pacify her but in vain her eye
was eager and quick as the she wolf's guarding
her young with one arm she pressed her father
to her bosom with the other she menaced everyone
that approached
the patience the guards was very soon exhausted
they had held back in awe but not
in fear with all her desperation the weapon
was soon wrested from her feeble hand and she
was borne shrieking and struggling among the
crowd the rabble murmured compassion but
such was the dread inspired by the inquisition
that no one attempted to interfere
the procession again resumed its march inez
was ineffectually struggling to release herself
from the hands the familiars that detained
the student salamanca 
her when suddenly she saw don ambrosio before
her wretched girl exclaimed he with
fury why have you fled from your friends 
deliver her said he to the familiars to my
domestics she is under my protection
his creatures advanced to seize her oh
no oh no cried she with new terrors and
clinging to the familiars i have fled from no
friends he is not my protector he is the
murderer my father 
the familiars were perplexed the crowd
pressed on with eager curiosity stand off
cried the fiery ambrosio dashing the throng
from around him then turning to the familiars
with sudden moderation my friends
said he deliver this poor girl to me her distress
has turned her brain she has escaped from
her friends and protectors this morning during
the confusion the house as the procession
went by a little quiet and kind treatment
will restore her to tranquillity
i am not mad i am not mad cried she
vehemently oh save me save me from
 the student salamanca
these men i have no protector on earth but my
father and him they are murdering 
the familiars shook their heads her wildness
corroborated the assertions don ambrosio
and his apparent rank commanded respect and
belief they relinquished their charge to him
and he was consigning the struggling inez to
his creatures let go your hold villain
cried a voice from among the crowd and antonio
was seen eagerly tearing his way through
the press people
seize him seize him cried don am
brosio to the familiars tis an accomplice 
the sorcerer
liar retorted antonio as he thrust the
mob to the right and left and forced himself to
the spot
the sword don ambrosio flashed in an
instant from the scabbard the student was
armed and equally alert there was a fierce
clash weapons the crowd made way for
them as they fought and closed again so as
to hide them from the view inez all was
the student salamanca 
tumult and confusion for a moment when there
was a kind shout from the spectators and
the mob again opening she beheld as she
thought antonio weltering in his blood
this new shock was too great for her already
overstrained intellects a giddiness seized
upon her every thing seemed to whirl before
her eyes she gasped some incoherent words
and sunk senseless upon the ground
days weeks elapsed before inez returned to
consciousness at length she opened her eyes
as if out a troubled sleep she was lying
upon a magnificent bed in a chamber richly
furnished with pier glasses and massive tables
inlaid with silver exquisite workmanship
the walls were covered with tapestry the cornices
richly gilded through the door which
stood open she perceived a superb saloon with
statues and chrystal lustres and a magnificent
suite apartments beyond the casements 
the room were open to admit the soft breath 
summer which stole in laden with perfumes
from a neighbouring garden from whence
the student salamanca
also the refreshing sounds fountains and the
sweet notes birds came in mingled music to
her ears female attendants were moving with
noiseless step about the apartment but as she
gazed around in silent wonder her eye rested
upon a new object interest in a chair at
the head her bed sat a venerable form
watching over her with a look fond anxiety
it was her father i will not attempt to describe
the scene that ensued nor the moments
 rapture which more than repaid all the sufferings
her affectionate heart had undergone as
soon as their feelings had become more calm
the alchymist stepped out the room to introduce
a stranger to whom they were indebted
for their lives and liberties he returned leading
in antonio no longer in his poor scholar's
garb but in the rich dress a nobleman
the feelings inez were nearly overpowered
by the sudden reverses and it was some time
before she was sufficiently calm to comprehend
the explanation this seeming romance
it appeared that the lover who had sought her
the student salamanca 
affections in the lowly guise a student was
only son and heir a powerful grandee valentia
some youthful irregularities had drawn
on him the displeasure his father he had
absented himself from home and remained incognito
at granada with a full resolve by study
and self regulation to reinstate himself in his
father's favour how hard he had studied
does not remain on record all that we know
is his romantic adventure the tower
it was at first a mere youthful caprice excited
by a glimpse a beautiful face in becoming a
disciple the achy mist he probably thought 
nothing more than pursuing a light love adventure
farther acquaintance however completely
fixed his affections in the mean time
he had been traced to his concealment his
father had relieved intelligence doubtless from
don ambrosio his being entangled in the
snares a mysterious adventurer and his daughter
trusty emissaries had been sent to seize
upon him and convey him by force to the paternal
home
 the student salamanca
what eloquence he used with his father to
convince him the perfect innocence and noble
descent the alchemist and the exalted worth
 his daughter does not appear all that we
know is that the father though a very passionate
was a very reasonable man as appears by
his consenting that his son should return to granada
and conduct inez as his affianced bride to
valentia on his arrival he had been shocked
at finding the tower deserted and reading the
alchymist's name on the list the condemned
at the autodafe he arrived just in time to
save him from the flames it was don ambrosia
that had fallen in their contest being
o
severely wounded and thinking his approaching
he had confessed to one the fathers
 the inquisition that he was the sole cause 
the alchymist's condemnation and that the evidence
on which it was founded was altogether
false the testimony don antonio came
in corroboration his innocence and as he was
a relation the grand inquisitor's it perhaps had
more than usual weight thus the poor alchy
the student salamanca 
mist was in a manner snatched from the very
flames and so great had been the sympathy excited
in his case that for once the populace
rejoiced in being disappointed an execution
the residue this story may readily be imagined
by any one versed in this valuable kind 
history don antonio married the lovely inez
and took her and her father with him to valencia
as she had been a loving and dutiful daughter
so she proved a true and tender wife it was
not long before he succeeded to his father's titles
and estates and he and his fair spouse were renowned
for being the handsomest and happiest
couple in all valentia
as to don ambrosio he partially recovered
to the enjoyment a broken constitution and a
blasted name and hid his remorse and disgraces
in a convent
the worthy alchymist took up his abode with
his children a pavilion in their garden was
assigned to him as a laboratory where he resumed
his researches after the grand secret he
was now and then assisted by his soninlaw
vol i 
 the student salamanca
but the latter slackened grievously in his zeal and
diligence after marriage still he would listen
with profound gravity and attention to the old
man's quotations from paracelsus sandivogius
and peter d'abano which daily grew longer
and longer in this way the good alchymist
lived on quietly and comfortably to what is called
a good old age that is to say an age that is
good for nothing and unfortunately for mankind
was hurried out life in his ninetieth
year just as he was on the point discovering
the philosopher's stone
such was the story the captain's friend 
which whiled away the whole morning very
tolerably the captain was every now and then
interrupted by questions and remarks which i
have not mentioned lest i should break the continuity
 the tale
he was also a little disturbed once or twice
by the general who fell asleep and breathed

the student salamanca 
rather hard to the great horror and annoyance
 lady lillycraft in a long and tender love
passage also which was particularly to her
ladyship's taste the unlucky general having his
head a little sunk upon his breast kept making
a sound at regular intervals very much like the
word pish long drawn out at length he made
an odd guttural sound that suddenly woke him 
he hemmed looked about with a slight degree
 consternation and then began to play with
her ladyship's work bag which however she
rather pettishly withdrew the steady sound
 the captain's voice however was too potent
a soporific for the poor general he kept gleaming
up and sinking in the socket until the cessation
 the tale again roused him when he
started awake put his foot down upon lady
lilly craft's cur the sleeping beauty which yelled
and seized him by the leg and in a moment
the whole library resounded with yelping and
exclamations never did a man more completely
mar his fortunes while he was asleep
silence was at length restored all the company
 the student op salamanca
expressed their thanks to the captain and gave
various opinions the story the parson said
he should have liked to have heard more the
leaden manuscript dug up at granada the general
said he could not well make out the drift
 the story he thought it a little confused i
am glad however said he that they burnt the
old chap the tower for i have no doubt he
was a notorious impostor

his certain life that never can deceive him
is full thousand sweets and rich content 
the smoothleav'd beeches in the field receive him
with coolest shade till noontide's heat be spent
his life is neither tost in boist'rous seas
or the vexatious world or lost in slothful ease
pleas'd and full blest he lives when he his god can please
phineas fletcher
i take great pleasure in accompanying the
squire in his perambulations about his estate
in which he is often attended by a kind cabinet
council his prime minister the steward is a
very worthy and honest old man and one those
veteran retainers that assume a right way 
that is to say a right to have his own way from
having lived time out mind on the place he
loves the estate even better than he does the 
 english country gentlemen
squire and thwarts the latter sadly in many 
his projects improvement and alteration indeed
the old man is a little apt to oppose every
plan that does not originate with himself and
will hold long arguments about it over a stile
or on a rise ground until the squire who hasa
high opinion his ability and integrity is fain
to give up the point such concession immediately
mollifies the old steward and it often happens
that after walking a field or two in silence
with his hands behind his back chewing the cud
 reflection he will suddenly observe that he
has been turning the matter over in his mind
and upon the whole he thinks he will take his
honour's advice
christy the huntsman is another the squire's
frequent attendants to whom he continually refers
in matters local history as to a chronicle
 the estate having been in a manner acquainted
with many the trees from the very
time that they were acorns old nimrod as i
have already shown is rather pragmatical on all
these points knowledge upon which he values
english country gentlemen 
himself but the squire never contradicts him 
and is certainly one the most indulgent potentates
that was ever henpecked by his ministers
he often laughs about it himself and evidently
yields to these old men in compliance
with the bent his own humour he likes this
honest independence old age for with all his
aristocratical feelings there is nothing that disgusts
him sooner than any appearance fawning
or servility
i really have seen no display royal state
that could compare with one the squire's
progresses about his paternal fields and through
his hereditary woodlands with several these
faithful adherents about him and followed by a
body guard dogs he encourages a frankness
and manliness deportment among his
dependants and is the personal friend his
tenants inquiring into their concerns and assisting
them in times difficulty and hardship
this has rendered him one the most popular
and course one the happiest landlords

 english country gentlemen
indeed i do not know a more enviable condition
 life than that an english gentleman
 sound judgment and good feelings who passes
the greater part his time on an hereditary estate
in the country from the excellence the
roads and the rapidity and exactness the public
conveyances he is enabled to command all
the comforts and conveniences all the intelligence
and novelties the capital while he is
removed from its hurry and distractions he
has ample means occupation and amusement
within his own domains he may diversify his
time by rural occupations by rural sports by
study and by the delights friendly society
collected within his own hospitable halls
or if his views and feelings are a more extensive
and liberal nature he has it greatly in his
power to do good and to have that good immediately
reflected back upon himself he can
render essential service to his country by assisting
in the disinterested administration the
laws by watching over the opinions and principles
 the lower orders around him by diff
country gentlemen 
fusing among them those lights which may be
important to their welfare by mingling frankly
among them gaining their confidence becoming
the immediate auditor their complaints
 informing himself their wants making
himself a channel through which their grievances
may be quietly communicated to the proper
sources mitigation and relief or by
becoming if need be the intrepid and incorruptible
guardian their liberties the enlightened
champion their rights
all this it appears to me can be done without
any sacrifice personal dignity without any
degrading arts popularity without any truckling
to vulgar prejudices or concurrence in vulgar
clamour but by the steady influence sincere
and friendly council fair upright and
generous deportment whatever may be said 
english mobs and english demagogues i have
never met with a people more open to reason 
more considerate in their tempers more tractable
by argument in the roughest times than the
english they are remarkably quick at dist
english country gentlemen
morning and appreciating whatever is manly and
honourable they are by nature and habit methodical
and orderly and feel the value all
that is regular and respectable they may occasionally
be deceived by sophistry and excited
into turbulence by public distresses and the misrepresentations
 designing men but open their
eyes and they will eventually rally round the
landmarks steady truth and deliberate good
sense they are fond established customs 
they are fond long established names and
that love order and quiet which characterizes
the nation gives a vast influence to the descendants
 the old families whose forefathers have
been lords the soil from time immemorial
it is when the rich and well educated and
highly privileged classes neglect their duties 
when they neglect to study the interests and
conciliate the affections and instruct the opinions
and champion the rights the people
that the latter become discontented and turbulent
and fall into the hands demagogues
the demagogue always steps in where the paenglish
country gentlemen 
trot is wanting there is a common high
handed cant among high feeding and as they
fancy themselves high minded men about putting
down the mob but all true physicians
know that it is better to sweeten the blood than
to attack the tumour to apply the emollient
rather than the cautery
it is absurd in a country like england where
there is so much freedom and such a jealousy
 right for any man to assume an aristocratical
tone and to talk superciliously the common
people there is no rank that makes him
independent the opinion and affections his
fellow men there is no rank nor distinction
that severs him from his fellow subject and if
by any gradual neglect or assumption on the
one side and discontent and jealousy on the
other the orders society should really separate
let those that stand on the eminence beware
that the chasm is not mining at their feet
the orders society in all well constituted
governments are mutually bound together and
important to each other there can be no such
 english country gentlemen
thing in a free government as a vacuum and
wherever one is likely to take place by the
drawing off the rich and intelligent from the
poor the bad passions society will rush in r
to fill up the space and rend the whole asunder
though born and brought up in a republic
and more and more confirmed in republican
principles by every year's observation and experience
yet i am not insensible to the excellence
that may exist in other forms government
 nor to the fact that they may be more
suitable to the situation and circumstances 
the countries in which they exist i have endeavoured
rather to look at them as they are
and to observe how they are calculated to effect
the which they propose considering
therefore the mixed nature the government
 this country and its representative form i
have looked with admiration at the manner in
which the wealth and influence and intelligence
were spread over its whole surface not
as in some monarchies drained from the country
and collected in towns and cities i have
english country gentlemen 
considered the great rural establishments the
nobility and the lesser establishments the
gentry as so many reservoirs wealth and intelligence
distributed about the kingdom apart
from the towns to irrigate freshen and fertilize
the surrounding country have looked
upon them too as the august retreats patriots
and statesmen where in the enjoyment 
honourable independence and elegant leisure
they might train up their minds to appear in
those legislative assemblies whose debates and
decisions form the study and precedents 
other nations and involve the interests the
world
i have been both surprised and disappointed
therefore at finding that on this subject i was
often indulging in a utopian dream rather thana
well grounded opinion i have been concerned
at finding that these fine estates were too
often involved and mortgaged or placed in the
hands creditors and the owners exiled from
their paternal lands there is an extravagance
i am told that runs parallel with wealth a lavish
vol 
ib english country gentlemen
expenditure among the great a senseless competition
among the aspiring a heedless joyless
dissipation among all the upper ranks that often
beggars even these splendid establishments
breaks down the pride and principles their
possessors and makes too many them mere
place hunters or shifting absentees it is thus
that so many are thrown into the hands government
 and a court which ought to be the
most pure and honourable in europe is so often
degraded by noble but importunate timeservers
it is thus too that so many become exiles from
their native land crowding the hotels foreign
nations and expending upon thankless strangers
the wealth so hardly drained from their laborious
peasantry having as it were their roots in their
own country but spreading forth their branches
and bearing their fruits in another i have looked
upon these latter with a mixture censure
and concern knowing the almost bigotted
fondness an englishman for his native home
i can conceive what must be their compunction
and regret when they call to mind amidst the
english country gentlemen 
sunburnt plains france the green fields 
england the hereditary groves which they have
abandoned the hospitable roof their fathers
which they have left desolate or to be inhabited
by strangers but retrenchment is no plea for
an abandonment country they have risen
with the prosperity the land let them abide its
fluctuations and conform to its fortunes it is
not for the rich to draw off from the country because
it is suffering let them share in their
relative proportion the common lot they owe
it to the land that has elevated them to honour
and affluence when the poor have to diminish
their scanty morsel bread when they have
to compound with the cravings nature and
study with how little they can do and not be
starved it is not then for the rich to fly and
diminish still farther the resources the poor
that they themselves may live in splendour in a
cheaper country let them rather retire to their
estates and there practise retrenchment let
them return to that noble simplicity that practical
good sense that honest pride which form the
 english country gentlemen
foundation true english character and from
them they may again rear the edifice fair and
honourable prosperity
on the rural habits the english nobility
and gentry on the manner in which they discharge
their duties on their patrimonial possessions
depend greatly the virtue and welfare 
the nation so long as they pass the greater
part their time in the quiet and purity the
country surrounded by the monuments their
illustrious ancestors surrounded by every thing
that can inspire generous pride noble emulation
and amiable and magnanimous sentiment
so long they are safe and in them the nation
may repose its interests and its honour but
the moment that they become the servile thronged
 court avenues and give themselves up to
the political intrigues and heartless dissipations
 the metropolis that moment they lose the
real nobility their natures and become the
mere leeches the country
that the great majority nobility and gentry
in england are endowed with high notions
english country gentlemen 
 honour and independence i thoroughly believe
they have evidenced it lately on very
important questions and have given an example
 adherence to principle in preference to
party and power that must have astonished
many the venal and obsequious courts 
europe such are the glorious effects freedom
even when infused into a constitution but
it seems to me that they are apt to forget the positive
nature their duties and to fancy that
their eminent privileges are only so many means
 self indulgence they should recollect that
in a constitution like that england the titled
orders are intended to be as useful as they are
ornamental and it is their virtues alone that
can render them both their duties are divided
between the sovereign and the subject surrounding
and giving lustre and dignity to the throne
and at the same time tempering and mitigating
its rays until they are transmitted in mild and
genial radiance to the people born to leisure
and opulence they owe the exercise their
talents and the expenditure their wealth to
 english country gentlemen
their native country they may be compared
to the clouds which being drawn up by the
sun and elevated in the heavens reflect and
magnify his splendour while they repay the
earth from which they derive their sustenance
by returning their treasures to its bosom in fertilizing
showers
a bachelor's confessions
i'll live a private pensive single life
the collier croydon
i was sitting in my room a morning or two
since reading when some one tapped at the
door and master simon entered he had an
unusually fresh appearance he had put on a
bright green riding coat with a bunch violets
in the button hole and had the air an old
bachelor trying to remunerate himself he had
not however his usual briskness and vivacity
but loitered about the room with somewhat 
absence manner humming the old song go
lovely rose tell her that wastes her time and
me and then leaning against the window and
looking upon the landscape he uttered a very 
a bachelor's confessions
bible sigh as i had not been accustomed to
see master simon in a pensive mood i thought
there might be some vexation preying on his
mind and i endeavoured to introduce a cheerful
strain conversation but he was not in the
vein to follow it up and proposed that we should
take a walk it w r as a beautiful morning 
that soft vernal temperature that seems to thaw
all the frost out one's blood and to set all nature
in a ferment the very fishes felt its influence
 the cautious trout ventured out his dark
hole to seek his mate the roach and the dace
rose up to the surface the brook to bask in the
sunshine and the amorous frog piped from among
the rushes if ever an oyster can really fall in
love as has been said or sung it must be on such
a morning
the weather certainly had its effect even upon
master simon for he seemed obstinately bent
upon the pensive mood instead skipping
briskly along smacking his dog whip whistling
quaint ditties or telling sporting anecdotes he
leaned on my arm and talked about the 
bachelor's confessions 
preaching nuptials from whence he made several
digressions upon the character women 
touched a little upon the tender passion and
made sundry very excellent though rather trite
observations upon disappointments in love it
was evident that he had something on his mind
which he wished to impart but felt awkward in
approaching it i was curious to see to what
this strain would lead but i was determined not
to assist him indeed i mischievously pretended
to turn the conversation and talked his
usual topics dogs horses and hunting but he
w as very brief in his replies and invariably got
back by hook or by crook into the sentimental
vein at length we came to a clump trees
that overhung a whispering brook with a rustic
bench at their feet the trees were grievously
scored with letters and devices which had grown
out all shape and size by the growth the
bark and it appeared that this grove had served
as a kind register the family loves from
time immemorial here master simon made
a pause pulled up a tuft flowers threw
vol 
 a bachelor's confessions
them one by one into the water and at length
turning somewhat abruptly upon me asked me
if i had ever been in love i confess the question
startled me a little as i am not over fond 
making confessions my amorous follies and
above all should never dream choosing my
friend master simon for a confidant he did
not wait however for a reply the inquiry was
merely a prelude to a confession on his own
part and after several circumlocutions and whimsical
preambles he fairly disburdened himself
 a very tolerable story his having been crossed
in love
the reader will very probably suppose that it
related to the gay widow who jilted him not
long since at doncaster races no such thing
it was about a sentimental passion that he
once had for a most beautiful young lady who
wrote poetry and played on the harp he used
to serenade her and indeed he described several
tender and gallant scenes in which he evidently
was picturing himself in his mind's eye as some
elegant hero romance though unfortunately
a bachelor's confessions 
for the tale i only saw him as he stood before
me a dapper little old bachelor with a face like
an apple that has dried with the bloom on it
what were the particulars this tender tale
i have already forgotten indeed i listened to it
with a heart like a very pebble stone having
hard work to repress a smile while master simon
was putting on the amorous swain uttering
every now and then a sigh and endeavouring to
look sentimental and melancholy
all that i recollect is that the lady according
to his account was certainly a little touched
for she used to accept all the music that he
copied for her harp and the patterns that he
drew for her dresses and he began to flatter
himself after a long course delicate attentions
that he was gradually fanning a gentle flame in
her heart when she suddenly accepted the hand
 a rich boisterous foxhunting baronet without
either music or sentiment who carried herby
storm after a fortnight's courtship master
simon could not help concluding by some obser
a bachelor's confessions
nation about modest merit and the power
 gold over the sex as a remembrance 
his passion he pointed out a heart carved on
the bark one the trees but which in the
process time had grown out into a large
excrescence and he showed me a lock her
hair which he wore in a true lover's knot in a
large gold brooch
j have seldom met with an old bachelor that
had not some time or other his nonsensical moment
when he would become tender and sentimental
talk about the concerns the heart
and have some confession a delicate nature
to make almost every man has some little
tract romance in his life to which he looks
back with fondness and about which he is apt
to grow garrulous occasionally he recollects
himself as he was at the time young and gamesome
 and forgets that his hearers have no other
idea the hero the tale but such as he may
appear at the time telling it peradventure a
withered whimsical spindleshanked old gentle
bachelor's confessions 
men with married men it is true this is not
so frequently the case their amorous romance
is apt to decline after marriage why i cannot
for the life me imagine but with a bachelor
though it may slumber it never dies it is always
liable to break out again in transient flashes
and never so much as on a spring morning in the
country or on a winter evening when seated in
his solitary chamber stirring up the fire and
talking matrimony
the moment that master simon had gone
through his confession and to use the common
phrase had made a clean breast it he became
quite himself again he had settled the
point which had been worrying his mind and
doubtless considered himself established as a
man sentiment in my opinion before we
had finished our morning's stroll he was singing
as blythe as a grasshopper whistling to his
dogs and telling droll stories and i recollect
that he was particularly facetious that day at
dinner on the subject matrimony and uttered
 a bachelor's confessions
several excellent jokes not to be found in joe
miller that made the future bride blush and
look down but set all the old gentlemen at the
table in a roar and absolutely brought tears into
the general's eyes

merrier england 
ancient phrase
there is nothing so rare as for a man to
ride his hobby without molestation i find the
squire has been repeatedly thwarted in his humours
and has suffered a kind well meaning
persecution late by a mr faddy an old gentleman
 some weight at least purse who
has moved into the neighbourhood he is a
worthy manufacturer who having accumulated
a large fortune by steam and spinning jennies
has retired from business and buried himself in
the shades the country
he has taken an old country seat and refitted
it and painted it until it looks not unlike his
own manufactory he has been particularly
 english gravity
careful in mending the walls and hedges and
putting up notices spring guns and men traps
in every part his premises indeed he shows
great jealousy in asserting his territorial rights
having stopped up a foot path that led across
one his fields and given notice in staring
letters that whoever was found trespassing
on these grounds would be prosecuted with
the utmost rigour the law he has brought
into the country with him all his trite maxims
and practical habits business and is
one those intolerably prosing sensible useful
troublesome old gentlemen that go about
wearying and worrying society with plans 
public utility
he is very much disposed to be on good
terms with the squire and is every now and
then calling upon him with some excellent measure
for the good the neighbourhood which
happens to run diametrically opposite to someone
or other the squire's peculiar notions 
but which is too sensible a measure to be
openly opposed
english gravity 
thus he has annoyed him excessively by enforcing
the vagrant laws expelling the gypsies
punishing poachers and endeavouring to suppress
country wakes and rustic games which
he considers great nuisances and causes the
deadly sin idleness i have observed however
that the manufacturer is gradually swelling
into the aristocrat he is losing sight his
origin or fancying that others have lost sight 
it and is attempting in a casual way to shuffle
himself into the pack gentility he has a
great deal to say about the common people 
talks his park his gamekeeper and the necessity
 keeping up the game laws and
makes frequent use the phrase the gentry
 the neighbourhood
he came to the hall lately with a face full 
business to consult with the squire about some
mode putting a stop to the frolicking at the village
on the approaching mayday as it drew idle
people together from all parts the neighbourhood
who spent the day fiddling and drinking
vol 
 english gravity
and dancing instead staying at home to work
for their families as the squire is at the bottom
 these mayday revels it may be supposed
that the suggestions the matteroffact
mr faddy were not received with the best grace
in the world after he was gone the squire could
not contain his indignation at having his poetical
cobwebs invaded by this buzzing blue bottle
fly traffick
in the warmth his feelings he made a
whimsical tirade at the whole race manufacturers
whom he accused being the manners
 the face the country and the destroyers 
rural manners sir said he with emotion
it makes my heart bleed to see all our fine
streams dammed up and bestrode by cotton
mills our valleys smoking with steam engines 
to hear the din the hammer and the loom
scaring away all our rural delights to see our
sturdy peasantry metamorphosed into pin makers
and stocking weavers and merry sherwood
and all the green wood haunts robin
hood covered with manufacturing towns
english gravity 
sir t have stood on the tottering ruins 
dudley castle and looked round with an aching
heart on what were once beautiful vales and
fertile hills now turned into a mere campus
phlegrae the whole country reeking with
coal pits a region fire where furnaces and
smelting houses were vomiting forth flumes and
smoke the people pale and ghastly looked
more like demons than human beings as they
toiled among these noxious exhalations and the
clanking wheels and engines seen through the
murky atmosphere looked like instruments 
torture in this terrestrial pandemonium what
is to become the country with these evils rankling
in its very core sir these manufacturers
will be the ruin the national character they
will not leave materials for a line poetry 
there was something in this in mentation
over public improvements and national industry
that amused me exceedingly but i find that the
squire really grieves over the growing spirit 
trade as destroying the charm life he considers
every new shorthand mode doing things
 english gravity
as an inroad snug sordid method and thinks
that this will soon become a mere matteroffact
world where life will be reduced to a mathematical
calculation conveniences and everything
will be done by steam
he maintains also that the nation has declined
in its free and joyous spirit in proportion
as it has turned its attention to commerce and
manufactures and that in old times when england
was an idler it was also a merrier little
island
indeed the old gentleman adduces a number
 authorities that in some measure bear him
out in his notions if we may judge from the
frequency and extravagance ancient festivals
and merrymakings and the hearty spirit with
which they were kept up by all classes people
the english were a much gayer people than
at present
stow in his survey london gives us many
animating pictures the revels on holidays at
the inns court and the mummers reasonings
and bonfires about the streets london then
english gravity 
resembled the continental cities in its manners
and amusements
the court used to dance after dinner on public
occasions after the coronation dinner 
richard the king the prelates the nobles
the knights and the rest the company danced
in westminster hall to the music the minstrels

the example the court was followed by
the middling classes who spent much the
time in dancing
stow gives us a gay city picture that resembles
the lively groups one may often see in paris
 for he tells us that on holidays after
evening prayers the maidens used to assemble
before the door in sight their masters and
dames and while one played on a timbrel the
others would dance for garlands hanged athwart
the street
 the gayety that prevailed in dress throughout
all ranks society we have abundant testimony
in the rich and fanciful costumes preserved
in books and paintings i have myself says
 english gravity
germaine markham met an ordinary tapster
in his silk stockings garters deep fringed vvith
gold lace the rest his apparel suitable with
cloak lined with velvet nashe too who
wrote in exclaims at the folly and finery
 the nation england the players stage 
gorgeous attire the ape all nations superfluities
the continual masquer in outlandish habiliments

these and many such authorities are quoted
by the squire by way contrasting the former
spirit and vivacity the nation with its present
monotonous habits and appearance john
bull he will say was then a gay cavalier
with a feather in his cap and a sword by his side 
but he is now a plodding citizen in snuff coloured
coat and gaiters
but what in fact has caused such a decline
 gayety in the national character that the
country has almost lost all right to its favourite
old title merry england it may be attributed
in part to the growing hardships the
times and the necessity turning the whole atenglish
gravity 
mention to the means subsistence but england's
gayest customs prevailed at times when
her common people enjoyed comparatively few
 the comforts and conveniences that they doat
present it may be still more attributed to
the universal spirit gain and the calculating
habits business that commerce has introduced 
but i am inclined to attribute it chiefly to the
gradual increase the liberty the subject
arid the general freedom and activity opinion
a free people are apt to be grave and thoughtful
they have high and important matters to
occupy their thoughts they feel it is their
right their interest and their duty to mingle in
public concerns and to watch over the general
welfare
the continual exercise the mind on political
topics gives intense habits thinking and
a more serious and earnest demeanour a nation
becomes less gay but more intellectually
active and vigorous it evinces less play 
the fancy but more power the imagination 
less taste and elegance but more grandeur 
 english gravity
mind less animated vivacity but deeper enthusiasm

if is when men are shut out the regions 
manly thought by a despotic government when
every grave and lofty theme is rendered perilous to
discussion and almost to reflection it is then that
they turn to the safer occupations taste and
amusement trifles rise to importance and occupy
the craving activity intellect
no being is more void care and reflection
than the slave none dances more gayly in his
intervals labour but make him free give
him rights and interests to guard and he becomes
thoughtful and laborious
the french are a gayer people than the english
why partly from temperament perhaps 
but greatly because they have been accustomed
to governments which surrounded the free exercise
 thought with danger and where he only
was safe who shut his eyes and ears to public
events and enjoyed the passing pleasure tie
day within late years they have had more opportunities
 exercising their minds and within
english gravity 
late years the national character has essentially
changed never did the french enjoy such a
degree freedom as they do at this moment 
and at this moment the french are comparatively
a grave people

gipsies
what's that to absolute freedom such as the very beggars have 
to feast and revel here to day and yonder tomorrow next day
where they please and so on still the whole country or kingdom
over there's liberty the birds the air can take no more
jovial crew
since the rencontre with the gipsies which i
have related in a former paper i have observed
several them haunting the purlieus the
hall in spite a positive interdiction the
squire's they are part a gang that has
long kept about this neighbourhood to the great
annoyance the farmers whose poultry yards
often suffer from their nocturnal invasions they
are however in some measure patronized by the
squire who considers the race as belonging to
the good old times which to confess the
private truth seem to have abounded with good
for nothing characters
gipsies 
this roving crew is called starlight tom's
gang from the name its chieftain a notorious
poacher i have heard repeatedly the
misdeeds this minion the moon for
every midnight depredation that takes place in
park or fold or farm yard is laid to his charge
starlight tom in fact answers to his name he
seems to walk in darkness and like a fox to be
traced in the mornings by the mischief he has
done he reminds me that fearful personage
in the nursery rhyme 
who goes round the house at night 
none but bloody tom 
who steals all the sheep at night 
none but one by one 
in short starlight tom is the scapegoat 
the neighbourhood but as cunning and adroit
that there is no detecting him old christy
and the gamekeeper have watched many a night
in hopes entrapping him and christy often
patrols the park with his dogs for the purpose
but all in vain it is said that the squire winks
hard at his misdeeds having an indulgent feels
gipsies
iris toward the vagabond because his being
very expert at all kinds games a great shot
with the cross bow and the best morris dancer
in the country
the squire also suffers the gang to lurk unmolested
about the skirts his estate on condition
that they do not come about the house the
approaching wedding however has made a kind
 saturnalia at the hall and has caused a suspension
 all sober rule it has produced a
great sensation throughout the female part the
household not a housemaid but dreams wedding
favours and has a husband running in her
head such a time is a harvest for the gipsies
there is a public footpath leading across one
part the park by which they have free ingress 
and they are continually hovering about the
grounds telling the servant girls fortunes or
getting smuggled in to the young ladies
i believe the oxonian amuses himself very
much by furnishing them with hints in private
and bewildering all the weak brains in the house
with their wonderful revelations the general
gipsies 
certainly was very much astonished by the communications
made to him the other evening by
the gipsy girl he kept a wary silence towards
us on the subject and affected to treat it lightly 
but i have noticed that he has since redoubled his
attentions to lady lillycraft and her dogs
i have seen also phoebe wilkins the housekeeper's
pretty and lovesick niece holding a
long conference with one these old sybil behind
a large tree in the avenue and often looking
round to see that she w r as not observed i
make no doubt that she was endeavouring to get
some favourable augury about the result her
love quarrel with young readymoney as oracles
have always been more consulted on love
affairs than upon any thing else i fear however
that in this instance the response was not
as favourable as usual for i perceived poor
phoebe returning pensively towards the house
her head hanging down her hat in her hand and
the ribband trailing along the ground
at another time as i turned a corner a
terrace at the bottom the garden just by a
 gipsies
clump trees and a large stone urn came
upon a bevy the young girls the family
attended by this same phoebe wilkins i was
at a loss to comprehend the meaning their
blushing and giggling and their apparent agitation
until i saw the red cloak a gipsy vanishing
among the shrubbery a few moments
after i caught sight master simon and the
oxonian stealing along one the walks in the
garden chuckling and laughing at their successful
waggery having evidently put the gipsy
up to the thing and instructed her what to
say
after all there is something strangely pleasing
in these tampering with the future even
where we are convinced the fallacy the
prediction it is singular how willingly the
mind will half deceive itself and with wheat a
degree awe we will listen to these babblers
about futurity for my part i cannot feel angry
with those poor vagabonds that seek to deceive
us into bright hopes and expectations i have
always been something a castle builder and
gipsies 
have found my liveliest pleasures arising from
the illusions which fancy has cast over common
placed realities as i get on in life i find it
more difficult to deceive myself in this delightful
manner and should be thankful to any
prophet however false that should conjure the
clouds which hang over futurity into palaces
and all its doubtful regions into fairy land
the squire who as i have observed has a
private good will toward gipsies has suffered
considerable annoyance on their account not
that they requite his indulgence with ingratitude
for they do not deprecate very flagrantly op his
estate but because their pilfering and misdeeds
occasion loud murmurs in the village
for my own part i have a great toleration
for all kinds vagrant sunshiny existence and
must confess i take a pleasure in observing the
ways gipsies the english who are accustomed
to them from childhood and often suffer
from their petty depredations consider them as
mere nuisances but i have been very much
struck with their peculiarities i like to behold
 gipsies
their clear olive complexions their romantic
black eyes their raven locks their lithe slender
figures and to hear them in low silver
tones dealing forth magnificent promises 
honours and estates world's wealth and
ladies love
their mode life too has something in it
very fanciful and picturesque they are the
denizens nature and maintain a primitive
independence in spite law and gospel 
county gaols and country magistrates it is curious
to see this obstinate adherence to the wild
unsettled habits savage life transmitted from
generation to generation and preserved in the
midst one the most cultivated populous
and systematic countries in the world they
are totally distinct from the busy thrifty people
about them they seem to be like indians
either above or below the ordinary cares and
anxieties mankind heedless power 
honour wealth and indifferent to the fluctuations
 the times the rise or fall grain or
stock or empires they seem to laugh at the toilgipsies

are always to be found lurking about fairs and

times and are whimsically associated in my
mind with fairies and witches robin good fellow

mayday customs
happy the age and harmless were the dayes
for then true love and amity was found
when every village did a maypole raise
and whitsunales and maygames did abound 
and all the lusty yonkers in a rout
with merry lasses danced the rod about
then friendship to their banquets bid the guests
and poore men fared the better for their feasts
then lords castles manners towns and towers
rejoic'd when they beheld the farmers flourish
and would come downe unto the summerbowers
to see the countrygallants dance the morris
pasouil's palinodia 
the month april has nearly passed away
and we are fast approaching that poetical day
which was considered in old times as the
boundary that parted the frontiers winter and
summer with all its caprices however i like
the month april i like these laughing and
crying days when sunshine and shade seem to
run in billows over the landscape i like to
 mayday customs
see the sudden shower coming over the meadows
and giving all nature a greener smile and the
bright sunbeams chasing the flying cloud and
turning all its drops into diamonds
i was enjoying a morning the kind in company
with the squire in one the finest parts 
the park
we were skirting a beautiful grove and he
was giving me a kind biographical account
 several his favourite forest trees when we
heard the strokes an axe from the midst a
thick copse the squire paused and listened
with manifest signs uneasiness he turned
his steps in the direction the sound the
strokes grew louder and louder as we advanced 
there was evidently a vigorous arm wielding the
axe the squire quickened his pace but in
vain a loud crack and a succeeding crash told
that the mischief had been done and some child
 the forest laid low when we came to the
place we found master simon and several others
standing about a tall and beautifully straight
young larch which had just been felled
mayday customs 
the squire though a man most harmonious
disposition was completely put out 
tune by this circumstance he felt like a monarch
witnessing the murder one his liege
subjects and demanded with some asperity the
meaning the outrage it turned out to be an
affair master simon's who had selected the
tree from its height and straightness for a maypole
 the old one which stood on the village
green being unfit for farther service
if any thing could have soothed the ire my
worthy host it would have been the reflection
that his tree had fallen in a good cause and i
saw that there was a great struggle between his
fondness for his groves and his devotion to may
day
he could not contemplate the prostrate tree
however without indulging in lamentation and
making a kind funeral eulogy and he forbad
that any tree should thenceforward be cut down
ort his estate without a warrant from himself
being determined he said to hold the sovereign
power life and death in his own hands
 mayday customs
this mention the maypole struck my attention
and i inquired whether the old customs
connected with it were still kept up with any
spirit in this part the country
the squire shook his head mournfully and i
found i had touched on one his tender points
for he grew quite melancholy in bewailing the
total decline old mayday though it is regularly
celebrated in the neighbouring village
yet it has been merely resuscitated by his countenance
and is kept up in a forced state existence
at his expense he meets with continual
discouragements and finds great difficulty in
getting the country bumpkins to play their parts
tolerably
he manages to have every year a queen 
the may but as to robin hood friar tuck
the dragon the hobby horse and all the other
mostly crew that used to enliven the day with
their mummery he has not ventured to introduce
them
still i look forward with some interest to the
promised shadow old mayday even though
mayday customs 
it be but a shadow and i feel more and more
pleased with this whimsical yet harmless hobby
 my host which is surrounding him with agreeable
associations and making a little world 
poetry about him
brought up as i have been in a new country
i may appreciate too highly the faint vestiges 
ancient customs which now and then meet
with and the interest i express in them may
provoke a smile from those who are negligently
suffering them to pass away but with whatever
indifference they may be regarded by those
to the manner born yet in my mind the
lingering flavour them imparts a charm to
rustic life which nothing else could readily supr
shall never forget the delight i felt on first
seeing a maypole it was on the banks the
dee close by the picturesque old bridge that
stretches across that river from the quaint little
city chester had already been carried
back into former days by the antiquities that
venerable place the examination which is
 mayday customs
equal to turning over the pages a black letter
volume or gazing on the pictures in froissart
the maypole on the margin that poetic
stream completed the illusion my fancy adorned
it with wreaths flowers and peopled the
green bank with all the dancing revelry may
day the mere sight the maypole gave a
glow to my feelings and spread a charm over
the country for th rest the day and as i
traversed a part the fair plain cheshire
and the beautiful borders wales and looked
from among swelling hills down a long green
valley through which the deva wound its
wizard stream my imagination turned all into
a perfect arcadia
whether it be owing to such poetical associations
early instilled into my mind or whether
there is as it were a sympathetic revival and
budding forth the feelings at this season certain
it is that i always experience wherever i
may be placed a delightful expansion the heart
at the return may it is said that birds about
this time will become restless in their cages as if
mayday customs 
instinct with the season conscious the revelry
that is going on in the groves and impatient to
break from their bondage and join in the jubilee
 the year
in like manner i have felt myself excited even
in the midst the metropolis when the windows
which had been churlishly closed all winter
were again thrown open to receive the balmy
breath may when the sweets the country
were breathed into the town and flowers
were cried about the streets
i have considered the treasure flowers thus
poured in as so many missives from nature inviting
us forth to enjoy the virgin beauty the
year before its freshness is exhaled by the
heats sunny summer y
one can readily imagine what a gay scene it
must have been in jolly old london on a may
day in former times when the doors were decorated
with flowering branches when every hat
was decked with hawthorn and robin hood
friar tuck maid marian the morris dancers
and all the other fantastic masks and revellers
vol 
 mayday customs
were performing their antics about the maypole
in every part the city
i am not a bigoted admirer old times and
old customs rrterely because their antiquity
but while i rejoice in the decline many 
the rude usages and coarse amusements former
days i cannot but regret that this innocent
and fanciful festival has fallen into disuse it
seemed appropriate to this verdant and pastoral
country and calculated to light up the too pervading
gravity the nation i value every
custom that tends to infuse poetical feeling into
the common people and to sweeten and soften
the rudeness rustic manners without destroying
their simplicity indeed it is to the decline
 this happy simplicity that the decline this
custom may be traced and the rural dance on
the green and the homely mayday pageant
have gradually disappeared in proportion as the
peasantry have become expensive and artificial
in their pleasures and too knowing for simple
enjoyment
mayday customs 
some attempts the squire informs me have
been made late years by men both taste
and learning to rally back the popular feeling
to these standards primitive simplicity but
the time has gone by the feeling has become
chilled by habits gain and traffick the country
apes the manners and amusements the
town and little is heard mayday at present
excepting from the lamentations authors who
sigh after it from among the brick walls the
city
for for the hobby horse is forgot

village worthies
nay i tell you i am so well beloved in our town that not the
worst dog in the street will hurt my little finger
collier croydon
as the neighbouring village is one those
outoftheway but gossipping little places
where a small matter makes a great stir it is
not to be supposed that the approach a festival
like that mayday can be regarded with
indifference especially since it is made a matter
 such moment by the great folks at the hall
master simon who is the faithful factotum 
the worthy squire and jumps with his humour
in every thing is frequent just now in his visits
to the village to give directions for the impending
fete and as i have taken the liberty occasionally
 accompanying him i have been
 village worthies 
enabled to get some insight into the characters
and internal politics this very sagacious
little community
master simon is in fact the caesar the village
it is true the squire is the protecting
power but his factotum is the active and busy
agent he intermeddle in all its concerns
is acquainted with all the inhabitants and their
domestic history gives counsel to the old folks
in their business matters and the young folks
in their love affairs and enjoys the proud satisfaction
 being a great mart in a little world
he is the dispenser too the squire's charity
which is bounteous and to do master simon
justice he performs this part his functions
with great alacrity indeed i have been entertained
with the mixture bustle importance
and kind heartiness which he displays he
is too vivacious a temperament to comfort
the afflicted by sitting down moping and whining
and blowing noses in concert but goes
whisking about like a sparrow chirping consolation
into every hole and corner the village
 village worthies
i have seen an old woman in a red cloak hold
him for half an hour together with some long
phthisical tale distress to which master simon
listened with many a bob the head
smack his whip and other symptoms impatience
 though he afterwards made a most
faithful and circumstantial report the case to
the squire i have watched him too during
one his pop visits into the cottage a superannuated
villager who is a pensioner the
squire's where he fidgeted about the room
without sitting down made many excellent offhand
reflections with the old invalid who was
propped up in his chair about the shortness 
life the certainty death and the necessity

village worthies 
he has also his cabinet councillors in the
village with whom he is very busy just now
preparing for the mayday ceremonies among
these is the village tailor a palefaced fellow that
plays the clarion in the church choir and being
a great musical genius has frequent meetings 
the band at his house where they make night
hideous by their concerts he is in consequence
high in favour with master simon and
through his influence has the making or rather
marring all the liveries the hall which generally
look as though they had been cut out by
one those scientific tailors the flying island
 laputa who took measure their customers
with a quadrant the tailor in fact might rise
to be one the monied men the village if he
were not rather too prone to gossip and keep
holidays and give concerts and blow all his
substance real and personal through his clarion
 which literally keeps him poor both in
body and estate he has for the present thrown
by all his regular work and suffered the breeches
 the village to go unmade and unmended

while he is occupied in making garlands parti
coloured rags in imitation flowers for the
decoration the maypole
another master simon's councillors is the
apothecary a short and rather fat man with a
pair prominent eyes that diverge like those 
a lobster he is the village wise man very
sententious and full profound remarks on
shallow subjects master simon often quotes
his sayings and mentions him as rather an extraordinary
man and even consults him occasionally
in desperate cases the dogs and horses
indeed he seems to have been overwhelmed by
the apothecary's philosophy which is exactly
one observation deep consisting indisputable
maxims such as may be gathered from the mottoes
 tobacco boxes i had a specimen his
philosophy in my very first conversation with
him in the course which he observed with
great solemnity and emphasis that man is a
compound wisdom and folly upon which
master simon who had hold my arm pressed
very hard upon it and whispered in my ear
that's a devilish shrewd remark 
the schoolmaster
there will no moss stick to the stone sisyphus no grasse hang
on the heels mercury no butter cleave on the bread a traveller

her bauld in her age so the traveller in every country loseth some

among the worthies the village that enjoy
the peculiar confidence master simon is one
who has struck my fancy so much that i have
thought him worthy a separate notice it is
slingsbyby the schoolmaster a thin elderly man
rather threadbare and slovenly somewhat indolent
in manner and with an easy good humoured
look not often met with in his craft i have
been interested in his favour by a few anecdotes
which i have picked up concerning him
he is a native the village and was a convol
 
 the schoolmaster
temporary and playmate ready money jack's
in the days their boyhood indeed they carried
on a kind league mutual good offices
slingsbyby was rather puny and withall somewhat
 a coward but very apt at his learning jack
on the contrary was a bullyboy out doors
but a sad laggard at his books slingsbyby helped
jack therefore to all his lessons and jack fought
all slingsbyby's battles and they were inseparable
friends this mutual kindness continued even
after they left the school notwithstanding the
dissimilarity their characters jack took to
ploughing and reaping and prepared himself to
till his paternal acres while the other loitered
negligently on in the path learning until he
penetrated even into the confines latin and
mathematics in an unlucky hour however
he took to reading voyages and travels and was
smitten with a desire to see the world this
desire increased upon him as he grew up so
early one bright sunny morning he put all his
effects in a knapsack slung it on his back took
staff in hand and called in his way to take leave
the schoolmaster 
 his early schoolmate jack was just going
out with the plough the friends shook hands
over the farm house gate jack drove his team
afield and slingsbyby whistled over the hills
and far away and sallied forth gayly to seek
his fortune
years and years passed by and young tom
slingsbyby was forgotten when one mellow sunday
afternoon in autumn a thin man somewhat
advanced in life with a coat out at elbows
a pair old nankeen gaiters and a few things
tied in a handkerchief and slung on the 
a stick was seen loitering through the village
he appeared to regard several houses attentively
to peer into the windows that were open
to eye the villagers wistfully as they returned
from church and then to pass some time in the
churchyard reading the tombstones
at length he found his way to the farm house
 ready money jack but paused ere he attempted
the wicket contemplating the picture
 substantial independence before him in
the porch the house sat ready money jack
 the schoolmaster
in his sunday dress with his hat upon his head
his pipe in his mouth and his tankard before
him the monarch all he surveyed beside
him lay his fat house dog the varied sounds
 poultry were heard from the well stocked
farm yard the bees hummed from their hives in
the garden the cattle lowed in the rich meadow 
while the crammed barns and ample stacks bore
proof an abundant harvest
the stranger opened the gate and advanced
dubiously toward the house the mastiff growled
at the sight him but was immediately
silenced by his master who taking his pipe
from his mouth awaited with inquiring aspect
the address this equivocal personage the
stranger eyed old jack for a moment so portly
in his dimensions and decked out in gorgeous
apparel then cast a glance upon his own threadbare
and starveling condition and the scanty
bundle which he held in his hand then giving
his shrunk waistcoat a twitch to make it meet
his receding waistband and casting another
look half sad half humorous at the sturdy
the schoolmaster 
yeoman i suppose said he mr gibbets
you have forgot old times and old playmates
the latter gazed at him with scrutinizing
look but acknowledged that he had no recollection
 him 
like enough like enough said the
stranger every body seems to have forgotten
poor slingsbyby
why no sure it can't be tom slingsbyby 
yes but it is though replied the other
shaking his head
ready money jack was on his feet in a
twinkling thrust out his hand gave his ancient
crony the gripe a giant and slapping the
other hand on a bench sit down there cried
he tom slingsbyby 
a long conversation ensued about old times
while slingsbyby was regaled with the best cheer
that the farm house afforded for he was hungry
as well as wayworn and had the keen appetite
 a poor pedestrian the early playmates
then talked over their lives and adventures
jack had but little to relate and was never good
 the schoolmaster
at a long story a prosperous life passed at
home has little incident for narration it is only
poor devils that are tossed about the world that
are the true heroes story jack had stuck by
the paternal farm followed tfce same plough that
his forefathers had driven and had waxed richer
and richer as he grew older as to tom slingsbyby
he was an exemplification the old proverb
a rolling stone gathers no moss he had
sought his fortune about the world without ever
finding it being a thing oftener found at home
than abroad he had been in all kinds situations
 had learnt a dozen different modes making
a living but had found his way back to
his native village rather poorer than when he
left it his knapsack having dwindled down into
a scanty bundle
as luck would have it the squire was passing
by the farm house that very evening and
called there as is often his custom he found
the two schoolmates still gossiping in the porch
and according to the good old scottish song
taking a cup kindness yet for auld lang
the schoolmaster 
syne the squire was struck by the contrast
in appearance and fortunes these early
playmates ready money jack seated in lordly
state surrounded by the good things this
life with golden guineas hanging to his very
watch chain and the poor pilgrim slingsbyby
thin as a weasel with all his worldly effects
his bundle hat and walking staff lying on the
ground beside him
the good squire's heart warmed towards the
cosmopolite for he is a little prone to like such
half vagrant kind characters he cast about
in his mind how he should contrive once more to
anchor slingsbyby in his native village honest
jack had already offered him a present shelter
under his roof in spite the hints and winks
and half remonstrances the shrewd dame gibbets
 but how to provide for his permanent
maintenance was the question luckily the
squire bethought himself that the village school
was without a teacher a little farther conversation
convinced him that slingsbyby was
as fit for that as for any thing else and
 the schoolmaster
in a day or two he was seen swaying the rod 
empire in the very schoolhouse where he had
often been horsed in the days his boyhood
here he has remained for several years and
being honoured by the countenance the squire
and the fast friendship mr tibbets he has
grown into much importance and consideration
in the village i am v told however that he still
shows now and then a degree restlessness
and a disposition to rove abroad again and see a
little more the world an inclination which
seems particularly to haunt him about springtime
there is nothing so difficult to conquer
as the vagrant humour when once it has been
fully indulged
since i have heard these anecdotes poor
slingsbyby i have more than once mused upon
the picture presented by him and his schoolmate
ready money jack on their coming together
again after so long a separation it is difficult
to determine between lots in life where each is
attended with its peculiar discontents he who
never leaves his home repines at his monotonous
the schoolmaster 
existence and envies the traveller whose life is a
constant tissue wonder and adventure while
he who is tossed about the world looks back with
many a sigh on the safe and quiet shore which
he has abandoned i cannot help thinking
however that the man that stays at home and
cultivates the comforts and pleasures daily springing
up around him stands the best chance for
happiness there is nothing so fascinating to a
young mind as the idea travelling and there
is very witchcraft in the old phrase found in
every nursery tale going to seek one's fortune
a continual change place and change
 object promises a continual succession adventure
and gratification curiosity but there
is a limit to all our enjoyments and every desire
bears its death in its very gratification curiosity
languishes under repeated stimulants
novelties cease to excite surprise until at length
we cannot wonder even at a miracle he who
has sallied forth into the world like poor slingsbyby
full sunny anticipations finds too soon
how different the distant scene becomes when
vol 
 the schoolmaster
visited the smooth place roughens as he approaches
 the wild place becomes tame and barren
 the fairy tints that beguiled him on still fly
to the distant hill or gather upon the land he
has left behind and every part the landscape is
greener than the spot he stands on
the school
but to come down from great men and higher matters to my little
children and poor school house again i will god willing go forward
orderly as i purposed to instruct children and young men both
for learning and manners
roger ascham
having given the reader a slight sketch 
the village schoolmaster he may be curious to
learn something concerning his school as the
squire takes much interest in the'education the
neighbouring children he put into the hands 
the teacher on first installing him in office a
copy roger ascham's schoolmaster and
advised him moreover to con over that portion
 old pelham which treats the duty 
masters and which condemns the favourite
method making boys wise by flagellation
he exhorted slingsbyby not to break down or
 the school
depress the free spirit the boys by harshness
and slavish fear but to lead them freely and
joyously on in the path knowledge making
it pleasant and desirable in their eyes he
wished to see the youth trained up in the manners
and habitudes the peasantry the good
old times and thus to lay a foundation for the
accomplishment his favourite object the revival
 old english customs and character
he recommended that all the ancient holidays
should be observed and that the sports the
boys in their hours play should be regulated
according to the standard authorities laid down
in struts a copy whose invaluable work
decorated with plates was deposited in the
school house above all he exhorted the pedagogue
to abstain from the use birch an instrument
 instruction which the good squire
regards with abhorrence as fit only for the
coercion brute natures that cannot be reasoned
with
mr slingsbyby has followed the squire's instructions
to the best his disposition and abi
the school 
cities he never flogs the boys because he is too
easy goodhumoured a creature to inflict pain
on a worm he is bountiful in holidays because
he loves holidays himself and has a sympathy
with the urchins impatience confinement
from having divers times experienced its
irksomeness during the time that he was seeing
the world
as to sports and pastimes the boys are faithfully
exercised in all that are on record quoits
races prison bars tipcat trapball bandyball
wrestling leaping and what not the only
misfortune is that having banished the birch
honest slingsbyby has not studied roger ascham
sufficiently to find out a substitute or rather he
has not the management in his nature to apply
one his school therefore though one the
happiest is one the most unruly in the country
 and never was a pedagogue more liked or
less heeded by his disciples than slingsbyby
he has lately taken a coadjutor worthy 
himself being another stray sheep that has returned
to the village fold this is no other than
 the school
the son the musical tailor who had bestowed
some cost upon his education hoping to see him
one day arrive at the dignity an exciseman or
at least a parish clerk the lad grew up
however as idle and musical as his father and
being captivated by the drum and fife a recruiting
party he followed them off to the army
he returned not long since out money and
out at the elbows the prodigal son the village
he remained for some time lounging
about the place in a half tattered soldier's dress
with a foraging cap on one side his head
jerking stones across the brook or loitering about
the tavern door a burthen to his father and regarded
with great coldness by all the warm
householders
something however drew honest slingsbyby
towards the youth it might be the kindness
he bore to his father who is one the schoolmaster's
great cronies it might be that secret
sympathy which draws men vagrant propensities
towards each other for there is something
truly magnetic in the vagabond feeling or it
the school 
might be that he remembered the time when he
himself had come back like this youngster a
wreck to his native place at any rate whatever
the motive slingsbyby drew towards the
youth they had many conversations in the
village taproom about foreign parts and the
various scenes and places they had witnessed
during their wayfaring about the world the
more slingsbyby talked with him the more he
found him to his taste and finding him almost
as learned as himself he forthwith engaged
him as an assistant or usher in the school
under such admirable tuition the school as
may be supposed flourishes apace and if the
scholars do not become versed in all the holyday
accomplishments the good old times to the
squire's heart's content it will not be the fault
 their teachers the prodigal son has become
almost as popular among the boys as the pedagogue
himself his instructions are not limited
to the school hours and having inherited the
musical taste and talents his father he has
bitten the whole school with the mania he
so the school
is a great hand at beating a drum which is often
heard rumbling from the rear the school house
he is teaching half the boys the village also
to play the fife and the pandean pipes and they
weary the whole neighbourhood with their
vague pipings as they sit perched on stiles or
loitering about the barn doors in the evenings
among the other exercises the school also
he has introduced the ancient art archery
one the squire's favourite themes with
such success that the whispers roam in truant
bands about the neighbourhood practising with
their bows and arrows upon the birds the air
and the beasts the field in a word so completely
are the ancient english customs and habits
cultivated at this school that i should not be
surprised if the squire should live to see one 
his poetic visions realized and a brood reared up
worthy successors to robin hood and his merry
gang outlaws

bishop cokjbet
i have mentioned the squire's fondness for
the marvellous and this predilection for legends
and romances his library contains a curious
collection old works this kind which bear
evident marks having been much read in
his great love for all that is antiquated he cherishes
popular superstitions and listens with very
grave attention to every tale however strange 
so that through his countenance the household
and indeed the whole neighbourhood is well
vol 
 popular superstitions
stocked with wonderful stories and if ever a
doubt is expressed anyone them the narrator
will generally observe that the squire
thinks there's something in it
the hall course comes in for its share the
common people having always a propensity to
furnish a great superannuated building the
kind with supernatural inhabitants the gloomy
galleries such old family mansions the stately
chambers adorned with grotesque carvings and
faded paintings the sounds that vaguely echo
about them the moaning the wind the cries
 rooks and ravens from the trees and chimney
tops all produce a state mind favourable to
superstitious fancies
in one chamber the hall just opposite a
door which opens upon a dusky passage there
is a full length portrait a warrior in armour 
when on suddenly turning into this passage
i have caught a sight the portrait thrown into
strong relief by the dark panelling against
which it hangs i have more than once been
startled as though it were a figure advancing
popular superstitions 
towards me to superstitious minds therefore
predisposed by the strange and melancholy stories
that are often connected with family paintings
it needs but little stretch fancy on a
moonlight night or by the flickering light a
candle to set the old pictures on the walls in
motion sweeping in their robes and trains about
the galleries
to tell the truth the squire confesses that
he used to take a pleasure in his younger days
in setting marvellous stories afloat and connecting
them with the lonely and peculiar places 
the neighbourhood whenever he read any
legend a striking nature he endeavoured to
transplant it and give it a local habitation
among the scenes his boyhood many 
these stories took root and he says he is often
amused with the odd shapes in which they will
come back to him in some old woman's narrative
after they have been circulating for years
among the peasantry and undergoing rustic additions
and amendments among these may
doubtless be numbered that the crusader's
 popular superstitions
ghost which i have mentioned in the account 
my christmas visit and another about the
hardriding squire yore the family nimrod
who is sometimes heard on stormy winter
nights galloping with hound and horn over a
wild moor a few miles distant from the hall
this i apprehend to have had its origin in the
famous story the wild huntsman the favourite
goblin in german tales though by thei

bye as i was talking on the subject with master
simon the other evening in the dark avenue he
hinted that he had himself once or twice heard
strange sounds at night very like a pack 
hounds in cry and that once as he was returning
rather late from a hunting dinner he had
seen a strange figure galloping along this same
moor but as he was riding rather fast at the
time and in a hurry to get home he did not
stop to ascertain what it was
popular superstitions are fast fading away in
england owing to the general diffusion knowledge
and the bustling intercourse kept up
throughout the country still they have their
popular superstitions 
strong holds and lingering places and a retired
neighbourhood like this is apt to be one them
the parson tells me that he meets with many traditional
beliefs and notions among the common
people which he has been able to draw from them
in the course familiar conversation though they
are rather shy avowing them to strangers and
particularly to the gentry who are apt to
laugh at them he says there are several his
old parishioners who remember when the village
had its barguest or bar ghost a spirit supposed
to belong to a town or village and to predict any
impending misfortune by midnight shrieks and
failings the last time it was heard was just
before the death mr drawbridge's father
who was much beloved throughout the neighbourhood
 though there are not wanting some
obstinate unbelievers who insist that it was nothing
but the howling a watch dog
i have been greatly delighted however at
meeting with some traces my old favourite
robin good fellow though under a different
appellation from any those by which i have
 popular superstitions
heretofore heard him called the parson assures
me that many the peasantry believe in
household goblins called dobbies which live
about particular farms and houses in the same
way that robin good fellow did old sometimes
they haunt the barns and outhouses and
now and then will assist the farmer wonderfully
by getting in all his hay or corn in a single night
in general however they prefer to live within
doors and are fond keeping about the great
hearths and basking at night after the family
have gone to bed by the glowing embers when
put into particular good humour by the warmth
 their lodgings and the tidiness the housemaids
they will overcome their natural laziness
arid do a vast deal household work before
morning churning the cream brewing the
beer or spinning all the good dame's flax all
this is precisely the conduct robin good
fellow described so charmingly by milton 
tells how the drudging goblin sweat
to earn his creambowl duly set
when in one night ere glimpse morn
his shadowy flail had threshed the con
popular superstitions 
that ten daylabourers could not 
then lays him down the lubberfiend
and stretched out all the chimney's length
basks at the fire his hairy strength
and cropfull out door he flings
ere the first cock his matin rings
but beside these household dobbies there are
others a more gloomy and unsocial nature 
that keep about lonely barns at a distance from
any dwelling house or about ruins and old
bridges these are full mischievous and
often malignant tricks and are fond playing
pranks upon benighted travellers there
is a story among the old people one that
haunted a ruined mill just by a bridge that
crosses a small stream how that late one night
as a traveller was passing on horseback the
dobbin jumped up behind him and grasped him
so close round the body that he had no power
to help himself but expected to be squeezed to
death luckily his heels were loose with which
he plied the sides his steed and was carried
with the wonderful instinct a traveller's
horse straight to the village inn had the inn
 popular superstitions
been at any greater distance there is no doubt
but he would have been strangled to death as
it was the good people were a long time in
bringing him to his senses and it was remarked
that the first sign he showed returning consciousness
was to call for a bottom brandy
the only instance one the household
dobbies that the parson has met with is one
that was said to keep about the old farm house
 ready money jack it has long been traditional
i am told that one these good natured
goblins is attached to the tibbets family and
came with them when they moved into this part
 the country for it is remarked that they keep
with certain families and follow them wherever
they remove there is a large old fashioned
fireplace in the farm house which affords fine
quarters for a chimney corner sprite the kind
that likes to lie warm especially as ready
money jack keeps up rousing fires in the wintertime
the old people the village recollect
many stories that were told about this goblin in
popular superstitions 
their young days it was thought to have
brought good luck to the house and to be the
reason why the tibbets were always beforehand
in the world why their farm was always
in better order their hay got in sooner 
and their corn better stacked than that their
neighbours the present mrs tibbets at the
time her courtship had a number these
stones told her by the country gossips and when
married was a little fearful about living in a
house where such a hobgoblin was said to haunt
jack however who has always treated this story
with great contempt assured her that there was
no spirit kept about his house that he could not
at any time lay in the red sea with one flourish
 his cudgel still his wife has never got completely
over her notions on the subject she
has had a horseshoe nailed on the threshold
and keeps a branch country or mountain ash
with its red berries suspended from one the
great beams in the parlour sure protections from
all evil spirits
vol 
popular superstitions
these stories however as i before observed
are fast fading away and in another generation
or two will probably be completely forgotten
there is something however about these rural
superstitions that is extremely pleasing to the
imagination i allude to those concerning the
good humoured race household demons and
indeed to the whole fairy mythology the
english have given an inexpressible charm to
these superstitions by the manner in which they
have associated them with whatever is most
homefelt and delightful in rustic life or refreshing
and beautiful in nature i do not know a
more fascinating race beings than these little
fabled people that haunted the southern sides 
hills and mountains lurked in flowers and about
fountain heads glided through keyhole into ancient
halls watched over farm houses and dairies 
danced on the green by summer moonlight and on
the kitchen hearth in winter they seem to me to
accord with the nature english housekeeping
and english scenery i always have them in mind
when i see a fine old english mansion with its
popular superstitions 
wide hall and spacious kitchen or a venerable
farm house in which there is so much fireside
comfort and good housewifery there was something
 national character in their love order
and cleanliness in the vigilance with which
they watched over the economy the kitchen
and the functions the servants munificently
rewarding with silver sixpence in shoe the tidy
housemaid but venting their direful wrath in
midnight bobs and pinches upon the sluttish
dairy maid i think i can trace the good effects
 this ancient fairy sway over household concerns
in the care that prevails to the present day
among english housemaids to put their kitchens
in order before they go to bed
i have said too that these fairy superstitions
seemed to me to accord with the nature english
scenery they suit these small landscapes
which are divided by honeysuckled hedges into
sheltered fields and meadows where the grass
is mingled with daisies butter cups and harebells
when i first found myself among english
scenery i was continually reminded the
popular superstitions
sweet pastoral images which distinguish their
fairy mythology and when for the first time a
circle in the grass was pointed out to me as one
 the rings where they were formerly supposed
to have held their moonlight revels it seemed
for a moment as if fairy land were no longer
a fable
browne in his britannia's pastorals gives a
picture the kind scenery to which i allude
a pleasant mead
where fairies often did their measures tread
which in the meadows make such circles green
as if with garlands it had crowned been
within one these rounds was to be seen
a hillock rise where oft the fairy queen
at twilight sat
and there is another picture the same in a
poem ascribed to ben jonson
i
by wells and rills in meadows green
we nightly dance our heyday guise
and to our fairy king and queen
we chaunt our moonlight mistresses
indeed it seems to me that the older british
poets with that true feeling for nature which
distinguishes them have closely adhered to the
popular superstitions s
simple and familiar imagery which they found
in these popular superstitions and have thus
given to their fairy mythology those continual
allusions to the farm house and the dairy the
green meadow and the fountain head that fill
our minds with the delightful associations 
rural life it is curious to observe how the
most beautiful fictions have their origin among
the rude and ignorant there is an indescribable
charm about the illusions with which chimerical
ignorance once clothed every subject
these twilight views nature are often more
captivating than any which are revealed by the
rays enlightened philosophy the most accomplished
and poetical minds therefore have
been fain to search back into these accidental
conceptions what are termed barbarous ages
and to draw from thence their finest imagery
and machinery if we look through our most
admired poets we shall find that their minds
have been impregnated by these popular fancies
 and that those have succeeded best who
have adhered closest to the simplicity their
 popular superstitions
rustic originals such is the case with shakspeare
in his midsummer's night's dream
which so minutely describes the employments
and amusements fairies and embodies all
the notions concerning them which were current
among the vulgar
it is thus that poetry in england has
echoed back every rustic note softened into
perfect melody it is thus that it has spread its
charms over every day life displacing nothing 
taking things as it found them but tinting them
up with its own magical hues until every green
hill and fountain head every fresh meadow
nay every humble flower is full song and
story
i am dwelling too long perhaps upon a threadbare
subject yet it brings up with it a thousand
delicious recollections those happy days 
childhood when the imperfect knowledge i have
since obtained had not yet dawned upon my
mind and when a fairy tale was true history tome
i have often been so transported by the
pleasure these recollections as almost to wish
popular superstitions 
that i had been born in the days when the fictions
 poetry were believed even now i cannot
look upon these fanciful creations ignorance
and credulity without a lurking regret that
they have all passed away the experience 
my early days tells me that they were sources 
exquisite delight and i sometimes question
whether the naturalist who can dissect the flowers
 the field receives half the pleasure from contemplating
them that he did who considered
them the abodes elves and fairies i feel convinced
that the true interests and solid happiness
 man are promoted by the advancement 
truth yet i cannot but mourn over the pleasant
errors which it has trampled down in its progress
the fawns and sylphs the household sprite the
moonlight revel oberon queen mab and the
delicious realms fairy land all vanish before the
light true philosophy but who does not sometimes
turn with distaste from the cold realities

in an old play entitled the maids metamorphosis

i am so full nimble stratagems that i should have ordered affairs

the goblins
in one my visits to the village with master
simon he proposed that we should stop at the
inn which he wanted to show me as a specimen
 a real country inn the head quarters village
gossip i had remarked it before in my
perambulations about the place it has a deep
old fashioned porch leading into a large hall
which serves for a tap room and traveller's room
having a wide fireplace with highbacked settles
on each side where the wise men the
village gossip over their ale and hold their sessions
during the long winter evenings the
a village politician 
landlord is an easy indolent fellow shaped a little
like one his own beer barrels who is apt
to stand gossiping at his door with his wig on
one side and his hands in his pockets whilst his
wife and daughter attend to customers his
wife however is fully competent to manage the
establishment and indeed from long habitude
rules over all the frequenters the tap room as
completely as if they were her dependents instead
 her patrons not a veteran ale bibber
but pays homage to her having no doubt been
often in her arrears i have already hinted that
she is on very good terms with ready money
jack he was a sweetheart her's in early
life and has always countenanced the tavern on
her account indeed he is quite the cock 
the walk at the tap room
as we approached the inn we heard someone
talk with great volubility and distinguished
the ominous words taxes poor's rates
and agricultural distress it proved to be a
thin loquacious fellow who had got the landlord
pinned up in one corner the porch with his
 a village politician
hands in his pockets as usual listening with an
air the most vacant acquiescence
the sight seemed to have a curious effect on
master simon as he squeezed my arm and altering
his course sheered wide the porch as
though he had not had any idea entering
this evident evasion made me notice the orator
more particularly he was meagre but active
in his make with a long pale bilious face a
black beard so ill shaven as to bloody his shirtcollar
a feverish eye and a hat sharpened up at
the sides into a most pragmatical shape he
had a newspaper in his hand and seemed to be
commenting on its contents to the thorough conviction
 mine host at the sight master
simon the landlord was a little flurried and
began to rub his hands edge away from his corner
and make several profound publican bows 
while the orator took no other notice my companion
than to talk rather louder than before
and with as i thought something an air 
defiance master simon however as i have
before said sheered off from the porch and passa
village politician 
ed on pressing my arm within his and whispering
as we got by in a tone awe and horror
 that's a radical he reads cobbett 
i endeavoured to get a more particular account
 him from my companion but he
seemed unwilling even to talk about him assuring
me only in general terms that he was
a cursed busy fellow that had a confounded
trick talking and was apt to bother one
about the national debt and such nonsense 
from which i suspected that master simon had
been rendered wary him by some accidental
encounter on the field argument for these
radicals are continually roving about in quest 
wordy warfare and never so happy as when
they can tilt a gentleman logician out his
saddle
on subsequent inquiry my suspicions have
been confirmed i find the radical has but recently
found his way into the village where he
threatens to commit fearful devastation with his
doctrines he has already made two or three
complete converts or new lights has shaken the
 a village politician
faith several others and has grievously puzzled
the brains many the oldest villagers
who had never thought about politics or scarce
any thing else during their whole lives
he is lean and meagre from the constant restlessness
 mind and body worrying about with
newspapers and pamphlets in his pockets which
he is ready to pull out on all occasions he has
shocked several the staunchest villagers by
talking lightly the squire and his family and
hinting it would be better the park should be
cut up into small farms and kitchen gardens or
feed good mutton instead worthless deer
he is a great thorn in the side the squire
who is sadly afraid he will introduce politics into
the village and turn it into an unhappy thinking
community he is a still greater grievance
to master simon who has hitherto been able to
sway the political opinions the place without
much cost learning or logic but has been
very much puzzled late to weed out the doubts
and heresies already sown by this champion 
reform indeed the latter has taken complete
a village politician 
command at the tap room the tavern not so
much because he has convinced as because he
has out talked all the old established oracles
the apothecary with all his philosophy has
been as naught before him he has convinced
and converted the landlord at least a dozen times
who however is liable to be convinced and converted
the other way by the next person with
whom he talks it is true the radical has a violent
antagonist in the landlady who is vehemently
loyal and thoroughly devoted to the king
master simon and the squire she now and
then comes out upon the reformer with all the
the fierceness a cata mountain and does not
spare her own soft headed husband for listening
to what she terms such low lived politics
what makes the good woman the more violent
is the perfect coolness with which the radical
listens to her attacks drawing his face up into
a provoking supercilious smile and when she
has talked herself out breath quietly asking
her for a taste her homebrewed
the only person that is in any way a match

 a village politician
for this redoubtable politician is ready money
jack tibbets who maintains his stand in the
tap room in defiance the radical and all his
works jack is one the most loyal men in the
country without being able to reason about the
matter he has that admirable quality for a
tough arguer also that he never knows when
he is beat he has half a dozen old maxims
which he advances on all occasions and though
his antagonist may overturn them never so often
yet he always brings them anew to the field
he is like the robber in ariosto who though
his head might be cut off half a hundred times
yet whipped it on his shoulders again in a twinkling
and returned as sound a man as ever to the
charge
whatever does not square with jack's simple
and obvious creed he sets down for french
politics for notwithstanding the peace he
cannot be persuaded the french are not still
laying plots to ruin the nation and get hold the
bank england the radical attempted to
overwhelm him one day by a long passage from
a village politician 
 
a newspaper but jack neither reads nor believes
in newspapers in reply he gave him
one the stanzas which he has by heart from
his favourite and indeed only author old tusser
and which he calls his golden rules 
leave princes affairs descanted on
and tend to such doings as stand thee upon
fear god and offend not the king nor his laws
and keep thyself out the magistrate's claws
when tibbets had pronounced this with great
emphasis he pulled out a wellfilled leathern
purse took out a handful gold and silver
paid his score at the bar with great punctuality
returned his money piece by piece into his
purse his purse into his pocket which he buttoned
up and then giving his cudgel a stout
thump upon the floor and bidding the radical
 good morning sir with the tone 
a man who conceives he has completely done
for his antagonist he walked with lionlike gravity
out the house two or three jack's
admirers who were present and were afraid
to take the field themselves looked upon this
 a village politician
as a perfect triumph and winked at each other
when the radical's back was turned aye
aye said mine host as soon as the radical
was out hearing let old jack alone i'll
warrant he'll give him his own

doctor mirriemaw 
the squire has lately received another shock
in the saddle and been almost unseated by his
marplot neighbour the indefatigable mr faddy
who rides his jogtrot hobby with equal zealand
is so bent upon improving and reforming
the neighbourhood that the squire thinks in a
little while it will be scarce worth living in the
enormity that has just discomposed my worthy
host is an attempt the manufacturer to have
a line coaches established that shall diverge
 travelling
from the old route and pass through the neighbouring
village i believe have mentioned that
the hall is situated in a retired part the country
at a distance from any great coach road in
so much that the arrival a traveller is apt to
make every one look out the window and to
cause some talk among the ale drinkers at the
little inn i was at a loss therefore to account
for the squire's indignation at a measure apparently
fraught with convenience and advantage
until i found that the conveniences travelling
were among his greatest grievances
in fact he rails against stage coaches post
chaises and turnpike roads as serious causes 
the corruption english rural manners they
have given facilities he says to every humdrum
citizen to trundle his family about the kingdom
and have sent the follies and fashions town
whirling in coach loads to the remotest parts 
the island the whole country he says is traversed
by these flying cargoes every byroad is
explored by enterprizing tourists from cheapside
and the poultry and every gentleman's park
travelling ill
and lawns invaded by cockney sketchers both
sexes with portable chairs and portfolios for
drawing
he laments over this as destroying the charm
 privacy and interrupting the quiet country
life but more especially as affecting the
simplicity the peasantry and filling their
heads with half city notions a great coach
inn he says is enough to ruin the manners 
a whole village it creates a horde sots and
idlers makes gapers and gazers and news
mongers the common people and knowing
jokes the country bumpkins the squire
has something the old feudal feeling he
looks back with regret to the good old times
when journeys were only made on horseback
and the extraordinary difficulties travelling
owing to bad roads bad accommodations and
highway robbers seemed to separate each village
and hamlet from the rest the world
the lord the manor was then a kind 
monarch in the little realm around him he
held his court in his paternal hall and was
 travelling
looked up to with almost as much loyalty and
deference as the king himself every neighbourhood
was a little world within itself having its
local manners and customs its local history and
local opinions the inhabitants were fonder 
their homes and thought less wandering it
was looked upon as an expedition to travel
out sight the parish steeple and a man
that had been to london w r as a village oracle for
the rest his life
what a difference between the mode travelling
in those days and at present at that
time when a gentlemen went on a distant visit
he set forth like a knight errant on an enterprize
 and every family excursion was a pageant
how splendid and fanciful must one 
those domestic cavalcades have been when
the beautiful dames were mounted on palfreys
magnificently caparisor i with embroidered
harness all tinkling with silver bells attended
by cavaliers richly attired on prancing steeds
and followed by pages and serving men as we
see them represented in old tapestry the gentravelling

try as they travelled about in those days were
like moving pictures they delighted the eyes
and awakened the admiration the common
people and passed before them like superior
beings and they were so there was a hardy
and healthful exercise connected with this
equestrian style that made them generous and
noble
in his fondness for the old style travelling
the squire makes most his journeys on horseback
 though he laments the modern deficiency
 incident on the road from the want fellow
wayfarers and the rapidity with which everyone
else is whirled along in coaches and post
chaises in the good old times on the contrary
a cavalier jogged on through bog and mire
from town to town and hamlet to hamlet conversing
with friars and franklins and all other
chance companions f the road beguiling the
way with travellers tales which then were truly
wonderful for every thing beyond one's neighbourhood
was full marvel and romance stopvol
 
 travelling
ing at night at some hostel where the bush
over the door proclaimed good wine or a pretty
hostess made bad wine palatable meeting at
supper with travellers like himself discussing
their day's adventures or listening to the song
or merry story the host who was generally a
boon companion and presided at his own
board for according to old tusser's innhold
er's posse 
at males my friend who violet here
and sitter with his host
shall both be sure better cheer
and scape with lesser cost
the squire is fond too stopping at those
inns which may be met with here and there in
ancient houses wood and plaister or alliance
houses as they are called by antiquaries
with deep porches diamondpaned bow windows
and panelled rooms and great fireplaces
he will prefer them to more spacious and modern
inns and will cheerfully put up with bad
cheer and bad accommodations in the gratification
 his humour they give him he says
travelling 
the feeling old times insomuch that he almost
expects in the dusk the evening to see
some party weary travellers ride up to the
door with plumes and mantles trunk hose wide
boots and long rapiers
the good squire's remarks brought to mind
a visit which i once paid to the tabard inn famous
for being the place assemblage from
whence chaucer's pilgrims set forth for canterbury
it is in the borough southwark not
far from london bridge and bears at present
the name the talbot it has sadly declined
in dignity since the days chaucer being a
mere rendezvous and packing place the great
wagons that travel into kent the court yard
which was anciently the mustering place the
pilgrims previous to their departure was now
lumbered with huge wagons crates boxes
hampers and baskets containing the good things
 town and country were piled about them 
while among the straw and litter the motherly
hens scratched and clucked with their hungry
broods at their heels instead chaucer's
 travelling
mostly and splendid throng i only saw a group
 wagoners and stable boys enjoying a circulating
pot ale while a long bodied dog sat
by with head on one side one ear cocked up
and wistful gaze as if waiting for his turn 
the tankard
notwithstanding this grievous declension
however i was gratified at perceiving that the
present occupants were not unconscious the
poetical renown their mansion
an inscription over the gateway proclaimed
it to be the inn where chaucer's pilgrims slept
on the night previous to their departure and at
the bottom the yard was a magnificent sign
representing them in the act sallying forth
i was pleased too at noticing that though the
present inn was comparatively modern yet
the form the old inn was preserved there
were galleries round the yard as in old times on
which opened the chambers the guests to
these ancient inns have antiquaries ascribed the
present forms our theatres plays were originally
acted in inn yards
travelling 
the guests lolled over the galleries which
answered to our modern dress circle the critical
mob clustered in the yard instead the pit and
the groups gazing from the garret windows were
no bad representatives the gods the shilling
gallery when therefore the drama grew important
enough to have a house its own the
architects took a hint for its construction from
the yard the ancient hostel
i was so well pleased at finding these remembrances
 chaucer and his poem that i took my
dinner in the little parlour the talbot whilst
it was preparing i sat by the window musing and
gazing into the court yard and conjuring up recollections
 the scenes depicted in such lively
colours by the poet until by degrees bales boxes
and hampers boys wagoners and dogs faded
from sight and my fancy peopled the place with
the mostly throng canterbury pilgrims the
galleries once more swarmed with idle gazers
in the rich dresses chaucer's time and the
whole cavalcade seemed to pass before me
there was the stately knight on sober steed who
 travelling
had ridden in healthiness and had fought
for our faith at tramissene and his son the
young squire a lover and a lusty bachelor with
curled locks and gay embroidery a bold rider a
dancer and a writer verses singing and fluting
all day long and fresh as the month may
and his knot beaded yeoman a bold forester in
green with horn and baldric and dagger a mighty
bow in hand and a sheaf peacock arrows
shining beneath his belt and the coy smiling
simple nun with her gray eyes her small red
mouth and fair forehead her coral beads about
her arm her golden broach with a love motto
and her pretty oath by saint ely and the
marchant solemn in speech and high on horse
with forked beard and flounders bever hat
and the sleek lusty monk on berry brown palfrey
 his hood fastened with gold pin wrought
with a love knot his bald head shining like
glass and his face glistening as though it had
been anointed and the lean logical sententious
clerke oxenforde upon his halfstarved
scholarlike horse and the bowing sompnour
travelling 
with fiery cherub face all knobbed with pirnpies
an eater garlic and onions and drinker
 strong wine red as blood that carried a
cake for a buckler and babbled latin in his
cups whose brimstone visage children
were sore afford and the buxom wife 
bath the widow five husbands upon her
ambling nag with her hat broad as a buckler
her red stockings and sharp spurs and
the slender choleric reeve norfolk with
close shaven beard and hair cropped round
his ears and long lean careless legs a rusty
blade by his side bestriding his good gray stot
and the jolly limitour with lisping tongue and
twinkling eye well beloved franklins and
housewives a great promoter marriages
among young women known at the taverns in
every town and by every hostler and gay
tapster in short before i was roused from
my reverie by the less poetical but more substantial
apparition a smoking beef steak 
had seen the whole cavalcade issue forth from
the hostel gate with the brawny double jointed
travelling
red haired miller playing the bagpipes before
them and the ancient host the tabard giving
them his farewell godsend to canterbury
when i told the squire the existence 
this legitimate descendant the ancient tabard
inn his eyes absolutely glistened with delight
he determined to hunt it up the very first time
he visited london and to eat a dinner there and
drink a cup mine host's best wine in memory
 old chaucer
the general who happened to be present immediately
begged to be the party for he liked
to encourage these long established houses as
they are apt to have choice old wines
mayday
ow the bright morning star day's harbinger
comes dancing from the east and leads with her
the flow'ry may who from her green lap throws
the yellow cowslip and the pale primrose
hail bounteous may that dost inspire
mirth and youth and warm desire
woods and groves are thy dressing
hill and dale doth boast thy blessing

as i was lying in bed this morning enjoying
one those half dreams half reveries which
are so pleasant in the country when the birds are
singing about the window and the sunbeams
peeping through the curtains i was roused by
the sound music on going down stairs i
found a number villagers drest in their holyday
clothes bearing a pole ornamented with garlands
and ribbands and accompanied by the vilvol
 
 mayday
lage band music under the direction the
tailor the pale fellow who plays on the clarion
they had all sprigs hawthorn or as it is called
 the may in their hats and had brought
green branches and flowers to decorate the hall
door and windows they had come to give notice
that the maypole was reared on the green
and to invite the household to witness the sports
the hall according to custom became a scene
 hurry and delighted confusion the servants
were all agog with may and music and there
was no keeping the tongues or the feet the
maids quiet who were anticipating the sports 
the green and the evening dance
i repaired to the village at an early hour to
enjoy the merrymaking the morning was
pure and sunny such as a maymorning is always
described the fields were white with daisies 
the hawthorn was covered with its fragrant blossoms
the bee hummed about every bank and
the swallow played high in the air about the village
steeple it was one those days when
we seem to draw in pleasure with the very air
mayday 
we breathe and to feel happy we know not why
whoever has felt the worth worthy man or
has doated on lovely woman will on such a day
call them tenderly to mind and feel his heart all
alive with long buried recollections
before reaching the village i saw the maypole
towering above the cottages with its gay
garlands and streamers and heard the sound 
music i found that there had been booths setup
near it for the reception company and a
bower green branches and flowers for the
queen may a fresh rosycheeked girl the
village
a band morris dancers were capering on
the green in their fantastic dresses jingling with
hawks bells with a boy dressed up as maid
marian and the attendant fool rattling his box
to collect contributions from the bystanders
i noticed also the gipsy women already
plying their mystery in scorners the village
reading the hands the simple country
girls and no doubt promising them all good
husbands and tribes children
 mayday
the squire made his appearance in the
course the morning attended by the parson
and was received with loud acclamations he
mingled among the country people throughout
the day giving and receiving pleasure wherever
he went
the amusements the day were under the
management slingsbyby the schoolmaster 
who is not merely lord misrule in his
school but likewise master the revels to the
village he was bustling about with the perplexed
and anxious air a man who has the
oppressive burthen promoting other people's
merriment upon his mind he had involved
himself in a dozen scrapes in consequence 
a politic intrigue which by the bye master
simon and the oxonian were at the bottom 
which had for object the election the queen
 may he had met with violent opposition
from a faction ale drinkers who were in favour
 a bouncing bar maid the daughter the tavern
keeper but he had been too strongly backed
not to carry his point though it shows that
mayday 
these crowns like all others are objects 
great ambition and heart burning j am told
that master simon takes great interest though
in an underhand way in the election these
may day queens and that the chaplet is generally
secured for some rustic beauty that has
found favour in his eyes
in the course the day there were various
games strength and agility on the green at
which a knot village veterans presided as
judges the lists among these i perceived
that ready money jack took the lead looking
with a learned and critical eye on the merits 
the different candidates his hat was drawn a
little on one side over his brow which gave
additional effect to his decisions and though he
was very laconic and sometimes merely expressed
himself by a nod yet it was evident that his
opinions far outweighed those the most
loquacious
young jack tibbets was the hero the day
and carried off most the prizes though in
some the feats agility he was rivalled by the
 mayday
prodigal son who appeared much in his
element on this occasion but his most formidable
competitor was the notorious gipsy the redoubtable
starlight tom i was rejoiced at
having an opportunity seeing this minion
 the moon in broad daylight i found him
to be a tall swarthy goodlooking fellow with
a lofty air something like i have seen in an indian
chieftain and with a certain lounging easy and
almost graceful carriage which i have often remarked
in beings the macaroni order that
lead an idle loitering life and have a gentlemanlike
contempt labour
master simon and the general reconnoitred
the ground together indulging a vast deal 
harmless raking among the buxom country girls
master simon would give some them a kiss
on meeting with them and would ask after their
sisters for he is acquainted with most the farmers
families sometimes he would whisper
and affect to talk mischievously with them and
if bantered on the subject would turn it off with
a laugh though it was evident he liked to be
mayday 
suspected being a gay lothario amongst
them
he had much to say to the farmers about their
farms and seemed to know all their horses byname
there was an old fellow with a round
ruddy face and a night cap under his hat who
is the wit the village and who took several
occasions to crack a joke with master simon in
the hearing his companions to whom he
would turn and wink hard when master simon
had passed
the harmony the day however had nearly
at one time been interrupted by the appearance
 the radical on the ground with two or three
 his disciples he soon got engaged in argument
in the very thick the throng above
which i could hear his voice and now and then
see his meagre hand half a mile out the
sleeve elevated in the air in violent gesticulation
and flourishing a pamphlet by way truncheon
he was decrying these idle nonsensical amusements
in times public distress when it was
every one's business to think other matters
 mayday
and to be miserable the honest village logicians
could make no stand against him especially
as he was seconded by his proselytes when to
their great joy master simon and the general
got embroiled in the discussion i saw that the
former rather entered into it with an ill grace
from which i was persuaded that he must before
this have had a brush with the radical but the
general was too loyal to suffer such talk in his
hearing and thought no doubt that a look and
a word from a gentleman would be sufficient to
shut up so shabby an orator the latter however
was no respecter persons but rather
seemed to exult in having such important antagonists
he talked with greater volubility than
ever and soon drowned them in declamation on
the subject taxes poor's rates and the national
debt master simon endeavoured to
brush along in his usual excursive manner which
had always answered amazingly well with the
villagers but the radical was one those pestilent
fellows that pin a man down to facts and
indeed he had two or three pamphlets in his
mayday 
pocket to support every thing he advanced by
printed documents in a word the two worthies
from the hall were completely dumbfounded
and this too in the presence several master
simon's staunch admirers who had always
looked up to him as infallible i do not know
how he and the general would have managed to
draw their forces decently from the field had
there not been a match grinning through a
horsecollar announced whereupon the radical
retired with great expression contempt and as
soon as his back was turned the argument was
carried against him all hollow
in the latter part the day the ladies from
the hall paid a visit to the green the fair
julia made her appearance leaning on her lover's
arm and looking extremely pale and
interesting as she is a great favourite in
the village where she has been known from
childhood and as her late accident had been
much talked about the sight her caused very
manifest delight and some the old women 
the village blessed her sweet face as she passed
vol 
 mayday
while they were walking about i noticed the
little schoolmaster in earnest conversation with
the young girl that represented the queen 
may evidently endeavouring to spirit her up to
some formidable undertaking at length as the
party from the hall approached her bower she
came forth faltering at every step until she
reached the spot where the fair julia stood between
her lover and lady lillycraft the little
queen then took the chaplet flowers from
her head and attempted to put it on that the
bride elect but the confusion both was so
great that the wreath would have fallen to the
ground had not the officer caught it and
laughing placed it upon the blushing brows 
his mistress there was something charming
in the very embarrassment these two young
creatures both so beautiful yet so different in
their kinds beauty master simon told me
afterwards that the queen may was to have
spoken a few verses which the schoolmaster had
written for her but that she had neither wit to
understand nor memory to recollect them
mayday 
besides added he between you and i she
murders the king's english abominably so
she has acted the part a wise woman in
holding her tongue and trusting to her pretty
face
among the other characters from the hall
was mrs hannah my lady lillycraft's gentlewoman
 to my surprise she was escorted by
old christy the huntsman and followed by his
ghost a greyhound but i find they are very
old acquaintances being drawn together by
some sympathy disposition mrs hannah
moved about with starched dignity among the
rustics who drew back from her with more awe
than they did from her mistress her mouth
seemed shut as with a clasp excepting that i
now and then heard the word fellows escape
from between her lips as she got accidentally
jostled in the crowd
but there was one other heart present that did
not enter into the merriment the scene which
was that the simple phoebe wilkins the
housekeeper's niece the poor girl has 

tinned to pine and whine for some time past
in consequence the obstinate coldness her
lover never was a little flirtation more severely
punished she appeared this day on the green
gallant by a smart servant out livery and
had evidently resolved to try the hazardous experiment
 awakening the jealousy her lover
she was dressed out in her very best affected
an air great gayety talked loud and girlishly
and laughed when there was nothing to laugh at
there was however an aching heavy heart in
the poor baggage's bosom under all this levity
i saw her eye in the midst her mirth turn
with an anxious expression every now and then
in quest her reckless swain and her cheek
turned pale and her fictitious gayety vanished
on his paying his rustic homage to the little
mayday queen
my attention was now diverted by a fresh stir
and bustle music was heard at a distance 
a banner was seen advancing up the road preceded
by a rustic band playing something like
a march and followed by a sturdy throng the
mayday 
chivalry a neighbouring and rival village
no sooner had they reached the green than they
challenged the heroes the day to new trials 
strength and activity several gymnastic contests
ensued for the honour the respective
villages in the course these exercises young
tibbets and the champion the adverse party
had an obstinate match at wrestling they
tugged and strained and panted without either
getting the mastery until both came to the
ground and rolled upon the green
just then the disconsolate phoebe came by
she saw her recreant lover in fierce contest as
she thought and in danger in a moment pride
pique and coquetry were forgotten she darted
into the ring seized upon the rival champion by
the hair and was on the point wreaking on
him her puny vengeance when a buxom strapping
country lass the sweetheart the prostrate
swain pounced upon her like a hawk and would
have stripped her her fine plumage in an instant
had she not been seized in her turn
a complete tumult ensued the chivalry 
 mayday
the two villages became embroiled blows
began to be dealt and sticks to be flourished
phoebe was carried off from the field in hysterics
in vain did the sages the village interfere
i saw the sententious apothecary tumbled into
the dirt as he was endeavouring to spread the oil
 wisdom over this tempestuous sea passion
slingsbyby who is a great lover peace went
into the midst the throng as marshal the
day to put an to the commotion but was
speedily rent in twain and came out with his
garment hanging in two strips from his shoulders
 while the prodigal son dashed in with fury
to revenge the insult which his patron had sustained

the tumult thickened i caught glimpses 
the jockey cap old christy like the helmet 
a chieftain bobbing about in the midst the
scuffle while mistress hannah separated from
her doughty protector was squalling and striking
at right and left with a faded parasol being tossed
and tousled about by the crowd in such wise
as was never maiden gentlewoman before
mayday 
at length i beheld old ready money jack
making his way into the very thickest the
throng tearing it as it were apart and enforcing
peace et armis it was surprising to seethe
sudden quiet that ensued the storm settled
down into tranquillity the parties having no
real grounds hostility became readily pacified
and in fact were a little at a loss to know why
they had got by the ears the schoolmaster
was pinned together again by his wife mrs
hannah drew on one side to plume her rumpled
feathers and then swept back again to the hall
ten times more bitter against mankind than ever
the tibbets family alone seemed slow in recovering
from the agitation the scene young
jack was evidently very much moved by the heroism
 the unlucky phoebe his mother
who had been summoned to the field action
by news the affray was in a sad panic and
had need all her management to keep him
from following his mistress and having a perfect
reconciliation
 mayday
what heightened the alarm and perplexity 
the good managing dame was that the matter
had aroused the slow apprehension old
ready money himself who was very much
struck by the intrepid interference so pretty
and delicate a girl and was sadly puzzled to understand
the meaning the violent agitation in
his family
when all this came to the ears the squire
he was grievously scandalized that his mayday
fete should have been disgraced by such a brawl
he ordered phoebe to appear before him but the
girl was so frightened and distressed that she
appeared sobbing and trembling and could make
no answer to his questions
lady lillycraft who had understood there
was an affair the heart at the bottom this
distress immediately took the girl into great
favour and protection and made her peace with
the squire
this was the only thing that disturbed the harmony
 the day if we except the discomfiture
 master simon and the general by the radical
matday 
upon the whole therefore the squire had very
fair reason to be satisfied that he had rode his
hobby throughout the day without any other
molestation
the reader learned in these matters will perceive
that all this was but a faint shadow the
once gay and fanciful rites may the peasantry
have lost the proper feeling for these rites
and have grown almost as strange to them as the
boors la marcia were to the customs 
chivalry in the days the valorous don quixote
indeed i considered it a proof the discretion
with which the squire rides his hobby
that he had not pushed the thing any farther
nor attempted to revive many obsolete usages 
the day which in the present matteroffact
times would appear affected and absurd i must
say however though i do it under the rose that
the general brawl in which this festival had nearly
terminated has made me doubt whether these
rural customs the good old times were
always so very loving and innocent as we are
apt to fancy them and whether the peasantry
vol 
 mayday
in those times were really so arcadian as they
have been fondly represented i begin to fear
those days were never airy dreams
sat for the picture and the poet's hand
imparting substance to an empty shade
impos'd a gay delirium for a truth
grant it i still must envy them an age
that favoured such a dream
the manuscript
yesterday was a day quiet and repose
after the bustle mayday during the morning
i joined the ladies in a small sitting room
the windows which came down to the floor
and opened upon a terrace the garden which
was set out with delicate shrubs and flowers
the soft sunshine that fell into the room through
the branches trees that overhung the windows
 the sweet smell the flowers and the
singing the birds seemed to produce a pleasing
yet calming effect on the whole party for
some time elapsed without any one speaking
lady lillycraft and miss templeton were
sitting by an elegant work table near one the
windows occupied with some pretty ladylike
work the captain was on a stool at his mistress
feet looking over some music and poor
 the manuscript
phoebe wilkins who has always been a kind 
pet among the ladies but who has risen vastly in
favour with lady lillycraft in consequence 
some tender confessions sat in one corner with
swoln eyes working pensively at some the
fair julia's wedding ornaments the silence
was interrupted by her ladyship who suddenly
proposed a task to the captain i am in your
debt said she for that tale you read to us the
other day i will now furnish one in return if
you'll read it and it is just suited to this sweet
may morning for it is all about love 
the proposition seemed to delight every one
present the captain smiled assent her ladyship
rang for her page in green and despatched
him to her room for the manuscript
as the captain said she gave us an account
 the author his story it is but right
i should give one mine it was written by
the parson the parish where i reside a
thin elderly man a delicate constitution but
positively one the most charming men that
ever lived he lost his wife a few years since
the manuscript 
one the sweetest women you ever saw he
has two sons whom he educates himself both
 whom already write delightful poetry this
parsonage is a lovely place close by the church 
all overrun with ivy and honeysuckles with
the sweetest flower garden about it for you
know our country clergymen are almost always
fond flowers and make their parsonages perfect
pictures
his living is a very good one and he is
very much beloved and does a great deal 
good in the neighbourhood and among the poor
and then such sermons as he preaches oh if
you could only hear one taken from a text in
solomon's songs all about love and marino
none the sweetest things you ever heard
he preaches it at least once a year in springtime
for he knows i am fond it
he always dines with me on sundays and
often brings rne some the sweetest pieces 
poetry all about the pleasures melancholy
and such subjects that make me cry so you
can't think
 the manuscript
i wish he would publish i think he has
some things as sweet as any thing in moore or
lord byron
he fell into very ill health some time ago
and was advised to go to the continent and i
gave him no peace until he went and promised
to take care his two boys until he returned
he was gone for above a year and was quite
restored when he came back he sent me the
tale i'm going to show you oh here it is said
she as the page put in her hands a beautiful
box satin wood she unlocked it and from
among several parcels notes on embossed paper
cards charades and copies verses
she drew out a crimson velvet case that smelt
very much perfumes
from this she took a manuscript daintily written
on giltedged vellum paper and stitched
with a light blue ribband this she handed to
the captain who read the following tale which
i have procured for the satisfaction the reader
annette delamere
oh wander no more on the storm beaten shore
nor heed the loud whistling gale 
nor strain thy sad eye to where sea meets with sky
in search thy true lover's sail
anon
in the course a tour that i once made in

lower normandy i remained for a day or two
at the old town honfleur which standgrnear
the mouth the seine it was the timgof a fete
and all the world was thronging in jtfoe evening
to dance at the fair held before the chapel our
lady grace as i like all kings isitcent
merrymaking i joined the throng
the chapel is situated on the top a high
hill or promontory from whence its bell maybe
heard at a distance by the mariner at night
it is said to have given the name to the port 
 annette delamere
 havre de grace which lies directly opposite
on the other side the seine the road up to
the chapel went in a zigzag course along the
brow the steep coast it was shaded by trees
from between which i had beautiful peeps at
the ancient towers moniteur below the varied
scenery the opposite shore the white
buildings havre in the distance and the
wide sea beyond the road was enlivened by
groups peasant girls in their bright crimson
dresses and tall caps and i found all the flower
 the neighbourhood assembled on the green
that crowns the summit the hill
xje chapel notre dame de grace is a
favourite resort the inhabitants honfleur
and its vicinity both for pleasure and devotion

at this littk chapel prayers are put up by the
mariners r ne p ort previous to their voyages
and by their friends during their absence and
votive offerings are hung about its walls in fulfilment
 vows made during times shipwreck
and disaster the chapel is surrounded by
trees over the portal is an image the virgin
annette delamere 
arid child with an inscription which struck meas
being quite poetical 
etoile de la mer priez pour nous
star the sea pray for us
on a level spot near the chapel under a grove
 noble trees the populace dance on fine summer
evenings and here are held frequent fairs
and fetes which assemble all the rustic beauty
 the loveliest parts lower normandy the
present was an occasion the kind booths
and tents were erected among the trees there
were the usual displays finery to tempt the
rural coquette wonderful shows to entice
the curious mountebanks were exerting their
eloquence jugglers and fortunetellers astonishing
the credulous while whole rows grotesque
saints in wood and waxwork were offered
for the purchase the pious
the fete had assembled in one view all the
picturesque costumes the pays d'ange and
the cote de caux i beheld tall stately caps and
vol it 
 annette delamere
trim bodies according to fashions which have
been handed down from mother to daughter for
centuries the exact counterparts those worn
in the time the conqueror and which surprised
me by their faithful resemblance to those
which i had seen in the old pictures froissart's
chronicles and in the paintings illuminated
manuscripts any one also that has been
in lower normandy must have remarked the
beauty the peasantry and that air native
elegance which prevails among them it is to
this country undoubtedly that the english owe
their good looks it was from hence that the
bright carnation the fine blue eye the light auburn
hair passed over to england in the train
 the conqueror and filled the land with beauty
the scene before me was perfectly enchanting
the assemblage so many fresh and
blooming faces the gay groups in fanciful
dresses some dancing on the green others
strolling about or seated on the grass the fine
clumps trees in the foreground bordering the
annette delamere 
brow this airy height and the broad green
sea sleeping in summer tranquillity in the distance

whilst i was regarding this animated picture
i was struck with the appearance a beautiful
girl who passed through the crowd without
seeming to take any interest in their amusements
she was slender and delicate in her form she
had not the bloom upon her cheek that is usual
among the peasantry normandy and her
blue eyes had a singular and melancholy expression
she was accompanied by a venerable
looking man whom i presumed to be her father
there was a whisper among the bystanders and
a wistful look after her as she passed the young
men touched their hats and some the children
followed her at a little distance watching her
movements she approached the edge the
hill where there is a little platform from whence
the people honfleur look out for the approach
 vessels here she stood for some time gazing
on the sea and waving her handkerchief though
there was nothing to be seen but two or three
 annette delamere
fishing boats far below like mere specks on the
bosom the distant ocean
these circumstances excited my curiosity and
i made some inquiries about her which were
answered with readiness and intelligence by a
priest the neighbouring chapel our conversation
drew together several the bystanders
each whom had something to communicate
and from them all i gathered the following particulars

annette delarbre was the only daughter 
one the higher order farmers or small proprietors
as they are called who lived at pont
l'eveque a pleasant village not far from honfleur
in that rich pastoral part lower normandy
called the pays d'ange annette was
the pride and delight her parents and was
brought up with the fondest indulgence she
was gay tender petulant and susceptible all
her feelings were quick and ardent and having
never experienced contradiction or restraint she
was little practised in selfcontrol nothing but
annette delamere 
the native goodness her heart kept her from
running continually into error
even while a child her susceptibility was
evinced in an attachment which she formed to a
playmate eugene la forge the only son a
widow who lived in the neighbourhood their
childish love was an epitome maturer passion 
it had its caprices and jealousies and quarrels
and reconciliations it was assuming something
 a graver character as annette entered her fifteenth
and eugene his nineteenth year when
he was suddenly carried off to the army by the
conscription it was a heavy blow to his widowed
mother for he was her only pride and comfort
 but it was one those sudden bereavements
which mothers were perpetually doomed
to feel in france during the time that continual
and bloody wars were incessantly draining her
youth it was a temporary affliction also to annette
to lose her lover with tender embraces
half childish half womanish she parted from
him the tears streamed from her blue eyes as
she bound a long braid her fair hair round his
 annette delamere
wrist but the smiles still broke through for
she was yet too young to feel how serious a thing
is separation and how many chances there are
when parting in this wide world against our ever
meeting again
weeks months years flew by annette increased
in beauty as she increased in years and
was the reigning belle the neighbourhood her
time passed innocently and happily her father
was a man some consequence in the rural
community and his house was the resort the
gayest the village annette held a kind rural
court she was always surrounded by companions
 her own age among whom she shone
unrivalled much their time was past in
making lace the prevalent manufacture the
neighbourhood as they sat at this delicate and
feminine labour the merry tale and sprightly
song went round none laughed with a lighter
heart than annette and if she sang her voice
was perfect melody their evenings were enlivened
by the dance or by those pleasant social
games so prevalent among the french and
annette delamere 
when she appeared at the village ball on sunday
evenings she was the theme universal admiration

as she was a rural heiress she did not want
for suitors many advantageous offers were
made her but she refused them all she laughed
at the pretended pangs her admirers and
triumphed over them with the caprice buoyant
youth and conscious beauty with all her
apparent levity however could any one have
read the story her heart they might have traced
in it some fond remembrance her early
playmate not so deeply graven as to be painful 
but too deep to be easily obliterated and they
might have noticed amidst all her gayety the
tenderness that marked her manner towards the
mother eugene she would often steal away
from her youthful companions and their amusements
to pass whole days with the good widow 
listening to her fond talk about her boy and
blushing with secret pleasure when his letters
were read at finding herself a constant theme
 recollection and inquiry
 annette delamere
at length the sudden return peice which
sent many a warrior to his native cottage brought
back eugene a young sunburnt soldier to the
village i need not say how rapturously his return
was greeted by his mother who saw in
him the pride and staff her old age he had
risen in the service by his merit but brought
away little from the wars excepting a soldierlike
air a gallant name and a scar across the
forehead he brought back however a nature
unspoiled by the camp he was frank open
generous and ardent his heart was quick and
kind in its impulses and was perhaps a little
softer from having suffered it was full tenderness
for annette he had received frequent
accounts her from his mother and the mention
 her kindness to his lonely parent had
rendered ner doubly dear to him he had been
wounded he had been a prisoner he had been
in various troubles but he had always preserved
the braid her hair which she had bound round
his arm it had been a kind talisman to
him when wounded and in prison he had many
annette delamere 
a time looked upon it as he lay on the hard
ground and the thought that he might one day
see annette again and the fair fields about his
native village had cheered his heart and enabled
him to bear up against every hardship
he had left anne te almost a child he found
her a blooming woman if he had loved her
before he now adored her annette was equally
struck with the improvement which time had
made in her lover she noticed with secret admiration
his superiority to the other young men
 the village the frank lofty military air that
distinguished him from all the rest at their rural
gatherings the more she saw him the more
her light playful fondness former years deepened
into ardent and powerful affection but
annette was a rural belle she had tasted the
sweets dominion and had been rendered
wilful and capricious by constant indulgence at
home and admiration abroad she was conscious
 her power over eugene and delighted
in exercising it she sometimes treated him
with petulant caprice enjoying the pain which
vol 
 annette delamere
she inflicted by her frowns from the idea how
soon she would chace it away again by her
smiles she took a pleasure in alarming his
fears by affecting a temporary preference to someone
or other his rivals and then would delight
in allaying them by an ample measure 
returning kindness perhaps there was some
degree vanity gratified by all this it might bea
matter triumph to show her absolute power
over the young soldier who was the universal
object female admiration eugene however
was too serious and ardent a nature to be
trifled with he loved too fervently not to be
filled with doubt he saw annette surrounded
by admirers and full animation the gayest
among the gay at all their rural festivities
and apparently most gay when he was most
dejected every one saw through this caprice
but himself every one saw that in reality she
doated on him but eugene alone suspected the
sincerity her affection for some time he
bore this coquetry with secret impatience and
distrust but his feelings grew sore and irritable
annette delamere 
and overcame his self command a slight misunderstanding
took place a quarrel ensued
annette unaccustomed to be thwarted and contradicted
and full the insolence youthful
beauty assumed an air disdain she refused
all explanations to her lover and they parted in
anger that very evening eugene saw her full
 gayety dancing with one his rivals and
as her eye caught his his fixed on her with unfeigned
distress it sparkled with more than usual
vivacity it was a finishing blow to his hopes
already so much impaired by secret distrust
pride and resentment both struggled in his breast 
and seemed to rouse his spirit to all its wonted
energy he retired from her presence with
the hasty determination never to see her again
a woman is more considerate in affairs 
love than man because love is more the study
and business her life annette soon repented
 her indiscretion she felt that she had used
her lover unkindly she felt that she had trifled
with his sincere and generous nature and then
he looked so handsome when he parted after
 annette delamere
their quarrel his fine features lighted up by indignation
she had intended making up with him
at the evening dance but his sudden departure
prevented her she now promised herself that
when next they met she would amply repay
him by the sweets a perfect reconciliation
and that thenceforward she would never never
tease him more 
that promise was not to be fulfilled day
after day passed but eugene did not make his
appearance sunday evening came the usual
time when all the gayety the village assembled
but eugene was not there she inquired
after him he had left the village she now
became alarmed and forgetting all coyness and
affected indifference called on eugene's mother
for an explanation she found her full affliction
and learnt with surprise and consternation
that eugene had gone to sea
while his feelings were yet smarting with
her affected disdain and his heart a prey to alternate
indignation and despair he had suddenly
embraced an invitation which had repeatedly
annette delamere 
been made him by a relative who was fitting
out a ship from the port honfleur and who
wished him to be the companion his voyage
absence appeared to him the only cure for his
unlucky passion and in the temporary transports
 his feelings there was something gratifying
in the idea having half the world intervene
between them the hurry necessary for
his departure left no time for cool reflection it
rendered him deaf to the remonstrances his
afflicted mother he hastened to honfleur justin
time to make the needful preparations for the
voyage and the first news that annette received
 this sudden determination was a letter delivered
by his mother returning her pledges 
affection particularly the long treasured braid
 her hair and bidding her a last farewell in
terms more full sorrow and tenderness than
upbraiding
this was the first stroke real anguish that
annette had ever received and it overcame her
 
the vivacity her spirits were apt to hurry her
to extremes she for a time gave way to ungo
 annette delamere
enable transports affliction and remorse and
discovered by her violent exclamations the real
ardour her affection the thought occurred
to her that the ship might not yet have sailed 
she seized on the hope with eagerness and hastened
with her father to honfleur the ship
had sailed that very morning from the heights
above the town she saw it lessening to a speck
on the broad bosom the ocean and before
evening the white sail had faded from her sight
she turned full anguish to the neighbouring
chapel our lady grace and throwing
herself on the pavement poured out prayers and
tears for the safe return her lover
when she returned home the cheerfulness 
her spirits was at an she looked back with
remorse and self upbraiding at her past caprices 
she turned with distaste from the adulation 
her admirers and had no longer any relish for
the amusements the village with humiliation
and diffidence she sought the widowed mother
 eugene but was received by her with
an overflowing heart for she only beheld in her
annette delamere 
one who could sympathize in her doating fondness
for her son it seemed some alleviation 
her remorse to sit by the mother all day to
study her wants to beguile her heavy hours 
to hang about her with the caressing endearments
 a daughter and to seek by every means if possible
to supply the place the son whom she
reproached herself with having driven away
in the mean time the ship made a prosperous
voyage to her destined port eugene's mother
received a letter from him in which he lamented
the precipitancy his departure the voyage
had given him time for sober reflection if annette
had been unkind to him he ought not to
have forgotten what was due to his mother who
was now advanced in years he accused himself
 selfishness in only listening to the suggestions
 his own inconsiderate passions he
promised to return with the ship to make his
mind up to his disappointment and to think 
nothing but making iii mother happy and
when he does return said annette clasping her
 annette delamere
hands with transport it shall not be tiny fault
if he ever leaves us again 
the time approached for the ship's return
she was daily expected when the weather became
dreadfully tempestuous day after day
brought news vessels foundered or driven on
shore and the sea coast was strewed with
wrecks intelligence was received the looked
for ship having been seen dismasted in a violent
storm and the greatest fears were entertained for
her safety
annette never left the side eugene's mother
she watched every change her countenance
with painful solicitude and endeavoured
to cheer her with hopes while her own mind
was racked by anxiety she tasked her efforts
to be gay but it was a forced and unnatural
gayety a sigh from the mother would completely
check it and when she could no longer
restrain the rising tears she would hurry away
and pour out her agony in secret
every anxious look every anxious inquiry 
the mother whenever a door opened or a strange
annette delamere 
face appeared was an arrow to her soul she
considered every disappointment as a pang her
own infliction and her heart sickened under the
careworn expression the maternal eye at
length this suspense became insupportable she
left the village and hastened to honfleur hoping
every hour every moment to receive some tidings
 her lover she paced the pier and wearied
the seamen the port with her inquiries she
made a daily pilgrimage to the chapel our
lady grace hung votive garlands on the
wall and passed hours either kneeling before
the altar or looking out from the brow the
hill upon the angry sea
at length word was brought that the long
wished for vessel was in sight she was seen
standing into the mouth the seine shattered
and crippled bearing marks having been sadly
tempest tost there was a general joy diffused
by her return and there was not a brighter eye
nor a lighter heart than annette's in the little
port honfleur the ship came to anchor in
the river and shortly after a boat put off for the
vol 
annette delamere
shore the populace crowded down to the
pier head to welcome it annette stood blushing
and smiling and trembling and weeping 
for a thousand painfully pleasing emotions agitated
her breast at the thoughts the meeting
and the reconciliation that was about to take
place her heart throbbed to pour itself out
and atone to her gallant lover for all its errors
her agitation increased as the boat drew near 
until it became distressing at one moment
she placed herself in a conspicuous place where
she might at once catch his view and surprize
him by her welcome the next moment she
shrunk among the throng trembling and faint
and gasping with her emotions
it was almost a relief to her when she perceived
that her lover was not in the boat she
presumed that he had remained on board to prepare
for his return home and she felt as if the
delay would enable her to gather more selfpos
session for the meeting as the boat was nearing
the shore there were a thousand inquiries
made and laconic answers returned at length
annette delamere 
annette heard some one inquire after her lover
her heart palpitated there was a moment's
pause the reply was brief but awful he had
been washed from the deck with two the
crew in the midst a stormy night when it
was impossible to render any assistance a
piercing shriek broke from among the crowd
and annette had nearly fallen into the waves
the sudden revulsion feelings after such
wearing anxiety was too much for her frame
she was carried home senseless her life was
for some time despaired and it was months
before she recovered her health but she never
had perfectly recovered her mind it still remained
unsettled with respect to her lover's
fate
the subject continued my informer is
never mentioned in her hearing but she sometimes
speaks it and it seems as though there
were some vague train impressions in her
mind in which hope and fear are strangely
mingled some imperfect idea his shipwreck
and yet some expectation his return
annette delamere
her parents have tried every means to cheer
her up and to banish these gloomy images from
her thoughts they assemble round her the
young companions in whose society she used to
delight and they will work and chat and sing
and laugh as formerly but she will sit silently
among them and will sometimes weep in the
midst their gayety and if spoken to will
make no reply but look up with streaming eyes
and sing a dismal little song which she has learnt
somewhere about a shipwreck it makes everyone's
heart ache to see her in this way for she
used to be the happiest creature in the village
she passes the greater part the time with
eugene's mother whose only consolation is her
society and who doats on her with a mother's
tenderness she is the only one that has perfect
influence over annette in every mood the
poor girl seems as formerly to make an effort to
be cheerful in her company but will sometimes
gaze upon her with the most piteous look and
then put back her cap and kiss her gray hairs
and fall on her neck and weep
annette delamere 
 she is not always melancholy however 
she has occasional intervals when she will be
bright and animated for days together but there
is a degree wildness attending these fits 
gayety that prevents their yielding any encouragement
to her friends at such times she will
arrange her room which is all covered with pictures
 ships and legends saints and will
wreath a white chaplet as if for a wedding and
prepare wedding ornaments she will listen
anxiously at the door and look frequently at the
window as if expecting some one s arrival it
is supposed that at such times she is looking for
her lover's return but as no one touches upon
the theme or mentions his name in her presence
the current her thoughts are for the most part
merely conjecture
now and then she will rriake a pilgrimage
to the chapel notre dame de grace where
she will pray for hours at the altar and decorate
the images with wreaths that she has woven or
will wave her handkerchief from the terrace
 annette delamere
as you have seen if there is any vessel to be
seen in the distance
nearly two years he informed me had
now elapsed without effacing from her mind
this singular taint insanity still her friends
hoped it might gradually wear away they
had at one time removed her to a distant part 
the country in hopes that absence from the scenes
connected with her story might have a salutary
effect but when her periodical melancholy returned
she became more restless and wretched
than usual and privately escaping from her
friends set out on foot without knowing the
road on one her pilgrimages to the chapel
this little story entirely drew my attention
from the gay scene the fete and fixed it upon
the beautiful annette while she was yet standing
on the terrace the vesper bell was rung from
the neighbouring chapel she listened for a moment
and then drawing a small rosary from her
bosom walked in that direction several the
peasantry followed her in silence and i felt too
much interested not to do the same
annette delamere 
the chapel as i said before is in the midst 
a grove on the high promontory the inside is
hung round with miniature ships and rude paintings
 wrecks and perils at sea and providential
deliverance the votive offerings captains and
crews that have been saved on entering annette
paused for a moment before a picture the
virgin which i observed had recently been decorated
with a wreath artificial flowers when
she reached the middle the chapel she knelt
down and those who followed her involuntarily
did the same at a little distance the evening
sun shone softly through the chequered grove into
one window the chapel a perfect stillness
reigned within and this stillness was the more
impressive contrasted with the distant sound 
music and merriment the fair
i could not take my eyes off from the poor
suppliant her lips moved as she told her beads 
but her prayers were breathed in silence it
might have been mere fancy excited by the scene
that as she raised her eyes to heaven i thought
they had an expression truly seraphic but i am
 annette delamere
easily affected by female beauty and there was
something in this mixture love devotion and
partial insanity that was inexpressibly touching

as the poor girl left the chapel there was a
sweet serenity in her looks and i was told that
she w r ould now return home and in all probability
be calm and cheerful for days and even
weeks in which time it was supposed that hope
predominated in her mental malady and that
when the dark side her mind as her friends
called it was about to turn up it would be known
by her neglecting her distaff or her lace singing
plaintive songs and weeping in silence
she passed on from the chapel without noticing
the fete but smiling and speaking to many
as she passed i followed her with my eye as
she descended the winding road towards honfleur
leaning on her father's arm heaven
thought i has ever its store balms for the
hurt mind and wounded spirit and may in time
raise up this broken flower to be once more the
pride and joy the valley the very delusion
annette delamere 
in which the poor girl walks may be one 
those mists kindly diffused by providence over
the regions thought when they become too
fruitful misery the veil may gradually be
raised which obscures the horizon her mind
as she is enabled steadily and calmly to contemplate
the sorrows at present hidden in mercy
from her view

part 
on my return from paris about a year afterwards
i turned off from the beaten route at
rouen to revisit some the most striking scenes
 lower normandy has ing passed through
the lovely country the pays d'ange i reached
honfleur on a fine afternoon intending to
cross to havre the next morning and embark for
england as i had no other way passing
the evening i strolled up the hill to enjoy the
fine prospect from the chapel notre dame de
grace and while there i thought inquiring
after the fate poor annette delarbre the
priest who had told me her story was officiating
at vespers after which i accosted him and learnt
from him the remaining circumstances
he told me that from the time i had seen herat
the chapel her disorder took a sudden turn for
the worse and her health rapidly declined her
cheerful intervals became shorter and less free
delamere 
quest and attended with more incoherency she
grew languid silent and moody in her melancholy
 her form was wasted her looks pale
and disconsolate and it was feared she would
never recover she became impatient all
sounds gayety and was never so contented
as when eugene's mother was near her the
good woman watched over her with patient and
yearning solicitude and in seeking to beguile
her sorrows would half forget her own sometimes
as she sat looking upon her pallid face the
tears would fill her eyes which when annette
perceived she would anxiously wipe them away
and tell her not to grieve for that eugene would
soon return and then she would affect a forced
gayety as in former times and sing a lively air 
but a sudden recollection would come over her
and she would burst into tears hang on the poor
mother's neck and entreat her not to curse her
for having destroyed her son
just at this time to the astonishment everyone
news was received eugene who it appeared
was still living when almost drowned
 annette delamere
he had fortunately seized upon a spar which had
been washed from the ship's deck finding
himself nearly exhausted he had fastened himself
to it and floated for a day and a night until all
sense had left him on recovering he had found
himself on board a vessel bound to india but so
ill as not to move without assistance his health
had continued precarious throughout the voyage
on arriving in india he had experienced many
vicissitudes and had been transferred from ship
to ship and hospital to hospital his constitution
had enabled him to struggle through every
hardship and he was now in a distant port
waiting only for the sailing a ship to return
home
great caution was necessary in imparting
these tidings to the mother and even then she
was nearly overcome by the transports her
joy but how to impart them to annette was a
matter still greater perplexity her state 
mind had been so morbid she had been subject to
such violent changes and the cause her derangement
had been such an inconsolable
annette delamere 
and hopeless kind that her friends had always
forbore to tamper with her feelings they had
never even hinted at the subject her griefs 
nor encouraged the theme when she adverted toit
 but had passed it over in silence hoping that
time would gradually wear the traces it from
her recollection or at least would render them
less painful they now felt at a loss how to undeceive
her even in her misery lest the sudden
recurrence happiness might confirm the estrangement
 her reason or might overpower
her enfeebled frame they ventured however
to probe those wounds which they formerly did
not dare to touch for they now had the balm to
pour into them they led the conversation to
those topics which they had hitherto shunned 
and endeavoured to ascertain the current her
thoughts in those varying moods that had formerly
perplexed them they found however
that her mind was even more affected than they
had imagined all her ideas were confused and
wandering her bright and cheerful moods
which now grew seldom than ever were all
 annette delamere
the effects mental delusion at such times
she had no recollection her lover's having
been in danger but was only anticipating his
arrival when the winter has passed away
said she and the trees put on their blossoms
and the swallow comes back over the sea he
will return when she was drooping and desponding
it was in vain to remind her what she
had said in her gayer moments and to assure
her that eugene would indeed return shortly
she wept on in silence and appeared insensible to
their words but at times her agitation became
violent when she would upbraid herself with
having driven eugene from his mother and
brought sorrow on her gray hairs her mind
admitted but one leading idea at a time which
nothing could divert or efface or if they ever
succeeded in interrupting the current her fancy
it only became the more incoherent and increased
the feverishness that preyed upon both mind
and body her friends felt more alarm for her
than ever for they feared that her senses were
annette delamere 
irrecoverably gone and her constitution completely
undermined
in the mean time eugene returned to the village
he was violently affected when the story
 annette was told him with bitterness 
heart he upbraided his own rashness and infatuation
that had hurried him away from her and
accused himself as the author all her woes
his mother would describe to him all the anguish
and remorse poor annette the tenderness
with which she clung to her and endeavoured
even in the midst her insanity to
console her for the loss her son and the
touching expressions affection that were
mingled with her most incoherent wanderings
 thought until his feelings would be wound
up to agony and he would intreat her to desist
from the recital they did not dare as yet to
bring him into annette's sight but he was permitted
to see her when she was sleeping the
tears streamed down his sunburnt cheeks as he
contemplated the ravages which grief and malady
had made and his heart swelled almost to
 annette delamere
breaking as he beheld round her neck the very
braid hair which she once gave him in token
 girlish affection and which he had returned
to her in anger
at length the physician that attended her determined
to adventure upon an experiment to
take advantage one those cheerful moods
when her mind was visited by hope and to endeavour
to engraft as it were the reality upon
the delusions her fancy these moods had
now become very rare for nature was sinking
under the continual pressure her mental
malady and the principle reaction was daily
growing weaker every effort was tried to
bring on a cheerful interval the kind several
 her most favourite companions were kept
continually about her they chatted gayly 
they laughed and sang and danced but annette
reclined with languid frame and hollow
eye and took no part in their gayety at length
the winter was gone the trees put forth their
leaves the swallow began to build in the eaves
 the house and the robin and wren piped all
annette delamere 
day beneath the window annette's spirits gradually
revived she began to deck her person
with unusual care and bringing forth a basket 
artificial flowers she went to work to wreathe
a bridal chaplet white roses her companions
asked her why she prepared the chaplet
 what said she with a smile have
you not noticed the trees putting on their wedding
dresses blossoms has not the swallow
flown back over the sea do you not know that
the time is come for eugene to return that he
will be home tomorrow and that on sunday
we are to be married 
her words were reported to the physician
and he seized on them at once he directed
that her idea should be encouraged and acted
upon her words were echoed through the
house every one talked the return eugene
as a matter course they congratulated
her upon her approaching happiness and assisted
her in her preparations the next morning
the same theme was resumed she was dressed
out to receive her lover every bosom fluttered
vol n 
 annette delamere
with anxiety a cabriolet drove into the village
 eugene is coming was the cry she
saw him alight at the door and rushed with a
shriek into his arms
her friends trembled for the result this
critical experiment but she did not sink under
it for her fancy had prepared her for his return
she was as one in a dream to whom a tide 
unlocked for prosperity that would have overwhelmed
his waking reason seems but the natural
current circumstances her conversation
however showed that her senses were
wandering there was an absolute forgetfulness
 all past sorrow a wild and feverish
gayety that at times was incoherent
the next morning she awoke languid and exhausted
all the occurrences the preceding
day had passed away from her mind as though
they had been the mere illusions her fancy
she rose melancholy and abstracted and as she
dressed herself was heard to sing one her
plaintive ballads when she entered the parlour
her eyes were swoln with weeping shea

annette delamere 
heard eugene's voice without and started she
passed her hand across her forehead and stood
musing like one endeavouring to recall a dream
eugene entered the room and advanced towards
her she looked at him with an eager searching
look murmured some indistinct words and before
he could reach her sunk upon the floor
she relapsed into a wild and unsettled state 
mind butnow that the first shock was over the
physician ordered that eugene should keep continually
in her sight sometimes she did not
know him at other times she would talk to him
as if he were going to sea and would implore
him not to part from her in anger and when he
was not present she would speak him as buried
in the ocean and would sit with clasped hands
looking upon the ground the picture despair

as the agitation her feelings subsided and
her frame recovered from the shock which it
had received she became more placid and coherent
eugene kept almost continually near her
he formed the real object round which her 
annette delamere
tered ideas once more gathered and which linked
them once mor with the realities life but
her changeful disorder now appeared to take a
new turn she became languid and inert and
would sit for hours silent and almost in a state 
lethargy if roused from this stupor it seemed
as if her mind would make some attempts to
follow up a train thought but soon became
confused she would regard every one that approached
her with an anxious and inquiring eye
that seemed continually to disappoint itself
sometimes as her lover sat holding her hand she
would look pensively in his face without saying
a word until his heart was overcome and after
these transient fits intellectual exertion she
would sink again into lethargy
by degrees this stupor increased her mind
appeared to have subsided into a stagnant and
almost deathlike calm for the greater part 
the time her eyes were closed her face almost
as fixed and passionless as that a
corpse she no longer took any notice 
surrounding objects there was an awfulness
annette delamere 
in this tranquillity that filled her friends with
apprehension the physician ordered that she
should be kept perfectly quiet or that if she
evinced any agitation she should be gently lulled
like a child by some favourite tune
she remained in this state for hours hardly
seeming to breathe and apparently sinking into
the sleep death her chamber was profoundly
still the attendants moved about it
with noiseless tread every thing was communicated
by signs and whispers her lover sat by
her side watching her with painful anxiety and
fearing that every breath which stole from her
pale lips would be the last
at length she heaved a deep sigh and from
some convulsive motions appeared to be troubled
in her sleep her agitation increased accompanied
by an indistinct moaning one 
her companions remembering the physician's instructions
endeavoured to lull her by singing
in a low voice a tender little air which was a
particular favourite annette's probably it
had some connection in her mind with her story 
 annette delamere
for every fond girl has some ditty the kind
linked in her thoughts with sweet and sad remembrances

as she sang the agitation annette subsided
a streak faint colour came into her
cheeks her eyelids became swoln with rising
tears w r which trembled there for a moment and
then stealing forth coursed down her pallid
cheek when the song was ended she opened
her eyes and looked about her as one awaking
in a strange place
oh eugene eugene said she it seems
as if i have had a long and dismal dream what
has happened and what has been the matter
with me 
the questions were embarrassing and before
they could be answered the physician who was
in the next room entered she took him by the
hand looked up in his face and made the same
inquiry he endeavoured to put her off with
some evasive answer no no cried she
i know i've been ill and i have been dreaming
strangely i thought eugene had left us and
annette delamere 
that he had gone to sea and that and that he
was drowned but he has been to sea added
she earnestly as recollection kept flashing
upon her and he has been wrecked and we
were all so wretched and he came home again
one bright morning and oh said she
pressing her hand against her forehead with a
sickly smile i see how it is all has not been
right here i begin to recollect but it is all
past now eugene is here and his mother is
happy and we shall never never part again
shall we eugene 
she sunk back in her chair exhausted the
tears streamed down her cheeks her companions
hovered round her not knowing what to
make this sudden dawn reason her lover
sobbed aloud she opened her eyes again and
looked upon them with an air the sweetest
acknowledgment you are all so good to me 
said she faintly
the physician drew the father aside your
daughter's mind is restored said he she is
sensible that she has been deranged she is
 annette delamere
growing conscious the past and conscious 
the present all that now remains is to keep
her calm and quiet until her health is reesta
blushed and then let her be married in god's
name 
the wedding took place said the good
priest but a short time since they were hereat
the last fete during their honey moon and a
handsomer and happier couple was not to be seen
as they danced under yonder trees the young
man his wife and mother now live on a fine
farm at pont l'eveque and that model a
ship which you see yonder with white flowers
wreathed round it is annette's offering thanks
to our lady grace for having listened to her
prayers and protected her lover in the hour 
peril
annette delamere 
the captain having finished there was a
momentary silence the tender hearted lady
lillycraft who knew the story by heart had led
the way in weeping and indeed had often begun
to shed tears before they had come to the
right place the fair julia was a little flurried
at the passage where wedding preparations were
mentioned but the auditor most affected was the
simple phoebe wilkins she had gradually
dropt her work in her lap and sat sobbing through
the latter part the story until towards the 
when the happy reverse had nearly produced
another scene hysterics go take this
case to my room again child said lady lillycraft
kindly and don't cry so much
i won't an't please your ladyship if i can
help it but i'm glad they made all up again
and were married
by the way the case this lovelorn damsel
begins to make some talk in the household esvol
n 
 annette delamere
specially among certain little ladies not far in
their teens whom she has made confidants
she is a great favourite with them all but
particularly so since she has confided to them
her love secrets
they enter into her concerns with all the
violent zeal and overwhelming sympathy with
which little boarding school ladies engage in the
politics a love affair i have noticed them
frequently clustering about her in private conferences
 or walking up and down the garden
terrace under my window listening to some long
and dolorous story her afflictions which
i could now and then distinguish the ever recurring
phrases says he and says she
i accidentally interrupted one these little
councils war when they were all huddled together
under a tree and seemed to be earnestly
considering some interesting document
the flutter at my approach showed that there
were some secrets under discussion and i observed
the disconsolate phoebe crumpling into
her bosom either a love letter or an old valentine
and brushing away the tears from her cheeks
annette delamere 
the girl is a good girl a soft melting nature
and shows her concern at the cruelty 
her lover only in tears and drooping looks but
with the little ladies who have espoused her
cause it sparkles up into fiery indignation and
i have noticed on sunday many a glance
darted at the pew the tibbets enough to
melt down the silver buttons on old ready mos
jacket
the c u l p r i t 
from fire from water and all things amiss
deliver the house an honest justice
the widow
the serenity the hall has been suddenly
interrupted by a very important occurrence in
the course this morning a posse villagers
was seen trooping up the avenue with boys
shouting in advance as it drew near we perceived
ready money jack tibbets striding
along wielding his cudgel in one hand and
with the other grasping the collar a tall fellow
whom on still nearer approach we recognised
for the redoubtable gipsy hero starlight
tom he was now however completely
the culprit 
cowed and crestfallen and his courage seemed
to have quailed in the iron gripe the lionhearted
jack
the whole gang gipsy women and children
came draggling in the rear some in tears others
making a violent clamour about the ears old
ready money who however trudged on in
silence with his prey heeding their abuse as little
as a hawk that has pounced upon a barn
door hero regards the outcries and cackling 
his whole feathered seraglio
he had passed through the village on his was
to the hall and course had made a great
sensation in that most excitable place where
every event is a matter gaze and gossip the
report had circulated like wildfire that old gibbets
had taken starlight tom prisoner the
ale drinkers forthwith abandoned the tap room
slingsbyby's school broke loose without waiting to
be dismissed and masters and boys swelled the
tide that came rolling at the heels old ready
money and his captive the uproar increased
as they approached the hall it aroused the
the culprit
whole garrison dogs and the crew hangers
on the great mastiff barked from the dog
house the stag hound and the greyhound and
the spaniel came barking from the hall door and
my lady lillycraft's little dogs barked from the
parlour windows i remarked however that
the gipsy dogs made no reply to all these menaces
and insults but crept close to the gang
looking round with a guilty poaching air and
now and then glancing up a dubious eye to their
owners which shows that the moral characters
even dogs may be ruined by bad company 
when the throng reached the front the
house they were brought to a halt by a kind 
advanced guard composed old christy the
gamekeeper and two or three servants the
house who had been brought out by the noise
the common herd the village fell back with
respect the boys were driven back by old
christy and his compeers while ready money
jack maintained his ground and his hold the
prisoner and was surrounded by the tailor the
schoolmaster and several other dignitaries the
the culprit
village and by the clamorous brood gipsies
who were neither to be silenced nor intimidated
by this time the whole household were brought
to the doors and windows and the squire to the
portal an audience was demanded by ready
money jack who had detected the prisoner in
the very act sheep stealing on his domains
and had borne him off to be examined before
the squire who is in the commission the
peace
a kind tribunal was immediately held in
the servant's hall a large chamber with a stone
floor and a long table in the centre at one 
 which just under an enormous clock was
placed the squire's chair justice while master
simon took his place at the table as clerk 
the court an attempt had been made by old
christy to keep out the gipsy gang but in vain 
and they with the village worthies and the
household half filled the hall the old housekeeper
and the butler were in a panic at this dangerous
irruption they hurried away all the
valuable things and portable articles that were at
 the culprit
hand and even kept a dragon watch on the gipsies
lest they should carry off the house clock or
the deal table
old christy and his faithful coadjutor the
gamekeeper acted as constables to guard the
prisoner and appeared to triumph in having at
last got this terrible nightwalking offender in
their clutches by the bye i am inclined to suspect
that the old huntsman bore some peevish
recollection having been handled rather roughly
by the gipsy in the chance medley affray 
mayday
silence was now commanded by master simon
but it was difficult to be enforced in such a mostly
assemblage there was a continual snarling
and yelping dogs and as fast as it was quelled
in one corner it broke out in another the
poor gipsy curs who like arrant thieves could
not hold up their heads in an honest house were
worried and insulted by the gentlemen dogs 
the establishment without offering to make resistance
 the very curs my lady lillycraft
bullied them with impunity
the culprit 
the examination was conducted with great
mildness and indulgence by the squire partly
from the kindness his nature and partly i
suspect because his heart yearned towards the
culprit who as i have before mentioned had
found great favour in his eyes from the skill he
had at various times displayed in archery morrice
dancing and other obsolete accomplishments
proofs however were too strong ready
money jack told his story in a straight forward
independent way nothing daunted by the presence
in which he found himself he had suffered
from various depredations on his sheepfold
and poultry yard and had at length kept watch
and caught the delinquent in the very act 
making off with a sheep on his shoulders
tibbets was repeatedly interrupted in the
course his testimony by the culprit's mother
a furious old beldame with an insufferable tongue
and who in fact was several times on the point
 flying at him tooth and nail the wife 
the prisoner whom i am told he does not beat
above half a dozen times a week completely in
vol 
 the culprit
treated lady lillycraft in her husband's behalf
by her tears and supplications and several the
other gipsy women were awakening strong sympathy
among the young girls and maid servants
in the back ground the pretty black eyed
gipsy girl whom i have mentioned on a former
occasion as the sybil that read the fortunes 
the general now endeavoured to wheedle that
doughty warrior into their interests and even
made some approaches to her old acquaintance
master simon but was repelled by the latter
with all the dignity office having assumed a
gravity and importance suitable to the occasion
i was a little surprised at first to find honest
slingsbyby the schoolmaster rather opposed to his
old crony tibbets and coming forward as a
kind advocate for the accused it seems that
he had taken compassion on the forlorn fortunes
 starlight tom arid had been trying his eloquence
in his favour the whole way from the village
but without effect during the examination
 ready money jack also slingsbyby had
stood like dejected pity at his side seeking
the culprit 
every now and then by a soft word to soothe any
exacerbation his ire or to qualify any harsh
expression he now ventured to make a few
observations to the squire in palliation the
delinquent's offences but poor slingsbyby spoke
more from the heart than the head and was evidently
actuated merely by a general sympathy
for any poor devil in trouble and a liberal toleration
for all kinds vagabond existence
the ladies too large and small with the
kindheartedness the sex were zealous on the
side mercy and interceded strenuously with
the squire insomuch that the prisoner finding
himself unexpectedly surrounded by active
friends once more reared his crest and seemed
disposed for a time to put on the airs injured
innocence the squire however with all his
benevolence heart and his lurking weakness
towards the prisoner was too conscientious
to swerve from the strict path justice there
was abundant concurring testimony that made
the proof guilt incontrovertible and starlight
tom's mittimus was made out accordingly
 the culprit
the sympathy the ladies was now greater
than ever they even made some attempts to
mollify the ire ready money jack but that
sturdy potentate had been too much incensed
by the repeated incursions that had been made
into his territories by the predatory band 
starlight tom and he was resolved he said
to drive the garment reptiles out the
neighbourhood to avoid all further importunities
as soon as the mittimus was made out
he girded up his loins and strode back to his
seat empire accompanied by his interceding
friend slingsbyby and followed by a detachment
 the gipsy gang who hung on his rear assailing
him with mingled prayers and declarations

the question now was how to dispose the
prisoner a matter great moment in this
peaceful establishment where so formidable a
character as starlight torn was like a hawk
entrapped in a dove cote as the hubbub and
examination had occupied a considerable time
it was too late in the day to send him to the
the culprit 
county prison and that the village was sadly
out repair from long want occupation
old christy who took great interest in the affair
proposed that the culprit should be committed
for the night to an upper loft a kind tower
in one the outhouses where he and the
gamekeeper would mount guard after much
deliberation this measure was adopted the premises
in question were examined and made secure
and christy and his trusty ally the one
armed with a fowling piece the other with an
ancient blunderbuss turned out as sentries to
keep watch over this donjon keep
such is the momentous affair that has just
taken place and it is an event too great moment
in this quiet little world not to turn it
completely topsyturvy labour is at a stand
the house has been a scene confusion the
whole evening the mansion has been beleaguered
by gipsy women with their children on
their backs wailing and lamenting while the old
virago a mother has cruised up and down before
the house shaking her head and muttering
 the culprit
to herself and now and then breaking into a
paroxysm rage brandishing her fist at the
hall and denouncing ill luck upon ready money
jack and even upon the squire himself
lady lillycraft has given repeated audiences
to the culprit's weeping wife at the hall door and
the servant maids have stole out to confer with
the gipsy women under the trees as to the
little ladies the family they are all outrageous
at ready money jack whom they look upon
in the light a tyrannical giant fairy tale
phoebe wilkins contrary to her usual nature
is the only female that is pitiless in this affair
she thinks mr tibbets quite in the right and
thinks the gipsies deserve to be punished severely
for meddling with the sheep the tibbets
in the mean time the females the family
have evinced all the provident kindness the
sex ever ready to soothe and succour the distressed
right or wrong lady lillycraft has had a
mattress taken to the outhouse and comforts
and delicacies all kinds have been taken to the
prisoner even the little girls have sent their
the culprit 
cakes and sweetmeats so that i'll warrant the
vagabond has never fared so well in his life before
old christy it is true looks upon everything
with a waryee struts about with his
blunderbuss with the air a veteran campaigner
keeps every one at bay and will hardly allow
himself to be spoken to the gipsy women
dare not come within gunshot and every tatterdemalion
 a boy has been frightened from the
park the old fellow is determined to lodge
starlight tom in prison with his own hands
and hopes he says to see one the poaching
crew made an example 
i doubt after all whether the worthy squire
is not the greatest sufferer in the whole affair
his honourable sense duty obliges him to be
rigid but the overflowing kindness his nature
makes this a grievous trial to him he is
not accustomed to have such demands upon his
justice in his truly patriarchal domain and it
wounds his benevolent spirit that while prosperity
and happiness are flowing in thus bounds
the culprit
teouslj upon him he should have to inflict
misery upon fellow being
he has been troubled and cast down the whole
evening took leave the family on going to
bed with a sigh instead his usual hearty and
affectionate tone and will in all probability have
a far more sleepless night than his prisoner indeed
this unlucky affair has cast a damp upon the
whole household as there appears to be an
universal opinion that the unlucky culprit will
come to the gallows
morning the clouds last evening are
all blown over a load has been taken from
the squire's heart and every face is once more
in smiles the gamekeeper made his appearance
at an early hour completely shamefaced
and chapfallen starlight tom had made his
escape in the night how he had got out the
loft no one could tell the devil must have assisted
him old christy was so mortified that
he would not show his face but had shut himself
up in his strong hold at the dogkennel and
the culprit 
would not be spoken with what has particularly
relieved the squire is that there is very
little likelihood the culprit's being retaken
having gone off on one the old gentleman's
best hunters
vol 
the historian
i have forborne to recount various tales which
have been told during the evenings at the hall
because some them were rather hackneyed
and tedious and others i did not feel warranted
in betraying into print i was suddenly startled
lately by a call from the squire to furnish a story
in my turn and having been a profound listener
to those others i could not in conscience refuse
 so i begged leave to read a manuscript tale
from the pen the late mr heinrich knickerbocker
the historian new york
as some curiosity was expressed about the author
i had to explain that he was a native 
new york a descendant one the ancient
dutch families that originally settled that province
and remained there after it was taken
possession by the english in that
the historian s
the descendants these dutch families still remained
in villages and neighbourhoods in various
parts the country retaining with singular
fidelity the dresses manners and even language
 their ancestors and forming a very distinct
and curious feature in the population the
state
that mr knickerbocker had written a history
 his native city comprising the reign the
three first governors who held a delegated sway
under the hogen moyens holland that in
this the worthy little dutchman had displayed
great historical research and a wonderful sense
 the dignity his subject but that his work
had been so little understood as to be pronounced
a mere work humour satirizing the follies
 the times in politics and morals and giving
whimsical views human nature
that among the papers left behind him were
several tales a lighter nature apparently
thrown together from materials which he had
gathered during his profound researches for his
history and which he seemed to have thrown
 the historian
by with neglect as unworthy publication
that these had fallen into my hands by an accident
which it was needless to mention and one
 those stories with its prelude in the words 
mr knickerbocker i now undertook to read
by way acquitting myself the debt which
i owed to the other storytellers in company
the haunted house
from the mss the late heinrich knickerbocker
formerly almost every place had a house this kind if a house
was seated on some melancholy place or built in some old romantic
manner or if any particular accident had happened in it such
as murder sudden death or the like to be sure that house had a
mark set on it and was afterwards esteemed the habitation a
bourne s antiquities
in the neighbourhood the ancient city 
manhattoes there stood not very many years
since an old mansion which when i was a boy
went by the name the haunted house it was
one the very few remains the architecture
 the early dutch settlers and must have been
a house some consequence at the time when
it was built it consisted a centre and two
wings the gable ends which were shaped
like stairs it was built partly wood and
 the haunted house
partly small dutch bricks such as the worthy
colonists brought with them from holland 
before they discovered that bricks could be
manufactured elsewhere the house stood remote
from the road in the centre a large
field with an avenue old locust trees leading
up to it several which had been shivered
by lightning and two or three blown down
a few apple trees grew straggling about the
field there were traces also what had been
a kitchen garden but the fences were broken
down the vegetables had disappeared or had
grown wild and turned to little better than
weeds with here and there a ragged rose bush
or a tall sunflower shooting up from among the
brambles and hanging its head sorrowfully as
if contemplating the desolation around it part
 the roof the old house had fallen in the
windows were shattered the pannels the
doors broken and mended with rough boards 
and there were two rusty weathercocks at the
ends the house which made a great jingling
acacias
the haunted house 
and whistling as they whirled about but always
poiutecl wrong the appearance the whole
was forlorn and desolate at the best times 
but in unruly weather the howling the wind
about the crazy old mansion the screeching 
the weathercocks the slamming and banging
 a few loose window shutters had altogether
so wild and dreary an effect that the neighbourhood
stood perfectly in awe the place and
pronounced it the rendezvous hobgoblins i
recollect the old building well for i recollect
how many times when an idle unlucky urchin
i have prowled round its precincts with some
 my graceless companions on holyday afternoons
when out on a freebooting cruise among
the orchards
there was a tree standing near the house
that bore the most beautiful and tempting fruit 
but then it was on enchanted ground for the
place was so charmed by frightful stories that we
dreaded to approach it sometimes we would
venture in a body and get near the hesperian
tree keeping an eye upon the old mansion and
 the haunted house
darting fearful glances into its shattered windows
 when just as we were about tf seize
upon our prize an exclamation from some one
 the gang or an accidental noise would throw
us all into a panic and we wo old scamper headlong
from the place nor ever stop until we had
got quite into the road then there were sure
to be a host anecdotes told about strange
cries and groans or some hideous face suddenly
seen staring out one the windows
by degrees we ceased to venture into these lonely
grounds but would stand at a distance and
throw stones at the building and there was something
fearfully pleasing in the sound as they
rattled along the roof or sometimes struck some
jingling fragments glass out the windows
the origin the house was lost in the obscurity
that covers the early period the province
whilst under the government their high
mightiness the states general some reported
it to have been a country residence wilhelm
kieft commonly called the testy one 
the dutch governors newamsterdam others
the haunted house 
said that it had been built by a naval commander
who served under van tromp and who on
being disappointed preferment retired from
the service in disgust became a philosopher
through sheer spire and brought over all his
wealth to the province that he might live according
to his humour and despise the world the
reason its having fallen to decay was likewise
a matter dispute some said that it was in
chancery and had already cost more than its
worth in legal expenses but the most current
and course the most probable account was
that it was haunted and that nobody could live
quietly in it there can in fact be very little
doubt that this last was the case there were so
many corroborating stories to prove it riot an
old woman in the neighbourhood but could furnish
at least a score there was a gray headed
curmudgeon a negro that lived hard by who
had a whole budget them to tell many 
which had happened to himself
i recollect many a time stopping with my
vol n 
 the haunted house
schoolmates and getting him to relate some
the old crone lived in a hovel in the midst a
small patch potatoes and indian corn which
his master had given him on setting him free
he would come to us with his hoe in his hand
and as we sat perched like a row swallows
on the rail the fence in the mellow twilight
 a summer evening he would tell us such
fearful stories accompanied by such awful
rolling his white eyes that we wre almost
afraid our own footsteps as we returned home
afterwards in the dark
poor old pompey many years are past since
he died and went to keep company with the
ghosts he was so fond talking about
he was buried in a corner his own little
ito patch the plough soon passed over his
ive and levelled it with the rest the field
and nobody thought any more the gray headed
negro by singular chance i was strolling in
that neighbourhood several years afterwards
when i had grown up to be a young man and i
found a knot gossips speculating on a skull
the haunted house 
which had just been turned up by a ploughshare

they course determined it to be the remains
 some one that had been murdered and
they had raked up with it some the traditionary
tales the haunted house i knew it at
once to be the relique poor pompey but i
held my tongue for i am too considerate 
other people's enjoyment ever to mar a story 
a ghost or a murder i took care however to
see the bones my old friend once more buried
in a place where they were not likely to be disturbed
as i sat on the turf and watched the
interment i fell into a long conversation with an
old gentleman the neighbourhood john fosse
windermere a pleasant gossiping man whose
whole life was spent in hearing and telling the
news the province he recollected old poi
pey and his stories about the haunted house 
but he assured me he could give me one still
more strange than any that pompey had related 
and on my expressing a great curiosity to hear it
he sat down beside me on the turf and told the
the haunted house
following tale i have endeavoured to give it as
nearly as possible in his words but it is now
many years since and i am grown old and my
memory is not over good cannot therefore
vouch for the language but i am always scrupulous
as to facts

in the early times the province newyork
while it groaned under the tyranny the
english governor lord carbury who carried
his cruelties toward the dutch inhabitants so jar
as to allow no dominie nor schoolmaster to oj
cite in their language without his special license
 about this time there lived in the jolly little
old city the manhattoes a kind motherly
dame known by the name dame heyliger
she was the widow a dutch sea captain
 adolph heyliger
who died suddenly a fever in consequence 
working too hard and eating too heartily at
the time when all the inhabitants turned out ina
panic to fortify the place against the invasion
 a small french privateer he left her with
very little money and one infant son the only
survivor several children the good woman
had need much management to make both
ends meet and keep up a decent appearance
however as her husband had fallen a victim to
his zeal for the public safety it was universally
agreed that something ought to be done for the
widow and on the hopes this something
she lived very tolerably for some years in the
mean time every body pitied and spoke well 
her and that helped along
she lived in a small house in a small street
called garden street very probably from a
garden which may have flourished there sometime
or other as her necessities every year
grew greater and the talk the public about
doing something for her grew less she had

adolph heyliger 
to cast about for some mode doing something
for herself by way helping out her slender
means and maintaining her independence 
which she was somewhat tenacious
living in a mercantile town she had caught
something the spirit and determined to venture
a little in the great lottery commerce
on a sudden therefore to the great surprise 
the street there appeared at her window a grand
array gingerbread kings and queens with
their arms stuck akimbo after the invariable
royal manner there were also several broken
tumblers some filled with sugar plumbs some
with marbles there were moreover cakes 
various kinds and barley sugar and holland
dolls and wooden horses with here and there
gilt covered picture books and now and then a
skein thread or a dangling pound candle
at the door the house sat the good old
dame's cat a decent demure looking personage
that seemed to scan every body that passed to
criticise their dress and now and then to stretch
her neck and look out with sudden curiosity to
adolph heyliger
see what was going on at the other the
street but if by chance any idle vagabond dog
came by and offered to be uncivil hoitytoity 
how she would bristle up and growl and spit
and strike out her paws she was as indignant
as ever was an ancient and ugly spinster on the
approach some graceless profligate
but though the good woman had to comedown
to those humble means subsistence yet
she still kept up a feeling family pride having
descended from the vanderspiegels amsterdam
 and she had the family arms painted
and framed and hung over her mantlepiece she
vas in truth much respected by all the poorer
people the place her house was quite a resort
 the old wives the neighbourhood they
would drop in there a winter's afternoon as
le sat knitting on one side her fireplace her
cat purring on the other and the teakettle singing
before it and they would gossip with her
until late in the evening there was always an
armchair for old peter de groodt sometimes
called long peter and sometimes peter longlegs
bolph heyliger 
the clerk and sexton the little lutheran
church who was her great crony and indeed
the oracle her fireside nay the dominie
himself did not disdain now and then to stop in
converse about the state her mind and take a
glass her especial good cherry brandy indeed
he never failed to call on new year's day
and wish her a happy new year and the good
dame who was a little vain on some points always
piqued herself on giving him as large a cake
as any one in town
i have said that she had one son he was
the child her old age butcould hardly be
called the comfort for all unlucky urchins
dolph heyliger was the most mischievous not
that the whisper was really vicious he was
only full fun and frolick and had that daring
gamesome spirit which is extolled in a rich man's
child but execrated in a poor man's he was
continually getting into scrapes his mother was
incessantly harassed with complaints some
waggish prank which he had played off bills
were sent in for windows that he had broken in
vol it 
s adolph heyligek
a word he had not reached his fourteenth year
before he was pronounced by all the neighbourhood
to be a wicked dog the wickedest dog
in the street nay one old gentleman in a
claret coloured coat with a thin red face and
ferret eyes went so far as to assure dame heytiger
that her son would one day or other come
to the gallows 
yet notwithstanding all this the poor old soul
loved her boy it seemed as though she loved
him the better the worse he behaved and that
he grew more in her favour the more he grew
out favour with the world mothers are
foolish fond hearted beings there's no reasoning
them out their dotage and indeed this
poor woman's child was all that was left to love
her in this world so w e must not think it hard
that she turned a deaf ear to her good friends
who sought to prove to her that dolph must inevitably
come to a halter to do the varlet justice
too he was strongly attached to his parent
he would not willingly have given her pain on
any account and when he had been doing wrong
adolph heyliger 
it was but foe him to catch his poor mother's eye
fixed wistfully and sorrowfully upon him to fill
his heart with bitterness and contrition but he
was a heedless youngster and could not for the
life him resist any new temptation to fun and
mischief though quick at his learning whenever
he could be brought to apply himself yet he
was always prone to be led away by idle company
 and would play truant to hunt after bird's
nests to rob orchards or to swim in the hudson

in this way he grew up a tall lubberly boy
and his mother began to be greatly perplexed
what to do with him or how to put him in a
way to do for himself for he had acquired such
an unlucky reputation that no one seemed willing
to employ him many was the consultation
that she held with peter de groodt the clerk
and sexton who was her prime councillor
peter was as much perplexed as herself for he
had no great opinion the boy and thought he
would never come to good he at one time
advised her to send him to sea a piece advice
 adolph heyliger
only given in the most desperate cases but dame
heyliger would not listen to such an idea she
could not think letting dolph go out her
sight she was sitting one day knitting by her
fireside in great perplexity when the sexton
entered with an air unusual vivacity and briskness
he had just come from a funeral it had
been that a boy dolph's years who had
been apprentice to a famous german doctor
who had died a consumption it is true there
had been a whisper that the deceased had been
brought to his by being made the subject 
the doctor's experiments on which he was apt
to try the effects a new compound or a quieting
draught this however it is likely was a
mere scandal at any rate peter de groodt did
not think it worth mentioning though had we
time to philosophize it would be a curious matter
for speculation why a doctor's family is apt
to be so lean and cadaverous and a butcher's so
jolly and rubicund
peter de groodt as i said before entered the
house dame heyliger with unusual alacrity
adolph heyliger 
he was full a bright idea that had popped
into his head at the funeral and over which he
had chuckled as he shovelled the earth into the
grave the doctor's disciple it had occurred
to him thar as the situation the deceased was
vacant at the doctor's it would be the very
place for dolph the boy had parts and could
pound a pestle and run an errand with any boy in
the town and what more was wanted in a student

the suggestion the sage peter was a vision
 glory to the mother she already saw dolphin
her mind's eye with a cane at his nose a
knocker at his door and an m d at the 
 his name one the established dignitaries 
the town 
the matter once undertaken was soon effected
 the sexton had some influence with the
doctor they having had much dealing together
in the way their separate professions and
the very next morning he called and conducted
the urchin clad in his sunday clothes to undergo
 adolph heyliger
the inspection doctor karl lodovich knip
perhausen
they found the doctor seated in an elbow
chair in one corner his study or laboratory
with a large volume in german print before him
he was a short fat man with a dark square
lace rendered more dark by a black velvet cap
he had a little robbed nose not unlike the ace
 spades with a pair spectacles gleaming
on each side his dusky countenance like a
couple bow windows
dolph felt struck with awe on entering into
the presence this learned man and gazed
about him with boyish wonder at the furniture
 this chamber knowledge which appeared
to him almost as the den a magician in the
centre stood a claw footed table with pestle and
mortar phials and galli pots and a pair small
burnished scales at one was a heavy
clothes press turned into a receptacle for drugs
and compounds against which hung the doctor's
hat and cloak and goldheaded cane and on
the top grinned a human scull along the randolph
heyliger 
timepiece were glass vessels holding snakes and
lizards and a human foetus preserved in spirits
a closet the doors which were taken off
contained three whole shelves full books and
some too mighty folio dimensions a collection
the like which dolph had never before
beheld as however the library did not
take up the whole the closet the doctor's
thrifty housekeeper had occupied the rest with
pots pickles and preserves and had hung
about the room among awful implements the
healing art strings red peppers and corpulent
cucumbers carefully preserved for seed
peter de groodt and his protege were received
with great gravity and stateliness by the
doctor who was a very wise dignified little
man and never smiled he surveyed dolph
from head to foot above and under and through
his spectacles and the poor lad's heart quailed as
these great glasses glared on him like two full
moons the doctor heard all that peter de
groodt had to say in favour the youthful candidate
 and then wetting his thumb with the
 adolph belligerent
 his tongue he began deliberately to turnover
page after page the great black volume
before him at length after many hums and
haws and stroking the chin and all that hesitation
and deliberation with which a wise man
proceeds to do what he intended to do from the
very first the doctor agreed to take the lad as a
disciple to give him bed board and clothing
and to instruct him in the healing art in return
for which he was to have his services until his
twentyfirst year behold then our hero all at
once transformed from an unlucky urchin running
wild about the streets to a student medicine
diligently pounding a pestle under the auspices
 the learned doctor karl lodovich
knipperhauseri it was a happy transition for
his fond old mother she was delighted with
the idea her boy's being brought up worthy
 his ancestors and anticipated the day when
he would be able to hold up his head with the
lawyer that lived in the large door opposite or
peradventure with the dominie himself
adolph heyliger 
doctor knipperhausen was a native the palatinate
in germany from whence in company
with many his countrymen he had taken refuge
in england on account religious persecution
he was one nearly three thousand
palatines who came over from england in 
under the protection governor hunter where
the doctor had studied how he had acquired
his medical knowledge and where he had received
his diploma it is hard at present to say
for nobody knew at the time yet it is certain
that his profound skill and abstruse knowledge
were the talk and wonder the common people
far and near his practice was totally different
from that any other physician consisting
in mysterious compounds known only to himself
in the preparing and administering 
which it was said he always consulted the stars
so high an opinion was entertained his skill
particularly by the german and dutch inhabitants
that they always resorted to him in desperate
cases he was one those infallible doctors
that are always effecting sudden and surprise
 
 adolph heyliger
sing cures when the patient has been given up
by all the regular physicians unless as is
shrewdly observed the case has been left too
long before it was put into his hands the
doctor's library was the talk and marvel the
neighbourhood i might almost say the entire
burgh the good people looked with reverence
at a man that had read three whole shelves full
 books and some them too as large as a
family bible there were many disputes among
the members the little lutheran church as
to which was the wisest man the doctor or the
dominie some his admirers even went so far
as to say that he knew more than the governor
himself in a word it was thought that there
was no to his knowledge 
no sooner was dolph received into the doctor's
family than he was put in possession the
lodgings his predecessor it was a garret
room a steep roofed dutch house where the
rain pattered on the shingles and the lightning
gleamed arid the wind piped through the crannies
in stormy weather and where whole troops
adolph heyligeiu 
 hungry rats galloped about like don cossacks
in defiance traps and ratsbane
he was soon up to his ears in medical studies
being employed morning noon and night in
rolling pills filtering tinctures or pounding the
pestle and mortar in one corner the laboratory
 while the doctor would take his seat in
another corner when he had nothing else to door
expected visitors and arrayed in his morning
gown and velvet cap would pore over the contents
 some folio volume it is true that the
regular thumping dolph's pestle or perhaps
the drowsy buzzing the summer flies would
now and then lull the little man into a slumber 
but then his spectacles were always wide awake
and studiously regarding the 
there was another personage in the house
however to whom dolph was obliged to pay
allegiance though a bachelor and a man 
such great dignity and importance yet the doctor
was like many other wise men subject to
petticoat goverment he was completely under
the sway his housekeeper a spare busy
 adolph heyliger
fretting housewife in a little round quilted
german cap with a huge bunch keys jingling
at the girdle an exceedingly long waist
fran use or frow ilsyy as it was pronounced
had accompanied him in his various migrations
from germany to england and from england
to the province managing his establishment
and himself too ruling him it is true with a
gentle hand but carrying a high hand with all
the world beside how she had acquired such
ascendancy i do not pretend to say people
it is true did talk but have not people been
prone to talk ever since the world began who
can tell how women generally contrive to get
the upper hand a husband it is true may
now and then be master in his own house but
who ever knew a bachelor that was not managed
by his housekeeper 
indeed frau ilsyy's power was not confined
to the doctor's household she was one 
those prying gossips that know every one's business
better than they do themselves and
whose allseeing eyes and alltelling tongues
adolph heyliger 
are terrors throughout a neighbourhood nothing
 any moment transpired m the world 
scandal this little burgh but it was kiiown
to frau ilsyy she had her crew cronies
that were perpetually hurrying to her little parlour
with some precious bit news nay she
would sometimes discuss a whole volume secret
history as she held the street door ajar and
gossiped with one those garrulous crones
in the very teeth a december blast
between the doctor and the housekeeper it
may easily be supposed that dolph had a busy
life it as frau f isy kept the keys and literally
ruled the roast it was starvation to offend
her though he found the study her temper
more perplexing even than that medicine
when not busy in the laboratory she kept him
running hither and thither on her own errands 
and on sundays he was obliged to accompany
her to and from church and carry her bible and
many a time has the poor varlet stood shivering
and blowing his fingers or holding his frostbit
ten nose in the church yard while frau ilsyy
 adolph heyliger
and her cronies were huddled together wagging
their heads and tearing some unlucky character
to pieces
with allhis advantages however dolph made
but very slow progress in his art this was no
fault the doctor's certainly for he took unwearied
pains with the lad keeping him close
to the pestle and mortar or on the trot about
town with phials and pillboxes and if he ever
flagged in his industry which he was rather apt
to do the doctor would fly into a passion and
ask him if he ever expected to learn his profession
unless he applied himself closer to the study
the fact is he still retained the fondness for
sport and mischief that had marked his childhood
the habit indeed strengthened with his
years and gained force from being thwarted and
constrained he daily grew more and more untractable
 and lost favour in the eyes both the
doctor and the housekeeper
in the mean time the doctor went on waxing
wealthy and renowned he was famous for his
skill in managing cases not laid down in the
adolph heyliger 
books he had cured several old women and
young girls witchcraft a terrible complaint
nearly as prevalent in the province in those days
as hydrophobia is at present he had even restored
one strapping country girl to perfect health
who had gone so far as to vomit crooked pins
and needles which is considered a desperate
stage the malady it was whispered also
that he was possessed the art preparing
love ponders and many applications had he inconsequence
from lovesick patients both
sexes but all these cases formed the mysterious
part his practice in which according to the
cant phrase secrecy and honour might be
depended on dolph therefore was obliged to
turn out the study when such consultations
occurred though it is said he learnt more the
secrets the art at the key hole than by all the
rest his studies put together
as the doctor increased in wealth he began to
extend his possessions and to look forward like
other great men to the time when he should retire
to the repose a country seat for this
adolph heyligek
purpose he had purchased a farm or as the
dutch settlers called it a bower a few miles
from town it had been the residence a wealthy
family that had returned some time since to
holland a large mansion house stood in the
centre it very much out repair and which
in consequence certain reports had received
the appellation the haunted house either
from these reports or from its actual dreariness
the doctor had found it impossible to get a tenant
and that the place might not fall to ruin
before he could reside in it himself he had placed
a country boor with his family in one wing
with the privilege cultivating the farm on
shares
the doctor now felt all the dignity a landholder
rising within him he had a little the
german pride territory in his composition
and almost looked upon himself as owner a
principality he began to complain the fatigue
 business and was fond riding out
to look at his estate his little expeditions
to his lands were attended with a bustle and paadolph
heyliger 
rade that created a sensation throughout the
neighbourhood his walleyed horse stood stamping
and whisking off the flies for a full hour before
the house then the doctor's saddle bags
would be brought out and adjusted then after
a little while his cloak would be rolled up and
strapped to the saddle then his umbrella would
be buckled to the cloak while in the meantime
a group ragged boys that observant
class beings would gather before the door
at length the doctor would issue forth in a pair
 jack boots that reached above his knees and
a cocked hat flapped down in front as he was
a short fat man he took some time to mount
into the saddle and when there he took sometime
to have the saddle and stirrups properly
adjusted enjoying the wonder and admiration
 the urchin crowd even after he had set
off he would pause in the middle the street
or trot back two or three times to give some
parting orders which were answered by the
housekeeper from the door or dolph from the
study or the black cook from the cellar or the
vol n 
 adolph heyliger
chambermaid from the garret window and
there were generally some last words bawled
after him just as he was turning the corner
the whole neighbourhood would be aroused
by this pomp and circumstance the cobbler
would leave his last the barber would thrust
out his frizzed head with a comb sticking in ita
knot would collect at the grocer's door and
the word would be buzzed from one the
street to the other the doctor's riding out to
his country seat 
these were golden moments for dolph no
sooner was the doctor out sight than pestle
and mortar were abandoned the laboratory was
left to take care itself and the student was
off on some madcap frolick indeed it must be
confessed the youngster as he grew up seemed
in a fair way to fulfil the prediction the old
claret coloured gentleman he was the ringleader
 all holyday sports and midnight gambols
 ready for all kinds mischievous pranks
and harebrained adventure there is nothing
so troublesome as a hero on a small scale or
oolph heyliger 
rather a hero in a small town dolph soon became
the abhorrence all drowsy housekeeping
old citizens who hated noise and had no relish
for waggery the good dames too considered
him as little better than a reprobate 
gathered their daughters under their wings
whenever he approached and pointed him out
as a warning to their sons no one seemed to
hold him in much regard excepting the wild
striplings the place who were captivated by
his openhearted daring manners and the negroes
who always look upon every idle dono
thing youngster as a kind gentleman even
the good peter de groodt who had considered
himself a kind patron the lad began to
despair him and would shake his head dubiously
as he listened to a long complaint the
housekeeper's and sipped a glass her raspberry
brandy
still his mother was not to be wearied out
 her affection by all the waywardness her
boy nor disheartened by the stories his misdeeds
with which her good friends were 
adolph heyliger
annually regaling her she had it is true very
little the pleasure which rich people enjoy
in always hearing their children praised but
she considered all this ill will as a kind persecution
which he suffered and she liked him
the better on that account she saw him growing
up a fine tall good looking youngster and
she looked at him with the secret pride a mother's
heart it was her great desire that dolph
should appear like a gentleman and all the money
she could save went towards helping out
his pocket and his wardrobe she would lookout
 the window after him as he sallied forth
in his best and her heart would yearn with delight
 and once when peter de groodt struck
with the youngster's gallant appearance on a
bright sunday morning observed well after
all dolph does grow a comely fellow the
tear pride started into the mother's eye ah
neighbour neighbour exclaimed she they
may say what they please poor dolph will yet
hold up his head with the best them 
dolph heyliger had now nearly attained his
adolph heyliger 
oneandtwentieth year and the term his
medical studies was just expiring yet it must
be confessed that he knew little more the profession
than when he first entered the doctor's
doors this however could not be from any
want quickness parts for he showed amazing
aptness in mastering other branches 
knowledge which he could only have studied at
intervals he was for instance a sure marksman
and won all the geese and turkeys at christmas
holidays he was a bold rider he was
famous for leaping and wrestling he played tolerably
on the fiddle could swim like a fish
and was the best hand in the whole place at
fives and ninepins
all these accomplishments however procured
him no favour in the eyes the doctor who
grew more and more crabbed and intolerant the
nearer the term apprenticeship approached
frau ilsyy too was forever finding some occasion
to raise a windy tempest about his ears 
and seldom encountered him about the house
without a clatter the tongue so that at length
 adolph heyliger
the jingling her keys as she approached was
to dolph like the ringing the prompter's bell
that gives notice a theatrical thunder storm
nothing but the infinite good humour the
heedless youngster enabled him to bear all this
domestic tyranny without open rebellion it
was evident that the doctor and his housekeeper
were preparing to beat the poor youth out the
nest the moment his term should have expired 
a shorthand mode which the doctor had providing
for useless disciples
indeed the little man had been rendered more
than usually irritable lately in consequence 
various cares and vexations which his country
estate had brought upon him the doctor had
been repeatedly annoyed by the rumours and
tales which prevailed concerning the old mansion
and found it difficult to prevail even upon
the countryman and his family to remain there
rent free every time he rode out to the farm
he was teased by some fresh complaint strange
noises and fearful sights with which the tenants
were disturbed at night and the doctor would
adolph meyliger 
come home fretting arid fuming and vent his
spleen upon the whole household it was indeed
a sore grievance that affected him both in
pride and purse he was threatened with an
absolute loss the profits his property and
then what a blow to his territorial consequence
to be the landlord a haunted house it was
observed however that with all his vexation
the doctor never proposed to sleep in the house
himself nay he could never be prevailed upon
to remain on the premises after dark but made
the best his way for town as soon as the bats
began to flit about in the twilight the fact
was the doctor was a secret believer in ghosts
having passed the early part his life in a country
where they particularly abound and indeed
the story went that when a boy he had
once seen the devil upon the harts mountains
in germany
at length the doctor's vexations on this head
were brought to a crisis one morning as he
sat dozing over a volume in his study he was
 adolph heyliger
suddenly startled from his slumbers by the bustling
in the housekeeper
here's a fine todo cried she as she entered
the room here's claus hopper come
in bag and baggage from the farm and swears
he'll have nothing more to do with it the
whole family have been frightened out their
wits for there's such racketing and rummaging
about the old house that they can't sleep quiet
in their beds
donner und bitten cried the doctor
impatiently will they never have done chattering
about that house what a pack fools
to let a few hungry rats and mice frighten them
out good quarters
nay nay said the housekeeper wagging
her head knowingly and piqued at having a
good ghost story doubted there's more in it
than rats and mice all the neighbourhood talks
about the house and then such sights have
been seen in it peter de groodt tells me that
the family that sold you the house and went to
holland dropped several strange hints about it
adolph heyliger 
and said they wished you joy your bargain 
and you know yourself there's no getting any
family to live in it
peter de groodt's a ninny an old woman
said the doctor peevishly i'll warrant he's
been filling these people's heads full stories
it's just like his nonsense about the ghost that
haunted the church belfry as an excuse for not
ringing the bell that cold night when germanus
brinkerhoff's house was on fire send clans
to me
claus hopper now made his appearance a
simple country lout full awe at finding himself
in the very study dr knipperhausen and
too much embarrassed to enter into much detail
 the matters that had caused his alarm he
stood twirling his hat in one hand resting sometimes
on one leg sometimes on the other looking
occasionally at the doctor and now and then
stealing a fearful glance at the death's head that
seemed ogling him from the top the clothes
press
the doctor tried every means to persuade him
vol 
 adolph heyliger
to return to the farm but all in vain he maintained
a dogged determination on the subject 
and at the close every argument or solicitation
would make the same brief inflexible reply
ici kan night mynheer
the doctor was a little pot and soon hot
his patience was exhausted by these continual
vexations about his estate the stubborn refusal
 claus hopper seemed to him like flat
rebellion his temper suddenly boiled over and
claus was glad to make a rapid retreat to escape
scalding
when the bumpkin got to the housekeeper's
room he found peter de groodt and several other
true believers ready to receive him here he
indemnified himself for the restraint he had
suffered in the study and opened a budget 
stories about the haunted house that astonished
all his hearers the housekeeper believed them
all if it was only to spite the doctor for having
received her intelligence so uncourteous peter
de groodt matched them with many a wonderful
legend the times the dutch dynasty and
adolph heyliger 
 the devil's stepping stones and the pirate
that was hanged at gibbet island and continued
to swing there at night long after the gallows
was taken down and the ghost the unfortunate
german lesser who was hanged for
treason which haunted the old fort and the government
house the gossiping knot dispersed
each charged with direful intelligence the
sexton disburdened himself at a vestry meeting
that was held that very day and the black
cook forsook her kitchen and spent half the
day at the street pump that gossiping place 
servants dealing forth the news to all that came
for water in a little while the whole town was
in a buzz with tales about the haunted house
some said that claus hopper had seen the
devil while others hinted that the house was
haunted by the ghosts some the patients
which the doctor had physicked out the
world and that was the reason why he did not
venture to live in it himself
all this put the little doctor in a terrible fume
he threatened vengeance on any one who
 adolph heyliger
should affect the value his property by exciting
popular prejudices he complained loud
 thus being in a manner dispossessed his
territories by mere bugbears but he secretly
determined to have the house exorcised by the
dominie
great was his relief therefore when in the
midst his perplexities dolph stepped forward
and undertook to garrison the haunted house
the youngster had been listening to all the stones
 claus hopper and peter de groodt he
was fond adventure he loved the marvellous
 and his imagination had become quite excited
by these tales wonder besides he had
led such an uncomfortable life at the doctor's
being subjected to the intolerable thraldom 
early hours that he was delighted at the prospect
 having a house to himself even though it
should be a haunted one his offer was eagerly
accepted and it was determined that he should
mount guard that very night his only stipulation
was that the enterprize should be kept secret
from his mother for he knew the poor soul
adolph heyliger 
would not sleep a wink if she knew that her son
was waging war with the powers darkness
when night came on he set out on this perilous
expedition the old black cook his only
friend in the household had provided him with
a little mess for supper and a rush light and
she tied round his neck an amulet given herby
an african conjuror as a charm against evil
spirits dolph was escorted on his way by the
doctor and peter de groodt who had agreed to
accompany him to the house and to see him safe
lodged
the night was overcast and it was very dark
when they arrived at the grounds which surrounded
the mansion the sexton led the way
with a lanthorn as they walked along the avenue
 acacias the fitful light catching from
bush to bush and tree to tree often startled the
doughty peter and made him fall back upon his
followers and the doctor grappled still closer
hold dolph's arm observing that the ground
was very slippery and uneven at one time they
were nearly put to total rout by a bat which
c adolph heyliger
came flitting about the lanthorn and the notes
 the insects from the trees and the frogs from
a neighbouring pond formed a most drowsy and
doleful concert
the front door the mansion opened with a
grating sound that made the doctor turn pale
they entered a tolerably large hall such as is
common in american country houses to serve
for sitting rooms in warm weather from hence
they went up a wide staircase that groaned and
creaked as they trod every step making its particular
note like the key a harpsichord this
led to another hall on the second story from
whence they entered the room where dolph was
to sleep it was large and scantily furnished
the shutters were closed but as they were
much shattered there was not want a circulation
 air it appeared to have been that sacred
chamber known among dutch housewives
by the name the best bed room which is
the best furnished but in which scarce any body
is ever permitted to sleep its splendour however
was all at an a few broken articles
adolph heyliger 
 furniture were about the walls and in the
centre the room was a heavy deal table and
a large arm chair both which had the look 
being coeval with the mansion the fireplace
was wide and had been faced with dutch tiles
representing scripture stories but several 
them had fallen out their places and lay shattered
about the hearth
the sexton had lit the rush light and the doctor
looking fearfully about the room was just
exhorting dolph to be good cheer and to
pluck up a stout heart when a noise in the chimney
like voices and struggling struck a sudden
panic into the sexton he took to his
heels with the lanthorn the doctor followed
hard after him the stairs groaned and whistled
as they hurried down increasing their agitation
and speed by its noises the front door slammed
after them and dolph heard them scrambling
down the avenue till the sound their feet
was lost in the distance that he did not join in
this precipitate retreat might have been owing
to his possessing a little more courage than his
 adolph heylger
companions or perhaps that he had caught a
glimpse the cause their dismay in a nest
 chimney swallows that came tumbling down
into the fireplace
being now left to himself he secured the front
door by a strong bolt and bar and having seen
that the other entrances were fastened he returned
to his desolate chamber having made his
supper from the basket which the good old cook
had provided he locked the chamber door and
retired to rest on a mattress in one corner the
night was calm and still and nothing broke
upon the profound quiet but the lonely chirping
 a cricket from the chimney a distant chamber
the rush light which stood in the centre
 the deal table shed a feeble yellow ray dimly
illumining the chamber and making uncouth
shapes and shadows on the walls from the clothes
which dolph had thrown over a chair
with all his boldness heart there was something
subduing in this desolate scene and he
felt his spirits flag within him as he lay on his
hard bed and gazed about the room he was
adolph heyligeh 
turning over in his mind his idle habits his
doubtful prospects and now and then heaving
a heavy sigh as he thought on his poor old mother
 for there is nothing like the silence and
loneliness night to bring dark shadows over
the brightest mind by and bye he thought he
heard a sound as if some one was walking below
stairs he listened and distinctly heard a step
on the great staircase it approached solemnly
and slowly tramp tramp tramp it was
evidently the tread some heavy personage 
and yet how could he have got into the house
without making a noise he had examined all
the fastenings and was certain that every entrance
was secured still the steps advanced
tramp tramp tramp it was evident that
the person approaching could not be a robber 
the step was too loud and deliberate a robber's
would be either stealthy or precipitate and
now the footsteps had ascended the staircase 
they were slowly advancing along the passage
resounding through the silent and empty apartments
the very cricket had ceased its means
 
 adolph heyliger
holy note and nothing interrupted their awful
distinctness the door which had been locked
on the inside slowly swung open as if self moved
the footsteps entered the room but no one
was to be seen they passed slowly and audibly
across it tramp tramp tramp but whatever
made the sound was invisible dolph rubbed
his eves and stared about him he could see
to every part the dimly lighted chamber all
was vacant yet still he heard these mysterious
footsteps solemnly walking about the chamber
they ceased and all was dead silence there
was something more appalling in this invisible
visitation than there would have been in anything
that addressed itself to the eyesight it
was awfully vague and indefinite he felt his
heart beat hard against his ribs a cold sweat
broke out upon his forehead he lay for sometime
in a state violent agitation nothing
however occurred to increase his alarm his
light gradually burnt down into the socket and
he felt asleep when he awoke it was broad
daylight the sun was peering through the
adolph heyliqer
cracks the window shutters and the birds
were merrily singing about the house the
bright cheery day soon put to flight all the terrors
 the preceding night dolph laughed or
rather tried to laugh at all that had passed and
endeavoured to persuade himself that it was a
mere freak the imagination conjured up by
the stories he had heard but he was a little
puzzled to find the door his room locked on
the inside notwithstanding that he had positively
seen it swing open as the footsteps entered
he returned to town in a state considerable
perplexity but he determined to say nothing on
the subject until his doubts were either confirmed
or removed by another night's watching
his silence was a grievous disappointment to the
gossips who had gathered at the doctor's mansion
they had prepared their minds to hear
direful tales and they were almost in a rage at
being assured that he had nothing to relate
the next night then dolph repeated his
vigil he now entered the house with some
trepidation he was particular in examining
 adolph heyligek
the fastenings all the doors and securing
them well he locked the door his chamber
and placed a chair upon it then having
despatched his supper he threw himself on his
mattress and endeavoured to sleep it was all
in vain a thousand crowding fancies kept him
waking the time slowly dragged on as if
minutes were spinning themselves out into
hours as the night advanced he grew more
and more nervous and he almost started from
his couch when he heard the mysterious footstep
again on the staircase up it came as
before solemnly and slowly tramp tramp
tramp it approached along the passage the
door again swung open as if there had been
neither lock nor impediment and a strange
looking figure stalked into the room it w as
an elderly man large and robust clothed in the
old flemish fashion he had on a kind short
cloak with a garment under it belted round
the waist a pair russet boots very large
at top and standing widely from his legs he
had trunk hose with great bunches at the
bolph heyliger 
knees his hat was broad and slouched with
a feather trailing over one side his irongray
hair hung in thick masses in his neck and he
had a short grizzled beard he walked slowly
round the room as if examining that all was
safe then hanging his hat on a peg beside the
door he sat down in the elbow chair and leaning
his elbow on the table fixed his eyes on
dolph with an unmoving and deadening stare
dolph was not naturally a coward but he
had been brought up in an implicit belief in
ghosts and goblins a thousand stories came
swarming to his mind that he had heard about
this building and as he looked at this strange personage
with his uncouth garb his pale visage
his grizzly beard and his fixed staring fishlike
eye his teeth began to chatter his hair to rise
on his head and a cold sweat to break out allover
his body how long he remained in this
situation he could not tell for he was like one
fascinated he could not take his gaze off
from the spectre but lay staring at him with
his whole intellect absorbed in the contemplated
adolph heyliger
tion the old man remained seated behind the
table without stirring or turning an eye always
keeping a dead stead glare upon dolph
at length the household cock from a neighbouring
farm clapped his wings and gave a loud
cheerful crow that rung over the fields at the
sound the old man slowly rose and took down
his hat from the peg the door opened and
closed after him he was heard to go slowly
down the staircase tramp tramp tramp and
when he had got to the bottom all was again
silent dolph lay and listened earnestly counted
every foot fall listened and listened if the steps
should return until exhausted with watching
and agitation he fell into a troubled sleep
daylight again brought fresh courage and assurance
he would fain have considered all that
had passed as a mere dream yet there stood
the chair in which the unknown had seated himself
 there was the table on which he had leaned
 there was the peg on w r which he had hung his
hat and there was the door locked precisely ashe
himself locked it with the chair placed against
adolph heyliger 
it he hastened down stairs and examined the
doors and windows all were exactly in the same
state in which he had left them and there was
no apparent way by which any being could have
entered and left the house without leaving some
trace behind pooh said dolph to himself
it was all a dream but it would not do the
more he endeavoured to shake the scene off from
his mind the more it haunted him
though he persisted in a strict silence as to
all that he had seen and heard yet his looks betrayed
the uncomfortable night that he had passed
it was evident there was something wonderful
hidden under this mysterious reserve the
doctor took him into the study locked the door
and sought to have a full and confidential communication
 but he could get nothing out him
frau use took him aside into the pantry but to
as little purpose and peter de groodt held him
by the button for a full hour in the churchyard
the very place to get at the bottom a ghost
story but came off not a whit wiser than the
rest it is always the case however that one
 adolph heyligkk
truth concealed makes a dozen current lies it
is like a guinea locked up in a bank that has a
dozen paper representatives before the day
was over the neighbourhood was full reports
some said that dolph heyliger watched in the
haunted house with pistols loaded with silver
bullets others that he had had a long talk with a
spectre without a head others that doctor
knipperhausen and the sexton had been hunted
down the bowerylane and quite into town by
a legion ghosts their old customers some
shook their heads and thought it a shame that
the doctor should put dolph to pass the night
alone in that dismal house where he might be
spirited away no one knew whither while others
observed with a shrug that if the devil did carry
off the youngster it would but be taking his
own
these rumours at length reached the ears 
the good dame heyliger and as may be supposed
threw her into a terrible alarm for her
son to have exposed himself to dangers from living
foes would have been nothing so dreadful
adolph heylfger 
in her eyes as to dare alone the terrors the
haunted house she hastened goethe doctor's
and passed a great part the day in attempting
to dissuade dolph from repeating his vigil she
told him a score tales which her gossiping
friends had just related to her persons who
had been carried off when watching alone in old
ruinous houses it was all to no effect dolph's
pride as well as curiosity was piqued he endeavoured
to calm the apprehensions his mother
and to assure her that there was no truth
in all the rumours she had heard she looked
at him dubiously and shook her head but finding
his determination was not to be shaken she
brought him a little thick dutch bible with brass
clasps to take with him as a sword wherewith
to fight the powers darkness and lest that
might not be sufficient the housekeeper gave him
the heidelberg catechism by way dagger
the next night therefore dolph took up his
quarters for the third time in the old mansion
whether dream or not the same thing was repeated
towards midnight when every thing
vol n 
 adolph heyliger
was still the same sound echoed through the
empty halls tramp tramp tramp the stairs
were again ascended the door again swung
open the old man entered walked round the
room hung up his hat and seated himself by
the table the same fear and trembling came
over poor dolph though not in so violent a degree
he lay in the same way motionless and
fascinated staring at the figure which regarded
him as before with a dead fixed chilling
gaze in this way they remained for a longtime
till by degrees dolph's courage began gradually
to revive whether alive or dead this
being had certainly some object in his visitation
and he recollected to have heard it said that
spirits have no power to speak until they are
spoken to summoning up resolution therefore
and making two or three attempts before he
could get his parched tongue in motion he addressed
the unknown in the most solemn form
 adjuration that he could recollect and demanded
to know what was the motive his
visit
adolph heylifier 
no sooner had he finished than the old man
rose and took down his hat the door opened and
he went out looking back upon dolph just ashe
crossed the threshold as if expecting him to
follow the youngster did not hesitate an instant
he took the candle in his hand and the
bible under his arm and obeyed the tacit invitation
the candle emitted a feeble uncertain
ray but still he could see the figure before him
slowly descending the stairs he followed trembling
when it had reached the bottom the
stairs it turned through the hall towards the back
door the mansion dolph held the light over
balustrades but in his eagerness to catch a sight
 the unknown he flared his feeble taper so
suddenly that it went out still there was
sufficient light from the pale moon beams that
fell through a narrow window to give him an
indistinct view the figure near the door he
followed therefore down stairs and turned
towards the place but when he got there
the unknown had disappeared the door remained
fast barred and bolted there was no
 adolph heyliger
other mode exit yet the being whatever he
might be was gone he unfastened the door
and looked out into the fields it was a hazy
moonlight night so that the eye could distinguish
objects at some distance he thought he
saw the unknown in a footpath that led from
the door he was not mistaken but how had
he got out the house he did not pause to
think but followed on the old man proceeded
at a measured pace without looking about him
his footsteps sounding on the hard ground he
passed through the orchard apple trees that
stood near the house always keeping to the footpath
it led to a well situated in a little hollow
which had supplied the farm with water just
at this well dolph lost sight him he rubbed
his eyes and looked again but nothing was
to be seen the unknown he reached the
well but nobody was there all the surrounding
ground was open and clear there was no
bush nor hiding place he looked down the
well and saw at a great depth the reflection 
the sky in the still water after remaining here
adolph heyliger 
for some time without seeing or hearing anything
more his mysterious conductor hereturned
to the house full awe and wonder
he bolted the door groped his way back to
bed and it was long before he could compose
himself to sleep
his dreams were strange and troubled he
thought he was following the old man along the
side a great river until they came to a vessel
that was on the point sailing and that his
conductor led him on board arid vanished he
remembered the commander the vessel a short
swarthy man with cried black hair blind 
one eye and lame one leg but the rest his
dream was very confused sometimes he wassailing
sometimes on shore now amidst storms
and tempests and now wandering quietly in unknown
streets the figure the unknown was
strangely mingled up with the incidents the
dream and the whole distinctly wound up by
his finding himself on board the vessel again
returning home with a great bag money 
 adolph heyliger
when he woke the gray cool light dawn
was streaking the horizon and the cocks passing
the rcveil from farm to farm throughout the
country he rose more harassed and perplexed
than ever he was singularly confounded by
all that he had seen and dreamt and began to
doubt whether his mind was not affected and
whether all that was passing in his thoughts
might not be mere feverish fantasy in his present
state mind he did not feel disposed to
return immediately to the doctor's and undergo
the crossquestioning the household he
made a scanty breakfast therefore on the remains
 his last night's provisions and then
wandered out into the fields to meditate on all
that had befallen him lost in thought he rambled
about gradually approaching the town until
the morning was far advanced when he was
roused by a hurry and bustle around him he
found himself near the water's edge in a throng
 people hurrying to a pier where there was a
vessel ready to make sail he was unconsciously
carried along by the impulse the crowd and
adolph heyliger 
found that it was a sloop on the point sailing
up the hudson to albany there was much
leavetaking and kissing old women and
children and great activity in carrying on board
baskets bread and cakes and provisions all
kinds notwithstanding the mighty joints 
meat that dangled over the stern for a voyage
to albany was an expedition great moment
in those days the commander the sloop
was hurrying about and giving a world orders
which were not very strictly attended to 
one man being busy in lighting his pipe and another
in sharpening his snickersee
the appearance the commander suddenly
caught dolph's attention he was short and swarthy
with cried black hair blind one eye
and lame one leg the very commander that
he had seen in his dream surprized and aroused
he considered the scene more attentively and
recalled still further traces his dream the
appearance the vessel the river and a
a variety other objects accorded with the imperfect
images vaguely rising to recollection
 adolph heyliger
as he stood musing on these circumstances
the captain suddenly called to him in dutch
step on board young man or you'll be left
behind he was startled by the summons
he saw that the sloop was cast loose and was
actually moving from the pier it seemed as if he
was actuated by some irresistible impulse he
sprung upon the deck and the next moment the
sloop was hurried off by the wind and tide
dolph's thoughts and feelings were all in tumult
and confusion he had been strongly
worked upon by the events that had recently
befallen him and could not but think that there
was some connexion between his present situation
and his last night's dream he felt as if he
was under supernatural influence and he tried
to assure himself with an old and favourite maxim
 his that one way or other all would turnout
for the best for a moment the indignation
 the doctor at his departure without leave
passed across his mind but that was a matter 
little moment then he thought the distress 
his mother at his strange disappearance and the
adolph heyliger 
idea gave him a sudden pang he would have
intreated to he put on shore but he knew with
such wind and tide the entreaty would have been
in vain then the inspiring love novelty and
adventure nine rushing in full tide through his
bosom he felt himself launched strangely and
suddenly on the world and under full way to explore
the regions wonder that lay up this mighty
river and beyond those blue mountains that had
bounded his horizon since childhood while he
was lost in this whirl thought the sails strained
to the freeze the shores seemed to hurry away
behind him and before he perfectly recovered
his selfpossession the sloop was ploughing her
way past spiking devil and yonkers and the
tallest chimney the manhattoes had faded
from his sight
i have said that a voyage up the hudson in
those days was an undertaking some moment
 indeed it was as much thought as a
voyage to europe is at present the sloops
were often many days on the way the cautious
navigators taking in sail when it blew fresh and
vol 
 adolph heyligek
coming to anchor at night and stopping to send
the boat ashore for milk for tea without which
it w r as impossible for the worthy old lady passengers
to subsist and then there were the
much talked perils the tappaan zee and
the highlands in short a prudent dutch burgher
would talk such a voyage for months and
even years before hand and never undertook
it without putting his affairs in order making
his will and having prayers said for him in the
low dutch churches
in the course such a voyage therefore
dolph was satisfied he would have time enough
to reflect and to make up his mind what he
should do when he arrived at albany the captain
with his blind eye and lame leg would it is
true bring his strange dream to mind and perplex
him sadly for a few moments but late his
life had been made up so much dreams arid
realities his nights and days had been so jumbled
together that he seemed to be moving continually
in a delusion there is always however
a kind vagabond consolation in a man's
adolph heyliger 
having nothing in this world to lose with this
dolph comforted his heart and determined
to make the most the present enjoyment
in the second day their voyage they came
to the highlands it was the latter part a
calm sultry day that they floated gently with
the tide between these stern mountains there
was that perfect quiet which prevails over nature
in the languor summer heat the turning
 a plank or the accidental falling an
oar on deck was echoed from the mountain side
and reverberated along the shores and if by
chance the captain gave a shout command
there were airy tongues that mocked it from
every cliff
dolph gazed about him in mute delight and
wonder at these scenes nature's magnificence
to the left the dunderberg heaved its woody
precipices height over height forest over forest
away into the deep summer sky to the right
strutted forth the bold promontory anthony's
nose with a solitary eagle wheeling about it 
while beyond mountain succeeded to mountain
 adolph heyliger
until they seemed to lock their arms together
and confine this mighty river in their embraces
there was a feeling quiet luxury in gazing
at the broad green bosoms here and there scooped
out among the precipices or at woodlands
high in air nodding over the edge some beetling
bluff and all transparent in the yellow
sunshine
in the midst his admiration dolph remarked
a pile bright snowy clouds peering above
the western heights it was succeeded by
another and another each seemingly pushing
onwards its predecessor and towering with dazzling
brilliancy in the deep blue atmosphere
and now muttering peals thunder were faintly
heard rolling behind the mountains the river
hitherto still and glassy reflecting pictures 
the sky and land now showed a dark ripple
at a distance as the breeze came creeping up it
the fish hawks wheeled and screamed and
sought their nests on the high dry trees the
crows flew clamorously to the crevices the
adolph heyliger 
rocks and all nature seemed conscious the approaching
thunder gust
the clouds now rolled in volumes over the
mountain tops their summits still bright and
snowy but the lower parts an inky blackness
the rain began to patter down in broad
and scattered drops the wind freshened and
curled up the waves at length it seemed as if
the bellying clouds were torn open by the mountain
tops and complete torrents rain came
rattling down the lightning leaped from cloud
to cloud and streamed quivering against the
rocks splitting and rending the stoutest forest
trees the thunder burst in tremendous explosions
 the peals were echoed from mountain to
mountain they crashed upon dunderberg and
then rolled up the long defile the highlands
each headland making a new echo until old
bull hill seemed to bellow back the storm
for a time the scudding rack and mist and
the sheeted rain almost hid the landscape from
the sight there was a fearful gloom illumined
still more fearfully by the streams lightning
 adolph heyliger
which glittered among the rain drops never
had dolph beheld such an absolute warring 
the elements it seemed as if the storm was
tearing and rending its way through this mountain
defile and had brought all the artillery 
heaven into action
the vessel was hurried on by the increasing
wind until she came to where the river makes
a sudden bend the only one in the whole course
 its majestic career just as they turned the
point a violent flaw wind came sweeping down
a mountain gully bending the forest before it
and in a moment lashing up the river into white
froth and foam the captain saw the danger
and cried out to lower the sail before the order
could be obeyed the flaw struck the sloop and
threw her on her beam ends every thing now
was fright and confusion the flapping the
sails the whistling and rushing the wind 
the bawling the captain and crew the shrieking
 the passengers all mingled with the rollthis
must have been the bend at west point
adolph heyliger 
ing and bellowing the thunder in the midst
 the uproar the sloop righted at the same
time the mainsail shifted the boom came sweeping
the quarterdeck and dolph who was gazing
unguardedly at the clouds found himself ina
moment floundering in the river
for once in his life one his idle accomplishments
was use to him the many truant
hours which he had devoted to sporting in the
hudson had made him an expert swimmer 
yet with all his strength and skill he found
great difficulty in reaching the shore his disappearance
from the deck had not been noticed
by the crew who were all occupied with their
own danger the sloop was driven along with
inconceivable rapidity she had hard work to
weather a long promontory on the eastern shore
round which the river turned and which completely
shut her from dolph's view
it was on a point the western shore that
he landed and scrambling up the rocks he
threw himself faint and exhausted at the foot
 a tree by degrees the thunder gust passed
 adolph heyliger
over the clouds rolled away to the east
where they lay piled in feathery masses tinted
with the last rosy rays the sun the distant
play the lightning might be still seen about
their dark bases and now and then might be
heard the faint muttering the thunder
dolph rose and sought about to see if any path
led from the shore but all was savage and
trackless the rocks were piled upon each
other great trunks trees lay shattered about
as they had been blown down by the strong
winds which draw through these mountains or
had fallen through age the rocks too were
overhung with wild vines and briars which
completely matted themselves together and opposed
a barrier to all ingress every movement
that he made shook down a shower from the
dripping foliage he attempted to scale one 
these almost perpendicular heights he was
strong and agile but he found it an herculean
undertaking often he was supported merely
by crumbling projections the rock and sometimes
he clung to roots and branches trees
adolph heyliger 
and hung almost suspended in the air the
wood pigeon came cleaving his whistling flight
by him and the eagle screamed from the brow
 the impending cliff as he was thus clambering
he was on the point seizing hold 
a shrub to aid his ascent when something rustled
swiftly among the leaves and he saw a snake
quivering along like lightning almost from under
his hand it coiled itself up immediately
in an attitude defiance with flattened head
distended jaws and quickly vibrating tongue
that played like a little flame about its mouth
dolph's heart turned faint within him and he
had well nigh let go his hold and tumbled
down the precipice the serpent stood on the
defensive but for an instant it was an instinctive
movement defence and finding there
was no attack it glided away into a cleft the
rock dolph's eye followed it with fearful intensity
and he saw at a glance that he was in
the vicinity a nest adders that lay knotted
and writhing and hissing in the chasm
he hastened with all speed to escape from so
vol 
 adolph heyliger
frightful a neighbourhood his imagination
was full this new horror he saw an adder
in every curling vine and heard the tail a rattle
snake in every dry leaf that rustled
at length he succeeded in scrambling to the
summit a precipice but it was covered by a
dense forest wherever he could gain a lookout
between the trees he saw that the coast rose
into heights and cliffs one rising beyond another
until huge mountains overtopped the whole
there were no signs cultivation nor any
smoke curling from among the trees to indicate
a human residence every thing was wild and
solitary as he was standing on the edge a
precipice that overlooked a deep ravine fringed
with trees his feet detached a great fragment 
rock it fell crashing its way through the treetops
down into the chasm a loud whoop or
rather a yell issued from the bottom the glen 
the moment after there was the report a gun
and a ball came whistling over his head cutting
the twigs and leaves and burying itself deep in
the bark a chestnut tree
adolph heyliger 
dolph did not wait for a second shot but made
a precipitate retreat fearing every moment to
hear the enemy in pursuit he succeeded however
in returning unmolested to the shore and
determined to penetrate no farther into a country
so beset with savage perils
he sat himself down dripping disconsolately
on a wet stone what was to be done where
was he to shelter himself the hour repose
was approaching the birds were seeking their
nests the bat began to flit about in the twilight 
and the night hawk soaring high in heaven seemed
to be calling out the stars night gradually
closed in and wrapped every thing in gloom and
though it was the latter part summer yet the
breeze stealing along the river and among these
dripping forests was chilly and penetrating
especially to a halfdrowned man
as he sat drooping and despondent in this comfortless
condition he perceived a light gleaming
through the trees near the shore where the
winding the river made a deep bay it
cheered him with the hopes that here might be
 adolph heyliger
some human habitation where he might get
something to appease the clamorous cravings 
his stomach and what was equally necessary in
his shipwrecked condition a comfortable shelter
for the night it was with extreme difficulty
that he made his way towards the light along
ledges rocks down which he was in danger
 sliding into the river and over great trunks
 fallen trees some which had been blown
down in the late storm and lay so thickly together
that he had to struggle through their
branches at length he came to the brow a
rock that overhung a small dell from whence
the light proceeded it was from a fire at the
foot a great tree that stood in the midst a
grassy interval or plat among the rocks the
fire cast up a red glare among the gray crags and
impending trees leaving chasms deep gloom
that looked like entrances to caverns a small
brook rippled close by betrayed by the quivering
reflection the frame there were two
figures moving about the fire and others squatted
before it as they were between him and
adolph heyliger 
the light they were in complete shadow but one
 them happening to move round to the opposite
side dolph was startled at perceiving by the
full glare falling on painted features and glittering
on silver ornaments that he was an indian
he now looked more narrowly and saw guns
leaning against a tree and a dead body lying on
the ground
dolph now began to doubt whether he was
not in a worse condition than before here was
the very foe that had fired at him from the glen
he endeavoured to retreat quietly not caring to
intrust himself to these half human beings in so
savage and lonely a place it was too late the
indian with that eagle quickness eye so remarkable
in his race perceived something stirring
among the bushes on the rock he seized
one the guns that leaned against the tree a
moment more and dolph might have had his
passion for adventure cured by a bullet he
hallooed loudly in the indian salutation friendship
the whole party sprang upon their feet 
the salutation was returned and the straggler
was invited to join them at the fire
 adolph heyliger
on approaching he found to his consolation
that the party was composed white men as
well as indians one who was evidently the
principal personage or commander was seated
on a trunk a tree before the fire he was a
large stout man somewhat advanced in life
but hale and hearty his face was bronzed almost
to the colour an indian's with strong
but rather jovial features an aquiline nose and
a mouth shaped like a mastiff's his face was
half thrown in shade by a broad hat with a
buck's tail in it his iron gray hair hung short
in his neck he wore a hunting frock with
indian leggings and mockasons and a tomahawk
in the broad wampum belt round his waist
as dolph caught a distinct view his person
and features he was struck with something that
reminded him the old man the haunted
house the man before him however was different
in his dress and age he was more cheery
too in his aspect and it was hard to define where
the vague resemblance lay but a resemblance
there certainly was dolph felt some degree 
adolph heyliger 
awe in approaching him but was assured by
the frank hearty welcome with which he was
received as he cast his eyes about too he
was still farther encouraged by perceiving that
the dead body which had caused him some alarm
was that a deer and his satisfaction was
complete in discovering by the savoury steams
which issued from a kettle suspended by a
hooked stick over the fire that there was a part
cooking for the evening's repast he now found
that he had fallen in with a rambling hunting
party such as often took place in those days
among the settlers along the river the hunter is
always hospitable and nothing makes men more
social and unceremonious than meeting in the
wilderness the commander the party
poured him out a dram cheering liquor which
he gave him with a merry leer to warm his
heart and ordered one his followers to fetch
some garments from a pinnace which was
moored in a cove close by while those in
which our hero was dripping might be dried
before the fire
 adolph heyliger
dolph found as he had suspected that the
shot from the glen which had come so near
giving him his quietus when on the precipice
was from the party before him he had nearly
crushed one them by the fragment rock
which he had detached and the jovial old
hunter in the broad hat and bucktail had fired
at the place where he saw the bushes move
supposing it to be some wild animal he
laughed heartily at the blunder it being what
is considered an exceeding good joke among
hunters but faith my lad said he if i
had but caught a glimpse you to take sight
at you would have followed the rock antony
vander heyden is seldom known to miss his
aim these last words were at once a clue
to dolph's curiosity and a few questions let
him completely into the character the man
before him and his band woodland rangers
the commander in the broad hat and
hunting frock was no less a personage than the
heer antony vander heyden albany 
whom dolph had many a time heard he was
adolph heyliger 
in fact the hero many a story being a man 
singular humours and whimsical habits that
were matters wonder to his quiet dutch neighbours
as he was a man property having
had a father before him from whom he inherited
large tracts wild land and whole barrels full
 wampum he could indulge his humours
without control instead staying quietly at
home eating and drinking at regular meal times
amusing himself by smoking his pipe on the
bench before the door and then turning into a
comfortable bed at night he delighted in all
kinds rough wild expeditions he was
never so happy as when on a hunting party in
the wilderness sleeping under trees or bark
sheds or cruising down the river or on some
woodland lake fishing and fowling and living
the lord knows how
he was a great friend to indians and to an
indian mode life which he considered true
natural liberty and manly enjoyment when at
home he had always several indian hangerson
who loitered about his house sleeping like
vol n 
 adolph heyliger
hounds in the sunshine or preparing hunting and
fishing tackle for some new expedition or shooting
at marks with bows and arrows over these
vagrant beings heer antony had as perfect command
as a huntsman over his pack though they
were great nuisances to the regular people his
neighbourhood as he was a rich man no one
ventured to thwart his humours indeed he had
a hearty joyous manner about him that made him
universally popular he would troll a dutch
song as he tramped along the street hail everyone
half a mile off and when he entered a house
he would slap the good man familiarly on his
back shake him by the hand till he roared and
kiss his wife and daughters before his face in
short there was no pride nor ill humour about
heer antony
beside his indian hangerson he had three
or four humble friends among the white men
who looked up to him as a patron and had the
run his kitchen and the favour being taken
with jim occasionally on his expeditions it
was with a medley such retainers that he was
adolph heyliger 
at present on a cruize along the shores the
hudson in a pinnace which he kept for his own
recreation there were two white men with
him dressed partly in the indian style with
mockasons and hunting shirts the rest his
crew consisted four favourite indians they
had been prowling about the river without any
definite object until they had found themselves
in the highlands where they had passed two or
three days hunting the deer which still lingered
among those mountains
it is a lucky circumstance young man
said antony vander heyden that you happened
to be knocked overboard today as tomorrow
morning we start early on our return
homewards and you might then have looked
in vain for a meal among these mountains
u but come lads stir about stir about let's
see what prog we have for supper the kettle
has boiled long enough my stomach cries cupboard
 and i'll warrant our guest is in no mood
to dally with his trencher
there was a bustle now in the little encamped
adolph heyliger
merit one took off the kettle and turned apart 
the contents into a huge wooden bowl another
prepared a flat rock for a table while a third
brought various utensils from the pinnace which
was moored close by and heer antony himself
brought a flask or two precious liquor from
his own private locker knowing his boon companions
too well to trust any them with the
key a rude but hearty repast was soon spread 
consisting smoking venison and cold bacon
with indian corn and round brown loaves 
good household bread never had dolph made
a more delicious repast and when he had washed
it down by two or three draughts from the
heer antony's flask and felt the jolly liquor sending
its warmth through his veins and glowing
round his heart he would not have changed his
situation no not with the governor the
province
the heer antony too grew chirping and
joyous he told half a dozen fat stories at which
his white followers laughed immoderately
though the indians as usual maintained an invincible
gravity this is your true life my
bolfh heyliger 
boy would he say slapping dolph on the
shoulder a man is never a man till he can
defy wind and weather range in the woods
sleep under a tree and live on bass wood leaves 
and then he would sit with his hat on one side
swaying a short squab dutch bottle in his hand
and sing a stave or two a dutch drinking
song to which his myrmidons would join in
chorus
with all his joviality however he mingled
discretion though he pushed the bottle unreservedly
to dolph yet he always took care to
help his followers himself and was particular in
only granting a certain allowance to the indians
heer antony knew the kind beings he had to
deal with
the repast was now at an the indians
had made their supper in silence from the contents
 the kettle and having drank their allowance
and smoked their pipes they wrapped
themselves in their blankets stretched themselves
on the ground with their feet to the fire and
soon fell asleep the others remained chatting
 adolph heyliger
before the fire which the gloom the forest and
the dampness the air from the late storm rendered
extremely comfortable and cheering
the conversation gradually moderated from
the hilarity supper time and turned upon
hunting adventures and exploits and perils in the
wilderness many which were so strange and
improbable that i will not venture to repeat
them lest the veracity heer antony and his
comrades be brought into question there were
many legendary tales told also about the river
and the settlements on its borders and as heer
antony sat in a twisted root a fallen tree that
served him for a kind arm chair and told these
wild stories with the fire gleaming on his strongly
marked face dolph was again repeatedly
struck with something in his looks that reminded
him the nightly visiter to the haunted house
the circumstance dolph's falling overboard
led to the relation anecdotes mishaps that
had befallen voyagers on this great river many
 which were attributed to supernatural causes
on dolph's staring at this suggestion antony
adolph heyliger 
vander heyden assured him that it was very
currently believed among the settlers along the
river that these highlands were under the dominion
 supernatural and mischievous beings 
which seemed particularly to vent their spleen
upon the dutch skippers some he said believed
them to be the evil spirits conjured up by
the indian wizards in the early times the
province to revenge themselves on the strangers
who had dispossessed them their country the
greater part however accounted for them by
the legend the storm ship which haunted
pointnopoint finding dolph to be utterly
ignorant this tradition heer antony undertook
to tell it in the very words in which it had
been written out by mynheer selon an early
poet the newnetherlands giving therefore
a stir to the fire he adjusted himself comfortably
in his root a tree and throwing back his
head and closing his eyes for a few moments to
summon up his recollection he related the follow t 
ing legend
 adolph heyliger
the storm ship
in the golden age the province the
new netherlands when it was under the sway
 outer van tiller otherwise called walter
the doubter the people the manhattoes
were alarmed one sultry afternoon just about
the time the summer solstice by a tremendous
storm thunder and lightning the rain descended
in such torrents as absolutely to spatter
up and smoke along the ground it seemed as
if the thunder rattled and rolled over the very
roofs the houses the lightning was seen
to play about the church st nicholas and
to strive three times in vain to strike its weather
cock garret van home's new chimney
was split almost from top to bottom and doffue
mildeberger was struck speechless from his baldfaced
mare just as as he was riding into town
in a word it was one those unparalleled
storms that only happen once within the meadolph
heyliger 
more that venerable personage known in all
towns by the appellation the oldest inhabitant

great was the terror the good old women
 the manhattoes they gathered their children
together and took refuge in the cellars after
having hung a shoe on the iron point every
bed post lest they should attract the lightning
at length the storm abated the thunder sunk
into a growl and the setting sun breaking from
under the fringed borders the clouds made
the broad bosom the bay to gleam like a sea
 molten gold
the word was given from the fort that a ship
was standing up the bay it passed from mouth
to mouth and street to street and soon put the
little capital in a bustle the arrival a ship
in those early times the settlement was an
event vast importance to the inhabitants it
brought them news from the old world from the
land their birth from which they were so completely
severed to the yearly ship too they
looked for their supply luxuries finery 
vol 
adolph heyliger
comforts and almost necessaries the good
vrouw could not have her new cap nor new
gown until the arrival the ship the artist
waited for it for his tools the burgomaster for
his pipe and his supply hollands the schoolboy
for his top and marbles and the lordly
landholder for the bricks with which he was to
build his new mansion thus every one rich
and poor great and small looked out for the arrival
 the ship it was the great yearly
event the town new amsterdam and
from one the year to the other the ship
the ship the ship was the continual topic
 conversation
the news from the fort therefore brought all
the populace down to the battery to behold the
wishedfor sight it was not exactly the time
when she had been expected to arrive and the
circumstance was a matter some speculation
many were the groups collected about the battery
here and there might be seen a burgomaster 
slow and pompous gravity giving his opinion
with great confidence to a crowd old women
adolph heyllger 
and idle boys at another place was a knot 
old weather beaten fellows who had been seamen
or fishermen in their times and were great
authorities on such occasions these gave different
opinions and caused great disputes among
their several adherents but the man most
looked up to and followed and watched by the
crowd was hans van pelt an old dutch sea captain
retired from service the nautical oracle 
the place he reconnoitred the ship through
an ancient telescope covered with tarry canvas
hummed a dutch tune to himself and said no
things hum however from hans van pek
had always more weight with the public thana
speech from another man
in the mean time the ship became more distinct
to the naked eye she was a stout round
dutch built vessel with high bow and poop and
bearing dutch colours the evening sun gilded
her bellying canvas as she came riding over
the long waving billows the sentinel who had
given notice her approach declared that he
first got sight her when she was in the centre
 adolph heyliger
 the bay and that she broke suddenly upon
his sight just as if she had come out the bosom
 the black thunder cloud the bystanders
looked at hans van pelt to see what he
would say to this report hans van pelt screwed
his mouth closer together and said nothing 
upon which some shook their heads and others
shrugged their shoulders
the ship was now repeatedly hailed but made
no reply and passing by the fort stood on up the
hudson a gun was brought to bear on her
and with some difficulty loaded and fired by
hans van pelt the garrison not being expert in
artillery the shot seemed absolutely to pass
through the ship and to skip along the water
on the other side but no notice was taken it
what was strange she had all her sails set and
sailed right against wind and tide which were
both down the river
upon this hans van pelt who was likewise
harbour master ordered his boat and set off to
board her but after rowing for two or three hours
he returned without success sometimes he
adolph heyliger 
would get within one or two hundred yards 
her and then in a twinkling she would be half
a mile off some said it w r as because his oarsmen
who were rather pursy and short winded
stopped every now and then to take breath and
spit on their hands but this it is probable was a
mere scandal h e got near enough however to
see the crew who were all dressed in the dutch
style the officers in doublets and high hats and
feathers not a word was spoken by any one
on board they stood as motionless as so many
statues and the ship seemed as ifleft to her own
government thus she kept on away up the
river lessening and lessening in the evening sunshine
until she faded from sight like a little
white cloud melting away in a summer sky
the appearance this ship threw the governor
into one the deepest doubts that ever beset
him in the whole course his administration
fears were entertained for the security the
infant settlements on the river lest this might
be an enemy's ship in disguise sent to take
possession the governor called together his
counsel repeatedly to assist him with their conadolph
heyliger
lectures he sat in his chair state built 
timber from the sacred forest the hague and
smoked his long jasmin pipe and listened to
all that his counsellors had to say on a subject
about which they knew nothing but in spite 
all the conjecturing the sagest and oldest heads
the governor still continued to doubt
messengers were despatched to different places
on the river but they returned without any
tidings the ship had made no port day after
dny and week after week elapsed but she never
returned down the hudson as however the
council seemed solicitous for intelligence they
soon had it in abundance the captains the
sloops seldom arrived without bringing some report
 having seen the strange ship at different
parts the river sometimes near the pallisadoes
 sometimes off croton point and sometimes
in the highlands but she was never reported
as having been seen above the highlands
the crews the sloops it is true generally differed
among themselves in their accounts 
these apparitions but that may have arisen
adolph heyliger 
from the uncertain situations in which they saw
her sometimes it was by the flashes a thunder
storm lighting up a pitchy night and giving
glimpses her careering across tappaan zee or
the wide waste haverstraw bay at one
moment she would appear close upon them as if
likely to run them down and would throw
them into great bustle and alarm when the next
flash would show her far off always sailing
against the wind sometimes in quiet moonlight
nights she would be seen under some high
bluff the highlands all in deep shadow excepting
her topsails glittering in the moonbeams
by the time however that the voyagers
would reach the place there would be no ship
to be seen and when they had passed on for
some distance and looked back behold there
she was again with her topsails in the moonshine
 her appearance was always just after
or just before or just in the midst unruly
weather and she was known by all the skippers
and voyagers the hudson by the name the
storm ship
 adolph heyligeu
these reports perplexed the governor and his
council more than ever and it would be endless
to repeat the conjectures and opinions that
were uttered on the subject some quoted
cases in point ships seen off the coast 
newengland navigated by witches and goblins
old hans van pelt who had been more
than once to the dutch colony at the cape 
good hope insisted that this must be the flying
dutchman which had so long haunted table
bay but being unable to make port had
now sought another harbour others suggested
that if it really was a supernatural apparition
as there was every natural reason to believe
it might be hendrick hudson and his crew 
the half moon who it was well known had
once run aground in the upper part the river
in seeking a northwest passage to china this
opinion had very little weight with the governor 
but it passed current out doors indeed it
had already been reported that hendrick hudson
and his crew haunted the kaatskill mountain
 and it appeared very reasonable to 
heyliger 
pose that his ship might infest the river where
the enterprise was baffled or that it might bear
the shadowy crew to their periodical revels in
the mountain
other events occurred to occupy the thoughts
and doubts the sage outer and his council 
and the storm ship ceased to be a subject 
deliberation at the board it continued however
to be a matter popular belief and marvellous
anecdote throughout the whole time 
the dutch goverment and particularly just before
the capture newamsterdam and the
subjugation the province by the english
squadron about that time the storm ship
was repeatedly seen in the tappaan zee about
weehawk and even down as far as hoboken
and her appearance was supposed to be ominous
 the approaching squall in public affairs
and the downfall dutch domination
since that time we have no authentic accounts
 her though it is said she still haunts
the highlands and cruises about pointnopoint
people who live along the river insist that they
vol n 
 adolph heyliger
sometimes see her in summer moonlight and
that in a deep still midnight they have heard
the chant her crew as if heaving the lead 
but sights and sounds are so deceptive along
the mountainous shores and about the wide
bays and long reaches this great river that
i confess i have very strong doubts upon the
subject
it is certain nevertheless that strange things
have been seen in these highlands in storms
which are considered as connected with the old
story the ship the captains the river
craft talk a little bulbousbottomed dutch
goblin in trunk hose and su garloaf d hat with
a speaking trumpet in his hand which they say
keeps about the dunderberg mountain they
declare that they have heard him in stormy
weather in the midst the turmoil giving orders
in low dutch for the piping up a fresh gust 
wind or the rattling off another thunder clap
that sometimes he has been seen surrounded by
a crew little imps in broad breeches and short
doublets tumbling head over heels in the rack
adolph meyliger
and mist and playing a thousand gambols in
the air or buzzing like a swarm flies about
antony's nose and that at such time the
hurryscurry the storm was always greatest
one time a sloop in passing by dunderberg
was overtaken by a thunderous that came
scouring down from the mountain and seemed
to burst just over the vessel though tight and
well ballasted yet she laboured dreadfully and
rocked until the water came over the gunwale
all the crew were amazed when it was discovered
that there was a little white sugarloaf hat on
the mast head w which was known at once for
the hat the heer the dunderberg nobody
however dared to climb to the mast head
and get rid this terrible hat the sloop continued
labouring and rocking as if she would
have rolled her mast overboard she seemed
in continual danger either upsetting or running
on shore in this way she drove quite
through the highlands until she had passed
pollopeps island where it is said the jurisdiction
 the dunderberg potentate ceases no
 adolph heyliger
sooner had she passed this bourne than the little
hat all at once spun up into the air like a top 
whirled up all the clouds into a vortex and
hurried them back to the summit the under
 while the sloop righted herself and sailed
on as quietly as if in a millpond nothing
saved her from utter wreck but the fortunate
circumstance having a horse shoe nailed
against the mast a wise precaution against evil
spirits which has since been adopted by all the
dutch captains that navigate this haunted river
there is another story told this foul weather
urchin by skipper daniel ouslesticker 
fishkill who was never known to tell a lie
he declared that in a severe squall he saw him
seated astride his bowsprit riding the sloop
ashore full butt against antony's nose
and that he was exorcised by dominie van
gibson esopus who happened to be onboard
and who sung the hymn st nicholas 
whereupon the goblin threw himself up in the
air like a ball and went off in a whirlwind
carrying away with him the nightcap the
adolph heyliger 
dominie's wife which was discovered the next

sunday morning hanging on the weathercock
 esopus church steeple at least forty miles
off after several events this kind had taken
place the regular skippers the river for a
long time did not venture to pass the under
without lowering their peak out homage
to the heer the mountain and it was
observed that all such as paid this tribute respect
were suffered to pass unmolested
such said antony vander heyden area
few the stories written down by selon the
poet concerning this storm ship which he affirms
to have brought this colony mischievous
imps into the province from some old ghostrid
den country europe i could give you a
host more if necessary for all the accidents
that so often befall the river craft in the highlands
are said to be tricks played off by these
 adolph heyliger
imps the dunderberg but i see that you are
nodding so let us turn in for the night
the moon had now just raised her silver
horns above the round back old bull hill 
and lit up the gray rocks and shagged forests 
and glittered on the waving bosom the river
the night dew was falling and the late gloomy
mountains began to soften and put on a gray
aerial tint in the dewy light the hunters stirred
the fire and threw on fresh fuel to qualify
the damp the night air they then prepared
a bed branches and dry leaves under a
ledge rocks for dolph while antony wander
heyden wrapping himself up in a huge coat
made skins stretched himself before the fire
it was some time however before dolph
could close his eyes he lay contemplating the
strange scene before him the wild w r gods and
rocks around the fire throwing fitful gleams on
the faces the sleeping savages and the heer
antony too who so singularly yet vaguely reminded
him the nightly visitant to the haunted
house now and then he heard the cry 
adolph heyliger 
some animal from the forest or the hooting 
the owl or the notes the whippoorwill which
seemed to abound among these solitudes or the
splash a sturgeon leaping out the river
and falling back full length on its placid surface
he contrasted all this with his accustomed nest
in the garret room the doctor's mansion 
where the only sounds he heard at night were
the church clock telling the hour the drowsy
voice the watchman drawling out that all was
well the deep snoring the doctor's clubbed
nose from below stairs or the cautious labours
 some carpenter rat gnawing in the wainscot
his thoughts then wandered to his poor old
mother what would she think his mysterious
disappearance what anxiety and distress
would she not suffer this was the thought that
would continually intrude itself to mar his present
enjoyment it brought with it a feeling 
pain and compunction and he fell asleep with
the tears yet standing in his eyes
were this a mere tale fancy here would
be a fine opportunity for weaving in strange 
adolph heyliger
ventures among these wild mountains and roving
hunters and after involving my hero ina
variety perils and unheardof difficulties
rescuing him from them all by some miraculous
contrivance but as this is absolutely a true
story i must content myself with simple facts
and keep to probabilities
at an early hour the next day therefore after
a hearty morning's meal the encampment
broke up and our adventurers embarked in the
pinnace antony vander heyden there being
no wind for the sails the indians rowed her
gently along keeping time to a kind chant
 one the white men the day was serene
and beautiful the river without a wave and
as the vessel cleft the glassy water it left a long
undulating track behind the crows who had
scented the hunters banquet were already
gathering and hovering in the air just where a
column thin blue smoke rising from among
the trees showed the place their last night's
quarters as they coasted along the bases 
the mountains the heer antony pointed out to
adolph heyliger 
dolph a bald eagle the sovereign these regions
who sat perched on a dry tree that projected
over the river and with eye turned upwards
seemed to be drinking in the splendour
 the morning sun their approach disturbed
the monarch's meditations he first spread one
wing and then the other balanced himself fora
moment and then quitting his perch with
dignified composure wheeled slowly over their
heads dolph snatched up a gun and sent a
whistling ball after him that cut some the
feathers from his wing the report the gun
leaped sharply from rock to rock and awakened
a thousand echoes but the monarch the
air sailed calmly on ascending higher and higher
and wheeling widely as he ascended soaring
up the green bosom the woody mountain
until he disappeared over the brow a beetling
precipice dolph felt in a manner rebuked by
this proud tranquillity and almost reproached
himself for having so wantonly insulted this
majestic bird heer antony told him laughing
to remember that he was not yet out the tervol
n 
 adolph heyligelt
histories the lord the dunderberg and an old
indian shook his head and observed that there
was bad luck in killing an eagle the hunter on
the contrary should always leave horn a portion
 his spoils
nothing however occurred to molest them
on their voyage they passed pleasantly through
these magnificent and lonely scenes until they
came to where pollopel's island lies like a floating
bower at the extremity the highlands
here they landed until the heat the day should
abate or a breeze spring up that might supersede
the labour the oar some prepared the midday
meal while others reposed under the shade
 the trees in luxurious summer indolence 
looking drowsily forth upon the beauty the
scene on the one side were the highlands
vast and cragged feathered to the top with forests
and throwing their shadows on the glassy
water that dimpled at their feet on the other
side was a wide expanse the river like a
broad lake with long sunny reaches and green
headlands and the distant line shawungunk
adolph heyliger 
mountains waving along a clear horizon or chequered
by a fleecy cloud
but i forbear to dwell on the particulars 
their cruize along the river this vagrant amphibious
life careering across silver sheets 
water coasting wild woodland shores banquetting
on shady promontories with the spreading
tree overhead the river curling its light foam
to one's feet and distant mountain and rock and
tree and snowy cloud and deep blue sky all
mingling in summer beauty before one all this
though never cloying in the enjoyment would
be but tedious in narration
when encamped by the water side some 
the party would go into the woods and hunt 
others would fish sometimes they would amuse
themselves by shooting at a mark by leaping by
running by wrestling and dolph gained great
favour in the eyes antony vander hey den
by his skill and adroitness in all these exercises
which the heer considered as the highest 
manly accomplishments
 adolph heyligek
thus did they coast jollily on choosing only
the pleasant hours for voyaging sometimes in
the cool morning dawn sometimes in the sober
evening twilight and sometimes when the
moonshine spangled the crisp curling waves
that whispered along the sides their little bark
never had dolph felt so completely in his element
 never had he met with any thing so completely
to his taste as this wild haphazard life
he was the very man to second antony vander
heyden in his rambling humours and gained
continually on his affections the heart the
old bushwhacker yearned towards the young
man who seemed thus growing up in his own
likeness and as they approached the their
voyage he could not help inquiring a little into
his history dolph frankly told him his course
 life his severe medical studies his little proficiency
and his very dubious prospects the
heer vas shocked to find that such amazing
talents and accomplishments were to be cramped
and buried under a doctor's wig he had a sovereign
contempt for the healing art having never
adolph heyliger 
had any other physician than the butcher he
bore a mortal grudge to all kinds study also
ever since he had been flogged about an unintelligible
 when he was a boy but to think
that a young fellow like dolph such wonderful
abilities who could shoot fish run jump
ride and wrestle should be obliged to roll pills
and administer juleps for a living twas monstrous
 he told dolph never to despair but to
throw physic to the dogs for a young fellow
 his prodigious talents could never fail to make
his way as you seem to have no acquaintance
in albany said heer antony you shall go
home with me and remain under my roof until
you can look about you and in the mean time y
we can take an occasional bout at shooting and
fishing for it is a pity such talents should be
idle
dolph who was at the mercy chance was
not hard to be persuaded indeed on turning
over matters in his mind which he did very sagely
and deliberately he could not but think that antony
vander heyden was somehow or other 
 adolph heyligek
connected with the story the haunted house 
that the misadventure in the highlands which
had thrown them so strangely together was
somehow or other to work out something
good in short there is nothing so convenient as
this somehow or other way accommodating
one's self to circumstances it is the mainstay
 a heedless actor and tardy reasoner like
dolph heyliger and he who can in this loose
easy way link foregone evil to anticipated good
possesses a secret happiness almost equal to
the philosopher's stone
on their arrival at albany the sight dolph's
companion seemed to cause universal satisfaction
many were the greetings at the river side
and the salutations in the streets the dogs
bounded before him the boys whooped as he
passed every body seemed to know antony
vander heyden dolph followed on in silence
admiring the neatness this worthy burgh for
in those days albany was in all its glory inhabited
almost exclusively by the descendants 
the original dutch settlers it had not as yet
adolph heyliger 
been discovered and colonized by the restless
people newengland every thing was quiet
and orderly every thing was conducted calmly
and leisurely no hurry no bustle no struggling
and scrambling for existence the grass
grew about the unpaved streets and relieved the
eye by its refreshing verdure tall sycamores
or pendent willows shaded the houses with caterpillars
swinging in long silken strings from
their branches or moths fluttering about like
coxcombs in joy at their gay transformation
the houses were built in the old dutch style
with the gable ends towards the street the
thrifty housewife was seated on a bench before
her door in a close crimped cap bright flowered
gown and white apron busily employed in knitting
the husband smoked his pipe on the opposite
bench and the little pet negro girl seated
on the step at her mistress feet was industriously
plying her needle the swallows sported
about the eaves or skimmed along the streets
and brought back some rich booty for their clamorous
young and the little housekeeping wren
 adolph heyliger
flew in and out a lilliputian house or an old
hat nailed against the wall the cows were
coming home lowing through the streets to be
milked at their owners doors and if perchance
there were any loiterers some negro urchin with
a long goad was gently urging them homewards
as dolph's companion passed on he received
a tranquil nod from the burghers and a friendly
word from their wives all calling him familiarly
by the name anton j for it was the custom
in this strong hold the patriarchs where they
had all grown up together from childhood to
call every one by the christian name the
heer did not pause to have his usual jokes with
them for he was impatient to reach his home
at length they arrived at his mansion it was
 some magnitude in the dutch style with
large iron figures on the gables that gave the
date its erection and showed that it had been
built in the earliest times the settlement
the news heer antony's arrival had preceded
him and the whole household was on
the look out a crew negroes large and
dolfh heyliger 
small had collected in front the house to receive
him the old whiteheaded ones who
had grown gray in his service grinned for joy
and made many awkward bows and grimaces 
and the little ones capered about his knees but
the most happy being in the household was a
little plump blooming lass his only child and
the darling his heart she came bounding
out the house but the sight a strange
young man with her father called up for a moment
all the bashfulness a homebred damsel
dolph gazed at her with wonder and delight
never had he seen as he thought any thing so
comely in the shape woman she was dressed
in the good old dutch taste with long stays
and full short petticoats so admirably adapted to
show and set off the female form her hair
turned up under a small round cap displayed
the fairness her forehead she had fine blue
laughing eyes a trim slender waist and soft
swell but in a word she was a little dutch
divinity and dolph who never stopped half
vol 
 adolph heyliger
way in a new impulse fell desperately in love
with her
dolph was now ushered into the house with
a hearty welcome in the interior was a mingled
display heer antony's taste and habits and
the opulence his predecessors the chambers
were furnished with good old carved mahogany
the beaufets and cupboards glittered with embossed
silver and painted china over the parlour
fireplace was as usual the family coat 
arms painted and framed above which was a
long duck fowling piece flanked by an indian
pouch and a powderhorn the room was decorated
with many indian articles such as pipes
 peace tomahawks scalping knives hunting
pouches and belts wampum and there were
various kinds fishing tackle and two or three
fowling pieces in the corners the household
affairs seemed to be conducted in some measure
after the master's humours corrected perhaps
by a little quiet management the daughter's
there was a great degree patriarchal simplicity
and good humoured indulgence the neadolph
heyliger 
goes came into the room without being called
merely to look at their master and hear his
adventures they would stand listening at the
door until he had finished a story and then go
off on a broad grin to repeat it in the kitchen
a couple pet negro children were playing
about the floor with the dogs and sharing with
them their bread and butter all the domestics
looked hearty and happy and when the table
was set for the evening repast the variety and
abundance good household luxuries bore testimony
to the open handed liberality the heer
and the notable housewifery his daughter
in the evening there dropped in several the
worthies the place the van rensselaer
and the gansevoorts and the rosebooms and
others antony vander heyden's intimates
to hear an account his expedition for he was
the sindbad albany and his exploits and adventures
were favourite topics conversation
among the inhabitants while these sat gossiping
together about the door the hall and
telling long twilight stories dolph was cosily
 adolph heyliger
seated entertaining the daughter on a window
bench he had already got on intimate terms
for those were not times false reserve and
idle ceremony and besides there is something
wonderfully propitious to a lover's suit in th
delightful dusk a long summer evening it
gives courage to the most timid tongue and
hides the blushes the bashful the stars
alone twinkled brightly and now and then a
firefly streamed his transient light before the
window or wandering into the room flew
gleaming about the ceiling
what dolph whispered in her ear that long
summer evening it is impossible to say his
words were so low and indistinct that they have
never reached the ear the historian it is
probable however that they were to the purpose
for he had a natural talent at pleasing the
sex and was never long in company with a petticoat
without paying proper court to it in
the mean time the visitors one by one departed
antony vander heyden who had fairly talked
himself silent sat nodding alone in his chair by
adolph heyliger 
the door when he was suddenly aroused by the
hearty salute with which dolph heyliger had
unguardedly rounded off one his periods and
which echoed through the still chamber like the
report a pistol the heer started up rubbed
his eyes called for lights and observed that it
was high time to go to bed on parting for the
night he squeezed dolph heartily by the hand 
looked waggishly in his face shook his head
knowingly ah dolph dolph said he
chuckling i see you're a sly dogjust like i
was at your age 
the chamber in which our hero was lodged
was spacious and panelled with oak it was
furnished with clothes presses and mighty chests
 drawers well waxed and glittering with brass
ornaments these contained ample stock 
family linen for the dutch housewives had always
a laudable pride in showing off their household
treasures to strangers
dolph's mind however was too full to take
particular note the objects around him yet
he could not help continually comparing the free
 adolph heyligek
openhearted cheeriness this establishment
with the starveling sordid joyless housekeeping
at doctor knypperhausen's still there was
something that marred the enjoyment the idea
that he must take leave his hearty host and
pretty hostess and cast himself once more adrift
upon the world to linger here would be folly
he should only get deeper in love and for a
poor varlet like himself to aspire to the daughter
 the great heer vander heyden it was
madness to think such a thing the very
kindness that the girl had shown towards him
prompted him on reflection to hasten his departure
 it would be a poor return for the frank
hospitality his host to entangle his daughter's
heart in an injudicious attachment in a word
dolph was like many other young reasoners 
exceeding good hearts and giddy heads who
think after they act and act differently from what
they think who make excellent determinations
over night and forget to keep them the next
morning
adolph heyliger 
this is a fine conclusion truly my voyage
said he as he almost buried himself in a
sumptuous feather bed and drew the fresh white
sheets up to his chin here am i instead 
finding a bag money to carry home launched
in a strange place with scarcely a stiver in my
pocket and what is worse have jumped ashore
up to my very ears in love into the bargain
however added he after some pause stretching
himself and turning in bed i'm in good
quarters for the present at least so i'll e'en
enjoy the present moment and let the next take
care itself i dare say all will work out
some how or other for the best
as he said these words he reached out his hand
to extinguish the candle when he was suddenly
struck with astonishment and dismay for he
thought he beheld the spectre the haunted
house staring at him from a dusky part the
chamber a second look reassured him as he
perceived that what he had taken for the spectre
was in fact nothing but a flemish portrait that
hung in a shadowy corner just behind a clothes
 adolph heyliger
press it was however the precise representation
 his nightly visiter the same cloak and
belted jerkin the same grizzled beard and fixed
eye the same broad slouched hat with a feather
hanging over one side dolph now called to
mind the resemblance he had frequently remarked
between his host and the old man the haunted
house and was fully convinced that they were
in some way connected and that some especial
destiny had governed his voyage he lay gazing
on the portrait with almost as much awe as he
had gazed on the ghostly original until the
shrill house clock warned him the lateness 
the hour he put out the light but remained
for a long time turning over these curious circumstances
and coincidences in his mind until
he fell asleep his dreams partook the nature
 his waking thoughts he fancied that he
still lay gazing on the picture until by degrees
it became animated that the figure descended
from the wall and walked out the room
that he followed it and found himself by the
well to which the old man pointed smiled on
him and disappeared
rolph heyliger 
in the morning when dolph waked he found
his host standing by his bed side who gave him
a hearty morning's salutation and asked him how
he had slept dolph answered cheerily and took
the occasion to inquire about the portrait that
hung against the wall ah said heer antony
 that's a portrait old killian vanderspie
gel once a burgomaster amsterdam who on
some popular troubles abandoned holland and
came over to the province during the government
 peter stuyvesant he was my ancestor
by the mother's side and an old miserly curmudgeon
he was when the english took
possession new amsterdam in he retired
into the country he fell into a melancholy
apprehending that his wealth would betaken
from him and that he would come to
beggary he turned all his property into cash
and used to hide it away he was for a year
or two concealed in various places fancying
himself sought after by the english to strip him
 his wealth and finally was found dead in
his bed one morning without any one being
vol h 
 adolph heylgek
able to discover where he had concealed the
greater part his money
when his host had left the room dolph remained
for some time lost in thought his
whole mind was occupied by what he had
heard vanderspiegel was his mother's family
name and he recollected to have heard her
speak this very killian vanderspiegel as one
 her ancestors he had heard her say too
that her father was killian's rightful heir only
that the old man died without leaving any thing
to be inherited it now appeared that heer
antony was likewise a descendant and perhaps
an heir also this poor old rich man 
and that thus the heyligers and the vander
hey dens were remotely connected what
thought he if after all this is the interpretation
 my dream j that this is the way i am to
make my fortune by this voyage to albany
and that i am to find the old man's hidden
wealth in the bottom that well but
what an odd roundabout mode communicating
the matter why the vengeance could not
adolph heyliger 
the old goblin have told me about the well at
once without sending me all the way to albany
to hear a story that was to send me all
the way back again 
these thoughts passed through his mind ashe
was dressing he descended the stairs full
 perplexity when the bright face marie
vander heyden suddenly beamed in smiles
upon him and seemed to give him a clue to the
whole mystery after all thought he the
old goblin is in the right if am to get his
wealth he means that i shall marry his pretty
descendant thus both branches the family
will be again united and the property go on in
the proper channel
no sooner did this idea enter his head than it
carried conviction with it he was now all impatience
to hurry back and secure the treasure 
which he did not doubt lay at the bottom 
the well and which he feared every moment
might be discovered by some other person
who knows thought he but this nightwalking
old fellow the haunted house may
 adolph heyliger
be in the habit haunting every visiter and may
give a hint to some shrewder fellow than myself
who will take a shorter cut to the well than by
the way albany he wished a thousand
times that the babbling old ghost was laid in the
red sea and his rambling portrait with him
he was in a perfect fever to depart two or
three days elapsed before any opportunity presented
for returning down the river they were
ages to dolph notwithstanding that he was
basking in the smiles the pretty marie and
daily getting more and more enamoured at
length the very sloop from which he had been
knocked overboard prepared to make sail dolph
made an awkward apology to his host for his
sudden departure antony vaiider heyden was
sorely astonished he had concerted half a
dozen excursions into the wilderness and his
indians were actually preparing for a grand expedition
to one the lakes he took dolph
aside and exerted his eloquence to get him to
give up all thoughts business and to remain
with him but in vain and he at length gave
adolph heyliger 
up the attempt observing that it was a thousand
pities so fine a young man should throw
himself away heer antony however gave
him a hearty shake by the hand at parting with
a favourite fowling piece and an invitation to
come to his house whenever he revisited albany
the pretty little marie said nothing but as he
gave her a farewell kiss her dimpled cheek
turned pale and a tear stood in her eye
dolph sprang lightly on board the vessel
they hoisted sail the wind was fair they
soon lost sight albany and its green hills
and embowered islands they were wafted
gaily past the kaatskill mountains whose fairy
heights were bright and cloudless they passed
prosperously through the highlands without
any molestation from the dunderberg goblin and
his crew they swept on across haverstraw
bay and by croton point and through the
tappaan zee and under the pallisadoes until
on the afternoon the third day they saw the
promontory hoboken hanging like a cloud in
 adolph heyliger
the air and shortly after the roofs the manbattles
rising out the water
dolph's first care was to repair to his mother's
house for he was continually goaded by the
idea the uneasiness she must experience on
his account on his way thither he endeavoured
to arrange some mode accounting for his
absence but felt sadly at a loss for with all his
heedlessness he was naturally frank and sincere
and had never deceived her he had conned
over something that he thought would do when
on entering the street in which her house was
situated he was thunderstruck on beholding ita
heap ruins there had been a great fire
which had destroyed several large houses and
the humble dwelling poor dame heyliger had
been involved in the conflagration the walls
were not so completely destroyed but that dolph
could perceive some traces the scene humble
quiet the scene his childhood the fireplace
with a few the tiles yet remained
though shattered to pieces the wreck the
good old dame's elbow chair and her dutch
adolph heyliger 
family bible reduced almost to a cinder lay
among the rubbish for a moment dolph's
head reeled he was stunned as with a blow 
but the next was a moment excruciating
agony for the idea rushed to his mind that she
had perished in the flames he was relieved
from the worst his fears by one the neighbours
who informed him that his mother was
yet alive but that overcome with fright and
affliction she lay ill at the house old peter
che groodt where she had taken refuge
dolph hastened thither with the penitent
feeling the prodigal son he recalled all
her tenderness her unwearied attention to his
comfort her indulgence his errors her
fond blindness to his faults and then he reflected
on his own idleness and want consideration
 only let her live said dolph
mentally and clasping his hands and i'll
show myself indeed a son 
he found old peter de groodt coming out
 the house peter started back on seeing
him and was for a moment doubtful whether
 adolph heyliger
it was not a ghost that stood before him then
shaking his head he pointed to the door ah
young man young man you're in a hopeful
way truly go in go in and see your poor
mother more sick on your account than her
own
it required some preparation however before
dolph's return could be made known to his
mother and even then the news almost overcame
her when he was admitted to see her
he sunk down beside her bed the poor woman
threw her arms round his neck my boy
my boy art thou still alive for a time she
seemed to have forgotten all her losses and
troubles in her joy at his return at length
recollecting herself ah my poor dolph 
said she thy mother can help thee no longer 
she can no longer help herself what will
become thee my poor son 
mother said dolph don't talk in that
way i've been too long a charge upon you
it's now my part to take care you in your old
days but come be good heart i'm here
adolph heyliger 
again sound and hearty something will yet
turn up things will all olph heyliger
was filled with broad golden pieces a coinage
which he had never seen before it was evident
he had lit on the place where old killian
vanderspiegel had concealed his treasure
fearful being seen by some straggler he
cautiously retired and buried his pot money
in a secret place he now spread terrible stones
about the haunted house and deterred
every one from approaching it while he made
frequent visits to it in stormy days when no one
was stirring in the neighbouring fields though
to tell the truth he did not care to venture therein
the dark for once in his life he was diligent
and industrious and followed up his new
trade angling with such perseverance and
success that in a little while he had hooked up
wealth enough to make him in those moderate
days a rich burgher for life
it would be tedious to detail minutely the
rest his story to tell how he gradually
managed to bring his property into use without
exciting surprise and inquiry how he satisfied
all scruples with regard to retaining the proadolph
heyliger 
party and at the same time gratified his own
feelings by marrying the pretty marie vander
hey den and how he and heer antony had
many a merry and roving expedition together
i must not omit to say however that dolph
took his mother home to live with him and cherished
her in her old days the good dame too
had the satisfaction no longer hearing her son
made the theme censure on the contrary he
grew daily in public esteem every body spoke
well him and his wines and the loveliest
burgomaster was never known to decline his invitation
to dinner dolph often related at his
own table the wicked pranks which had once
been the abhorrence the town but they were
now considered excellent jokes and the gravest
dignitary was ready to die with laughing at them
no one was more struck with dolph's increasing
merit than his old master the doctor and
so forgiving was dolph in his temper that he
absolutely employed the doctor as his family
physician only taking care that his prescriptions
should always be thrown out the 
adolph heylioer
dow his mother had often her junto old
cronies to take a snug cup tea with her in her
comfortable little parlour and peter de groodt
as he sat by the fire side with one her grandchildren
on his knee would many a time congratulate
her upon her son's turning out so great
a man upon which the good old soul would
wag her head with exultation and exclaim ah
neighbour neighbour did i not say that dolph
would one day or other hold up his head with
the best them 
thus did dolph heyliger go on cheerily
and prosperously growing merrier as he grew
older and wiser and completely falsifying the
old proverb about money got over the devil's
back for he made good use his wealth and
became a distinguished citizen and a valuable
member the community he was a great
promoter public institutions such as beefsteak
societies and catch clubs he presided
at all public dinners and was the first that introduced
turtle from the west indies he improved
the breed race horses and game cocks 
adolph heyliger 
he was a great patron modest merit insomuch
that any one who could sing a good song
or tell a good story was sure to find a place at
his table and his benevolence became so well
known that every now and then a bantling was
laid at his door which he never failed to take
into the house and cherish as his own
he was a member too the corporation made
several laws for the protection game and oysters
and bequeathed to the board a large silver
punch bowl made out the identical porringer
before mentioned and which is in the possession
 the corporation to this very day
finally he died at a florid and jolly old age
 an apoplexy at a corporation feast and was
buried with great honours in the yard the little
dutch church in garden street where his
tombstone may still be seen with an epitaph in
dutch verse by his friend mynheer justus benson
an ancient and excellent poet the manbattles

the foregoing tale rests on better authority
than most tales the kind as i have it at second
 adolph heyliger
hand from the lips dolph hejliger himself
he never related it until towards the latter part
 his life and then in great confidence for he
was very discreet to a few particular cronies at
his own table over an extra bowl punch 
and strange as the hobgoblin parts the story
may seem there never was a single doubt expressed
on the subject by any his guests it
may not be amiss before concluding to observe
that in addition to his other accomplishments
dolph heyliger was noted for being the ablest
drawer the long bow in the whole province
the wedding
no more no more much honor aye betide
the lofty bridegroom and the lovely bride
that their succeeding days and years may say
each day appears like to a marriage day
braithttaite
the fair julia having recovered from the
effects her fall the day for the wedding was
at length appointed as it drew near there rose
several doubts and conversations between lady
lilly craft master simon and the parson on the
subject marrying in the month may 
against which i find there is an ancient prejudice
as being an unfortunate month for matrimony
from the discussions that took place
on these occasions i picked up much valuable
information relative to weddings such as that
if there were two celebrated in the same church
tol n 
 the wedding
on the same day the first would be happy the
second otherwise if in going to church they
should meet the funeral a female the bride
would die first if a male the bridegroom
if the new married couple were to dance together
on their wedding day the wife would
thenceforth rule the roast with many more curious
facts the same kind which made me
ponder more than ever upon the perils which
surround this happy state and how little men
know the awful risks they run in venturing upon
it i abstain however from enlarging on this
topic as i have no wish to promote the increase
 bachelors
the squire however though he gave due
weight to all these ancient saws yet had a host
 poetical authorities in favour this loving
month which i suppose were conclusive with
the young couple as i found they were perfectly
willing to marry in may and abide the consequences

the wedding has accordingly taken place at
the village church in presence a numerous
the wedding 
company relations and friends and many 
the tenantry the squire must needs have
something the old ceremonies observed on the
occasion so at the gate the churchyard
several little girls the village dressed in white
were in readiness with baskets flowers which
they strewed before the bride and the butler
bore before her the bride cup a great embossed
silver bowl one the family reliques from the
days the hard drinkers this was filled with
rich wine and decorated with a branch rosemary
tied with gay ribbands according to ancient
custom
happy is the bride that the sun shines on
says the old proverb and it was as sunny and
auspicious a morning as heart could wish the
bride looked uncommonly beautiful but in
fact what woman does not look interesting on her
wedding day there is something extremely
touching in the appearance a young and timid
bride in her robes virgin white led up trembling
to the altar when thus i behold a lovely
girl in the tenderness her years forsaking her
 the wedding
father's house and the home her childhood
and giving herself up with implicit confiding to
the man her choice in the good old language
 the ceremony for better for worse for
richer for poorer in sickness and in health to
love honour and obey till death us do part
it brings to my mind the beautiful self devotion
 ruth whither thou goes i will go and
where thou longest i will lodge thy people shall
be my people and thy god my god
the fair julia was supported on the trying
occasion by lady lillycraft whose heart was
overflowing with its wonted sympathy in all
matters love and matrimony as the bride
approached the altar her face would be one moment
covered with blushes and the next deadly
pale and she seemed almost ready to shrink from
sight among her female companions i do not
know what it is that makes every one serious
and as it were awe struck at a marriage ceremony
 which is generally considered as an occasion
 festivity and rejoicing as the ceremony
was performing i observed many a rosy
the wedding 
face among the country girls turn pale and i
did not see a smile throughout the church the
young ladies from the hall were almost as much
frightened as if it had been their own case and
stole many a look sympathy at their trembling
companion a tear stood in the eye the sensitive
lady lillycraft and as to phoebe wilkins
who was present the soft hearted baggage absolutely
wept and sobbed aloud but it is hard to
tell half the time what these fond foolish creatures
are crying about
the captain too though naturally gay and
unconcerned was much agitated on the occasion
and in attempting to put the ring upon the
bride's finger dropped it on the floor which i am
since told is a very lucky omen even master
simon had lost his usual vivacity and had assumed
a most whimsically solemn face which
he is apt to do on all occasions ceremony
he had much whispering with the parson and
parish clerk for he is always a busy personage
in the scene and he echoed the clerk's amen
with a solemnity and devotion that edified the
whole assemblage
 the wedding
the moment however that the ceremony
was over the transition was magical the
bride cup was passed round according to ancient
usage for the company to drink to a
happy union every one's feelings seemed to
break forth from restraint master simon had a
world bachelor pleasantries to utter and
as to the gallant general he bowed and cooed
about the dulcet lady lillycraft like a mighty
cock pigeon about his dame
the villagers gathered in the churchyard to
cheer the happy couple as they left the church
and the musical tailor had marshalled his band
and set up a hideous discord as the blushing
and smiling bride passed through a lane honest
peasantry to her carriage the children
shouted and threw up their hats the bells rang
a merry peal that threatened to bring down the
battlements the old tower and set all the
crows and rooks flying and cawing about the
air and there was a continual popping off 
rusty firelock from every part the neighbourhood

the wedding 
the prodigal son distinguished himself on
the occasion but had nearly done mischief as
the horses the bride's carriage took fright
from the discharge a row old gun barrels
which he had mounted as a park artillery in
front the school house to give the captain a
military salute as he passed
the day passed off with great rustic rejoin
kings tables were spread under the trees in
the park where all the peasantry the neighbourhood
were regaled with roast beef and
plum pudding and oceans ale ready money
jack presided at one the tables and became
so full good cheer as to unbend from
his usual gravity sing a song out all tune
and give two or three shouts laughter that
almost electrified his neighbours like so many
peals thunder slingsbyby the schoolmaster
and the apothecary vied with each
other in making speeches over their liquor and
there were occasional glees and musical performances
by the village band that must have
 the wedding
frightened every fawn and dryad from the
park
old christy even was warmed into a flow on
the occasion he appeared newly equipped
from top to toe with bright leather breeches
and a great wedding favour flaunting in his
jockey cap the old man drank health and
happiness to the young couple at least a dozen
times and ended by dancing a hornpipe on
one the tables to the great astonishment 
the whole world
equal gayety reigned within doors where a
large party friends were entertained everyone
laughed at his own pleasantry without attending
to that his neighbour's the bride
cup was carried about according to ancient form
and loads bride cake distributed the young
ladies were all busy in passing morsels cake
through the wedding ring to dream on and i
myself assisted a fine little boarding school girl
in putting up a quantity for her companions
which i have no doubt will set all the little
heads in the school gadding for a week to come
the wedding 
in the evening we were entertained by a display
 fireworks got up by the schoolmaster
and apothecary with the assistance the prodigal
son whom the squire talks making his
gamekeeper by way reward for his extraordinary
services the village also was generally
illuminated excepting the house the radical
who has not shown his face during the rejoin
kings
one wedding makes many says an old proverb
and i should not be surprised if it holds
good in the present instance i have seen several
flirtations among the young people that have
been brought together on this occasion master
simon however has told me in great confidence
that he thinks the old general's case is
desperate with lady lillycraft she having determined
that he is quite destitute sentiment
it is with some concern therefore that i have
seen him throwing away tender glances upon
her at the w r adding dinner during the changing
 the dishes
i am told moreover that young jack tibi
 
 the wedding
bets was so touched by the wedding ceremony
at which he was present and captivated by the
sensibility poor phoebe wilkins that he had
a reconciliation with her that very day after dinner
in one the groves the park and danced
with her at the village in the evening to the
complete confusion old dame tibbets
domestic politics
what is more lady lillycraft who with her
usual benevolence in all concerns the heart
had lately taken an interest in this love affair
on hearing the reconciliation the lovers
undertook the critical task breaking the matter
to ready money jack she thought there
was no time like the present and attacked the
sturdy old yeoman that very evening in the park
while his heart was yet lifted up with the squire's
good cheer jack was a little surprised at being
drawn aside by her ladyship but was not to be
flurried by such anhonour he was still more
surprised by the nature her communication 
and this first intelligence an affair that had
been passing under his eye he listened howthe
wedding 
ever with his usual gravity as her ladyship represented
the advantages the match the good
qualities the girl and the distress which all
parties had lately suffered at length his eye began
to kindle and his hand to play with the
head his cudgel lady lillycraft saw that
something in the narrative had gone wrong
and hastened to mollify his rising ire by reiterating
the soft hearted phoebe's merit and
fidelity and her great unhappiness when old
ready money suddenly interrupted her by
exclaiming that if jack did not marry the
wench he'd break every bone in his body 
the match therefore is considered a settled
thing dame tibbets and the housekeeper have
made friends and drank tea together and phoebe
has again recovered her good looks and good
spirits and is caroling from morning till night
like a lark
but the most whimsical caprice cupid is
one that i should be almost afraid to mention
did i not know that i was writing for readers
well experienced in the waywardness this
 the wedding
most mischievous deity the morning after
the wedding therefore while lady lillycraft
was making preparations for her departure an
audience was requested by her immaculate handmaid
mrs hannah who with much primming
 the mouth and many maidenly hesitations
requested leave to stay behind and that lady
lillycraft would supply her place with some
other servant her ladyship was thunderstruck 
what hannah going to quit her that had lived
with her so long 
why one could not help it one must settle
in life some time or other
the good lady was still lost in amazement 
at length the secret was gasped from the dry
lips the maiden gentlewoman she had been
some time thinking changing her condition
and at length had given her word last evening
to mr christy the huntsman 
how or when or where this singular courtship
had been carried on i have not been able to
learn or how she has been able with the vinegar
 her disposition to soften the stony heart
the wedding 
 old nimrod so however it is and it has
astonished every one with all her ladyship's
love match making this last fume hymen's
torch has been too much for her she
has endeavoured to reason with mrs hannah
but all in vain her mind was made up and she
grew tart on the least contradiction lady lily
applied to the squire for his interference 
she did not know what she should do without
mrs hannah she had been used to have her
about her so long a time
the squire on the contrary rejoiced in the
match as relieving the good lady from a kind 
toilette tyrant under whose sway she had suffered
for years instead thwarting the affair
therefore he has given it his full countenance
and declares that he will set up the young
couple in one the best cottages on his estate
the approbation the squire has been followed
by that the whole household they all
declare that if ever matches are really made in
heaven this must have been for that old
christy and mrs hannah were as cordially
 the wedding
formed to be linked together as ever were 
box and vinegar cruet
is soon as this matter was arranged lady
lillyiaft took her leave the family at the
hall taking with her the captain and his blushing
bride who are to pass the honeymoon with
her master simon accompanied them on
horseback and indeed means to ride on a head
to make preparations the general who was
fishing in vain for an invitation to her seat
handed her ladyship into her carriage with a
heavy sigh upon which his bosom friend master
simon who was just mounting his horse
gave me a knowing wink made an abominably
wry face and leaning from his saddle whispered
loudly in my ear it wont do then putting
spurs to his horse away he cantered off
the general stood for some time waving his
hat after the carriage as it rolled down the
avenue until he was seized with a fit sneezing
from exposing his head to the cool breeze
the company have now almost all taken
their departure i have determined to do the
the wedding 
same tomorrow morning and i hope my reader
may not think that i have already lingered too
long at the ball i have been tempted to do so
however because i thought i had lit upon one
 the retired places where there are yet some
traces to be met with old english character
a little while hence and all these will have
passed away
ready money jack will sleep with his fathers
the good squire and all his peculiarities
will be buried in the parish church the old
hall will be modernized into a fashionable
country seat or pera venture a manufactory
the park will be cut up into kitchen gardens
a daily coach will run through the village and
it will become like all other commonplace villages
thronged with coachmen postboys tipplers
and politicians and christmas mayday
and all their hearty merrymakings will be
forgotten

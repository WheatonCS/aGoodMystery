glaucus friendship tested enmity softened
love same because one loving is blind i
 night was somewhat advanced and 
gay loungingplaces pompeians were still
crowded you might observe in countenances
 various idlers a more earnest expression
than usual they talked in large knots and
groups as if they sought by numbers to divide 
half painful half pleasurable anxiety which belonged
to subject on which they conversed 
tt was a subject life and death
a young man passed briskly by graceful
 
portico temple fortune so briskly
indeed that he came with no slight force full
against rotund and comely form that
respectable citizen diomed who was retiring
homeward to his suburban villa
 halloo groaned merchant recovering
with some difficulty his equilibrium have you
no eyes or do you think i have no feeling by
jupiter you have well nigh driven out divine
particle such another shock and my soul will be
in hades 
ah diomed i is it you forgive my inadvertence
i was absorbed in thinking 
reverses life our poor friend glaucus eh
who could have guessed it
well but tell me clodius is he really to je
tried by senate 
yes they say crime is so extraordinary
a nature that senate itself must adjudge it
and so victors are to induct him formally
he has been accused publicly then 

pompeii 
 to be sure where have you been not to hear
that
why i have only just returned from neapoles
whither i went on business very morning
after his crime so shocking and at my
house same night that it happened 
 there is no doubt his guilt said clodius
shrugging his shoulders and as these crimes
take precedence all little undignified peccadilloes
they will hasten to finish sentence
previous to games
 games good gods replied diomed
with a slight shudder can they adjudge him to
 beasts so young so rich 
true but then he is a greek had he been
a roman it would have been a thousand pities
these foreigners can be borne with in their prosperity
 but in adversity we must not forget that
they are in reality slaves however we 
upper classes are always tenderhearted and he
would certainly get off tolerably well if he were
left to us for between ourselves what is a paltry
 
priest isis what isis herself but common
people are superstitious they clamour for
 blood sacrilegious one it is dangerous
not to give way to public opinion
and blasphemer christian or nazarene
or whatever else he be called 
oh poor dog if he will sacrifice to cybele
or isis he will be pardoned if not tiger has
him at least so i suppose but trial will
decide we talk while urn's still empty
and greek may yet escape deadly 
his own alphabet but enough this gloomy
subject how is fair julia
well i fancy
commend me to her but hark door
yonder creaks on its hinges it is house 
 praetor who comes forth by bacchus it
is egyptian what can he want with our
official friend 
 some conference touching murder doubt
 initial fdvaro death condemning letter 
greeks as c was romans
pompeii 
less replied diomed but what was supposed
to be inducement to crime glaucus was
to have married priest's sister
 yes some say appetites refused alliance
it might have been a sudden quarrel glaucus was
evidently inebriate nay so much so as to have
been quite insensible when taken up and i hear is
still delirious whether with wine terror remorse
 furies or bacchanals i cannot say
poor fellow he has good counsel
 best caius pollio an eloquent fellow
enough pollio has been hiring all poor gentlemen
and wellborn spendthrifts pompeii to
dress shabbily and sneak about swearing their
friendship to glaucus who would not have spoken
to them to be made emperor i will do him
justice he was a gentleman in his choice acquaintance
and trying to melt stony citizens
into pity but it won't do isis is mightily
popular just at this moment
and by by i have some merchandise at
alexandria yes isis ought to be protected

true so farewell old gentleman we shall
meet soon if not we must have a friendly bet at
 amphitheatre all my calculations are confounded
by this cursed misfortune glaucus
he had bet on lydon gladiator i must makeup
my tablets elsewhere vale 
leaving less active diomed to regain his
villa clodius strode on humming a greek air
and perfuming night with odours that
steamed from his snowy garments and flowinglocks

if thought he glaucus feed lion
julia will no longer have a person to love better
than me she will certainly dote on me and
so i suppose i must marry by gods 
twelve lines begin to fail mei look suspiciously
at my hand when it rattles dice that infernal
sallust insinuates cheating and if it be
discovered that ivory is cogged why farewell
to merry supper and perfumed billet 
clodius is undone better marry then while
i may renounce gaming and push my fortune
pompeii 
or rather gentle julia's at imperial
court
thus muttering schemes his ambition
if by that high name projects clodius maybe
called gamester found himself suddenly
accosted he turned and beheld dark brow
 graces
 hail noble clodius pardon my interruption 
and inform me i pray you which is house 
sallust
it is but a few yards hence wise graces
but does sallust entertain tonight
i know not answered egyptian nor
am i perhaps one those whom he would seek
as a boon companion but thou knowest that his
house holds person glaucus murderer
ay he goodhearted epicure believes in
 greek's innocence you remind me that he
has become his surety and therefore till 
trial is responsible for his appearance well
if a criminal could obtain surety called vates in capital
offences he was not compelled to lie in prison till after sentence

sallust's house is better than a prison especially
that wretched hole in forum but for what
can you seek glaucus
why noble clodius if we could save him
from execution it would be well condemnation
 rich is a blow upon society itself i
should like to confer with him for i hear he has
recovered his senses and ascertain motives 
his crime they may be so extenuating as to
plead in his defence
you are benevolent graces
 benevolence is duty one who aspires
to wisdom replied egyptian modestly
 which way lies sallust's mansion
i will shew you said clodius if you will
suffer me to accompany you a few steps but
pray what has become poor girl who was
to have wed athenian sister murdered
priest
alas wellnigh insane sometimes she utters
imprecations on murderer then suddenly
stops short then cries but why curse oh my
pompeii 
brother glaucus was not tby murderer never
will i believe it then she begins again and
again stops short and mutters awfully to herself
yet if it were indeed he 
unfortunate lone
 but it is well for her that those solemn cares
to dead which religion enjoins have hitherto
greatly absorbed her attention from glaucus and
herself and in dimness her senses she
scarcely seems aware that glaucus is apprehended
and on eve trial when funeral rites
are performed her apprehension will return and
then i fear me much that her friends will be revolted
by seeing her run to succour and aid 
murderer her brother 
such scandal should be prevented
i trust i have taken precautions to that effect
i am her lawful guardian and have just succeeded
in obtaining permission to escort her after
 burial apsecides to my own house there
please gods she will be secure
you have done well sage arbaces and
 
now yonder is house sallust gods
keep you yet hark you arbaces why so
gloomy and unsocial men say you can be gay 
why not let me initiate you into pleasures 
pompeii i flatter myself no one knows them
better
i thank you noble clodius under your
auspices i might venture i think to wear 
philyra but at my age i should be an awkward
pupil
oh never fear i have made converts fellows
 seventy rich too are never old
 you flatter me at some future time i will
remind you your promise
 you may command marcus clodius at all
times and so vale
 now said egyptian soliloquising i am
not wantonly a man blood i would willingly
save this greek if he will by confessing crime
be lost for ever to lone and for ever free me from
 chance discovery and i can save him by
persuading julia to own philter which will
pompeii 
be held his excuse but if he do not confess 
crime why julia must be shamed from confession
and he must die die lest he prove my
rival with living die that he may be my
proxy with dead will he confess can he
not be persuaded that in his delirium he struck
 blow to me it would give far greater safety
than even his death hem we must hazard 
experiment
sweeping along narrow street arbaces now
approached house sallust when he beheld
a dark form wrapped in a cloak and stretched at
length across threshold door
so still lay figure and so dim was its outline
that any other than arbaces might have felt a
superstitious fear lest he beheld one those grim
lemures who above all other spots haunted 
threshold homes they formerly possessed
but not for arbaces were such dreams
rise said he touching figure with his
foot thou obstructed way
ha who art thou cried form in a
 
sharp tone and as she raised herself from 
ground starlight fell full on pale face and
fixed but sightless eyes lydia tressilian
who art thou i know burden thy
voice
blind girl what dost thou here at this late
hour fie is this seeming thy sex or years
home girl 
i know thee said lydia in a low voice 
thou art arbaces egyptian then as if
inspired by some sudden impulse she flung herself
at his feet and clasping his knees exclaimed
in a wild and passionate tone o dread and
potent man save him save lira he is not
guilty it is i he lies within ill dying and
i i am hateful cause and they will not
admit me to him they spurn blind girl from
 hall o heal him thou knowest some herb
some spell some counter charm for it is
a potion that hath wrought this frenzy
hush child i know all thou forgotten
that i accompanied julia to saga's home
pompeii 
doubtless her hand administered draught but
her reputation demands thy silence reproach
not thyself what must be must meanwhile
i seek criminal he may yet be saved
away 
thus saying arbaces extricated himself from
 clasp despairing thessalian and knocked
loudly at door
in a few moments heavy bars were heard
sullenly to yield and porter half opening 
door demanded who was there
arbaces important business to sallust relative
to glaucus i come from praetor
 porter half yawning half groaning admitted
 tall form egyptian lydia
sprang forward how is he she cried tell
me tell me 
ho mad girl is it thou still for shame
why they say he is sensible
 gods be praised and you will not
admit me ah i beseech thee 
admit thee no a pretty salute i should
 
prepare for these shoulders were i to admit such
things as thou go home 
 door closed and lydia with a deep sigh
laid herself down once more on cold stones 
and wrapping her cloak round her face resumed
her weary vigil
meanwhile arbaces had already gained 
triclinium where sallust with his favourite freedman
sat late at supper
what arbaces and at this hour accept
this cup
nay gentle sallust it is on business not
pleasure that i venture to disturb thee how
doth thy charge they say in town that he
has recovered sense
alas and truly replied goodnatured
but thoughtless sallust wiping tear from his
eyes but so shattered are his nerves and frame
that t scarcely recognise brilliant and gay
carouser i was wont to know yet strange to
say be cannot account for cause sudden
frenzy that seized him he retains but a dim
pompeii 
consciousness what hath passed and despite
thy witness wise egyptian solemnly upholds his
innocence death apsecides
sallust said arbaces gravely there is
much in thy friend's case that merits a peculiar
indulgence and could we learn from his lips 
confession and cause his crime much might
be yet hoped from mercy senate for
 senate thou knowest hath power either
to mitigate or to sharpen law therefore it
is that i have conferred with highest authority
 city and obtained his permission
to hold a private conference this night with 
athenian tomorrow thou knowest trial
comes on
well said sallust thou wilt be worthy 
thy eastern name and fame if thou canst learn
aught from him but thou mayest try poor
glaucus and he had such an excellent appetite
he eats nothing now 
 benevolent epicure was moved sensibly at
this thought he sighed and ordered his slaves
to refill his cup
 
night wanes said egyptian suffer
me to see thy ward now
sallust nodded assent and led way to a
small chamber guarded without by two dozing
slaves door opened at request 
arbaces sallust withdrew egyptian was
alone with glaucus
one those tall and graceful candelabra
common to that day supporting a single lamp
burned beside narrow bed its rays fell
palely over face athenian and arbaces
was moved to see how sensibly that countenance
had changed rich colour was gone 
cheek was sunk lips were convulsed and
pallid fierce had been struggle between
reason and madness life and death youth
 strength glaucus had conquered but 
freshness blood and soul life life its
glory and its zest were gone for ever
 egyptian seated himself quietly beside 
bed glaucus still lay mute and unconscious 
his presence at length after a considerable
pause arbaces thus spoke 
pompeii 
glaucus we have been enemies i come to
thee alone and in dead night thy friend
perhaps thy saviour
as steed starts from path tiger
glaucus sprang up breathless alarmed panting
at abrupt voice sudden apparition
 his foe their eyes met and neither for
some moments had power to withdraw his gaze
 flush went and came over face 
athenian and bronzed cheek egyptian
grew a shade more pale at length with
an inward groan glaucus turned away drew
his hand across his brow sunk back and muttered

am i still dreaming
no glaucus thou art awake by this right
hand and my father's head thou seest one who
may save thy life hark i know what thou hast
done but i know also its excuse which thou
thyself art ignorant thou hast committed murder
it is true a sacrilegious murder frown not 
start not these eyes saw it but i can save
 
thee i can prove how thou wert bereaved 
sense and made not a freethinking and freeacting
man but in order to save thee thou must confess
thy crime sign but this paper acknowledging
thy hand in death appetites and thou shalt
avoid fatal urn
 what words are these murder and apsecides 
did i not see him stretched on ground bleeding
and a corpse and wouldst thou persuade me
that did deed man thou lies away
be not rash glaucus be not hasty deed
is proved come come thou mayest well be excused
for not recalling act thy delirium and
which thy sober senses would have shunned even
to contemplate but let me try to refresh thy
exhausted and weary memory thou knowest
thou wert walking with priest disputing about
his sister thou knowest he was intolerant and
half a nazarene and he sought to convert thee
and ye had hot words and he calumniated thy
mode life and swore he would not marry lone
to thee and then in thy wrath and thy frenzy
pompeii 
thou clidst strike sudden blow come come 
you can recollect this read this papyrus it runs
to that effect sign it and thou art saved
barbarian give me written lie that i may
tear it murderer lone's brother confess
to have injured one hair head him
she loved let me rather perish a thousand
times 
beware said arbaces in a low and hissing
tone there is but one choice thy confession
and thy signature or amphitheatre and 
lion's maw 
as egyptian fixed his eyes upon sufferer
he hailed with joy signs evident emotion that
seized latter at these words a slight shudder
passed over athenian's frame his lip fell an
expression sudden fear and wonder betrayed
itself in his brow and eye
great gods he said in a low voice what
reverse is this it seems but a little day since
life laohed out from amidst roses lone mine 
youth health love lavishing on me their treads
 
sures and now pain madness shame death
and for what what have i done oh i am mad
still
sign and be saved i said soft sweet voice
 egyptian
tempter never cried glaucus in reaction
 rage thou knowest me not thou
knowest not haughty soul an athenian
 sudden face death might appal me for a
moment hut fear is over dishonour appals
for ever who will debase his name to save his
life who exchange clear thoughts for sullied
 who will belie himself to shame and stand
blackened in eyes glory and love if to
earn a few years polluted life there be so base a
coward dream not dull barbarian east to
find him in one who has trod same sod as harmonious
and drank same air as socrates go 
leave me to live without self reproach or to perish
without fear i
bethink thee well lion's fangs hoots
 brutal mob vulgar gaze on thy dying
pompeii 
agony and mutilated limbs thy name degraded 
thy corpse unburied shame thou wouldst
avoid clinging to thee for aye and ever 
thou rarest thou art madman shame
is not in loss other men's esteem it is in
 loss our own wilt thou go my eyes loathe
 sight thee hating ever i despise thee now 
i go said arbaces stung and exasperated
but not without some pitying admiration his
victim i go we meet twice again once at 
trial once at death farewell
 egyptian rose slowly gathered his robes
about him and left chamber he sought
sallust for a moment whose eyes began to reel
with vigils cup he is still unconscious
or still obstinate there is no hope for
him
 say not so replied sallust who felt but little
resentment against athenian's accuser for he
possessed no great austerity virtue and was
rather moved by his friend's reverses than persuaded
 his innocence say not so my
 
egyptian so good a drinker shall be saved if
possible bacchus against isis 
we shall see said egyptian
sullenly bolts were again withdrawn 
door unclosed arbaces was in open street 
and poor lydia once more started from her long
watch
wilt thou save him she cried clasping her
hands
child follow me home i would speak to thee
it is for his sake i ask it
 and thou wilt save him 
no answer came forth to thirsting ear 
blind girl arbaces had already proceeded far up
 street she hesitated a moment and then followed
his steps in silence
 i must secure this girl said he musingly
lest she give evidence philter as to 
vain julia she will not betray herself

a classic funeral
while arbaces had been thus employed sorrow
and death were in house lone it was
 night preceding morn in which solemn
funeral rites were to be decreed to remains 
 murdered appetites corpse had been
removed from temple isis to house 
 nearest surviving relative and lone had heard
at same breath death her brother and
 accusation against her betrothed that first
violent anguish which blunts sense to all but
itself and forbearing silence her slaves had
prevented her learning minutely circumstances
attendant on fate her lover his illness
vol iii c
 
his frenzy and his approaching trial were unknown
to her she learnt only accusation
against him and at once indignantly rejected it 
nay on hearing that arbaces was accuser
she required no more to induce her firmly and
solemnly to believe that egyptian himself was
 criminal but vast and absorbing importance
attached by ancients to performance
 every ceremonial connected with death a
relation had as yet confined her wo and her
convictions to chamber deceased alas 
it was not for her to perform that tender and
touching office which obliged nearest relative
to endeavour to catch breath parting
soul beloved one but it was hers to close
 straining eyes distorted lips to watch by
 consecrated clay as fresh bathed and anointed
it lay in festive robes upon ivory bed to
strew couch with leaves and flowers and to
renew solemn cypressbranch at threshold
 door and in these sad offices in lamentation
and in prayer lone forgot herself it was
pompeii 
among loveliest customs ancients to
bury young at morning twilight for as
they strove to give softest interpretation to
death so they poetically imagined that aurora
who loved young had stolen them to her
embrace and though in instance murdered
priest this fable could not appropriately
cheat fancy general custom was still
preserved
 stars were fading one by one from 
grey heavens and night slowly receding before
 approach morn when a dark group stood
motionless before lone's door high and slender
torches made paler by unhallowed dawn
cast their light over various countenances hushed
for moment in one solemn and intent expression
and now there rose a slow and dismal
music which accorded sadly with rite and
this was rather a greek than a roman custom but 
reader will observe that in cities blagna greece 
greek customs and superstitions were much mingled with 
roman
 
floated far along desolate and breathless
streets while a chorus female voices 
prsefiese so often cited by roman poets
accompanying tibicin and mercian flute
woke following strain 
o'er sad threshold where cypress bough
supplants rose that should adorn thy home
on pilgrimage on earth that now
awaits thee wanderer to cocytus come 
darkly we woo and weeping we invite 
death is thy host his banquet asks thy soul 
thy garlands hang within house night

first went musicians playing a slow march 
 solemnity lower instruments broken by
many a louder and wilder burst funeral
trumpet next followed hired mourners chanting
their dirges to dead and female voices
were mingled with those boys whose tender
years made still more striking contrast life
and death fresh leaf and withered one
but players buffoons archimedes
whose duty it was to personate dead these
 customary attendants at ordinary funerals
were banished from a funeral attended with so
many terrible associations
 priests isis came next in their snowy

forefathers and behind bier followed amidst

by music flashed upon dark lethargy 
wo she covered that countenance with her hands
and sobbed unseen for hers was not noisy
sorrow shrill lament ungoverned gesture
which characterised those who honoured less faithfully
in that age as in all channel deep
grief flowed hushed and still
and so procession swept on till it had traversed
 streets passed city gate and gained
 place tonics without wall which 
traveller yet beholds
raised in form an altar unpolished
pine amidst whose interstices were placed preparations
 combustible matter stood funeral
pyre and around it drooped dark and gloomy
cypresses so consecrated by song to tomb
as soon as bier was placed upon pile
 attendants parting on either side lone passed
up to couch and stood before unconscious
clay for some moments motionless and silent
 
 features dead had been composed from

hushed for ever terror and doubt 
contest passion awe religion struggle

 breast that young aspirant to holy 
life what trace was visible in awful serenity
 that impenetrable brow and breathing lip 
 sister gazed and not a sound was heard
amidst crowd there was something terrible
yet softening also in silence and when it
broke it broke sudden and abrupt it broke with
a loud and passionate cry vent longsmothered
despair

with that after a brief pause she rose and
her pale and beautiful countenance was again

were placed in a silver urn which was
solemnly stored in one neighbouring sepulchres
beside road and they placed within it
 vial full tears and small coin which
poetry still consecrated to grim boatman

chaplets and incense kindled on altar and
 tomb hung round with many lamps

ay so you would have precise answers to
those questions there are various ways satisfying
you there is lithomanteia or speakingstone
which answers your prayer with an infant's
voice but then we have not that precious stone
with us costly is it and rare then there is 
shops perfumers
 
gastromanteia whereby demon casts pale and
ghastly images upon water prophetic

peculiar fashion to contain consecrated liquid
which we have not i think therefore that 
simplest method satisfying your desire would be
by magic air
i trust said sosia tremulously that there
is nothing very frightful in operation i have
no love for apparitions
fear not thou wilt see nothing thou wilt
only hear by bubbling water whether or not
thy suit prospers first then be sure from 
rising eveningstar that thou leaves 
gardengate somewhat open so that demon
may feel himself invited to enter therein and
place fruits and water near gate as a sign 
hospitality then three hours after twilight come
here with a bowl coldest and purest water
and thou shalt learn all according to thessalian
lore my mother taught me but forget
not gardengate all rests upon that it must
pompeii 
be open when you come and for three hours previously

trust me replied unsuspecting sosia 
i know what a gentleman's feelings are when
a door is shut in his face as cookshop's hath
been in mine many a day and i know also that
a person respectability as a demon course
is cannot but be pleased on other hand
with any little mark courteous hospitality
meanwhile pretty one here is thy morning's
meal
and what trial 
o lawyers are still at it talk talk it
will over till tomorrow
 tomorrow you are sure that
 so i hear
 and lone
by bacchus she must be tolerably well
for she was strong enough to make my master
stamp and bite his lip this morning i saw him
quit her apartment with a brow like a thunderstorm

 oods would have a sad time it and now
for arbaces i am treading a quicksand but it
ought to cover a mine i have egyptian's
life in my power what will he value it at
as he thus soliloquised he crossed through 
open court into peristyle where a few lamps
here and there broke upon empire 
starlit night and issuing from one chambers
that bordered colonnade suddenly encountered
arbaces
sho calenus meekest thou me said 
egyptian and there was a little embarrassment
in his voice
yes wise arbaces i trust my visit is not
unseasonable
nay it was but this instant that my f reedman
callias sneezed thrice at my right hand i
knew therefore some good fortune was in store
for me and lo gods have sent me calenus

pompeii 
shall we within to your chamber arbaces 
as you will but night is clear and balmy
i have some remains languor yet lingering
on me from my recent illness air refreshes
me let us walk in garden we are equally
alone there
with all my heart answered priest
and two friends passed slowly to one 
many terraces which bordered by marble vases
and sleeping flowers intersected garden
it is a lovely night said arbaces blue
and beautiful as that on which twenty years ago
 shores italy first broke upon my view my
calenus age creeps upon us let us at least feel
that we have lived
 thou at least mayst arrogate that boast
said calenus beating about as it were for an
opportunity to communicate secret which
weighed upon him and feeling his usual awe 
arbaces still more impressively that night from
 quiet and friendly tone dignified condescension
which egyptian assumed thou
 
at least mayst arrogate that boast thou hast
had countless wealth a frame on whose closewoven
fibres disease can find no space to enter 
prosperous love inexhaustible pleasure and
even at this hour triumphant revenge
thou alludes to athenian ay tomorrow's
sun fiat his death will go forth 
senate does not relent but thou mistakes his
death gives me no other gratification than that it
releases me from a rival in affections lone
i entertain no other sentiment animosity against
that unfortunate homicide
homicide repeated calenus slowly and
meaningly and halting as he spoke he fixed
his eyes upon arbaces stars shone pale and
steadily on proud face their prophet but
they betrayed there no change eyes calenus
fell disappointed and abashed he continued
rapidly homicide it is well to charge him
with that crime but thou all men knowest
that he is innocent
 explain thyself said arbaces coldly for
pompeii 
he had prepared himself for hint his secret
fears had foretold
arbaces answered calenus sinking his voice
into a whisper i was in sacred grove sheltered
by chapel and surrounding foliage
i overheard i marked whole i saw thy
weapon pierce heart apsecides i blame
not deed it destroyed a foe and an apostate

thou safest whole said arbaces drily
so i imagined thou wert alone
alone returned calenus surprised at 
egyptian's calmness
and wherefore wert thou hid behind 
chapel at that hour
because i had learnt conversion appetites
to christian faith because i knew that
on that spot he was to meet fierce olinthus 
because they were to meet there to discuss plans
for unveiling sacred mysteries our goddess
to people and i was there to detect in order
to defeat them
 
hast thou told living ear what thou didst
witness 
no my master secret is locked in thy
servant's breast
what even thy kinsman burho guesses it
not come truth 
by gods 
hush we know each other what are 
gods to us v
by fear thy vengeance then no 
and why hast thou hitherto concealed from
me this secret why hast thou waited till eve
 athenian's condemnation before thou hast
ventured to tell me that arbaces is a murderer
and having tarried so long why revealed thou
now that knowledge 
because because stammered calenus
colouring and in confusion
because interrupted arbaces with a gentle
smile and tapping priest on shoulder with
a kindly and familiar gesture because my calenus
 see now i will read thy heart and explain
pompeii 
its motives because thou didst wish thoroughly
to commit and entangle me in trial so that i
might have no loophole escape that i might
stand firmly pledged to perjury and to malice as
well as to homicide that having myself whetted
 appetite populace to blood no wealth
no power could prevent my becoming their victim
 and thou tallest me thy secret now ere 
trial be over and innocent condemned to
shew what a dexterous web villany thy word
tomorrow could destroy to enhance in this
 ninth hour price thy forbearance to
shew that my own arts in arousing popular
wrath would at thy witness recoil upon myself 
and that if not for glaucus for me would gape
 jaws lion is it not so 
 arbaces replied calenus losing all 
vulgar audacity his natural character verily
thou art a magian thou readiest heart as it
were a scroll
it is my vocation answered egyptian
vol iii e
 
laughing gently well then forbear and when
all is over i will make three rich
pardon me said priest as quick
suggestion that avarice which was his masterpassion
bade him trust to no future chance 
generosity pardon me thou saidst right 
we know each other if thou wouldst have me
silent thou must pay something in advance as an
offer to hippocrates if rose sweet emblem
 discretion is to take root firmly water her this
night with a stream gold
witty and poetical answered arbaces still
in that bland voice which lulled and encouraged
when it ought to have alarmed and checked his
griping comrade wilt thou not wait morrow

why this delay perhaps when i can no
longer give my testimony without shame for not
having given it ere innocent man suffered
thou wilt forget my claim and indeed thy pres
 god silence
pompeii 
sent hesitation is a bad omen thy future gratitude
well then calenus what would st thou have
me pay thee 
 thy life is very precious and thy wealth is
very great returned priest grinning
wittier and more witty but speak out 
what shall be sum 
arbaces i have heard that in thy secret treasury
below beneath those rude oscan arches which
prop thy stately halls thou hast piles gold 
vases and jewels which might rival receptacles
 wealth deified nero thou
may st easily spare out those piles enough to
make calenus among richest priests pompeii
and yet not miss loss
come calenus said arbaces winningly and
with a frank and generous air thou art an old
friend and hast been a faithful servant thou
canst have no wish to take away my life nor i a
desire to stint thy reward thou shalt descend
with me to that treasury thou referred to thou
 
shalt feast thine eyes with blaze uncounted
gold and sparkle priceless gems and thou
shalt for thy own reward bear away with thee
this night as much as thou canst conceal beneath
thy robes nay when thou hast once seen what
thy friend possesses thou wilt learn how foolish it
would be to injure one who has so much to bestow
when glaucus is no more thou shalt pay 
treasury another visit speak i frankly and as a
friend
 o greatest best men cried calenus
almost weeping with joy canst thou thus forgive
my injurious doubts thy justice thy generosity

hush one other turn and we will descend
to oscan arches

 slave obeyed and lydia bending for
some moments silently over lamp now rose
and in a low voice chanted following rude and

by jericho's art that shed

by lone ithaca's wise king

 spectre is certainly coming said sosia 
i feel him running along my hair 
 place thy bowl water on ground
now then give me thy napkin and let me fold
up thy face and eyes
ay that's always custom with these
charms not so tight though gently gently 
there thou canst not see v

address then to spectre whatever question
thou wouldst ask him in a lowwhispered
voice three times if thy question is answered in
pompeii 
 affirmative thouwilt hear water ferment
and bubble before demon breathes upon it 
if in negative water will be quite silent
but you will not play any trick with

 let me place bowl under thy feet so
now thou wilt perceive that i cannot touch it

very fair now then o bacchus befriend

two years and a half three four ill fortune
to you friend demon you are not a lady that's
clear or you would not keep silence so long
five six sixty years and may pluto seize you 
i'll ask no more and sosia in a rage kicked
down water over his legs he then after
much fumbling and more cursing managed to
extricate his head from napkin in which it
was completely folded stared round and discovered
that he was in dark
what ho lydia lamp is gone ah
pompeii 
traitress and thou art gone too but i'll catch
thee thou shalt smart for this 
 slave groped his way to door it was
bolted from without he was a prisoner instead
 lydia what could he do he did not dare
to knock loud to call out lest arbaces should
overhear him and discover how he had been
duped and lydia meanwhile had probably
already gained gardengate and was fast on
her escape
but thought he she will go home or
at least be somewhere in city tomorrow
at dawn when slaves are at work in peristyle
i can make myself heard then i can go
forth and seek her i shall be sure to find and
bring her back before arbaces knows a word 
 matter ah that's best plan little
traitress my fingers itch at thee and to leave
only a bowl water too had it been wine it
would have been some comfort
while sosia thus entrapped was lamenting
his fate and revolving his schemes to repossess
 
himself lydia blind girl with that singular
precision and dexterous rapidity motion
which we have before observed was peculiar
to her had passed lightly along peristyle
threaded opposite passage that led into 
garden and with a beating heart was about
to proceed towards gate when she suddenly
heard sound approaching steps and distinguished
 dreaded voice arbaces himself
she paused for a moment in doubt and
terror then suddenly it flashed across her recollection
that there was another passage which was
little used except for admission fair partakers
 egyptian's secret revels and which
wound along basement that massive fabric
towards a door which also communicated with
 garden by good fortune it might be open
at that thought she hastily retraced her steps
descended narrow stairs at right and was
soon at entrance passage alas 
door at that entrance was closed and secured
while she was yet assuring herself that it was
pompeii 
indeed locked she heard behind her voice
 calenus and a moment after that arbaces
in low reply she could not stay there they
were probably passing to that very door she
sprang onward and felt herself in unknown
ground air grew damp and chill this reassured
her she thought she might be among
 cellars luxurious mansion or at least
in some rude spot not likely to be visited by its
haughty lord when again her quick ear caught
steps and sound voices on on she turned
extending her arms which now frequently
encountered pillars thick and massive form
with a tact doubled in acuteness by her fear
she escaped these perils and continued her way
 air growing more and more damp as she proceeded
 yet still as she ever and anon paused for
breath she heard advancing steps and 
indistinct murmur voices at length she was
abruptly stopped by a wall that seemed 
limit her path was there no spot in which
she could hide no aperture no cavity there
 
was none she stopped and wrung her hands
in despair then again nerved as voices
neared upon her she hurried on by side 
 wall and coming suddenly against one 
 sharp buttresses that here and there jutted
boldly forth she fell to ground though
much bruised her senses did not leave her
she uttered no cry nay she hailed accident
that had led her to something like a
screen and creeping close up to angle
formed by buttress so that on one side at
least she was sheltered from view she gathered
her slight and small form into its smallest compass
and breathlessly awaited her fate
meanwhile arbaces and priest were taking
their way to that secret chamber whose stores
were so vaunted by egyptian they were ina
vast subterranean atrium or hall low roof
was supported by short thick pillars an architecture
far remote fi'om grecian graces 
that luxuriant period single and pale lamp
which arbaces bore shed but an imperfect ray
pompeii 
over bare and rugged walls in which 
huge stones without cement were fitted curiously
and uncouthly into each other disturbed
reptiles glared dully on intruders and then
crept into shadow walls
calenus shivered as he looked around and
breathed damp unwholesome air
yet said arbaces with a smile perceiving
his shudder it is these rude abodes that furnish
 luxuries halls above they are like
 labourers world we despise their
ruggedness yet they feed very pride that
disdains them
and whither goes yon dim gallery to 
left asked calenus in this depth gloom
it seems without limit as if winding into hades
on contrary it does but conduct to 
upper day answered arbaces carelessly mt is
to right that we steer to our bourne
 hall like many in more habitable
regions pompeii branched ofi at extremity
into two wings or passages length which
 
not really great was to eye considerably exaggerated
by sullen gloom against which 
lamp so faintly struggled to right these
alcb two comrades now directed their steps
 gay glaucus will be lodged tomorrow in
apartments not much dryer and far less spacious
than this said calenus as they passed by 
very spot where completely wrapt in shadow
 broad projecting buttress cowered thessalian

ay but then he will have dry room and
ample enough in arena on following day
and to think continued arbaces slowly and
very deliberately to think that a word thine
could save him and consign arbaces to his
doom 
 that word shall never be spoken said
calenus
right my calenus it never shall returned
arbaces familiarly leaning his arm on priest's
shoulder and now halt we are at 
door
pompeii 
 light trembled against a small door deep
set in wall and guarded strongly by many
plates and bindings iron that intersected 
rough and dark wood from his girdle arbaces
now drew a small ring holding three or four
short but strong keys oh how beat griping
heart calenus as he heard rusty wards
growl as if resenting admission to treasures
they guarded 
enter my friend said arbaces while i
hold lamp on high that thou mayst glut thine
eyes on yellow heaps
 impatient calenus did not wait to be twice
invited he hastened towards aperture
scarce had he crossed threshold when
 strong hand arbaces plunged him forwards

 word shall never he spoken said he
with a loud exultant laugh and closed door
upon priest
calenus had been precipitated down several
steps but not feeling at moment pain 
 
his fall he sprung up again to door and
beating at it fiercely with his clenched fist he
cried aloud in what seemed more a beast's howl
than a human voice so keen was his agony and
despair oh release me release me and i will
ask no gold 
 words but imperfectly penetrated massive
door and arbaces again laughed then
stamping his foot violently rejoiced perhaps to
give vent to his long stifled passions 
all gold dalmatia cried he will
not buy thee a crust bread starve wretch 
thy dying groans will never wake even echo
 these vast halls nor will air ever reveal
as thou knowest in thy desperate famine thy
flesh from thy bones that so perishes man
who threatened and could have undone arbaces 
farewell
oh pity mercy inhuman villain was it
for this 
 rest sentence was lost to ear 
arbaces as he passed backward along dim
pompeii 
hall a toad plump and bloated lay unmoving
before his path rays lamp fell upon
its shaped hideousness and red upward eye
arbaces turned aside that he might not harm it
thou art loathsome and obscene he muttered
 but thou canst not injure me therefore
thou art safe in my path
 cries calenus dulled and choked by 
barrier that confined him yet faintly reached 
ear egyptian he paused and listened
intently
this is unfortunate thought he for i
cannot sail till that voice is dumb for ever my
stores and treasures lie not in yon dungeon it is
true but in opposite wing my slaves as they
move them must not hear his voice but what
fear that in three if he still survive his
accents by my father's beard must be weak
enough then no they could not pierce even
through his tomb by isis it is cold i long fora
deep draught spiced valerian
 
with that remorseless egyptian drew his
gown closer round him and besought upper air

chapter xiii
nydia accosts calends
what words terror yet hope had lydia
overheard next day glaucus was to be
condemned yet there lived one who could
save him and adjudge arbaces to his doom
and that one breathed within a few steps her
hidingplace she caught his cries and shrieks 
his imprecations his prayers though they fell
choked and muffled on her ear he was imprisoned
but she knew secret his cell 
could she but escape could she but seek 
prsetor he might yet in time be given to light
and preserve athenian her emotions almost
stifled her her brain reeled she felt her
 
sense give way but by a violent eisbrt she
mastered herself and after listening intently for
several minutes till she was convinced that
arbaces had left space to solitude and herself
she crept on till her ear guided her to very
door that had closed upon calenus here she
more distinctly caught his accents terror and
despair thrice she attempted to speak and
thrice her voice failed to penetrate folds 
heavy door at length finding lock she
applied her lips to its small aperture and 
prisoner distinctly heard a soft tone breathe his name
his blood curdled his hair stood on 
that awful solitude what mysterious and preternatural
being could penetrate who's there
he cried in new alarm what spectre what
dread larva calls upon lost calenus
priest replied thessalian unknown
to arbaces i have been by permission 
gods a witness to his perfidy if i myself can
escape from these walls i may save thee but
pompeii 
let thy voice reach my ear through this narrow
passage and answer what i ask
ah blessed spirit said priest exultingly
and obeying suggestion lydia save me
and i will sell very cups on altar to pay
thy kindness
i want not thy gold i want thy secret
did i hear aright canst thou save athenian
glaucus from charge against his life 
i can i can therefore may furies
blast foul egyptian hath arbaces snared
me thus and left me to starve and rot 
they accuse athenian murder canst
thou disprove accusation
only free me and proudest head 
pompeii is not more safe than his i saw 
deed done i saw arbaces strike blow i can
convict true murderer and acquit innocent
man but if i perish he dies also dost thou
interest thyself for him oh blessed stranger in
my heart is urn which condemns or frees him
and thou wilt give full evidence what
thou knowest
will oh were hell at my feet yes
revenge on false egyptian revenge revenge
 revenge i
as through his ground teeth calenus shrieked
forth those words lydia felt that in his worst
passions was her certainty his justice to 
athenian her heart beat was it was it to be
her proud destiny to preserve her idolised her
adored enough said she powers
that conducted me hither will carry me through
all yes i feel that i shall deliver thee wait
in patience and in hope
but be cautious be prudent sweet stranger
attempt not to appeal to arbaces he is marble
seek prsetor say what thou knowest obtain
his writ search bring soldiers and smiths
 cunning these locks are wondrous strong 
time flies i may starve starve if you are not
quick go go yet stay it is horrible to be
alone air is like a charnel and score

pions ha and pale larvae oh stay
stay 
nay said lydia terrified by terror 
 priest and anxious to confer with herself 
nay for thy sake i must depart take hope
for thy companion farewell
so saying she glided away and felt with extended
arms along pillared space until she
had gained farther hall and 
mouth passage that led to upper air
but there she paused she felt that it would be
more safe to wait awhile until night was so far
blended with morning that whole house would
be buried in sleep and so that she might quit it
unobserved she therefore once more laid herself
down and counted weary moments in her
sanguine heart joy was predominant emotion
glaucus was in deadly peril but she should save
him 
chapter xiv
graces and love nydia gains garden will
she escape and save athenian
when arbaces had warmed his veins by large
draughts that spiced and perfumed wine so
valued by luxurious he felt more than usually
elated and exultant heart there is a pride
in triumphant ingenuity not less felt perhaps
though its object be guilty our vain human
nature hugs itself in consciousness superior
craft and selfobtained success afterwards comes
 horrible reaction remorse
but remorse was not a feeling which arbaces
was likely ever to experience for fate 
base calenus he swept from his remembrance 
thought priest's agonies and lingering death
pompeii 
he felt only that a great danger was passed and
a possible foe silenced all left to him now would
be to account to priesthood for disappearance
 calenus and this he imagined it would
not be difficult to do calenus had often been
employed by him in various religious missions to
 neighbouring cities on some such errand
he could now assert that he had been sent with
offerings to shrines isis at stage and
annapolis placatory goddess for recent
murder her priest appetites when calenus
had expired his body might be thrown previous
to egyptian's departure from pompeii
into deep stream sarnus and when
discovered suspicion would probably fall upon
 nazarene atheists as an act revenge for
 death olinthus at arena after rapidly
running over these plans for screening himself
arbaces dismissed at once from his mind all recollection
 wretched priest and animated
by success which had lately crowned all his
schemes he surrendered his thoughts to lone
 
 time he had seen her she had driven
him from her presence by a reproachful and bitter
scorn which his arrogant nature was unable to
endure he now felt emboldened once more to
renew that interview for his passion for her was
like similar feelings in other men it made him
restless for her presence even though in that presence
he was exasperated and humbled from
delicacy to her grief he laid not aside his dark
and festive robes but renewing perfumes
on his raven locks and arranging his tunic in its
most becoming folds he sought chamber 
 neapolitan accosting slave in attendance
without he inquired if lone had yet retired
to rest and learning that she was still up and
unusually quiet and composed he ventured into
her presence he found his beautiful ward sitting
before a small table and leaning her face upon
both her hands in attitude thought yet
 expression face itself possessed not
its wonted bright and psychelike expression 
sweet intelligence lips were apart eye
pompeii 
vacant and unheeding and long dark hair
falling neglected and dishevelled upon her neck
gave by contrast additional paleness to a
cheek which had already lost roundness 
its contour
arbaces gazed upon her a moment ere he advanced
she too lifted up her eyes and when
she saw who was intruder shut them with an
expression pain but did not stir
 ah said arbaces in a low and earnest
tone as he respectfully nay humbly advanced
and seated himself at a little distance from 
table ah that my death could remove thy
hatred then would i gladly die thou wrongest
me lone but i will bear wrong without a
murmur only let me see thee sometimes chide
reproach scorn me if thou wilt i will learn
myself to bear it and is not even thy bitterest
tone sweeter to me than music most
artful lute in thy silence world seems to
stand still a stagnation curdles up veins 
 earth there is no earth no life without 
 
light thy countenance and melody thy
voice
give me back my brother and my betrothed
said lone with a calm and imploring tone and
a few large tear's rolled unheeded down her
cheeks
 would that i could restore one and save
 other returned arbaces with apparent emotion
 yes to make thee happy i would renounce
my illfated love and gladly join thy
hand to athenian's perhaps he will yet come
unscathed from his trial arbaces had prevented
her learning that trial had already commenced
 if so thou art free to judge or condemn
him thyself and think not oh lone that i
would follow thee longer with a prayer love i
know it is in vain suffer me only to weep to
mourn with thee forgive a violence deeply repented
and that shall offend no more let me
be to thee only what i once was a friend a
father a protector ah lone spare me and
forgive 
pompeii 
 i forgive thee save but glaucus and i will
renounce him oh mighty arbaces thou art
powerful in evil or in good save athenian
and poor lone will never see him more as
she spoke she rose with weak and trembling
limbs and falling at his feet she clasped his knees 
oh if thou really lowest me if thou art
human remember my father's ashes remember
my childhood think all hours we passed
happily together and save my glaucus 
strange convulsions shook frame 
egyptian his features worked fearfully he
turned his face aside and said in a hollow voice
if i could save him even now i would but
 roman law is stern and sharp yet if i
could succeed if i could rescue and set him free
wouldst thou be mine my bride
thine repeated lone rising thine thy
bride my brother's blood is unavenged who
slew him o nemesis can i even sell for 
life glaucus thy solemn trust arbaces 
thine never 
 
 lone lone cried arbaces passionately 
why these mysterious words why dost thou
couple my name with thought thy brother's
death
my dreams couple it and dreams are from
 gods
vain fantasies all is it for a dream that
thou wouldst wrong innocent and hazard thy
sole chance saving thy lover's life 
hear me said lone speaking firmly and
with a deliberate and solemn voice if glaucus
be saved by thee i will never be borne to his
home a bride but i cannot master horror 
other rites i cannot wed with thee interrupt
me not but mark me arbaces if glaucus die
on that same day i basile thine arts and leave to
thy love only my dust yes thou mayst put
 knife and poison from my reach thou
mayst imprison thou mayst chain me but 
brave soul resolved to escape is never without
means these hands naked and unarmed though
they be shall tear away bonds life fetter
pompeii 
tliein and these lips shall firmly refuse air
thou art learned thou hast read how women
have died rather than meet dishonour if glaucus
perish i will not unworthily linger behind him
by all gods heaven and ocean and
 earth i devote myself to death i have
said 
high proud dilating in her stature like one
inspired air and voice lone struck an awe
into breast her listener
brave heart said he after a short pause
thou art indeed worthy to be mine oh that
i should have dreamt such a sharer to my high
doom and never found it but in thee lone he
continued rapidly dost thou not see that we
were born for each other canst thou not recognise
something kindred to thine own energy
thine own courage in this high and selfdependent
soul we were formed to unite our
sympathies formed to breathe a new spirit into
this hackney and gross world formed for 
mighty destinies which my soul sweeping down

 gloom time foresees with a prophet's vision
with a resolution equal to thine own i defy thy
threats an inglorious suicide i hail thee as
my own i queen climes un darkened by 
eagle's wing ravaged by his beak how
before thee in homage and in awe but claim
thee in worship and in love together will we
cross ocean together will we found our
realm and fardistant ages shall acknowledge
 long race kings born from marriagebed
 arbaces and lone 
thou rarest these mystic declamations are
suited rather to some palsied crone selling charms
in marketplace than to wise arbaces
thou hast heard my resolution it is fixed as
 fates themselves orcus has heard my vow
and it is written in forgetful
hades atone then o arbaces atone 
past convert hatred into regard vengeance into
gratitude preserve one who shall never be thy
rival these are acts suited to thy original
nature which gives forth sparks something
pompeii 
high and noble they weigh in scales 
kings death they turn balance on that
day when embodied soul stands shivering and
dismayed between tartarus and elysium they
glad heart in life better and longer than 
reward a momentary passion oh arbaces 
hear me and be swayed 
enough lone all that i can do for glaucus
shall be done but blame me not if i fail inquire
 my foes even if i have not sought if i
do not seek to turn aside sentence from his
head and judge me accordingly sleep then
lone night wanes i leave thee to its rest and
mayst thou have kinder dreams one who has
no existence but in thine
without waiting a reply arbaces hastily withdrew
 afraid perhaps to trust himself farther to
 passionate prayer lone which racked him
with jealousy even while it touched him to compassion
but compassion itself came too late
had lone even pledged him her hand as his reward
he could not now his evidence given 
 
 populace excited have saved athenian
still made sanguine by his very energy mind
he threw himself on chances future
and believed he should yet triumph over 
woman that had so entangled his passions
as his attendants assisted to unrobe him for 
night thought lydia flashed across him
he felt it was necessary that lone should never
learn her lover's frenzy lest it might excuse
his imputed crime and it was possible that her
attendants might inform her that lydia was
under his roof and she might desire to see her
as this idea crossed him he turned to one his
freedmen 
 go callias said he forthwith to sosia
and tell him that on no pretence is he to suffer
 blind slave lydia out her chamber but
stay first seek those on attendance upon my ward
and caution them not to inform her that blind
girl is under my roof go quick 
 slave hastened to obey after having discharged
his commission with respect to lone's
pompeii 
attendants he sought worthy sosia he
found him not in little cell which was apportioned
for his cubiculum he called his name
aloud and from lydia's chamber close at hand
he heard voice sosia reply 
oh callias is it you that i hear gods
be praised open door i pray you 
 slave withdrew bolt and rueful
face sosia hastily obtruded itself
what in chamber with that young
girl sosia pro jmdor are there not fruits
ripe enough on wall but that thou must
tamper with such green 
name not little witch interrupted sosia
impatiently she will be my ruin and he forthwith
imparted to callias history air
demon and escape thessalian
hang thyself then unhappy sosia i i am
just charged from arbaces with a message to thee
on no account art thou to suffer her even for a
moment from that chamber 
me misery exclaimed slave what
 
can i do by this time she may have visited half
pompeii but tomorrow i will undertake to
catch her in her old haunts keep but my counsel
dear callias
 i will do all that friendship can consistent
with my own safety but are you sure she has
left house she may be hiding here yet
 how is that possible she could easily have
gained garden and door as i told thee
was open
nay not so for at that very hour thou specifies
arbaces was in garden with priest
calenus i went there in search some herbs
for my master's bath tomorrow i saw table
set out but gate i am sure was shut depend
upon it that calenus entered by garden and
naturally closed door after him
but it was not locked
yes for i myself angry at a negligence
which might expose bronzes in peristyle
to mercy any robber turned key took
it away and as i did not see proper slave
pompeii ill
to whom to give it or i should have rated him
finely here it actually is still in my girdle
oh merciful bacchus i did not pray to
thee in vain after all let us not lose a moment 
let us to garden instantly she may yet be
there
 goodnatured callias consented to assist 
slave and after vainly searching chambers
at hand and recesses peristyle they
entered garden
it was about this time that lydia had resolved
to quit her hidingplace and venture forth on her
way lightly tremulously holding her breath
which ever and anon broke forth in quick convulsive
gasps now gliding by flowerwreathed
columns that bordered peristyle now darkening
 still moonshine that fell over its tessellated
centre now ascending terrace garden
now gliding amidst gloomy and breathless
trees she gained fatal door to find it locked
we have all seen that expression pain uncertainty
 fear which a sudden disappointment
il 
 touch if i may use expression casts over
 face blind but what words can paint
 intolerable wo sinking whole
heart which was now visible on features 
 thessalian again and again her small quivering
hands wandered to and fro inexorable
door poor thing that thou wert in vain had
been all thy noble courage thy innocent craft
thy doubling to escape hound and huntsman 
within but a few yards from thee laughing at thy
endeavours thy despair knowing thou wert now
their own and watching with cruel patience their
own moment to seize their prey thou art saved
from seeing thy pursuers
hush callias let her go on let us see
what she will do when she has convinced herself
that door is honest
 look she raises her face to heavens 
she mutters she sinks down despondent no 
by pollux she has some new scheme she will
not resign herself per jove a tough spirit
see she springs up she retraces her steps she
pompeii 
thinks some other chance i advise thee sosia
to delay no longer seize her ere she quit 
garden now 
ah runaway i have thee eh said sosia
seizing upon unhappy lydia
as a hare's human cry in fangs 
dogs as sharp voice terror uttered by a
sleepwalker suddenly awakened broke shriek
 blind girl when she felt abrupt gripe
 her gaoler it was a shriek such utter
agony such entire despair that it might have
rung hauntingly in your ears for ever she felt
as if plank sinking glaucus were
torn from his clasp it had been a suspense 
life and death and death had now won 
game
gods that cry will alarm house arfaces
sleeps full lightly gag her cried callias
ah here is very napkin with which 
young witch conjured away my reason come
that's right now thou art dumb as well as
blind
 
and catching light weight in his arms
sosia soon gained house and reached 
chamber from which lydia had escaped there
removing gag he left her to a solitude so
racked and terrible that out hades its anguish
could scarcely be exceeded
pompeii ijo
chapter xv
 sorrow boon companions for our afflictions
 dungeon and its victims
it was now late on third and day 
trial glaucus and olynthus a few hours after
 court had broke up and judgment been given
a small party fashionable youth at pompeii
were assembled round fastidious board 
lepidus
 so glaucus denies his crime to said
clodius
yes but testimony arbaces was convincing
 he saw blow given answered lepidus

what could have been cause
why priest was a gloomy and sullen
fellow he probably rated glaucus soundly about
 
his gay life and gaming habits and ultimately
swore he would not consent to his marriage with
lone high words arose glaucus seems to have
been full passionate god and struck in
sudden exasperation excitement wine
 desperation abrupt remorse brought on 
delirium under which he suffered for some 
and i can readily imagine poor fellow that yet
confused by that delirium he is even now unconscious
 crime he committed such at
least is shrewd conjecture arbaces who
seems to have been most kind and forbearing in
his testimony
yes he has made himself generally popular
by it but in consideration these extenuating
circumstances senate should have relaxed 
sentence
and they would have done so but for 
people but they were outrageous priests
had spared no pains to excite them and they
imagined ferocious brutes because glaucus
was a rich man and a gentleman that he was
pompeii 
likely to escape and therefore they were inveterate
against him and doubly resolved upon his
sentence senate did not dare refuse to strip
him rights citizenship and so pass judgment
 death though after all there was but a
majority three against him ho chian 
 he looks sadly altered but how composed
and fearless
ay we shall see if his firmness will 
over tomorrow but what merit in courage
when that atheistical hound olinthus manifested
 same 
 blasphemer yes said lepidus with
pious wrath no wonder that one decurions
was but two ago struck dead by
lightning in a serene sky gods feel vengeance
against pompeii while vile desecrator is
alive within its walls
pliny says that immediately before irruption vesuvius
one doctrines imunicipales was though heaven
was unclouded struck dead by lightning
 
yet so lenient was senate that had he but
expressed his penitence and scattered a few grains
 incense on altar cybele he would have
ijeen let off i doubt whether these nazarenes
had they state religion would be as tolerant
to up supposing we had kicked down image
 their deity blasphemed its rites and denied its
faith
they give glaucus one chance in consideration
 circumstances they allow him against
 lion use same stiles wherewith he
smote priest
hast thou seen lion hast thou looked at
his teeth and fangs and wilt thou call that a
chance why sword and buckler would be
mere reed and papyrus against rush 
mighty beast o i think true mercy has
been not to leave him long in suspense and it was
therefore fortunate for him that our benign laws are
slow to pronounce but swift to execute and that
 games amphitheatre had been by a sort
pompeii 
 providence so long since fixed for tomorrow
he who awaits death dies twice
as for atheist said clodius he is to
cope grim tiger nakedhanded well these
combats are past betting on who will take 
odds
a peal laughter announced ridicule 
 question
poor clodius said host to lose a
friend is something but to find no one to bet on
 chance his escape is a worse misfortune to
thee
why it is provoking it would have been
some consolation to him and to me to think he
was useful to 
 people said grave pansa are all
delighted with result they were so much
afraid sports at amphitheatre would go
off without a criminal for beasts and now to
get two such criminals is indeed a joy for 
poor fellows they work liard they ought to
have some amusement
 
there speaks popular pansa who never
moves without a string clients as long as an
indian triumph he is always prating about 
people gods he will by being a gracchus 
certainly i am no insolent aristocrat said
pansa with a generous air
well observed lepidus it would have
been assuredly dangerous to have been merciful
at eve a beastfight if ever come to be
tried pray jupiter there may be either no beasts
in vivaria or plenty criminals in jail
and pray said one party what
has become poor girl whom glaucus was
to have married a widow without being a bride
that is hard 
oh returned clodius she is safe under 
protection her guardian arbaces it was natural
she should go to him when she had lost
both lover and brother
by sweet venus glaucus was fortunate
among women they say rich julia was
in love with him
pompeii 
a mere fable my friend said clodius economically
 i was with her today if any
feeling sort she ever conceived i flatter
myself that have consoled her
hush gentlemen said pansa do you not
know that clodius is employed at house 
diomed in blowing hard at torch it begins
to burn and will soon shine bright on shrine
 hymen
is it so said lepidus what clodius
become a married man fie 
never fear answered clodius old diomed
is delighted at notion marrying his
daughter to a nobleman and will come down
largely with sesterces you will see that i
shall not lock them up in atrium it will bea
white day for his jolly friends when clodius
marries an heiress
say you so cried lepidus come then a
full cup to health fair julia 
while such was conversation one not
discordant to tone mind common among
 
 dissipated that day and which might perhaps
a century ago have found an echo in 
looser circles paris while such i say was 
conversation in gaudy triclinium lepidus
far different scene which scowled before 
young athenian
after his condemnation glaucus was admitted
no more to gentle guardianship sallust
 only friend his distress he was led along
 forum till guards stopped at a small door
by side temple jupiter you may
see place still door opened in centre
in a somewhat singular fashion revolving round
on its hinges as it were like a modern turnstile
so as only to leave half threshold open at 
same time through this narrow aperture they
thrust prisoner placed before him a loaf and
a pitcher water and left him to darkness and
as he thought to solitude so sudden had been
that revolution fortune which had prostrated
him from palmy height youthful pleasure
and successful love to lowest abyss igno
pompeii 
many and horror a most bloody death that
he could scarcely convince himself that he was
not held in meshes some fearful dream
his elastic and glorious frame had triumphed
over a potion greater part vrhich he
had fortunately not drained he had recovered
sense and consciousness but still a dim and
misty depression clung to his nerves and darkened
his mind his natural courage and 
greek nobility pride enabled him to vanquish
all unbecoming apprehension and in judgment
court to face his awful lot with a steady
mien and unavailing eye but consciousness
 innocence scarcely sufficed to support him when
 gaze men no longer excited his haughty
valour and he was left to loneliness and silence
he felt damps dungeon sink chillingly
into his enfeebled frame he fastidious
 luxurious refined he who had hitherto
braved no hardship and known no sorrow beautiful
bird that he was why had he left his far
and sunny clime olive groves his native
 
hills music immemorial streams why
had he wantoned on his glittering plumage amidst
these harsh and ungenial strangers dazzling 
eye with his gorgeous hues charming ear
with his blithesome song thus suddenly to be
arrested caged in darkness a victim and a
prey his gay flights for ever over his hymns
 gladness for ever stilled poor athenian 
his very faults exuberance a gentle and
joyous nature how little had his past career fitted
him for trials he was destined to undergo 
 hoots mob amidst whose plaudits he
had so often guided his graceful car and bounding
steed still rung gratingly in his ear cold
and stony faces his former friends comates
 his merry revels still rose before his eye
none now were by to soothe to sustain 
admired adulated stranger these walls
opened but on dread arena a violent and
shameful death and lone her too he had
heard nought no encouraging word no pitying
message she too had forsaken him she bepompeii

lived him guilty and what crime 
murder a brother he ground his teeth he
groaned aloud and ever a sharp fear shot across
him in that fell and fierce delirium which had
 unaccountably seized his soul which had so
ravaged disordered brain might he not indeed
unknowing to himself have committed 
crime which he was accused yet as 
thought flashed upon him it was as suddenly
checked for amidst all darkness past
he thought distinctly to recall dim grove 
cybele upward face pale dead 
pause that he had made beside corpse and
 sudden shock that felled him to earth
he felt convinced his innocence and yet who
to latest time long after his mangled remains
were mingled with elements would believe
him guiltless or uphold his fame as he recalled
his interview with arbaces and causes 
revenge which had been excited in heart 
that dark and fearful man he could not but
believe that he was victim some deeplaid
 
and mysterious snare clue and train which
he was lost in attempting to discover and lone 
arbaces loved her might his rival's success be
founded upon his ruin that thought cut him
more deeply than all and his noble heart was
more stung by jealousy than appalled by fear
again he groaned aloud
a voice from recess darkness answered
that burst anguish who it said
is my companion in this awful hour athenian
glaucus is it thou 
 so indeed they called me in mine hour 
fortune they may have other names for me now
and thy name stranger 
 is olinthus thy comate in prison as 
trial
what he whom they call atheist is
it injustice men that hath taught thee to
deny providence gods
alas answered olinthus j thou not i 
art true atheist for thou denies sole true
god unknown one to whom thy athenian
pompeii 
fathers erected an altar it is in this hour that i
know my god he is with me in dungeon 
his smile penetrates darkness on eve 
death my heart whispers immortality and earth
recedes from me but to bring weary soul
nearer unto heaven
tell me said glaucus abruptly did i
not hear thy name coupled with that apsecides
in my trial dost thou believe me guilty 
god alone reads heart but my suspicion
rested not upon thee
on whom then 
 thy accuser arbaces
ha thou clearest me and wherefore 
because i know man's evil breast and
he had cause to fear him who is now dead
with that olinthus proceeded to inform glaucus
 those details which reader already knows 
 conversion apsecides plan they had
proposed for detection impostures 
 egyptian priestcraft and seductions
practised by arbaces upon youthful weakness
 
 proselyte had therefore concluded
olinthus had deceased encountered arfaces
reviled his treasons and threatened detection
 place hour might have favoured
 wrath egyptian and passion and craft
alike dictated fatal blow
it must have been so cried glaucus joyfully
 i am happy
 yet what o unfortunate avails to thee now
 discovery thou art condemned and fated 
and in thine innocence thou wilt perish
but i shall know twsez guiltless and in my
mysterious madness i had fearful though momentary
doubts yet tell me man a strange creed
thickest thou that for small errors or for ancestral
faults we are ever abandoned and accursed
by powers above whatever name thou allotted
to them
god is just and abandons not his creatures
for their mere human frailty god is merciful
and curses none but wicked who repent
not
pompeii 
yet it seemeth to me as if in divine
anger i had been smitten by a sudden madness 
a supernatural and solemn frenzy wrought not by
human means
there are demons on earth answered 
nazarene fearfully as well as there are god
and his son in heaven and since thou acknowledges
not first may have had power
over thee
glaucus did not reply and there was a silence
for some minutes at length athenian said
in a changed and soft and halfhesitating voice
christian believes thou among doctrines
 thy creed that dead live again that they
who have loved here are united hereafter that
beyond grave our good name shines pure from
 mortal mists that unjustly dim it in grosseyed
world and that streams which are divided
by desert and rock meet in 
solemn hades and flow once more into one
believe i that o athenian no i do not
believe i knoic and it is that beautiful and
g
 
blessed assurance which supports me now o
college continued olynthus passionately biide
 my heart torn from me in first month 
our nuptials shall i not see thee yet and ere
many be past welcome welcome death
that will bring me to heaven and thee 
there was something in this sudden burst 
human affection which struck a kindred chord on
 soul greek he felt for first time
a sympathy greater than mere affliction between
him and his companion he crept nearer towards
olinthus for italians fierce in some points
were not unnecessarily cruel in others they spared
 separate cell and superfluous chain and
allowed victims arena sad comfort
 such freedom and such companionship as 
prison would afford
 yes continued christian with holy
fervour immortality soul resurrection
 reunion dead is great
principle our creed great truth a god
suffered death itself to attest and proclaim no
pompeii 
fabled elysium no poetic orcus but a pure
and radiant heritage heaven itself is portion
 good
 tell me then thy doctrines and expound tome
thy hopes said glaucus earnestly
olinthus was not slow to obey that prayer 
and there as oftentimes in early ages 
christian creed it was in darkness 
dungeon and over approach death that
 dawning gospel shed its soft and consecrating rays
chapter xvi
a chance fon glaucus
 hours passed in lingering torture over 
head lydia from time in which she had
been replaced in her cell
sosia as if afraid he should be again outwitted
had refrained from visiting her until late
in morning following day and then he
but thrust in periodical basket food and
wine and hastily closed door that day
rolled on and lydia felt herself pent barred 
inexorably confined when that day was 
 glaucus and when her release would
have saved him yet knowing that almost
impossible as seemed her escape sole chance
pompeii 
for life glaucus rested on her this young
girl frail passionate and acutely susceptible as
she was resolved not to give way to a despair
that would disable her from seizing whatever
opportunity might occur she kept her senses
whenever beneath whirl intolerable thought
they reeled and tottered nay she took food and
wine that she might sustain her strength that
she might he pispared
she revolved scheme after scheme escape
and was forced to dismiss all yet sosia was her
only hope only instrument with which she
could tamper he had been superstitious in 
hope ascertaining whether he could eventually
purchase his freedom blessed gods might he
not be won by bribe freedom itself was
she not nearly rich enough to purchase it her
slender arms were covered with bracelets 
presents lone and on her neck she yet wore
that very chain which it may be remembered
had occasioned her jealous quarrel with glaucus
and which she had afterwards promised vainly to
 
wear for ever she waited burningly till sosia
should again appear but as hour after hour
passed and he came not she grew impatient
every nerve beat with fever she could endure
 solitude no longer she groaned she shrieked
aloud she beat herself against door her
cries echoed along hall and sosia in peevish
anger hastened to see what was matter and
silence his prisoner if possible
sho ho what is this said he surlily
young slave if thou screamed out thus we
must gag thee my shoulders will smart for it if
thou art heard by my master
kind sosia chide me not i cannot endure
to be so long alone answered lydia 
solitude appals me sit with me i pray a little
while nay fear not that i should attempt to
escape place thy seat before door keep
thine eye on me i will not stir from this spot
sosia who was a considerable gossip himself
was moved by this address he pitied one who
had nobody to talk with it was his case too he
pompeii 
pitied and resolved to relieve himself he took
 hint lydia placed a stool before door
leant his back against it and replied 
 i am sure i do not wish to be churlish and
so far as a little innocent chat goes i have no
objection to indulge you but mind no tricks 
no more conjuring
 no no tell me dear sosia what is 
hour
it is already evening goats are going
home
 o gods how went trial 
 both condemned
lydia repressed shriek well well i
thought it would be so when do they suffer
tomorrow in amphitheatre if it were not
for thee little wretch i should be allowed to go
with rest and see it
lydia leant back for some moments nature
could endure no more she had fainted away
but sosia did not perceive it for it was dusk
 eve and he was full his own privations he
 
went on lamenting loss so delightful a show
and accusing injustice arbaces for singling
him out from all his fellows to be converted into a
jailor and ere he had half finished lydia with
a deep sigh recovered sense life
thou highest blind one at my loss well
that is some comfort so long as you acknowledge
how much you cost me i will endeavour not
to grumble it's hard to be illtreated and yet not
pitied
sosia how much dost thou require to makeup
 purchase thy freedom 
how much why about two thousand sesterces

 gods be praised not more seest thou
these bracelets and this chain they are well
worth double that sum i will give them thee
if 
tempt me not i cannot release thee arfaces
is a severe and awful master who knows
but i might feed fishes sarnus alas 
all sesterces in world would not buy me
pompeii 
back into life better a live dog than a dead
lion
sosia thy freedom think well if thou wilt
let me out only for one little hour let me out
at midnight i will return ere tomorrow's dawn 
nay thou canst go with me
no said sosia sturdily a slave once disobeyed
arbaces and he was never more heard 
but law gives a master no power over 
life his slave
 law is very obliging but more polite than
efficient i know that arbaces always gets 
law on his side besides if i am once dead what
law can bring me to life again 
lydia wrung her hands is there no hope
then said she convulsively
none escape till arbaces give word
well then said lydia quickly thou wilt
not at least refuse to take a letter for me thy
master cannot kill thee for that to whom prsetor
 
to a magistrate no jot i i should be
made a witness in court for what i know and
 way they crossexamine a slave is by 
torture
 pardon i meant not prsetor it was a
word that escaped me unawares i meant quite
another person gay sallust
oh and what want you with him 
glaucus was my master he purchased me from
a cruel lord he alone has been kind to me he is
to die i shall never live happily if i cannot in
his hour trial and doom let him know that one
heart is grateful to him sallust is his friend he
will convey my message
i am sure he will do no such thing glaucus
will have enough to think between this and tomorrow
without troubling his head about a blind
girl
man said lydia rising wilt thou become
free thou hast osier in thy power tomorrow
it will be too late never was freedom more
cheaply purchased thou canst easily and unpompeii
 
missed leave home less than half an hour will
suffice for thine absence and for such a trifle
wilt thou refuse liberty 
sosia was greatly moved it was true 
request was remarkably silly but what was that
to him so much better he could lock 
door on lydia and if arbaces should learn his
absence offence was venial and would merit
but a reprimand yet should lydia's letter contain
something more than what she had said 
should it speak her imprisonment as he shrewdly
conjectured it would do what then it need
never be known to arbaces that he had carried
 letter at worst bribe was enormous 
 risk light temptation irresistible he
hesitated no longer he assented to proposal
 give me trinkets and i will take 
letter yet stay thou art a slave thou hast no
right to these ornaments they are thy master's
they were gifts glaucus he is my
master what chance hath he to claim them 
who else will know they are in my possession 
 
enough i will bring thee papyrus
in a few minutes lydia had concluded her
letter which she took precaution to write in
greek language her childhood and which
almost every italian higher ranks was then
supposed to know she carefully wound round
 epistle protecting thread and covered its
knot with wax and ere she placed it in hands
 sosia she thus addressed him 
sosia i am blind and in prison thou mayst
think to deceive me thou mayst pretend only to
take this letter to sallust thou mayst not fulfil
thy charge but here i solemnly dedicate thy
head to vengeance thy soul to infernal powers
if thou wrongest thy trust and i call upon thee
to place thy right hand faith in mine and repeat
after me these words by ground on which
we stand by elements which contain life and
can curse life by orcus allavenging by
 olympian jupiter allseeing i swear
that i will honestly discharge my trust and faithfully
deliver into hands sallust this letter
pompeii 
and if i perjure myself in this oath may full
curses heaven and hell be wreaked upon me 
enough i trust thee take thy reward it is
already dark depart at once
thou art a strange girl and thou hast frightened
me terribly but it is all very natural and
if sallust is to be found i give him this letter as i
have sworn by my faith i may have my little
peccadilloes but perjury no i leave that to my
betters
with this sosia withdrew carefully passing
athwart lydia's door heavy bolt carefully
locking its wards and hanging key to his
girdle he retired to his own den enveloped himself
from head to foot in a huge disguising cloak and
slipped out by back way undisturbed and
unseen
 streets were thin and empty he soon
gained house sallust porter bade him
leave his letter and begone for sallust was so
grieved at condemnation glaucus that he
could not on any account be disturbed
 
nevertheless i have sworn to give this letter
into his own hands do so i must and sosia well
knowing by experience that cerberus loves a sop
thrust some halfadozen sesterces into hand
 porter
well well said relenting you
may enter if you will but to tell you truth
sallust is drinking himself out his grief it is
his way when any thing disturbs him he orders
a capital supper best wine and does not give
over till every thing is out his head but 
hquor
an excellent plan excellent ah what it
is to be rich if i were sallust i would have
some grief or another every day but just say a
kind word for me with atriensis i see him
coming
sallust was too sad to receive company he
was too sad also to drink alone so as was his wont
he admitted his favourite freedman to his entertainment
and a stranger banquet never was held
for ever and anon kindhearted epicure sighed
pompeii 
whimpered wept outright and then turned with
double zest to some new dish or his refilled goblet
 my good fellow said he to his companion
 it was a most awful judgment height it is
not bad that kid eh poor dear glaucus 
what a jaw lion has too ah ah ah 
and sallust sobbed loudly fit was stopped
by a counteraction hiccups
take a cup wine said freedman
a thought too cold but then how cold
glaucus must be shut up house tomorrow
not a slave shall stir forth none my people
shall honour that cursed arena no no
a cup wine your grief distracts you by
 gods it does a piece that cheesecake
it was at this auspicious moment that sosia
was admitted to presence disconsolate
carouser
ho what art thou
merely a messenger to sallust i give him
this billet from a young lady there is no answer
that i know may i withdraw 
 op
thus said discreet sosia keeping his face
muffled in his cloak and speaking with a feigned
voice so that he might not hereafter be recognised

by gods a pimp unfeeling wretch
do you not see my sorrows go and 
curses pandarus with you 
sosia lost not a moment in retiring
 will you read letter sallust said 
freedman
letter which letter said epicure
reeling for he began to see double a curse on
these wenches say i am i a man to think 
hiccup pleasure when when my friend
is going to be eat up
eat another tartlet
 no no my grief chokes me 
take him to bed said freedman and
sallust's head now declining fairly on his breast
they bore him off to his cubiculum still muttering
lamentations for glaucus and imprecations on
 unfeeling invitations ladies pleasure
pompeii 
meanwhile sosia strode indignantly homeward
pimp indeed quoth he to himself pimp 
a scurvytongued fellow that sallust had i
been called knave or thief i could have forgiven
it but pimp faugh there is something in 
word which toughest stomach in world
would rise against a knave is a knave for his
own pleasure and a thief a thief for his own
profit and there is something honourable and
philosophical in being a rascal for one's own sake 
that is doing things upon principle upon a grand
scale but a pimp is a thing that defiles itself
for another a pipkin that is put on fire for
another man's pottage a napkin that every
guest wipes his hands upon and scullion
says by your leave to a pimp i would
rather he had called me parricide but man
was drunk and did not know what he said and
besides i disguised myself had he seen it had
been sosia who addressed him it would have
been honest sosia and worthy man 
rant nevertheless trinkets have been won
easily that's some comfort and o goddess
verona i shall be a freedman soon and then
i should like to see who'll call me pimp 
unless indeed he pay me pretty handsomely for it 
while sosia was soliloquising in this highminded
and generous vein his path lay along a narrow
lane that led towards amphitheatre and its
adjacent palaces suddenly as he turned a sharp
corner he found himself in midst a considerable
crowd men women and children
all were hurrying on laughing talking gesticulating
 and ere he was aware it worthy
sosia was borne away with noisy stream
what now he asked his nearest neighbour
a young artificer what now where
are all these good folks thronging does any
rich patron give away alms or viands tonight 
 not so man better still replied artificer
 noble pansa people's friend 
pompeii 
has granted public leave to see beasts in
their vivaria by hercules they will not be seen
so safely by some persons tomorrow 
tis a pretty sight said slave yielding
to throng that impelled him onward and
since i may not go to sports tomorrow i
may as well take a peep at beasts tonight
you will do well returned his new acquaintance
 a lion and a tiger are not to be seen at
pompeii every day
 crowd had now entered a broken and wide
space ground on which as it was only lighted
scantily and from a distance press became
dangerous to those whose limbs and shoulders
were not fitted for a mob nevertheless 
women especially many them with children
in their arms or even at breast were 
most resolute in forcing their way and their shrill
exclamations complaint or objurgation were
heard loud above more jovial and masculine
voices yet amidst them was a young and girlish
voice that appeared to come from one too happy

in her excitement to be alive to inconvenience crowd
aha cried young woman to some 
her companions i always told you so i always
said we should have a man for lion and now
we have one for tiger too i wish tomorrow
were come 
ho ho for merry merry show
with a forest faces in every row 
lo swordsmen bold as son alcmsena
sweep side by side o'er hushed arena
talk while you may you will hold your breath
when they meet in grasp glowing death 
tramp tramp how gaily they go 
ho ho for merry merry show 
a jolly girl said sosia
yes replied young artificer a curlyheaded
handsome youth yes i replied he
enviously women love a gladiator if i
had been a slave i would have soon found my
schoolmaster in lanista 
pompeii 
would you indeed said sosia with a sneer
people's notions differ
 crowd had now arrived at place 
destination but as cell in which wild
beasts were confined was extremely small and narrow
tenfold more vehement than it hitherto had
been was rush and press aspirants to obtain
admittance two officers amphitheatre
placed at entrance very wisely mitigated
 evil by dispensing to foremost only
a limited number tickets at a time and admitting
no new visitors till their predecessors had
sated their curiosity sosia who was a tolerably
stout fellow and not troubled with any remarkable
scruples diffidence or goodbreeding contrived
to be among first initiated
separated from his companion artificer
sosia found himself in a narrow cell oppressive
heat and atmosphere and lighted by several rank
and flaring torches
animals usually kept in different vivaria
or dens were now for greater entertainment
 
visitors placed in one but equally indeed
divided from each other by strong cages protected
by iron bars
there they were fell and grim wanderers
 desert who have now become almost 
principal agents this story lion who
as being more gentle by nature than his
fellowbeast had been more incited to ferocity
by hunger stalked restlessly and fiercely to and
fro his narrow confines his eyes were lurid with
rage and famine and as every now and then he
paused and glared around spectators fearfully
pressed backward and drew their breath more
quickly but tiger lay quiet and extended at
full length in his cage and only by an occasional
play his tail or a long impatient yawn testified
any emotion at his confinement or at crowd
which honoured him with their presence
i have seen no fiercer beast than yon lion
even in amphitheatre rome said a gigantic
and sinewy fellow who stood at right hand 
sosia
pompeii 
 i feel humbled when i look at his limbs
replied at left sosia a slighter and younger
figure with his arms folded on his breast
 slave looked first at one and then at 
other virtus in medio i virtue is ever in 
middle muttered he to himself a goodly
neighbourhood for thee sosia a gladiator on
each side 
that is well said lydon returned huger
gladiator i feel same
and to think observed lydon in a tone 
deep feeling to think that noble greek he
whom we saw but a day or two since before us so
full youth and health and joyousness is to
feast yon monster 
why not growled niger savagely many
an honest gladiator has been compelled to a like
combat by emperor why not a wealthy
murderer by law
lydon sighed shrugged his shoulders and remained
silent meanwhile common gazers
listened with staring eyes and lips apart 
 
gladiators were objects interest as well as 
beasts they were animals same species 
so crowd glanced from one to other 
men and brutes whispering their comments
and anticipating morrow
 well said lydon turning away i thank
 gods that it is not lion or tiger am to
contend with even you niger are a gentler
combatant than they
but equally dangerous said gladiator
with a fierce laugh and bystanders admiring
his vast limbs and ferocious countenance
grinned too
that as it may be answered lydon carelessly
as he pressed through throng and quitted
 den
 i may as well take advantage his shoulders
thought prudent sosia hastening to follow him 
 crowd always give way to a gladiator so i
will keep close behind and come in for a share 
his consequence
 son medon strode quickly through 
pompeii 
mob many whom recognised his features and
profession
that is young lydon a brave fellow he
fights tomorrow said one
ah i have a bet on him said another
see how firmly he walks 
good luck to thee lydon said a third
lydon you have my wishes halfwhispered
a fourth smiling a comely woman middle
classes and if you win why you may hear
more me
a handsome man by venus cried a fifth
who was a girl scarce in her teens thank
you returned sosia gravely taking compliment
to himself
however strong purer motives lydon
and certain though it be that he would never
have entered so bloody a calling but from 
hope obtaining his father's freedom he was
not altogether unmoved by notice he excited
he forgot that voices now raised in commendation
might on morrow be shouting over
his deathpangs fierce and reckless as well as
generous and warmhearted by nature he was
already imbued with pride a profession
that he fancied he disdained and affected by 
influence a companionship that in reality he
loathed he saw himself now a man importance
 his step grew yet lighter and his mien
more elate
niger said he turning suddenly as he had
now threaded crowd we have often quarrelled
 we are not matched against each other
but one us at least may reasonably expect to
fall give us thy hand 
most readily saidsosia extending his palm
ha what fool is this why i thought niger
was at my heels 
i forgive mistake replied sosia condescendingly
don't mention it error was
easy i and niger are somewhat same
build
ha ha that is excellent niger would
have slit thy throat had he heard thee 
pompeii 
you gentlemen arena have a most
disagreeable mode talking said sosia let
us change conversation
val val r said lydon impatiently i
am in no humour to converse with thee 
why truly returned slave you must
have serious thoughts enough to occupy your
mind tomorrow is i think your first essay in
 arena well i am sure you will die bravely 
may thy words fall on thine own head said
lydon superstitiously for he by no means liked
 blessing sosia die no i trust mis
hour is not yet come 
he who plays at dice with death must expect
 dog's throw replied sosia maliciously 
but you are a strong fellow and i wish you all
imaginable luck and so vale 
with that slave turned on his heel and
took his way homeward
i trust rogue's words were not ominous
said lydon musingly in my zeal for my
father's liberty and my confidence in my own
 
thews and sinews i have not contemplated 
possibility death my poor father i am thy
only son if i were to fall 
as thought crossed him gladiator
strode on with a more rapid and restless pace
when suddenly in an opposite street he beheld
 very object his thoughts leaning on his
stick his form bent by care and age his eyes
downcast and his steps trembling greyhaired
medon slowly approached towards gladiator
lydon paused a moment he divined at once 
cause that brought forth old man at that late
hour
be sure it is i whom he seeks thought he 
he is horrorstruck at condemnation olinthus
 he more than ever esteems arena criminal
and hateful he comes again to dissuade me
from contest i must shun him i cannot
brook his prayers his tears
these thoughts so long to recite flashed across
 young man like lightning he turned abruptly
and fled swiftly in an opposite direction
pompeii 
he paused not till almost spent and breathless
lie found himself on summit a small acclivity
which overlooked most gay and splendid
part that miniature city and as he there
paused and gazed along tranquil streets
glittering in rays moon which had
just arisen and brought partially and picturesquely
into light crowd around amphitheatre
at a distance murmuring and swaying to
and fro influence scene affected him
rude and unimaginative though his nature he
sat himself down to rest upon steps a
deserted portico and felt calm hour
quiet and restore him opposite and near at hand
 lights gleamed from a palace in which 
master now held his revels doors were open
for coolness and gladiator beheld numerous
and festive group gathered round tables
in atrium while behind them closing 
long vista illumined rooms beyond 
in atrium as i have elsewhere observed a larger party
 guests than ordinary was frequently entertained
 
spray distant fountain sparkled in 
moonbeams there were garlands wreathed
round columns hall there gleamed
still and frequent marble statue there
amidst peals jocund laughter rose music
and lay
ifngwieiljsf sos
away with your stories hades
which flamen has forged to affright us 
we laugh at your three maiden ladies
your fates and your sullen cocytus
poor jove has a troublesome life sir
could we credit your tales his portals 
in shutting his ears on his wife sir
and opening his eyes upon mortals
oh blest be bright epicurus 
who taught us to laugh at such fables 
on hades they wanted to moor us
and his hand cut terrible cables
pompeii 
if then there's a jove or a juno
they vex not their heads about us man 
besides if they did i and yon know

what think you gods place their bliss eh 
in playing spy on a sinner 
in counting girls that we kiss eh 
or cups that we empty at dinner

this music this wine and this mirth boys
we care not for gods up above us 
we know there's no god for this earth boys 
while ly don's piety which accommodating as
it might be was in no slight degree disturbed by
these verses which embodied fashionable philosophy
 day slowly recovered itself from
 shock it had received a small party menin
plain garments and middle class passed
 
by his restingplace they were in earnest conversation
and did not seem to notice or heed 
gladiator as they moved on
o horror on horrors said one olinthus

to sentence an innocent man to same arena

thunder sinai may yet be heard and lord
preserve his saint fool has said in his

at that moment out broke again from 
illumined palace burden revellers

a sudden silence from startled hall revel
succeeded these ominous avoids christians
swept on and were soon hidden from sight 
 gladiator awed he scarce knew why by 
mystic denunciations christians lydon
after a short pause now rose to pursue his way
homeward
before him how serenely slept starlight
on that lovely city how breathlessly its pillared
streets reposed in their security how
softly rippled darkgreen waves beyond 
pompeii 
how cloudless spread aloft and blue dreaming
campaniann skies yet this was night for
 gay pompeii colony hoar chaldean
 fabled city hercules delight
 voluptuous roman age after age had
rolled destructive unheeded over its head 
and now ray quivered on dialplate 
its doom gladiator heard some light steps
behind a group females were wending homeward
from their visit to amphitheatre as he
turned his eye was arrested by a strange and sudden
apparition from summit vesuvius
darkly visible at distance there shot a pale
meteoric livid light it trembled an instant and
was gone and at same moment that his eye
caught it voice one youngest 
women broke out hilariously and shrill 
tramp tramp how gaily they go 
ho ho for morrow's merry show 
a page we care not for gods up above us 
we know there's no god for this earth boys 
 doctrines epicurus himself are pure and simple far
from denying existence diviner powers villeins defender
and explainer his philosophy in cicero's dialogue on 
nature gods asserts that epicurus was first who
saw that there were gods from impression which nature herself
makes on minds all men he imagined belief 
 deity to be an innate or antecedent notion roxfipis 
mind a doctrine which modern metaphysicians certainly not
epicurean have largely availed themselves he believed that
worship was due to divine powers from veneration which
felicity and excellence command and not from any dread their
vengeance or awe their power a sublime and fearless philosophy
suitable perhaps to half a dozen great and refined spirits
but which would present no check to passions mass 
mankind according to him gods were far too agreeably
employed in contemplating their own happiness to trouble
their heads about sorrows and joys quarrels and
 cares petty and transitory affairs man for this
earth they were unsympathising abstractions 
wrapt up in majesty divine
can they regard on what we dine 
cotta who in dialogue referred to attacks philosophy
 epicurus with great pleasantry and considerable though not
pompeii 
uniform success draws evident and practical corollary from
 theory that asserts noninterference gods how
says he can there be sanctity if gods regard not human
affairs if deity shew no benevolence to man let us dismiss
him at once why should i entreat him to be propitious he
cannot be propitious since according to you favour and benevolence
are only effects imbecility cotta indeed quotes
from poisonous de natura decorum to prove that epicurus did
not really believe in existence a god but that his concession
 a being wholly nugatory was merely a precaution
against accusations atheism epicurus could not be such a
fool says cotta as sincerely to believe that a deity has 
members a man without power to use them a thin pellucidity
regarding no one and doing nothing and whether thisbe
true or false concerning epicurus it is certain that to all
effects and purposes his later disciples were but refining atheists
 sentiments uttered in song in text are precisely
those professed in sober prose by graceful philosophers 
garden who as they had wholly perverted morals epicurus
which are at once pure and practical found it a much
easier task to corrupt his metaphysics which are equally dangerous
and visionary

 dream graces a visitor and a warning
to egyptian
 awful night preceding fierce joy 
amphitheatre rolled drearily away and gayly
broke forth dawn day 
pompeii air was uncommonly calm and
sultry a thin and dull mist gathered over 
valleys and hollows broad campaniann fields
but yet it was remarked in surprise by early
fisherman that despite exceeding stillness 
 atmosphere waves sea were agitated
and seemed as it were to run disturbed
back from shore while along blue and
stately sarnus whose ancient breadth channel
 traveller now vainly seeks to discover there

crept a hoarse and sullen murmur as it glided
by laughing plains and gaudy villas 
wealthy citizens clear above low mist rose
 timeworn towers immemorial town
 redtiled roofs bright streets solemn
columns many temples and statuecrowned
portals forum and arch 
triumph far in distance outline 
 circling hills soared above vapours and
mingled with changeful hues morning
sky cloud that had so long rested over 
crest vesuvius had suddenly vanished and its
rugged and haughty brow looked without a frown
over beautiful scenes below
despite earliness immature hour 
gates city were opened horseman upon
horseman vehicle after vehicle poured rapidly
in and voices numerous pedestrian groups
clad in holyday attire rose high in joyous and
excited merriment streets were crowded with
citizens and strangers from populous neighbourhood
 pompeii and noisily fast conpompeii

fuseclly swept many streams life towards
 fatal show
despite vast size amphitheatre seemingly
so disproportioned to extent city
and formed to include nearly whole population
 pompeii itself so great on extraordinary occasions
was concourse strangers from all
parts campania that space before it was
usually crowded for several hours previous to 
commencement sports by such persons as
were not entitled by their rank to appointed and
special seats and intense curiosity which
 trial and sentence two criminals so remarkable
had occasioned increased crowd on
this day to an extent wholly unprecedented
while common people with lively vehemence
 their campaniann blood were thus
pushing scrambling hurrying on yet amidst
all their eagerness preserving as is now wont
with italians in such meetings a wonderful order
and quarrelsome good humour a strange
visitor to arbaces was threading her way to his
 
sequestered mansion at sight her quaint
and primaeval garb her wild gait and gestures
 passengers she encountered touched
each other and smiled but as they caught a
glimpse her countenance mirth was hushed
at once for face was as face dead 
and what with ghastly features and obsolete
robes stranger it seemed as if one long
entombed had risen once more amongst living
in silence and awe each group gave way as she
passed along and she soon gained broad
porch egyptian's palace
 black porter like rest world
astir at an unusual hour started as he opened 
door to her summons
 sleep egyptian had been unusually
profound during night but as dawn
approached it was disturbed by strange and
unquiet dreams which impressed him more
as they were coloured by peculiar philosophy
he embraced
pompeii 
he thought that he was transported to 
bowels earth and that he stood alone in a
mighty cavern supported by enormous columns 
rough and primaeval rock lost as they ascended
in vastness a shadow athwart whose eternal
darkness no beam day had ever glanced and
in space between these columns were huge
wheels that whirled round and round unceasingly
and with a rushing and roaring noise only to
 right and left extremities cavern 
space between pillars was left bare and 
apertures stretched away into galleries not wholly
dark but dimly lighted by wandering and erratic
fires that meteorlike now crept as snake
creeps along rugged and dank soil and now
leapt fiercely to and fro darting across vast
gloom in wild gambols suddenly disappearing
and as suddenly bursting into tenfold brilliancy
and power and while he gazed wonderingly
upon gallery to left thin mistlike aerial
shapes passed slowly up and when they had
gained hall they seemed to rise aloft and to
 
vanish as smoke vanishes in measureless
ascent
he turned in fear towards opposite extremity
 and behold there came swiftly from
 gloom above similar shadows which swept
hurriedly along gallery to right as if borne
involuntarily adown tides some invisible
stream and faces these spectres were more
distinct than those that emerged from opposite
passage and on some was joy and on others
sorrow some were vivid with expectation and
hope some unutterably dejected by awe and horror
and so they passed swift and constantly on till
 eyes gazer grew dizzy and blinded with
 whirl an ever varying succession things
impelled by a power apparently not their own
arbaces turned away and in recess 
hall he saw mighty form a giantess seated
upon a pile skulls and her hands were busy
upon a pale and shadowy woof and he saw that
 woof communicated with numberless
wheels as if it guided machinery their
pompeii 
movements he thought his feet by some secret
agency were impelled towards female and
that he was borne onwards till he stood before
her face to face countenance giantess
was solemn and hushed and beautifully serene
it was as face some colossal sculpture 
his own ancestral sphinx no passion no human
emotion disturbed its brooding and unwrinkled
brow there was neither sadness nor joy nor
memory nor hope it was free from all with
which wild human heart can sympathise
 mystery mysteries rested on its beauty it
awed but terrified not it was incarnation 
 sublime and arbaces felt voice leave
his lips without an impulse his own and 
voice asked
who art thou and what is thy task 
 i am that which thou hast acknowledged
answered without desisting from its work 
mighty phantom my name is nature these
are wheels world and my hand guides
them for life all things
 
and what said voice arbaces are
these galleries that strangely and fitfully illumined
stretch on either hand into abyss
 gloom 
 that answered giantmother which
thou beholds to left is gallery unborn
 shadows that flit onward and upward
into world are souls that pass from 
long eternity being to their destined pilgrimage
on earth that which thou beholds to thy
right wherein shadows descending from above
sweep on equally unknown and dim is gallery
 dead
and wherefore said voice arbaces
yon wandering lights that so wildly break 
darkness but only hreah not reveal
dark fool human sciences dreamer 
 stars and wouldbe decipherer heart
and origin things those lights are but 
glimmerings such knowledge as is vouchsafed
to nature to work her way to trace enough 
 past and future to give providence to her
pompeii 
designs judge then puppet as thou art what
lights are reserved for thee 
arbaces felt himself tremble as he asked again
 wherefore am i here 
 it is forecast thy soul prescience
 thy rushing doom shadow thy fate
lengthening into eternity as it declines from
earth
ere he could answer arbaces felt a rushing
wind sweep down cavern as wings a
giant god borne aloft from ground and
whirled on high as a leaf in storms autumn
he beheld himself in midst spectres 
 dead and hurrying with them along 
length gloom as in vain and impotent despair
he struggled against impelling power he
thought wind grew into something like a
shape a spectral outline wings and talons
 an eagle with limbs floating far and indistinctly
along air and eyes that alone clearly and
vividly seen glared stonily and remorselessly on
his own

what art thou again said voice 
egyptian
 i am that which thou hast acknowledged
and spectre laughed aloud and my name
is necessity
to what dost thou bear me
to unknown
to happiness or to wo
as thou hast sown so shalt thou reap
dread thing not so if thou art ruler
 life thine are my misdeeds not mine
i am but breath god answered 
mighty wind
 then is my wisdom vain groaned 
dreamer
 husbandman accuses not fate when
having sown thistles he reaps not corn thou
hast sown crime accuse not fate if thou respect
not harvest virtue
 scene suddenly changed arbaces was ina
place human bones and lo in midst 
them was a skull and skull still retaining its
pompeii 
fleshless hollows assumed slowly and in mysterious
confusion a dream face appetites 
and forth from grinning jaws there crept a
small worm and it crawled to feet arbaces
he attempted to stamp on it and crush it but it
became longer and larger with that attempt it
swelled and bloated till it grew into a vast serpent
 it coiled itself round limbs arbaces 
it crunched his bones it raised its glaring eyes
and poisonous jaws to his face he writhed in
vain he withered he gasped beneath influence
 blighting breath he felt himself
blasted into death and then a voice came from
 reptile which still bore face apsecides
and rang in his reeling ear 
thy victim is thy judge worm thou
wouldst crush becomes serpent that
devours thee
with a shriek wrath and wo and despairing
resistance arbaces awoke his hair on 
his brow bathed in dew his eyes glazed and
staring his mighty frame quivering as an in
 
sant's beneath agony that dream he
awoke he collected himself he blessed gods
whom he disbelieved that he was in a dream 
he turned his eyes from side to side he saw
 dawning light break through his small but
lofty window he was in precincts day
he rejoiced he smiled his eyes fell and
opposite to him he beheld ghastly features
 lifeless eye livid lip hag 
vesuvius 
ha he cried placing his hands before his
eyes as to shut out grisly vision do i dream
still am i with dead
 mighty hermes no thou art with one
deathlike but not dead recognise thy friend
and slave
there was a long silence slowly shudders
that passed over limbs egyptian chased
each other away saintlier and saintlier dying till
he was himself again
it was a dream then said he lyell 
let me dream no more or day cannot com
pompeii 
senate for pangs night woman how
earnest thou here and wherefore
i came to warn thee answered sepulchral
voice saga
 warn me dream hed not then what
peril
 listen to me some evil hangs over this
fated city fly while it he time thou knowest
that i hold my home on that mountain beneath
which old tradition saith there yet burn fires
 river phlegethon and in my cavern is
a vast abyss and in that abyss i have late
marked a red and dull stream creep slowly
slowly on and heard many and mighty sounds
hissing and roaring through gloom but
 night as i looked thereon behold stream
was no longer dull but intensely and fiercely
luminous and while i gazed beast that
liveth with me and was cowering by my side
uttered a shrill howl and fell down and died
we may suppose that exhalations were similar in effect
to those in grotto del cane
 
and slaver and froth were round his lips i
crept back to my lair but i distinctly heard all
 night rock shake and tremble and
though air was heavy and still there were 
hissing pent winds and grinding as 
wheels beneath ground so when i rose this
morning at very birth dawn i looked again
down abyss and i saw vast fragments stone
borne black and floatingly over lurid stream 
and stream itself was broader fiercer redder
than night before then i went forth and
ascended to summit rock and in that
summit there appeared a sudden and vast hollow
which i had never perceived before from which
curled a dim faint smoke and vapour was
deathly and i gasped and sickened and nearly
died i returned home i took my gold and my
drugs and left habitation many years for
i remembered dark etruscan prophecy which
saith when mountain opens city shall
fall when smoke crowns hill 
parched fields there shall be wo and weeping
pompeii 
in hearths children sea dread
master ere i leave these walls for some more
distant dwelling i come to thee as thou livest
know i in my heart that earthquake that
sixteen years ago shook this city to its solid base
is but forerunner more deadly doom 
walls pompeii are built above fields 
dead and rivers sleepless hell be
warned and fly
witch i thank thee for thy care one not
ungrateful on yon table stands a cup gold 
take it it is thine i dreamt not that there lived
one out priesthood isis who would have
saved arbaces from destruction signs thou
hast seen in bed extinct volcano continued
 egyptian musingly surely tell 
some coming danger to city perhaps another
earthquake fiercer than be that as it
may there is a new reason for my hastening from
these walls after this day i will prepare my
departure daughter etruria whither eldest
thou 
 
i shall cross over to herculaneum this day
and wandering thence along coast shall seek
out a new home i am friendless my two companions
 fox and snake are dead great
hermes thou hast promised me twenty additional
years life
ay said egyptian i have promised
thee but woman he added lifting himself
upon his arm and gazing curiously on her face
tell me i pray thee wherefore thou wishes
to live what sweets dost thou discover in existence
 
it is not life that is sweet but death that is
awful replied hag in a sharp impressive
tone that struck forcibly upon heart 
vain starseer he winced at truth 
reply and no longer anxious to retain so uninviting
a companion he said time wanes i
must prepare for solemn spectacle this day
sister farewell enjoy thyself as thou canst over
 ashes life
 hag who had placed costly gift 
pompeii 
arbaces in loose folds her vest now rose to
depart when she had gained door she
paused turned back and said this may bethe
 time we meet on earth but whither lieth
 flame when it leaves ashes wandering
to and fro up and down as an exhalation
on morass flame may be seen in 
marshes lake below and witch and
 magian pupil and master 
great one and accursed one may meet again
farewell 
out croaker muttered arbaces as door
closed on hag's tattered robes and impatient
 his own thoughts not yet recovered from 
past dream lie hastily summoned his slaves
it was custom to attend ceremonials 
 amphitheatre in festive robes and arbaces
arrayed himself that day with more than usual
care his tunic was most dazzling white 
his many fibula were formed from most
precious stones over his tunic flowed a loose
eastern robe half gown half mantle glowing in
 
 richest hues tyrian dye and sandals
that reached half way up knee were studded
with gems and inlaid with gold in quackeries
that belonged to his priestly genius arbaces
never neglected on great occasions arts
which dazzle and impose upon vulgar and
on this day that was for ever to release him
by sacrifice glaucus from fear 
a rival and chance detection he felt that
he was arraying himself as for a triumph or a
nuptial feast
it was customary for men rank to be accompanied
to shows amphitheatre by a procession
 their slaves and freed men and long
family arbaces were already arranged in
order to attend litter their lord
only to their great chagrin slaves in attendance
on lone and worthy sosia as jailer
to lydia were condemned to remain at home
callias said arbaces apart to his freedman
who was buckling on his girdle i am
weary pompeii i propose to quit it in three
pompeii 
 should wind favour thou knowest 
vessel that lies in harbour and belongs to
nurses alexandria i have purchased it 
him day after tomorrow we shall begin to
remove my stores
so soon tis well arbaces shall be obeyed 
and his ward lone 
accompanies me enough is morning
fair 
dim and oppressive it will probably be intensely
hot in forenoon
 poor gladiators and more wretched
criminals descend and see that slaves are
marshalled
left alone arbaces stepped into his chamber 
study and thence upon portico without he
saw dense masses men pouring fast into 
amphitheatre and heard cry assistants
and cracking cordage as they were
straining aloft huge awning under which
 citizens molested by no discomforting ray
were to behold at luxurious ease agonies 
 
their fellowcreatures suddenly a wild strange
sound went forth and as suddenly died away it
was roar lion there was a silence in
 distant crowd but silence was followed
by joyous laughter they were making merry at
 hungry impatience royal beast
 brutes muttered disdainful arbaces
 are ye less homicides than i am slay but in
selfdefence ye make murder pastime
he turned with a restless and curious eye towards
vesuvius beautifully glowed green
vineyards round its breast and tranquil as eternity
lay in breathless skies form 
mighty hill
we have time yet if earthquake be nursiii
thought arbaces and he turned from 
spot he passed by table which bore his
mystic scrolls and chaldean calculations
august art he thought have not consulted
thy decrees since i past danger and
 crisis they foretold what matter i know
that henceforth all in my path is bright and
pompeii 
smooth have not events already proved it
away doubt away pity mirror o my
heart mirror for future but two images
empire and lone

lydia assured by account sosia on his
return home and satisfied that her letter was in
 hands sallust gave herself up once more to
hope sallust would surely lose no time in seeking
 praetor in coming to house 
egyptian in releasing her in breaking prison
 calends that very night glaucus would be
free alas night passed dawn broke
she heard nothing but hurried footsteps 
slaves along hall and peristyle and their voices
in preparation for show by and by commanding
voice arbaces broke on her ear a
flourish music rung out cheerily long procession
were sweeping to amphitheatre to glut
their eyes on deathpangs athenian 
pompeii 
 procession arbaces moved along slowly
and with much solemnity till now arriving at 
place where it was necessary for such as came in
litters or chariots to alight arbaces descended
from his vehicle and proceeded to entrance
by which more distinguished spectators were
admitted his slaves mingling with humbler
crowd were stationed by officers who received
their tickets not much unlike our modern opera
ones in places in jwpularia seats apportioned
to vulgar and now from spot
vvhere arbaces sat his eye scanned mighty
and impatient crowd that filled stupendous
theatre
on upper tier but apart from male spectators
sat women their gay dresses resembling
some gaudy flowerbed it is needless to
add that they were most talkative part 
assembly and many were looks directed up to
them especially from benches appropriated to
 young and unmarried men on lower
seats round arena sat more highborn and
 
wealthy visitors magistrates and those 
senatorial or equestrian dignity passages
which by corridors at right and left gave
access to these seats at either oval
arena were also entrances for combatants
strong palings at these passages prevented any
unwelcome eccentricity in movements 
beasts and confined them to their appointed prey
around parapet which was raised above 
arena and from which seats gradually rose
were gladiatorial inscriptions and paintings
wrought in fresco typical entertainments
for which place was designed throughout 
whole building wound invisible pipes from which
as day's advanced cooling and fragrant showers
were to be sprinkled over spectators 
officers amphitheatre were still employed
in task fixing vast awning or malaria
which covered whole and which luxurious invention
 companions arrogated to themselves 
 equites sat immediately behind senators
pompeii 
it was woven whitest appian wool and
variegated with broad stripes crimson owing
either to some inexperience on part 
workmen or to some defect in machinery
 awning however was not arranged that day
so happily as usual indeed from immense
space circumference task was always
one great difficulty and art so much so that
it could seldom be adventured in rough or windy
weather but present day was so remarkably
still that there seemed to spectators no excuse
for awkwardness artificers and when
a large gap in back awning was still
visible from obstinate refusal one part 
 malaria to ally itself with rest murmurs
 discontent were loud and general
thestile pansa at whose expense exhibition
was given looked particularly annoyed at
 defect and vowed bitter vengeance on 
head chief officer show who fretting
puffing perspiring busied himself in idle orders
and unavailing threats

 hubbub ceased suddenly operators
desisted crowd were stilled gap was
forgotten for now with a loud and warlike
flourish trumpets gladiators marshalled in
ceremonious procession entered arena they
swept round oval space very slowly and deliberately
in order to give spectators full leisure
to admire their stern serenity feature their
brawny limbs and various arms as well as to
form such wagers as excitement moment
might suggest
h cried widow fulvia to wife 
pansa as they leant down from their lofty bench
do you see that gigantic gladiator how drolly he
is dressed 
 yes said senile's wife with complacent
importance for she knew all names and qualities
 each combatant he is a retiarius or
better he is armed only you see with a threepronged
spear like a trident and a net he wears
no armour only fillet and tunic he is a
mighty man and is to fight with sporus yon thickpompeii

set gladiator with round shield and drawn
sword but without bodyarmour he has not his
helmet on now in order that you may see his face 
how fearless it is by and by he will fight with
his visor down
but surely a net and a spear are poor arms
against shield and sword 
that shews how innocent you are my dear
fulvia retiarius generally has best it
but who is yon handsome gladiator nearly
naked is it not quite improper by venus but
his limbs are beautifully shaped 
it is lydon a young untried man he has 
rashness to fight yon other gladiator similarly
dressed or rather undressed tetraides they
fight first in greek fashion with cestus 
afterwards they put on armour and try sword and
shield
he is a proper man this lydon and 
women i am sure are on his side
so are not experienced betters clodius
offers three to one against him
 
 oh jove how beautiful exclaimed 
widow as two gladiators armed capapie rode
round arena on light and prancing steeds
resembling much combatants in tilts 
 middle ages they bore lances and round
shields beautifully inlaid their armour was
woven intricately with bands iron but it covered
only thighs and right arms short cloaks
extending to seat gave a picturesque and
graceful air to their costume their legs were
naked with exception sandals which were
fastened a little above ankle oh beautiful
 who are these asked widow
 one is named berbix he has conquered
twelve times other assumes arrogant
name nobilior they are both gauls
while thus conversing first formalities 
 show were over to these succeeded a feigned
combat with wooden swords between various
gladiators matched against each other among
these skill two roman gladiators hired
for occasion was most admired and next
pompeii 
to them most graceful combatant was lydoii
this sham contest did not above an hour nor
did it attract any very lively interest except among
those connoisseurs arena to whom art was
preferable to more coarse excitement body
 spectators were rejoiced when it was over 
and when sympathy rose to terror combatants
were now arranged in pairs as agreed beforehand
 their weapons examined and grave
sports day commenced amidst deepest
silence broken only by an exciting and preliminary
blast warlike music
it was often customary to commence sports
by most cruel all and some nestorius or
gladiator appointed to beasts was slain first
as an initiatory sacrifice but in present
instance experienced pansa thought it better
that sanguinary drama should progress not
decrease in interest and accordingly 
execution olinthus and glaucus was reserved
for it was arranged that two horsemen
should first occupy arena that foot
 
gladiators paired off should then he loosed indiscriminately
on stage that glaucus and 
lion should next perform their part in bloody
spectacle and tiger and nazarene be 
grand finale and in spectacles pompeii
 reader roman history must limit his imagination
nor expect to find those vast and wholesale
exhibitions magnificent slaughter with
which a nero or a caligula regaled inhabitants
 imperial city roman shows which
absorbed more celebrated gladiators and 
chief proportion foreign beasts were indeed
 very reason why in lesser towns 
empire sports amphitheatre were comparatively
humane and rare and in this as in
other respects pompeii was but miniature
 microcosm rome still it was an awful
and imposing spectacle with which modern times
have happily nothing to compare a vast theatre
rising row upon row nearly five hundred
feet in height and swarming with human beings
from fifteen to eighteen thousand in number 
pompeii 
intent upon no fictitious representation no tragedy
 stage but actual victory or
defeat exultant life or bloody death 
each and all who entered arena 
 two horsemen were now at either extremity
 lists if so they might be called and at a
given signal from pansa combatants started
simultaneously as in full collision each advancing
his round buckler each poising on high his light
yet sturdy javelin but just when within three
paces his opponent steed berbix suddenly
halted wheeled round and as nobilior was
borne rapidly by his antagonist stirred upon
him buckler nobilior quickly and skilfully
extended received a blow which otherwise
would have been fatal
well done nobilior cried preetor giving
 first vent to popular excitement
bravely struck my berbix answered ciodies
from his seat
and wild murmur swelled by many a shout
echoed from side to side
 
 visors both horsemen were completely
closed like those knights in aftertimes
but head was nevertheless great
point assault and nobilior now wheeling
his charger with no less adroitness than his opponent
directed his spear full on helmet his
foe berbix raised his buckler to shield himself
and his quickeyed antagonist suddenly lowering
his weapon pierced him through breast
berbix reeled and fell
nobilior nobilior shouted populace
i have lost ten sententia said clodius between
his teeth
habet he has it said pansa deliberately
 populace not yet hardened into cruelty
made signal mercy but as attendants
 arena approached they found kindness
came too late heart gaul had been
pierced and his eyes were set in death it was
his life's blood that flowed so darkly over sand
and sawdust arena
a little more than 
pompeii 
it is a pity it was so soon over there was
little enough for one's trouble said widow
fulvia
yes i have no compassion for berbix anyone
might have seen that nobilior did but feint
mark they fix fatal hook to body they
drag him away to spoliarium they scatter
new sand over stage pansa regrets nothing
more than that he is not rich enough to strew 
arena with borax and cinnabar as nero used
well if it has been a brief battle it is quickly
succeeded see my handsome lydon on arena
ay and netbearer too and swordsmen
oh charming
there were now on arena six combatants
niger and his net matched against sporus
with his shield and his short broadsword lydon
and tetraides naked save by a cincture round
 waist each armed only with a heavy greek
cestus and two gladiators from rome clad incomplete
steel and evenly matched with immense
bucklers and pointed swords
initiatory contest between lydon and
tetraides being less deadly than that between
 other combatants no sooner had they advanced
to middle arena than as by
common consent rest held back to see how
that contest should be decided and wait till
fiercer weapons might replace cestus ere they
themselves commenced hostility they stood
leaning on their arms and apart from each other
gazing on show which if not bloody enough
thoroughly to please populace they were still
inclined to admire because its origin was their
ancestral greece
no persons could at first glance have seemed
less evenly matched than two antagonists
tetraides though not taller than lydon weighed
considerably more natural size his muscles
was increased to eyes vulgar by masses
 solid flesh for as it was a notion that 
contest cestus fared easiest with him who
was plumpest tetraides had encouraged to 
utmost his hereditary predisposition to portly
pompeii 
his shoulders were vast and his limbs thickset
doublejointed and slightly curved outward in
that formation which takes so much from beauty
to give so largely to strength but lydon except
that he was slender even almost to meagreness
was beautifully and delicately proportioned and
 skilful might have perceived that with much
less compass muscle than his foe that which
he had was more seasoned iron and compact
in proportion too as he wanted flesh he was
likely to possess activity and a haughty smile
on his resolute face which strongly contrasted 
stolid heaviness his enemy's gave assurance
to those who beheld it and united their hope to
their pity so that despite disparity their
seeming strength cry multitude was
nearly as loud for lydon as for tetraides
whoever is acquainted with modern prizering
 whoever has witnessed heavy and disabling
strokes which human fist skilfully
directed hath power to bestow may easily
understand how much that happy facility would
 
be increased by a band carried by thongs leather
round arm as high as elbow and terribly
strengthened about knuckles by a plate 
iron and sometimes a plummet lead yet this
which was meant to increase perhaps rather
diminished interest fray for it necessarily
shortened its duration a very few blows
successfully and scientifically planted might suffice
to bring contest to a close and battle
did not therefore often allow full scope for that
energy fortitude and dogged perseverance which
we technically style iiluck which not unusually
wins day against superior science and which
heightens to so painful a delight interest in
 battle and sympathy for brave
 guard thyself growled tetraides movingnearer
and nearer to his foe who rather shifted
round him than receded
lydon did not answer save by a scornful glance
 his quick vigilant eye tetraides struck it
was as blow a smith on a vice lydon
sank suddenly on one knee blow passed over
pompeii 
his head not so harmless was lydon's retaliation
he quickly sprung to his feet and aimed
his cestus full on broad breast his antagonist
tetraides reeled populace shouted
you are unlucky today said lepidus to
clodius you have lost one bet you will lose
another
by gods my bronzes go to auctioneer
if that is case have no less than a hundred
sententia upon tetraides ha ha see see how
he rallies that was a home stroke he has
cut open lydon's shoulder a tetraides a
tetraides 
but lydon is not disheartened by pollux
how well he keeps his temper see how dexterously
he avoids those hammerlike hands 
dodging now here now there circling round
and round ah poor lydon he has it again
three to one still on tetraides what say
you lepidus 
well nine sententia to three be it so
above 
 
what again lydoriv he stops he gasps for
breath by gods he is down no is he
again on his legs brave lydon tetraides is
encouraged he laughs loud he rushes on him
fool success blinds him he should be
cautious lydon's eye is like a lynx's said
clodius between his teeth
ha clodius saw you that your man totters
 another blow he falls he falls
earth revives him then he is once more
up but blood rolls down his face
 by thunderer lydon wins it see how
he presses on him that blow on temple
would have crushed an ox it has crushed tetrades
he falls again he cannot move habet 
habet l
habet r repeated pansa take them out
and give them armour and swords
noble editor said officers we fear
that tetraides will not recover in time howbeit
we will try
do so
pompeii 
in a few moments officers who had dragged
off stunned and insensible gladiator returned
with rueful countenances they feared for his
life he was utterly incapacitated from reentering
 arena
in that case said pansa hold lydon a subcities
 and first gladiator that is vanquished
let lydon supply his place with victor
 people shouted their applause at this sentence
 then they again sunk into deep silence
 trumpets sounded loudly four combatants
stood each against each in prepared and
stern array
dost thou recognise romans my claudius
 are they among celebrated or are
they merely ordinarii 
eumolpus is a good secondrate swordsman
my lepidus nepimus lesser man i have
never seen before but he is son one 
imperial fiscales and brought up in a proper
school doubtless they will shew sport but i
 gladiators maintained by emperor
 
have no heart for game i cannot win back
my money i am undone curses on that lydon
who could have supposed he was so dexterous or
so lucky 
well clodius shall i take compassion on
you and accept your own terms with these romans

an even ten sententia on eumolpus then 
what when nepimus is untried nay
nay that is too bad
well ten to eight
agreed
while contest in amphitheatre had thus
commenced there was one in loftier benches
for whom it had assumed indeed a poignant a
stifling interest aged father lydon despite
his christian horror spectacle in his
agonised anxiety for his son had not been able to
resist being spectator his fate one amidst
a fierce crowd strangers lowest rabble 
 populace old man saw felt nothing but
 form presence his brave son not a
pompeii 
sound had escaped his hps when twice he had
seen him fall to earth only he had turned
paler and his limbs trembled but he had uttered
one low cry when he saw him victorious 
unconscious alas more fearful battle to
which that victory was but a prelude
my gallant boy said he and wiped his eyes
is he thy son said a brawny fellow to 
right nazarene he has fought well 
let us see how he does by and by hark he is
to fight first victor now old boy pray 
gods that that victor be neither romans 
nor next to them giant niger
 old man sat down again and covered his
face fray for moment was indifferent to
him lydon was not one combatants yet
yet thought flashed across him fray
was indeed deadly interest first who fell
was to make way for lydon he started up
and bent down with straining eyes and clasped
hands to view encounter
 first interest was attracted towards 
 
combat niger with sporus for this species 
contest from fatal result which usually attended
it and from great science it required
in either antagonist was always peculiarly inviting
to spectators
they stood at a considerable distance from each
other singular helmet which sporus adore
 visor which was down concealed his face 
but features niger attracted a fearful and
universal interest from their compressed and vigilant
ferocity thus they stood for some moments
each eyeing each until sporus began slowly and
with great caution to advance holding his sword
pointed like a modern fencer's at breast his
foe niger retreated as his antagonist advanced
gathering up his net with his right hand and
never taking his small glittering eye from 
movements swordsman suddenly when
sporus had approached nearly at arm's length 
retiarius threw himself forward and cast his net
a quick inflection body saved gladiator
from deadly snare he uttered a sharp cry 
pompeii 
joy and rage and rushed upon niger but niger
had already drawn in his net thrown it across
his shoulders and now fled round lists with a
swiftness which sector in vain endeavoured
to equal people laughed and shouted aloud
to see ineffectual efforts broadshouldered
gladiator to overtake flying giant when at
that moment their attention was turned from
these to two roman combatants
they had placed themselves at onset face to
face at distance modern fencers from each
other but extreme caution which both evinced
at first had prevented any warmth engagement
and allowed spectators full leisure to interest
themselves in battle between sporus and his
foe but romans were now heated into full
and fierce encounter they pushed returned 
advanced on retreated from each other withall
that careful yet scarcely perceptible caution
so called from office that tribe gladiators in following
 foe moment net was cast in order to smite
him ere he could have time to rearrange it
 
which characterises men well experienced and
equally matched but at this moment eumolpus
 elder gladiator by that dexterous backstroke
which was considered in arena so difficult to
avoid had wounded nepimus in side 
people shouted lepidus turned pale
ho saidclodius game is nearly over
if eumolpus fights now quiet fight other
will gradually bleed himself away
but thank gods he does not fight 
backward fight see he presses hard upon
nepimus by mars but nepimus had him
there helmet rang again clodius i shall

why do i ever bet but at dice groaned
clodius to himself or why cannot one cog a
gladiator 
a sporus a sporus shouted populace
as niger having now suddenly paused had again
cast his net and again unsuccessfully he had
not retreated this time with sufficient agility 
sword sporus had inflicted a severe wound
pompeii 
upon his right leg and incapacitated to fl
he was pressed hard by fierce swordsman
his great height and length arm still continued
however to give him no despicable advantages
 and steadily keeping his trident at 
front his foe he repelled him successfully for
several minutes sporus now tried by great
rapidity evolution to get round his antagonist
who necessarily moved with pain and slowness
in so doing he lost his caution he advanced too
near to giant raised his arm to strike and
received three points fatal spear full in
his breast he sank on his knee in a moment
more deadly net was cast over him he
struggled against its meshes in vain again 
again again he writhed mutely beneath 
fresh strokes trident his blood flowed
fast through net and redly over sand 
he lowered his arms in acknowledgment defeat

 conquering retiarius withdrew his net and
leaning on his spear looked to audience for
 
their judgment slowly too at same moment
 vanquished gladiator rolled his dim
and despairing eyes around theatre from
row to row from bench to bench there glared
upon him but merciless and unpitying eyes 
hushed was roar murmur silence
was dread for in it was no sympathy not a
hand no not e'en a woman's hand gave 
signal charity and life sporus had never been
popular in arena and lately interest 
 combat had been excited on behalf 
wounded niger people were warmed into
blood mimic fight had ceased to charm
 interest had mounted up to desire 
sacrifice and thirst death 
 gladiator felt that his doom was sealed he
uttered no prayer no groan people gave
 signal death in dogged but agonised
submission he bent his neck to receive fatal
stroke and now as spear retiarius
was not a weapon to inflict instant and certain
death there stalked into arena a grim and
pompeii 
fatal foi brandishing a short sharp sword and
with features utterly concealed beneath its visor
with slow and measured steps this dismal headsman
approached gladiator still kneeling 
laid his left hand on his humbled crest drew
 edge blade across his neck turned
round to assembly lest in moment
remorse should come upon them dread
signal continued same blade glittered
brightly in air fell and gladiator
rolled upon sand his limbs quivered were
still he was a corpse 
his body was dragged at once from arena
through gate death and thrown into 
gloomy den termed technically spoliation
and ere it had well reached that destination 
strife between remaining combatants was decided
 sword eumolpus had inflicted
 deathwound upon less experienced com
see engraving from friezes at pompeii in work
on that city published in library entertaining knowledge
 
blatant a new victim was added to receptacle
 slain
throughout that mighty assembly there now
ran a universal movement people breathed
more freely and resettled themselves in their
seats a grateful shower was cast over every
row from concealed conduits tn cool and
luxurious pleasure they talked over late spectacle
 blood eumolpus removed his helmet
and wiped his brows his closecurled hair and
short beard his noble roman features and bright
dark eye attracted general admiration he
was fresh unwounded unfatigued
 editor paused and proclaimed aloud that
as niger's wound disabled him from again entering
 arena lydon was to be successor to
 slaughtered nepimus and new combatant
 eumolpus
yet lydon added he if thou wouldst decline
 combat with one so brave and tried
thou may est have full liberty to do so eumolpus
is not antagonist that was originally decreed
pompeii 
for thee thou knowest best how far thou canst
cope with hin if thou fairest thy doom is
honourable death if thou conquered out my
own purse i will double stipulated prize
 people shouted applause lydon stood
in lists he gazed around high above he
beheld pale face straining eyes his
father he turned away irresolute for a moment
no conquest cestus was not sufficient
he had not yet won price victory his
father was still a slave 
noble senile he replied in a firm and
deep tone i shrink not from this combat
for honour pompeii i demand that one
trained by its longcelebrated lanista shall do
battle with this roman
 people shouted louder than before
four to one against lydon said clodius
to lepidus
i would not take twenty to one why 
is a very achilles and this poor fellow is but a tiro 
eumolpus gazed hard on face lydon 
he smiled yet smile was followed by a slight
and scarce audible sigh a touch compassionate
emotion which custom conquered moment
 heart acknowledged it
and now both clad in complete armour 
sword drawn visor closed two combatants
 arena ere man at least was
matched with beast stood opposed to each other
it was just at this time that a letter was delivered
to praetor by one attendants 
 arena he removed cincture glanced
over it for a moment his countenance betrayed
surprise and embarrassment he reread 
letter and then muttering tush it is impossible
 man must be drtmk even in 
morning to dream such follies threw it
carelessly aside and gravely settled himself once
more in attitude attention to sports
 interest public was wound up very
high eumolpus had at first won their favour
but gallantly lydon and his welltimed
pompeii 
allusion to honour pompeii lanista
had afterwards given latter preference in
their eyes
holla old fellow said medon's neighbour
to him your son is hardly matched but
never fear editor will not permit him to be
slain no nor people neither he has behaved
too bravely for that ha that was a home
thrust well averted by pollux at him again
lydon they stop to breathe what art thou
muttering old boy
prayers answered medon with a more calm
and hopeful mien than he had yet maintained
prayers trifles time for gods to carry
a man away in a cloud is gone now ha jupiter 
what a blow thy side thy side take
care thy side lydon 
there was a convulsive tremor throughout 
assembly a fierce blow from eumolpus full on
 crest had brought lydon to his knee
habet he has it cried a shrill female
voice he has it huzza 
 
it was voice girl who had so anxiously
anticipated sacrifice some criminal to 
beasts
be silent child said wife pansa
haughtily non habet he is not wounded
i wish he were if only to spite old surly
medon muttered girl
meanwhile lydon who had hitherto defended
himself with great skill and valour began to give
way before vigorous assaults practised
roman his arm grew tired his eye dizzy he
breathed hard and painfully combatants
paused again for breath
young man said eumolpus in a low aoice
desist i will wound thee slightly then lower
thy arms thou hast propitiated editor and
thermo thou wilt be honourably saved 
and my father still enslaved groaned lydon
to himself no death or his freedom
at that thought and seeing that his strength
not being equal to endurance roman
every thing depended on a sudden and
pompeii 
desperate effort he threw himself fiercely on
eumolpus roman warily retreated lydon
thrust again eumolpus drew himself aside 
 sword grazed his cuirass lydon's breast
was exposed roman plunged his sword
through joints armour not meaning
however to inflict a deep wound lydon
weak and exhausted fell forward fell right
on point it passed through and through
even to back eumolpus drew forth his
blade lydon still made an effort to regain his
balance his sword left his grasp he struck
mechanically at gladiator with his naked
hand and fell prostrate on arena with
one accord editor and assembly made signal
 mercy officers arena approached 
they took off helmet vanquished he
still breathed his eyes rolled fiercely on his foe 
 savageness he had acquired in his callingglared
from his gaze and lowered upon brow
darkened already with shades death then
with a convulsive groan with a half start he
 
lifted his eyes above they rested not on 
face editor nor on pitying brows 
his relenting judges he saw them not they
were as if vast space was desolate and bare 
one pale agonising face alone was all he recognised
 one ciy a broken heart was all that
amidst murmurs and shouts populace
reached his ear ferocity vanished from
his brow a soft a tender expression sanctifying
but despairing filial love played over his features 
played waned darkened his face suddenly
became locked and rigid resuming its former
fierceness he fell upon eai'th
look to him said iedile he has done
his duty 
 officers dragged him off to spoliation
a true type glory and its fate murmured
arbaces to himself and his eye glancing
round amphitheatre betrayed so much disdain
and scorn that whoever encountered it felt his
breath suddenly arrested and his emotions frozen
into one sensation abasement and awe
pompeii 
again rich perfumes were wafted around 
theatre attendants sprinkled fresh sand over
 arena
bring forth lion and glaucus athenian
said editor
and a deep and breathless hush overwrought
interest and intense yet strange to say not
unpleasing terror lay like a mighty and awful
dream over assembly
 
chapter iii
sallust and lydia's letter
thrice had sallust wakened from his morning
sleep and thrice recollecting that his friend was
that day to perish had he turned himself with a
deep sigh once more to court oblivion his sole
object in life was to avoid pain and where he
could not avoid at least to forget it
at length unable any longer to steep his consciousness
in slumber he raised himself from his
incumbent posture and discovered his favourite
freedman sitting by his bedside as usual for
sallust who as i have said had a gentlemanlike
taste for polite letters was accustomed to be
read to for an hour or so previous to his rising in
 morning

chapter iv
 amphitheatre once more
glaucus and olynthus had been placed together
in that gloomy and narrow cell in which 
criminals arena awaited their and
fearful struggle their eyes late accustomed
to darkness scanned faces each other
in this awful hour and by that dim light 
paleness which chased away natural hues
from either cheek assumed a yet more ashen and
ghastly whiteness yet their brows were erect
and dauntless their limbs did not tremble their
lips were compressed and rigid religion 
 one pride other conscious
innocence both and it may be support
derived from their mutual companionship elevated
 victim into hei'o 
 
hark hearest thou that shout they are
growling over their human hood said olinthus
i hear my heart grows sick but gods
support me
 gods o rash young man in this hour
recognise only one god have i not taught
thee in dungeon wept for thee prayed for
thee in my zeal and in my agony have i not
thought more thy salvation than my own 
brave friend answered glaucus solemnly
i have listened to thee with awe with wonder
and with a secret tendency towards conviction
had our lives been spared i might gradually
have weaned myself from tenets my owt
faith and inclined to thine but in this hour
it were a craven thing and a base to yield to
hasty terror what should be only result 
lengthened meditation were i to embrace thy
creed and cast down my father's gods should i
not be bribed by thy promise heaven or awed
by thy threats hell olinthus no think we
 each other with equal charity i honouring

thy sincerity thou pitying my blindness or my
obdurate courage as have been my deeds such
will be my reward and power or powers
above will not judge harshly human error
mien it is linked with honesty purpose and
truth heart speak we no more this hush
dost thou hear them drag yon heavy body
through passage such as that clay will be
ours soon
o heaven o christ already i behold ye
cried fervent olinthus lifting up his hands 
i tremble not i rejoice that prisonhouse
shall be soon broken
glaucus bowed his head in silence he felt
 distinction between his fortitude and that 
his fellow sufferer heathen did not tremble 
but christian exulted
 door swung gratingly back gleam 
spears shot along walls
glaucus athenian thy time has come
said a loud and clear voice lion awaits
thee
 
i am ready said athenian brother
and comate one embrace bless me and
farewell 
 christian opened his arms he clasped 
young heathen to his breast he kissed his forehead
and cheek he sobbed aloud his tears
flowed fast and hot over features his
friend
o could i have converted thee i had not
wept o that i might say to thee we two
shall sup this night in paradise 
it may be so yet answered greek with
a tremulous voice they whom death parted
not may meet yet beyond grave on 
earth on beautiful beloved earth 
farewell for ever worthy officer i am ready
glaucus tore himself away and when he came
forth into air its breath which though sunless
was hot and arid smote witheringly upon
him his frame not yet restored from effects
 deadly draught shrunk and trembled
 officers supported him
pompeii 
courage said one thou art young active
wellknit they give thee a weapon despair
not and thou mayest yet conquer
glaucus did not reply but ashamed his
infirmity he made a desperate and convulsive
effort and regained firmness his nerves
they anointed his body completely naked save
by a cincture round loins placed stiles
vain weapon in his hand and led him into 
arena
and now when greek saw eyes 
thousands and tens thousands upon him he no
longer felt that he was mortal all evidence 
fear all fear itself was gone a red and
haughty flush spread over paleness his
features he towered aloft to full his glorious
stature in elastic beauty his limbs
and form in his intent but frowning brow 
in high disdain and in indomitable soul
which breathed visibly which spake audibly 
from his attitude his lip his eye he seemed
 very incarnation vivid and corporeal 
 
valour his land divinity its worship
at once a hero and a god 
 murmur hatred and horror at his crime
which had greeted his entrance died into 
silence involuntary admiration and halfcompassionate
respect and with a quick and convulsive
sigh that seemed to move whole mass
 life as if it were one body gaze spectators
turned from athenian to a dark uncouth
object in centre arena it was 
grated den lion 
by venus how warm it is said fulvia 
yet there is no sun would those stupid
sailors could have fastened up that gap in 
awning
oh it is warm indeed i turn sick i
faint said wife pansa even her experienced
stoicism giving way at struggle about
to take place
 lion had been kept without food for twentysailors
were generally employed in fastening malaria 
 amphitheatre
pompeii 
four hours and animal had during whole
morning testified a singular and restless uneasiness
which keeper had attributed to pangs
 hunger yet its bearing seemed rather that 
fear than rage its roar was painful and distressed
 it hung its head snuffed air through
 bars then lay down started again and
again uttered its wild and farresounding cries
and now in its den it lay utterly dumb and
mute with distending nostrils forced hard against
 grating and disturbing with a heaving breath
 sand below on arena
 editor's lip quivered and his cheek grew
pale he looked anxiously around hesitated 
delayed crowd became impatient slowly
he gave sign keeper who was behind
 den cautiously removed grating and 
lion leaped forth with a mighty and glad roar 
release keeper hastily retreated through
 grated passage leading from arena and
left lord forest and his prey
glaucus had bent his limbs so as to give himself
 
 firmest posture at expected rush lion
with his small and shining weapon raised on high
in faint hope that one welldirected thrust
for he knew that he should have time but for
one might penetrate through eye to 
brain his grim foe
but to unutterable astonishment all 
beast seemed not even aware presence 
 criminal at first moment its release
it halted abruptly in arena raised itself half
on snuffing upward air with impatient
sighs then suddenly it sprung forward but not
on athenian at halfspeed it circled round
and round space turning its vast head from
side to side with an anxious and perturbed gaze
as if seeking only some avenue escape once
or twice it endeavoured to leap up parapet
that divided it from audience and on failing
uttered rather a baffled howl than its deeptoned
and kingly roar it evinced no sign either 
wrath or hunger its tail drooped along sand
instead lashing its gaunt sides and its eye
pompeii 
though it wandered at times to glaucus rolled
again listlessly from him at length as if tired
 attempting to escape it crept with a moan
into its case and once more laid itself down
to rest
 first surprise assembly at apathy
 lion soon grew converted into resentment
at its cowardice and populace already merged
their pity for fate glaucus into angry compassion
for their own disappointment
 editor called to keeper 
how is this take goad prick him
forth and then close door den
as keeper with some fear but more astonishment
was preparing to obey a loud cry was
heard at one entrances arena there
was a confusion a bustle voices remonstrance
suddenly breaking forth and suddenly silenced at
 reply all eyes turned in wonder at 
interruption towards quarter disturbance
 crowd gave way and suddenly sallust
appeared on senatorial benches his hair dishes
 
veiled breathless heated halfexhausted he
cast his eyes hastily round ring remove
 athenian he cried haste he is innocent 
arrest arbaces egyptian he is murderer
 apsecides 
art thou mad o sallust said praetor
rising from his seat what means this raving 
remove athenian quick or his blood
be on your head preetor delay and you answer
with your own life to emperor i bring with
me eyewitness to death priest
apsecides room there stand back give
way people pompeii fix every eye upon
arbaces there he sits room there for 
priest calenus 
pale haggard fresh from jaws famine
and death his face fallen his ees dull as a
vulture's his broad frame gaunt as a skeleton 
calenus was supported into very row in which
arbaces sat his releases had given him sparingly
 food but chief sustenance that
nerved his feeble limbs was revenge 
pompeii 
 priest calenus galena cried 
mob is it he no it is a dead man 
it is priest calenus said praetor
gravely what hast thou to say
arbaces egypt is murderer apsecides
 priest isis these eyes saw him deal 
blow it is from dungeon in which he plunged
me it is from darkness and horror a death
by famine that gods have raised me to proclaim
his crime release athenian he is
innocent 
it is for this then that lion spared him 
a miracle a miracle cried pansa
a miracle a miracle shouted people
remove athenian arbaces to lion 
and that shout echoed from hill to vale from
coast to sea graces to lion
officers remove accused glaucus remove
but guard him yet said praetor 
gods lavish their wonders upon this day
as praetor gave word release there
was a cry joy a female voice a child's voice
 
and it was joy it rang through heart 
 assembly with electric force it was touching 
it was holy that child's voice and populace
echoed it back with a sympathising granulation 
silence said grave praetor who is
there
 blind girl lydia answered sallust
it is her hand that has raised calenus from 
grave and delivered glaucus from lion
 this hereafter said praetor calenus
priest i sis thou accuses arbaces murder
 apsecides
i do
thou didst behold deed
praetor with these eyes 
enough at present details must be reserved
for more suiting time and place arbaces
 egypt thou hearest charge against thee 
thou hast not yet spoken what hast thou to
say
 gaze crowd had been long riveted
on arbaces but not until confusion which
pompeii 
he had betrayed at first charge sallust and
 entrance calenus had subsided at 
shout arbaces to hon he had indeed
trembled and dark bronze his cheek had
taken a paler hue but he had soon recovered
his haughtiness and selfcontrol proudly he
returned angry glare countless eyes
around him and replying now to question
 praetor he said in that accent so peculiarly
tranquil and commanding which characterised
his tones
praetor this charge is so mad that it scarcely
deserves reply my first accuser is noble
sallust most intimate friend glaucus
my second is a priest i revere his garb and
calling but people pompeii ye know somewhat
 character calenus he is griping
and goldthirsty to a proverb witness such
men is to be bought praetor i am innocent
sallust said magistrate where found
you calenus
in dungeons arbaces
vol iii m
 
egyptian said praetor frowning thou
didst then dare to imprison a priest gods 
and wherefore
hear me answered arbaces rising calmly
but with agitation visible in his face this man
came to threaten that he would make against me
 charge he has now made unless i would purchase
his silence with half my fortune i remonstrated
 in vain peace there let not priest
interrupt me noble praetor and ye o people 
i was a stranger in land i knew myself
innocent crime but witness a priest
against me might yet destroy me in my perplexity
i decoyed him to cell whence he has
been released on pretence that it was coffeehouse
 my gold i resolved to detain him there
until fate true criminal was sealed and
his threats could avail no longer but i meant
no worse i may have erred but who amongst
ye will not acknowledge equity selfpreservation
 were i guilty why was witness
 this priest silent at trial then i had not
pompeii 
detained nor concealed him wliy did he not
proclaim my guilt when i proclaimed that 
glaucus praetor this needs an answer for
 rest i throw myself on your laws i demand
their protection remove hence accused and
 accuser i will willingly meet and cheerfully
abide by decision legitimate tribunal
this is no place for farther parley
he says right said praetor ho 
guards remove arbaces guard calenus sallust
we hold you responsible for your accusation
let sports be resumed
what cried calenus turning round to 
people shall isis be thus contemned shall
 blood apsecides yet cry for vengeance 
shall justice be delayed now that it may be
frustrated hereafter shall lion be cheated
 his lawful prey a god a god i feel 
god rush to my lips to lion to lion
with arbaces
his exhausted frame could support no longer
 ferocious malice priest he sank on 
 
srounj in strong convulsions foam gathered
to his mouth he was as a man indeed whom a
supernatural power had entered people saw
and shuddered
it is a god that inspires holy man to
 lion with egyptian 
with that cry up sprang on moved thousands
upon thousands they rushed from 
heights they poured down in direction 
egyptian in vain did senile command in
vain did praetor lift his voice and proclaim
 law people had been already rendered
savage by exhibition blood they thirsted
for more their superstition was aided by their
ferocity aroused inflamed by spectacle
 their victims they forgot authority 
their rulers it was one those dread popular
convulsions common to crowds wholly ignorant
half free and half servile and which peculiar
constitution roman provinces so frequently
exhibited power praetor was as a
reed beneath whirlwind still at his word
pompeii 
 oiiards had drawn themselves alone lower
benches on which upper classes sat separate
from vulgar they made but a feeble barrier
 waves human sea halted for a moment
to enable arbaces to count exact moment
 his doom in despair and in a terror which
beat down even pride he glanced his eyes over 
rolling and rushing crowd when right above
them through wide chasm which had been
left in malaria he beheld a strange and awful
apparition he beheld and his craft restored
his courage 
he stretched his hand on high over his lofty
brow and royal features there came an expression
 unutterable solemnity and command
behold he shouted with a voice thunder
which stilled roar crowd behold
how gods protect guiltless fires 
 avenging orcus burst forth against false
witness my accusers 
 eyes crowd followed gesture 
 egyptian and beheld with ineffable dismay
 
a vast vapour shooting from summit vesuvius
in form a gigantic pinetree 
trunk blackness branches fire a fire
that shifted and wavered in its hues with every
moment now fiercely luminous now a dull
and dying red that again blazed terrifically forthwith
intolerable glare 
there was a dead heart sunken silence 
through which there suddenly broke roar 
 lion which from within building was
echoed back by sharper and fiercer yells 
its fellowbeast dread seers were they 
burden atmosphere and wild prophets 
rhe wrath to come
then there rose on high universal shrieks
 women men stared at each other but
were dumb at that moment they felt earth
shake beneath their feet walls theatre
trembled and beyond in distance they heard
 crash falling roofs an instant more and
 mountaincloud seemed to roll towards them
 pliny
pompeii 
turk and rapid like a torrent at same time
it east forth from its bosom a shower ashes
mixed with vast fragments binding stone over
 crushing vines over desolate streets 
over amphitheatre itself far and wide 
with many a mighty splash in agitated sea
fell that awful shower
no longer thought crowd justice or 
arbaces safety for themselves was their sole
thought each turned to fly each dashing pressing
crushing against other trampling recklessly
over fallen amidst groans and oaths
and prayers and sudden shrieks enormous
crowd vomited itself forth through numerous
passages whither should they fly some anticipating
a second earthquake hastened to their
homes to load themselves with their more costly
goods and escape while it was yet time others
dreading showers ashes that now fell fast
torrent upon torrent over streets rushed
under roofs nearest houses or temples
or sheds shelter any kind for pross

darker and larger and mightier spread

ghastly night rushing upon realm noon

chapter v
 cell prisoner and den 
dead grief unconscious horror
stunned by his reprieve doubting that he was
awake glaucus had been led by officers 
 arena into a small cell within walls 
theatre they threw a loose robe over his foi'ni
and crowded round in congratulation and wonder
there was an impatient and fretful cry without
 cell throng gave way and blind
girl led by some gentler hand flung herself at
 feet glaucus
it is who have saved thee she sobbed
now let me die
lydia my child my preserver

oh let me feel thy touch thy breath yes
yes thou livest we are not too late that dread
door methought it would never yield and
calenus oh his voice was as dying wind
among tombs we had to wait gods it seemed
hours ere food and vine restored to him something
 strength but thou livest thou livest
yet and i shave saved thee 
this affecting scene was soon interrupted by
 event just described
 mountain earthquake resounded
from side to side officers fled with rest
they left glaucus and lydia to save themselves
as they might
as sense dangers around them flashed
on athenian his generous heart recurred to
olinthus he too was reprieved from tiger
by hand gods should he be left to a no
less fatal death in neighbouring cell taking
lydia by hand glaucus hurried across 
passages he gained den christian
he found olinthus kneeling and in prayer
pompeii 
arise arise my friend lie cried save
thyself and fly see nature is thy dread deliverer
he led forth bewildered christian
and pointed to cloud which advanced darker
and darker disgorging forth showers ashes
and pumice stones and bade him hearken to
 cries and trampling rush scattered
crowd
this is hand god god be praised i
said olinthus devoutly
fly seek thy brethren concert vith them
thy escape farewell 
olinthus did not answer neither did he mark
 retreating form his friend high thoughts
and solemn absorbed his soul and in enthusiasm
 his kindling heart he exulted in 
mercy god rather than trembled at evidence
 his power
at length he roused himself and hurried on 
he scarce knew whither
 open doors a dark desolate cell suddenly
appeared on his path through gloom within
 
there flared and flickered a single lamp and by
its light he saw three grim and naked forms
stretched on earth in death his feet were
suddenly arrested for amidst terrors 
that drear recess spoliation arena
he heard a low voice calling on name 
christ 
he could not resist lingering at that appeal
he entered den and his feet were dabbled in
 slow streams blood that gushed from 
corpses over sand
who said nazarene calls upon 
son god v
no answer came forth and turning round
olinthus beheld by light lamp an old
greyheaded man sitting on floor and supporting
in his lap head one dead
 features dead man were finely and
rigidly locked in sleep but over lip
there played a fierce smile not christian's
smile hope but dark sneer hatred and
defiance yet on face still lingered beaupompeii

tiful roundness early youth hair curled
thick and glossy over unwrinkled brow and
 down manhood but slightly shaded 
marble hueless yet iron cheek and over
this face bent one such unutterable sadness 
 such yearning tenderness such fond and
such deep despair tears old man fell
fast and hot but he did not feel them and when
his lips moved and he mechanically uttered 
prayer his benign and hopeful faith neither his
heart nor his sense responded to words it
was but involuntary emotion that broke from
 lethargy his mind his boy was dead and
had died for him and old man's heart was
broken 
medon said olinthus pityingly arise and
fly god is forth upon wings elements
 new gomorrah is doomed fly
ere fires consume thee 
he was ever so full life he cannot be
dead come hither place your hand on his
heart sure it beats yet i 
 
brother soul has fled we will remember
it in our prayers thou canst not
reanimate dumb clay come come hark
while i speak yon crashing walls hark yon
agonising cries not a moment is to be lost 
come 
i hear nothing said medon shaking his
grey hair poor boy his love murdered
him 
come come forgive this friendly force
what who would sever father from 
son and medon clasped body tightly in his
embrace and covered it with passionate kisses
go said he lifting up his face for one moment
 go we must be alone
alas said compassionate nazarene 
death hath severed ye already
 old man smiled very calmly no no
no he muttered his voice growing lower with
each word death has been more kind
with that his head drooped on his son's breast
his arms relaxed their grasp olinthus caught
pompeii 
him by hand pulse had ceased to beat
 words father were words 
truth death had been more hind
meanwhile glaucus and lydia were pacing
swift up perilous and fearful streets 
athenian had learnt from his preserver that lone
was yet in house arbaces thither he fled
to release to save her few slaves that 
egyptian had left at his mansion when he had
repaired in long procession to amphitheatre
had been able to offer no resistance to aimed
band sallust and when afterwards volcano
broke forth they had huddled together stunned
and frightened in inmost recesses house
even tall ethiopian had forsaken his post at
 door and glaucus who left lydia without
 poor lydia jealous once more even in such
an hour passed on through vast hall without
meeting one fi'om whom to learn chamber 
lone even as he passed ho vv ever darkness
that covered heavens increased so rapidly
that it was with difficulty he could guide his
 
steps flowerwreathed columns seemed to
reel and tremble and with every instant he heard
 ashes fall searchingly into roofless peristyle
breathless he paced along shouting out
aloud name lone and at length he heard
at a gallery a voice her voice in
wondering reply to rush forward to shatter
 door to seize lone in his arms to hurry
from mansion seemed to him work an
instant scarce had he gained spot where
lydia was than he heard steps advancing towards
 house and recognised voice 
arbaces who had returned to seek his wealth
and lone ere he fled from doomed pompeii
but so dense was already reeking atmosphere
that foes saw not each other though
so near save that dimly in gloom glaucus
caught moving outline snowy robes 
 egyptian
they hastened onward those three alas 
whither they now saw not a step before
them blackness became utter they were
pompeii 
encompassed with doubt and horror and 
death he had escaped seemed to glaucus only
to have changed its forms and augmented its
victims
 
chapter vi
calends and bubo dished and clovis girl
 amphitheatre and julia
 sudden catastrophe which had as it were
riven very bonds society and left prisoner
and jailor alike free had soon rid calends
 guards to whose care praetor had consigned
him and when darkness and 
crowd separated priest from his attendants he
hastened with trembling steps towards temple
 his goddess as he crept along and ere darkness
was complete he felt himself suddenly caught
by robe and a voice muttered in his ear 
hist calenus an awful hour
ay by my father's head who art thou
thy face is dim and thy voice is strange
not know thy burbo fie
pompeii 
gods how darkness gathers ho ho 
by yon terrific mountain what sudden blazes 
lightning how they dart and quiver hades
is loosed on earth 
tush thou believes not these things calenus
 now is he time to make our fortune 
ha
listen thy temple is full gold and precious
mummers let us load ourselves with
them and then hasten to sea and embark 
none will ever ask an account doings 
this day 
burbo thou art right hush and follow
me into temple who cares now who sees
now whether thou art priest or not follow
and we will share 
in precincts temple were many priests
gathered around altars praying weeping
grovelling in dust impostors in safety they
volcanic lightnings these phenomena were especially 
characteristic long subsequent eruption and their
evidence is visible in tokens that more awful one now so
imperfectly described
 
were not less superstitious in danger calenus
passed them and entered chamber yet to be
seen in south side court burbo followed
him priest struck a light wine and
viands strewed table remains a sacrificial
feast
a man who has hungered fortyeight hours
muttered calenus has an appetite even in such
a time he seized on food and devoured it
greedily nothing could perhaps be more unnaturally
horrid than selfish baseness these
villains for there is nothing more loathsome
than valour avarice plunder and sacrilege
while pillars world tottered to
and fro what an increase to terrors 
nature can be made by vices man
wilt thou never have done said burbo
impatiently thy face purples and thine eyes
start already
it is not every day one has such a right to be
hungry o jupiter what sound is that 
 hissing fiery water what does 
pompeii 
cloud give rain as avell as flame ha what
shrieks and burbo how silent all is now 
look forth
amidst other horrors mighty mountain
now cast up columns boiling water blent and
kneaded with halfburning ashes streams
fell like seething mud over streets in frequent
intervals and full where priests isis had
now cowered around altars on wdiicli they had
vainly sought to kindle fires and pour incense one
 fiercest those deadly torrents mingled
with immense fragments scoria had poured its
rage over bended forms priests it
dashed that cry had been death that silence
had been eternity ashes pitchy
stream sprinkled altars covered pavement
and half concealed quivering corpses 
 priests 
they are dead said burbo terrified for 
first time and hurrying back into cell i
thought not danger was so near and fatal
 two wretches stood staring at each other 
 
you might have heard their hearts beat alexius
 less bold by nature but more griping recovered
first
we must to our task and away he said ina
low whisper frightened at his own voice he
stepped to threshold paused crossed over 
heated floor and his dead brethren to sacred
chapel and called to burbo to follow but 
gladiator quaked and drew back
so much better thought calenus 
more aauii be any booty hastily he loaded himself
with more portable treasures temple
 and thinking no more his comrade
hurried from sacred place a sudden flash 
lightning from mount shewed burbo mio
stood motionless at threshold flying and
laden form priest he took heart he
stepped forth to join him when a tremendous
shower ashes fell right before his feet 
gladiator shrank back once more darkness
closed him in but shower continued fast 
fast its heaps rose high and suffocatingly 
pompeii 
deathly vapours steamed from them wretch
gasped for breath he sought in despair again to
fly ashes had blocked up threshold he
shrieked as his feet shrank from boiling fluid
how could he escape he could not climb to
 open space nay were he able he could not
brave its horrors it were best to remain in 
cell protected at least from fatal air he
sat down and clenched his teeth by degrees
 atmosphere from without stifling and venomous
 crept into chamber he could endure
it no longer his eyes glaring round rested
on a sacrificial axe which some priest had left in
 chamber he seized it with desperate
strength his gigantic arm he attempted to hew
his way through walls
meanwhile streets were already thinned 
 crowd had hastened to disperse itself under
shelter ashes began to fill up lower
parts town but here and there you heard
 steps fugitives crunching them warily or
saw their pale and haggard faces by blue
 
glare lightning or more unsteady glare
 torches by which they endeavoured to steer
their steps but ever and anon boiling water
 straggling ashes or mysterious and gusty
winds rising and dying in a breath extinguished
these wandering lights and with them 
living hope those who bore them
in street that leads to gate herculaneum
clodius now bent his perplexed and
doubtful way if i can gain open country
thought he doubtless there will be various
vehicles beyond gate and herculaneum is
not far distant thank mercury i have little to
lose and that little is about me 
holla help there help cried a querulous
and frightened voice i have fallen
down my torch is gone out my slaves have
deserted me i am diomed rich diomed 
ten thousand sesterces to him who helps me 
at same moment clodius felt himself caught
by feet fortune to thee let me go
fool said gambler
pompeii 
oh help me up give me thy hand
there rise
is this clodius i know voice whither
flies thou
towards herculaneum
blessed be gods our way is same
then as far as gate why not take refuge in
my villa thou knowest long range subterranean
cellars beneath basement that
shelter what shower can penetrate
you speak well said clodius musingly 
and by storing cellar with food we can
remain there even some should these wondrous
storms endure so long
o blessed be he who invented gates to a
city cried diomed see they have placed
a light within yon arch by that let us guide our
steps
 air was now still for a few minutes 
lamp from gate streamed out far and clear 
 fugitives hurried on they gained gate 
they passed by roman sentry lightning
vol ill n
 
flashed over his livid face and polished helmet
but his stern features were composed even in
their awe he remained erect and motionless
at his post that hour itself had not animated
 machine ruthless majesty rome
into reasoning and selfacting man there
he stood amidst crashing elements he had
not received permission to desert his station
and escape 
diomed and his companion hurried on when
suddenly a female form rushed athwart their
way it was girl whose ominous voice had
been raised so often and so gladly in anticipation
 merry show 
oh diomed she cried shelter shelter
see pointing to an infant clasped to her breast
 see this little one i it is mine child 
shame i have never owned it till this hour
but now i remember i am a mother i have
plucked it from cradle its nurse she had
 skeletons more than one sentry were found at their
posts
pompeii 
fled who could think babe in such tin
hour but she who bore it save it save it 
curses on thy shrill voice away harlot
muttered clodius between his ground teeth
nay girl said more humane diomed 
follow if thou wilt this way this way to
 vaults 
they hurried on they arrived at house 
diomed they laughed aloud as they crossed 
threshold for they deemed danger over
diomed ordered his slaves to carry down into
 subterranean gallery before described a profusion
 food and oil for lights and there julia
clodius mother and her babe greater
part slaves and some frightened visitors
and clients neighbourhood sought their
shelter
 
chapter vii
 progress destruction
 cloud which had scattered so deep a
murkiness over day had now settled into a
solid and impenetrable mass it resembled less
even thickest gloom a night in open
air than close and blind darkness some
narrow room but in proportion as blackness
gathered did lightnings around vesuvius
increase in their vivid and scorching glare nor
was their horrible beauty confined to usual
hues fire no rainbow ever rivalled their
varying and prodigal dies now brightly blue as
 most azure depth a southern sky now 
a livid and snakelike green darting restlessly to
pliny
pompeii 
and fro as folds an enormous serpent 
now a lurid and intolerable crimson gushing
forth through columns smoke far and wide
and lighting up whole city from arch to arch
then suddenly dying into a sickly paleness like
 ghost its own life 
in pauses showers you heard 
rumbling earth beneath and groaning
waves tortured sea or lower still and
audible but to watch interest fear 
grinding and hissing murmur escaping
gases through chasms distant mountain
sometimes cloud appeared to break
from its solid mass and by lightning to assume
quaint and vast mimicries human or monster
shapes striding across gloom hurtling one
upon other and vanishing swiftly into 
turbulent abyss shade so that to eyes and
fancies affrighted wanderers unsubstantial
vapours were as bodily forms 
gigantic foes agents terror and death
dion cassius
 
 ashes in many places were already kneesleep
 and boiling showers which came from
 steaming breath volcano forced their
way into houses bearing with them a strong
and suffocating vapour in some places immense
fragments rock hurled upon houseroofs
bore down along streets masses confused
ruin which yet more and more with every hour
obstructed away and as day advanced
 motion earth was more sensibly felt 
 footing seemed to slide and creep nor could
chariot or litter be kept steady even on most
level ground
sometimes huger stones striking against
each other as they fell broke into countless fragments
emitting sparks fire which caught whatever
was combustible within their reach and
along plains beyond city darkness was
now terribly relieved for several houses and
even vineyards had been set on flames and at
various intervals fires rose sullenly and
fiercely against solid gloom to add to this
pompeii 
partial relief darkness citizens had
here and there in more public places such
as porticos temples and entrances to
 forum endeavoured to place rows torches 
but these rarely continued long showers and
 winds extinguished them and sudden
darkness into which their sudden birth was converted
had something in it doubly terrible and
doubly impressing on impotence human
hopes lesson despair
frequently by momentary light these
torches parties fugitives encountered each
other some hurrying towards sea others
flying from sea back to land for 
ocean had retreated rapidly from shore an
utter darkness lay over it and upon its groaning
and tossing waves storm cinders and rock fell
without protection which streets and roofs
afforded to land wild haggard ghastly
with supernatural fears these groups encountered
each other but without leisure to speak to
consult to advise for showers fell now free
 
quietly though not continuously extinguishing
 lights which shewed to each band deathlike
faces other and hurrying all to seek
refuge beneath nearest shelter whole
elements civilisation were broken up ever
and anon by flickering lights you saw 
thief hastening by most solemn authorities 
 law laden with and fearfully chuckling over
 produce his sudden gains if in darkness
wife was separated from husband or parent
from child vain was hope reunion each
hurried blindly and confusedly on nothing in
all various and complicated machinery 
social life meas left save primal law selfpreservation

through this awful scene did athenian
wade his way accompanied by lone and blind
girl suddenly a rush hundreds in their path
to sea swept by them lydia was torn from
 side glaucus who with lone was borne
rapidly onward and when crowd whose forms
they saw not so thick was gloom were gone
pompeii 
lydia was still separated from their side glaucus
shouted her name no answer came they
retraced their steps in vain they could not discover
her it was evident that she had been
swept along some opposite direction by human
current their friend their preserver was lost
and hitherto lydia had been their guide her
blindness rendered to her alone scene familiar 
accustomed through a perpetual night to thread
 windings city she led them unerringly
towards seashore by which they had resolved
to hazard an escape now which way could they
wend all was rayless to them a maze without
a clue wearied despondent bewildered they
however passed along ashes falling upon
their heads fragmentary stones dashing up
its sparkles before their feet
alas alas murmured lone i can go no
farther my steps sink among scorching
cinders fly dearest beloved fly and leave
me to my fate 
hush my betrothed my bride death with
n
 
thee is sweeter than life without thee yet
whither oh whither can we direct ourselves
through gloom already it seems that we
have made but a circle and are in very spot
which we quitted an hour ago
o gods yon rock see it hath riven 
roof before us it is death to move through 
streets i 
blessed lightning see lone see i 
portico temple fortune is before us
let us creep beneath it it will protect us from
 showers
he caught his beloved in his arms and with
difficulty and labour gained temple he
bore her to remoter and more sheltered part
 portico and leant over her that he might
shield her with his own form from lightning
and showers beauty and unselfishness
 love could hallow even that dismal
time
who is there said trembling and hollow
voice one who had preceded them in their
pompeii 
place refuge yet what matters crush
 ruined world forbids to us friends or foes
lone turned at sound voice and
with a faint shriek cowered again beneath 
arms glaucus and he looking in direction
 voice beheld cause her alarm
through darkness glared forth two burning
eyes lightning flashed and lingered athwart
 temple and glaucus with a shudder perceived
 lion to which he had been doomed
couched beneath pillars and close beside
him unwitting vicinity lay giant form
 him who had accosted them gladiator
niger
that lightning had revealed to each other 
form beast and man yet instinct both
was quelled nay lion crept near and nearer
to gladiator as for companionship and 
gladiator did not recede or tremble revolution
 nature had dissolved her lighter terrors
and her wonted ties
while they were thus terribly protected a
 
group men and women bearing torches passed
by temple they were congregation 
 nazarenes and a sublime and unearthly
emotion had not indeed quelled their awe but it
had robbed awe fear they had long believed
according to error early christians
that day was at hand they imagined
now that day had come
wo wo cried in a shrill and piercing
voice elder at their head behold 
lord descended to judgment he maketh fire
come down from heaven in sight men 
wo wo ye strong and mighty wo to ye 
 fasces and purple wo to idolater
and worshipper beast wo to ye who
pour forth blood saints and gloat over 
deathpangs sons god wo to 
harlot sea wo wo 
and with a loud and deep clovis troop
chanted forth along wild horrors air 
wo to harlot sea wo wo 
 nazarenes paced slowly on their torches
pompeii 
still flickering in storm their voices still
raised in menace and solemn warning till lost
amid windings in streets darkness 
 atmosphere and silence death again
fell over scene
there was one frequent pauses in 
showers and glaucus encouraged lone once more
to proceed just as they stood hesitating on 
 step portico an old man with a bag
in his right hand and leaning upon a youth tottered
by youth bore a torch glaucus recognised
 two as father and son miser and
prodigal
father said youth if you cannot
move more swiftly i must leave you or we both
perish 
fly boy then and leave thy sire
but i cannot fly to starve give me thy bag
 gold and youth snatched at it
wretch wouldst thou rob thy father
ay who can tell tale in this hour
miser perish 
 
 boy struck old man to ground
plucked bag from his relaxing hand and fled
onward with a shrill yell
ye gods cried glaucus are ye blind
then even in dark such crimes may well
confound guiltless with guilty in one common
ruin lone on on

graces encounters glaucus and lone
advancing as men grope for escape in a dungeon
lone and her lover continued their uncertain
way at moments when volcanic lightnings
lingered over streets they were enabled
by that awful light to steer and guide their progress
 yet little did view it presented to
them cheer or encourage their path in parts
where ashes lay dry and unconfined with
 boiling torrents cast upward from mountain
at capricious intervals surface 
earth presented a leprous and ghastly white
in other places cinder and rock lay matted in
heaps from beneath which might be seen 
 
half hid limbs some wished and manoled
fugitive groans dying were broken
by wild shrieks women's terror now near
now distant which when heard in utter
darkness were rendered doubly appalling by 
crushing sense helplessness and uncertainty
 perils around and clear and distinct
through all were mighty and various
noises from fatal mountain its rushing
winds its whirling torrents and from time
to time burst and roar some more fiery
and fierce explosion and ever as winds
swept howling along street they bore sharp
streams burning dust and such sickening and
poisonous vapours as took away for instant
breath and consciousness followed by a rapid
revulsion arrested blood and a tingling
sensation agony trembling through every nerve
and fibre frame
oh glaucus my beloved my own take
me to thy arms one embrace let me feel thy
pompeii 
arms around me and in that embrace let me
die i can no more 
for my sake for my life courage yet
sweet lone my life is linked with thine and see
torches this way lo how they brave 
wind ha they live through storm doubtless
fugitives to sea we will join them
as if to inspire lovers winds and showers
came to a sudden pause atmosphere was
profoundly still mountain seemed at rest
gathering perhaps fresh fury for its next burst 
 torchbearers moved quickly on we are
nearing sea said in a calm voice person
at their head liberty and wealth to each slave
who survives this day courage i tell you
that gods themselves have assured me 
deliverance on 
redly and steadily torches flashed full on
 eyes glaucus and lone who lay trembling
and exhausted on his bosom several slaves
were bearing by light panniers and coffers
heavily laden in front them a drawn
 
sword in his hand towered lofty form 
arbaces
by my fathers cried egyptian fate
smiles upon me even through these horrors and
amidst greatest aspects wo and death
bodes me happiness and love away greek 
i claim my ward lone 
traitor and murderer cried glaucus glaring
upon his foe nemesis hath guided thee to
my revenge a just sacrifice to shades 
hades that now seem loosed on earth approach
touch but hand lone and thy weapon
shall be as a reed i will tear thee limb from
limb
suddenly as he spoke place became lighted
with an intense and lurid glow bright and gigantic
through darkness which closed around
it like walls hell mountain shone a
pile fire its summit seemed riven in two 
or rather above its surface there seemed to rise
two monstershapes each confronting each as
demons contending for a world these were
pompeii 
 one deep bloodred hue fire which lighted
up whole atmosphere far and wide but helow
 nether part mountain was still
dark and shrouded save in three places adown
which flowed serpentine and irregular a rivers
 molten lava darkly red through 
profound gloom their banks they flowed
slowly on as towards devoted city over 
broadest there seemed to spring a cragged and
stupendous arch from which as from jaws 
hell gushed sources sudden phlegethon
and through stilled air was heard rattling
 fragments rock hurtling one upon another
as they were borne down fiery cataracts 
darkening for one instant spot where they
fell and suffused next in burnished hues
 flood along which they floated 
 slaves shrieked aloud and cowering hid
their faces egyptian himself stood transfixed
to spot glow lighting up his commanding
features and jewelled robes high behind him
rose a tall column that supported bronze
 
statue augustus and imperial image seemed
changed to a shape fii'e 
with his left hand circled round form 
lone with his right arm raised in menace and
grasping stiles which was to have been his
weapon in arena and which he still fortunately
bore about him with his brow knit his lips
apart wrath and menace human passions
arrested as by a charm upon his features 
glaucus fronted egyptian 
muttering to himself arbaces turned his eyes
from mountain they rested on form 
glaucus he paused a moment why he
muttered should i hesitate did not stars
foretell only crisis imminent peril to which
i was subjected is not that peril past 
 soul cried he aloud can brave 
wreck worlds and wrath imaginary gods 
by that soul will i conquer to advance

thine own head thus then i regain lone 
he advanced one step it was his on earth

 ground shook beneath him with a convulsion
that cast all around upon its surface a simultaneous
crash resounded through city as down
toppled many a roof and pillar lightning
as if caught by metal lingered an instant on
 imperial statue then shivered bronze and
column down fell ruin echoing along 
street and riving solid pavement where it
crashed prophecy stars was fulfilled

 sound shock stunned athenian
for several moments when he recovered 
light still illumined scene earth still
slid and trembled beneath lone lay senseless
on ground but he saw her not yet his eyes
were fixed upon a ghastly face that seemed to
emerge without limbs or trunk from huge
fragments shattered column a face 
unutterable pain agony and despair eyes
shut and opened rapidly as if sense were not

 despair lovers condition 
multitude
glaucus turned in gratitude but in awe caught
lone once more in his arms and fled along 
street that was yet intensely luminous but suddenly
a duller shade fell over air instinctively
he turned to mountain and behold 
one two gigantic crests into which 
summit had been divided rocked and wavered to
and fro and then with a sound mightiness
 which no language can describe it fell from its
burning base and rushed an avalanche fire
down sides mountain at same
instant gushed forth a volume blackest smoke
rolling on over air sea and earth
another and another and another shower
 
 ashes far more profuse than before scattered
fresh desolation along streets darkness once
more wrapt them as a veil and glaucus his bold
heart at quelled and despairing sunk beneath
 cover an arch and clasping lone to his
heart a bride on that couch ruin resignned
himself to die 
meanwhile lydia when separated by throng
from glaucus and lone had in vain endeavoured
to regain them in vain she raised that
plaintive cry so peculiar to blind it was lost
amidst a thousand shrieks more selfish terror
again and again she returned to spot where
tlie had been divided to find her companions
gone to seize every fugitive to inquire glaucus
to be dashed aside in impatience distraction
who in that hour spared one thought to
his neighbour perhaps in scenes universal
horror nothing is more horrid than unnatural
selfishness they engender at length it occurred
to lydia that as it had been resolved to seek
pompeii 
 seashore for escape her most probable chance
 rejoining her companions would be to persevere
in that direction guiding her steps then
by staff which she always carried she continued
with incredible dexterity to avoid 
masses ruin that encumbered path to
thread streets and unerringly so blessed now
was that accustomed darkness so afflicting in ordinary
life to take nearest direction to 
seaside
poor girl her courage was beautiful to behold 
and fate seemed to favour one so helpless 
boiling torrents touched her not save by 
general rain which accompanied them huge
fiagents scoria shivered pavement before
and beside her but spared that frail form and
when lesser ashes fell over her she shook
them away with a slight tremor and dauntlessly
resumed her course
 a heavy shower ashes rained upon us which every
now and then we were obliged to shake off otherwise we should
have been crushed and buried in heap pliny

weak exposed yet fearless supported but byone
wish she was a very emblem psyche in
her wanderings hope walking through 
valley shadow soul itself lone
but undaunted amidst dangers and snares
 life
her path was however constantly impeded by
 crowds that now groped amidst gloom
now fled in temporary glare lightnings
across scene and at length a group torchbearers
rushing full against her she was thrown
down with some violence
what said voice one party
is this brave blind girl by bacchus
she must not be left here to die up i
my thessalian so so are you hurt 
that's well come on with us we are for
 shore 
o sallust it is thy voice gods be
thanked glaucus glaucus have ye seen
h'nn 
not i he is doubtless out city by
pompeii 
this time gods who saved him from 
lion will save him from burning mountain
as kindly epicure thus encouraged lydia
he drew her along with him towards sea
heeding not her passionate entreaties that he
would linger yet awhile to search for glaucus 
and still in accent despair she continued
to shriek aloud that beloved name which amidst
all roar convulsed elements kept alive
a music at her heart
 sudden illumination burst floods
 lava and earthquake which we have already
described chanced when sallust and his party had
just gained direct path leading from city
to port and here they were arrested by an
immense crowd more than half population 
 city they spread along field without 
walls thousands upon thousands uncertain whither
to fly sea had retired far from shore 
and they who had fled to it had been so terrified
by agitation and preternatural shrinking 
 element gasping forms uncouth
 
sea things which waves had left upon 
sand and by sound huge stones cast
from mountain into deep that they had
returned again to land as presenting less
frightful aspect two thus two streams
 human beings one seaward other grow
 sea had met together feeling a sad comfort
in numbers arrested in despair and doubt
 world is to be destroyed by fire said an
old man in long loose robes a philosopher 
stoic school stoic and epicurean wisdom have
alike agreed in this prediction and hour is
come 
yea hour is come cried aloud voice
solemn but not fearful
those around turned in dismay voice
came from above them it alas voice olinthus
who surrounded by his christian friends
stood upon an abrupt eminence on which old
greek colonists had raised a temple to apollo
now timeworn and half in ruin
as he spake there came that sudden illuminestion which had heralded death arbaces
and glowing over that mighty multitude awed
crouching breathless never on earth had 
faces men seemed so haggard never had
meeting mortal beings been so stamped with
 horror and sublimity dread never till 
 trumpet sounds shall such meeting be seen
again and above rose form olinthus with
outstretched arm and prophet brow girt with 
living fires and crowd knew face him
they had doomed to fangs beast then
their victim novo their warner and through 
stillness again came his ominous voice 
 hour is come
 christians repeated cry it was caught
up it was echoed from side to side woman and
man childhood and old age repeated not
aloud but in a smothered and dreary murmur 
 hour is come 
at that moment a wild yell burst through 
air and thinking only escape whither it
knew not terrible tiger african desert
 
leapt amongst throng and hurried through
its parted streams and so came earthquake
and so darkness once more fell over earth
and now new fugitives arrived grasping 
treasures no longer destined for their lord 
slaves arbaces joined throng one only 
all their torches yet flickered on it was borne
by sosia and its light falling on face lydia
he recognised thessalian
what avails thy liberty now blind girl said
 slave
who art thou canst thou tell me glaucus

ay i saw him but a few minutes since
blessed be thy head where
couched beneath arch forum 
dead or dying gone to rejoin arbaces who is
no more 
lydia uttered not a word she slid fi'om 
side sallust silently she glided through those
behind her and retraced her steps to city
she gained forum arch she stooped
pompeii 
down she felt around she called on name
 glaucus
a weak voice answered who calls on me i
is it voice shades lo i am prepared

arise follow me take my hand i glaucus
thou shalt be saved 
in wonder and sudden hope glaucus arose 
lydia still ah thou then art safe 
 tender joy his voice pierced heart
 poor thessalian and she blessed him for his
thought her
half leading half carrying lone glaucus followed
his guide with admirable discretion she
avoided path which led to crowd she had
just quitted and by another route sought 
shore
after many pauses and incredible perseverance
they gained sea and joined a group
who bolder than rest resolved to hazard any
peril rather than continue in such a scene in
darkness they put forth to sea but as they
 
cleared land and caught new aspects 
mountain its channels molten fire threw a
partial redness over waves
utterly exhausted and worn out lone slept on
 breast glaucus and lydia lay at his feet
meanwhile showers dust and ashes still
borne aloft fell into wave and scattered
their snows over deck far and wide borne
by winds those showers descended upon

chapter x
 next morning fate nydia
and meekly softly beautifully dawned at 
 light over trembling deep winds
were sinking into rest foam died from 
glowing azure that delicious sea around 
east thin mists caught gradually rosy hues
that heralded morning light was about to
resume her reign yet still dark and massive ia
 distance lay broken fragments 
destroying cloud from which red streaks burning
oilier and more dim betrayed yet rolling
fires mountain scorched fields
 white walls and gleaming columns that had
adorned lovely coast were no more sullen
o
 
and dull were shores so lately crested by
 cities herculaneum and pompeii 
darlings deep were snatched from her embrace
 century after century shall mighty
mother stretch forth her azure arms and know
them not moaning round sepulchres 
lost 
there was no shout from mariners at 
dawning light it had come too gradually and
they were too wearied for such sudden bursts 
joy but there was a low deep murmur thankfulness
amidst those watchers long night
they looked at each other and smiled they took
heart they felt once more that there was a world
around and a god above them and in 
feeling that worst was past overwearied
ones turned round and fell placidly to sleep in
 growing light skies there came 
silence which night had wanted and bark
drifted calmly onward to its port a few other
vessels bearing similar fugitives might be seen
in expanse apparently motionless yet gliding
pompeii 
also on there was a sense security 
companionship and hope in sight 
their slender masts and white sails what
beloved friends lost and missed in gloom
might they not bear to safety and to shelter 
in silence general sleep lydia rose
gently she bent over face glaucus she
inhaled deep breath his heavy slumber 
timidly and sadly she kissed his brow his lips
she felt for his hand it was locked in that 
lone she sighed deeply and her face darkened
again she kissed his brow and with her hair
wiped from it damps night may 
gods bless you athenian she murmured may
you be happy with your beloved one may you
sometimes remember lydia alas she is no
farther use on earth 
with these words she turned away slowly
she crept along by fori or platforms to 
farther side vessel and pausing bent low
over deep cool spray dashed upward on
her feverish brow it is kiss death she
 
said it is welcome balmy air played
through her waving tresses she put them from
her face and raised those eyes so tender though
so lightness to sky whose soft face she had
never seen 
no no she said half aloud and in a musing
and thoughtful tone i cannot endure it this
jealous exacting love it shatters my whole soul
in madness i might harm him again wretch
that i was i have saved him twice saved him
happy happy thought why not die happy 
it is glad thought i can ever know o 
sacred sea i hear thy voice invitingly it hath
a freshening and joyous call they say that in thy
embrace is dishonour that thy victims cross not
 fatal styx be it so i would not meet him
in shades for i should meet him still with
her rest rest rest there is no other elysium
for a heart like mine 
a sailor half dozing on deck heard a slight
splash on waters drowsily he looked up
and behind as vessel merrily bounded on he
pompeii 
fancied he saw something white above waves 
but it vanished in an instant he turned round
again and dreamed his home and children
when lovers awoke their first thought was
 each other their next lydia she was not
to be found none had seen her since night
every crevice vessel was searched there
was no trace her mysterious from first to
 blind thessalian had vanished for ever
from living world they guessed her fate in
silence and glaucus and lone while they drew
nearer to each other feeling each other 
world itself forgot their deliverance and wept
as for a departed sister

health you request me to visit you at rome 
no sallust come rather to me at athens i have
forsworn imperial city its mighty tumult and
hollow joys in my own land henceforth i dwell
for ever ghost our departed greatness is
dearer to me than gaudy life your loud
prosperity there is a charm to me which no
other spot can supply in porticos hallowed
still by holy and venerable shades in olive
groves missus i still hear voice poetry

on heights phyle clouds twilight
seem yet shrouds departed freedom 
herald herald morrow that shall
come you smile at my enthusiasm sallust
better be hopeful in chains than resigned to their
glitter you tell me you are sure that i cannot
enjoy life in these melancholy haunts a fallen
majesty you dwell with rapture on roman
splendours and luxuries imperial court
my sallust non sum qualis era i am not
what i was events my life have sobered
 bounding blood my youth my health has
never quite recovered its mounted elasticity ere it
felt pangs disease and languished in 
damps a criminal's dungeon my mind has
never shaken off dark shadow day
 pompeii horror and desolation 
that awful ruin our beloved our remembered
lydia i have reared a tomb to her shade and
i see it every day from window my study
it keeps alive in me a tender recollection a not
unpleasing sadness which are but a fitting
 
homage to her fidelity and mysteriousness 
her early death lone gathers flowers but
my own hand wreathes them daily around 
tomb she was worthy a tomb in athens 
you speak growing sect christians
in rome sallust to you i may confide my
secret i have pondered much over that faith 
i have adopted it after destruction 
pompeii i met once more with olinthus 
saved alas only for a day and falling afterwards
a martyr to indomitable energy his
zeal in my preservation from lion and 
earthquake he taught me to behold hand
 unknown god i listened believed 
adored my own my more than ever beloved
lone has also embraced creed a creed
sallust which shedding light over this world
gathers its concentrated glory like a sunset over
 next we know that we are united in 
soul as in flesh for ever and for ever ages
may roll on our very dust be dissolved earth
pompeii 
shrivelled like a scroll but round and round
 circle eternity rolls wheel life 
imperishable unceasing and as earth from
 sun so immortality drinks happiness from
virtue chick is smile upon face god
visit me then sallust bring with you 
learned scrolls epicurus pythagoras diogenes
 arm yourself for defeat and let us
amidst groves academies dispute under a
surer guide than any granted to our fathers on
 mighty problem true ends life and
 nature soul
lone at that name my heart yet beats lone
is by my side as i write i lift my eyes and meet
her smile sunlight quivers over hymettus 
and along my garden i hear hum 
summer bees am i happy ask you oh what
can rome give me equal to what i possess at
athens here every thing awakens soul
and inspires affections trees waters
 hills skies are those athens fair
though mourning mother poetry and
 
 wisdom world in my hall i seethe
marble faces my ancestors in ceramucus
i survey their tombs in streets i
behold hand phidias and soul 
pericles harmonious aristogiton they are everywhere
 but in our hearts in mine at least
they shall not perish if any thing can make
me forget that i am athenian and not free it is
partly soothing love watchful vivid
sleepless lone a love that has taken a new
sentiment in our new creed h a love which
none our poets beautiful though they be had
shadowed forth in description for mingled with
religion it partakes religion it is blended with
pure and unworldly thoughts it is that which
we may hope to carry through eternity and keep
therefore white and unsullied that we may not
blush to confess it to our god this is true
type dark fable our grecian eros and
psyche it is in truth soul sleeping in 
arms love and if this our love support me
partly against fever desire for freedom 
pompeii 
my religion supports me more for whenever i
would grasp sword and sound shell and
rush to a new marathon but marathon without
victory i feel my despair at chilling thought
 my country's impotence crushing weight
 roman yoke comforted at least by 
thought that earth is but beginning life 
that glory a few years matters little in 
vast space eternity that there is no perfect
freedom till chains clay fall from soul
and all space all time become its heritage
and domain yet sallust some mixture 
soft greek blood still mingles with my faith i
can share not zeal those who see crime and
eternal wrath in men who cannot believe as
they i shudder not at creed others i
dare not curse them i pray great father to
convert this lukewarmness exposes me to some
suspicion amongst christians but i forgive
it and not offending openly prejudices 
 crowd i am thus enabled to protect my
brethren from danger law and 
 
consequences their own zeal if moderation
seem to me natural creature benevolence
it gives also greatest scope to beneficence
such then o sallust is my life such my
opinions in this manner i greet existence and
await death and thou gladhearted and kindly
pupil epicurus thou but come hither
and see what enjoyments what hopes are ours
and not splendour imperial banquets 
nor shouts crowded circus nor 
noisy forum nor glittering theatre nor
 luxuriant gardens nor voluptuous baths
 rome shall seem to thee to constitute a life
 more vivid and uninterrupted happiness than
that which thou so unreasonably pities as 
career glaucus athenian farewell

which imperial roman shivered when he

campania and composed this history 
notes to v
rt p rivers molten java
various theories as to exact mode by which pompeii was
destroyed have been invented by ingenious i have adopted
that m'hich is most generally received and which upon inspecting
 strata appears only one admissible by commonsense
namely a destruction by showers ashes and boiling water
mingled with frequent irruptions large stones and aided
by partial convulsions earth herculaneum on contrary
appears to have received not only showers ashes but
also inundations from molten lava and streams referred to
in text must be considered as destined for that city rather
than for pompeii volcanic lightnings introduced in my
description were evidently among engines ruin at pompeii
papyrus and other more inflammable materials are
found in a lurnt state some substances in metal are partially
melted and a bronze statue is completely shivered as by lightning
upon whole i believe my description destruction
is very little assisted by invention and will be fotmd not
 less accurate for its appearance in a romance
 p a love that has taken a new sentiment in
our new creed
v'hat we now term and feel to be sentiment in love was very
little known amongst ancients and at this day is scarcely
vol iii p
 
acknowledged out christendom it is a feeling intimately connected
with not a belief but a conviction that passion is 
 soul and like soul immortal chateaubriand in that
work so full both error and tnith his essay on 
genius christianity has referred to this sentiment with his
usual eloquence it makes indeed great distinction between
 amatory poetry moderns and that 
ancients and i have thought that i might with some consonance
to truth and nature attribute consciousness this
sentiment to glances after his conversion to christianity though
he is only able vaguely to guess at rather than thoroughly to
explain its cause

those who once moved springs that minute yet gorgeous
machine luxury and life
at present there have been about or skeletons discovered
in pompeii iut as a great part city is yet to be disinterred
we cadi scarcely calculate number those who perished
in destruction still however we have every reason to conclude
that they were very few in proportion to those who escaped

author who has vainly endeavoured in work which he now
concludes to beguile most painful gloomy and despondent
period a life in web which has been woven less 
white than world may deem but like most other friends
 imagination is capricious and forsakes us often at 
moment in which we most need its aid as we grow older we
begin to learn that two our more faithful and steadfast
comforter is custom but i should apologise for this sudden
and unseasonable indulgence a momentary weakness it is
but for a moment with returning health returns also that
energy without which soul were given us in vain and which
enables us calmly to face evils oiir being and resolutely
to fulfil its objects there is but one philosophy though there
are a thousand schools and its name is fortitude 
to bear is to conquer our fate

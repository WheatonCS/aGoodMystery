i have often debated in my mind whether i should give to the world
or for ever lock up within the secrecy of my own breast the history
of the adventures which it has been my lot in life to experience the
importance of any single individual in society especially one so
isolated as myself is so little that it can scarcely be supposed
that the community at large can be affected by his fortunes either
good or evil or interested in any way in his fate yet it sometimes
happens that circumstances conspire to elevate the humblest person
from obscurity and to give the whole world an interest in his
affairs and that man may safely consider himself of some value in his
generation whose history is of a character to instruct the ignorant
and inexperienced such a man i consider myself to be and the more
i reflect upon my past life the more i am convinced it contains a
lesson which may be studied with profit while at the same time
if i am not greatly mistaken the lesson will be found neither dry
nor repulsive but here and there on the contrary quite diverting
the psychologist i hate big words but one cannot do without them
and the metaphysician will discover in my relation some new subjects
for reflection and so perhaps will the doctor of medicine and the
physiologist but while i leave these learned gentlemen to discuss what
may appear most wonderful in my revealments i am most anxious that the
common reader may weigh the value of what is at least in appearance
more natural simple and comprehensible

it will be perceived that many of the following adventures are of a
truly extraordinary character there are some men--and to such my story
will seem incredible enough--who pride themselves on believing nothing
that they do not know and who endeavour very absurdly to restrict
the objects of belief to those that admit of personal cognizance there
are others again who boast the same maxim but have a more liberal
understanding of the subjects of knowledge and permit themselves
to believe many things which are susceptible of satisfactory proof
but not of direct cognition now i must declare beforehand in order
to avoid all trouble that from the very nature of the life i have
led consisting of the strangest transitions and vicissitudes it is
impossible i should have laid up proofs to satisfy any one of the truth
of my relation who is disposed to be incredulous if any one should
say i doubt all the answer i could make would be doubt and be
hanged--not however meaning any offence to anybody though it is
natural one should be displeased at having his veracity questioned
i write for the world at large which is neither philosophic nor
skeptical and the world will believe me otherwise it is a less
sensible world than i have all along supposed it to be




chapter ii


the birth and family of sheppard lee with some account of his temper
and complexion of mind


i was born somewhere towards the close of the last century--but
the register-leaf having been torn from the family bible and no one
remaining who can give me information on the point i am not certain as
to the exact year--in the state of new-jersey in one of the oldest
counties that border upon the delaware river my father was a farmer
in very good circumstances respectable in his degree but perhaps
more famous for the excellent sausages he used to manufacture for the
philadelphia market than for any quality of mind or body that can
distinguish one man from his fellows taking the hint from his success
in this article of produce he gradually converted his whole estate
into a market-farm raising fine fruits and vegetables and such
other articles as are most in demand in a city in which enterprise
he succeeded beyond his highest expectations and bade fair to be
as in the end he became a rich man the only obstacle to a speedy
accumulation of riches was a disproportionate increase in the agents
of consumption--his children multiplying on his hands almost as fast
as his acres until he could count eleven in all a number that filled
him at one time with consternation he used to declare no apple could
be expected to ripen on a farm where there were eleven children and
as for watermelons and sugar-corn it was folly to think of raising
them longer but fate sent my father relief sooner and more effectually
than he either expected or desired nine of the eleven being removed
by death in a space of time short of six years three two of whom
were twin sisters were translated in the natural way falling victims
to an epidemic and were buried in the same grave a fourth was soon
after killed by falling out of an apple-tree my eldest brother then a
boy of fourteen years old upon some freak ran away from home for he
was of a wild madcap turn and getting into an oyster-boat made a
voyage into the bay where he was lost for having fallen overboard
and not being able to swim a clumsy fellow who thought to save him
in that way clutched him round the neck with a pair of oyster-tongs
and thereby strangled him two others were drowned in a millpond where
they were scraping for snapping-turtles another who was the wag of
the family was killed by attempting to ride a pig which running
in great alarm through a broken fence into the orchard dashed his
brains out against a white-oak rail and the ninth died of a sort of
hysterical affection caused by this unlucky exploit of his brother
for he could not cease laughing at it notwithstanding its melancholy
termination and he died of the fit within twenty-four hours

thus in a few years there remained but two of all the eleven
children--to wit my oldest sister prudence and myself my mother
from whom i had my christian name sheppard that being her maiden
name died several years before this last catastrophe her mind having
been affected and indeed distracted by so many mournful losses
occurring in such rapid succession she fell into a deep melancholy
and died insane

being one of the youngest children i grieved but little for the loss
of my brothers and sisters nor was i able to appreciate the advantage
which in a worldly point of view their death must prove to me my
father however perceived the difference for having now so few to
look after and be chargeable to him he could with great propriety
consider himself a rich man he immediately resolved as i was now his
only son that i should have a good education and it was not his fault
if in this particular i fell short of his expectations i was sent
to good schools and in course of time was removed to the college at
nassau hall in princeton where i remained during three years that
is until my father's decease when i yielded to the natural indolence
of my temper and left the college or rather for i had formed no
resolution on the subject procrastinated my return from day to day
until it was too late to return

my natural disposition was placid and easy--i believe i may say
sluggish i was not wanting in parts but had as little energy or
activity of mind as ever fell to the share of a jerseyman and how
my father ever came to believe i should make a figure in the world
i cannot conceive unless it was because he knew he had a fortune to
leave me and saw me safely lodged in a college it is very certain he
encouraged a strong belief that i should one day be a great man and
i fancy it was for this reason he showed himself so favourable to me
in his will he left me the bulk of his property bestowing upon my
sister who had recently married little beyond a farm which he had
purchased in a neighbouring county but which was a valuable one and
quite satisfied her husband

but my father was a better judge of sausages than of human character
besides being deficient as i humbly confess in all those qualities
that are necessary to the formation of a great man i had not the
slightest desire to be one ambition was a passion that never afflicted
my mind and i was so indifferent to the game of greatness which was
playing around me that i seriously declare there was a president
of the united states elected to office and turned out again after
having served his regular term without my knowing any thing about it
i had not even the desire so common to young men who find themselves
in possession of a fortune to launch out into elegant expenses to
dash about the country with fine horses servants and clothes and
to play the spendthrift in cities on the contrary i no sooner found
myself arrived at my majority which was a few months after my father's
death than i sat down very quietly on the farm resolved to take the
world easily which i supposed i might easily do i had some idea of
continuing to conduct the estate as my father had done before me but
it was a very vague one and having made one or two efforts to bear
myself like a man of business i soon found the effort was too tiresome
for one of my disposition and i accordingly hired an overseer to
manage the property for me




chapter iii


the pleasures of having nothing to do--some thoughts on matrimony


having thus shuffled the cares of business from my shoulders to
another's my time began to weigh a little heavily on my hands and i
cast about for some amusement that might enable me to get rid of it as
there was great abundance of small game such as quails partridges
and rabbits in the neighbourhood i resolved to turn sportman and
in consequence i bought me a dog and gun and began to harry the
country with some spirit but having the misfortune to shoot my dog the
first day and soon after a very valuable imported cow belonging
to a neighbour for which i was obliged to pay him enormous damages
and meeting besides with but little luck i grew disgusted with the
diversion my last shot was soon fired for having forgotten the
provisions of our game-laws i killed a woodcock too early in the
summer for which on the information of a fellow who owed me a grudge
i was prosecuted although it was the only bird i ever killed in all my
life and soundly fined and this incensed me so much that i resolved
to have nothing more to do with an amusement that cost so much money
and threw me into so many difficulties

i was then at a loss how to pass my time until a neighbour who bred
fine horses persuaded me to buy a pair of blooded colts and try my
luck on the turf and this employment though rather too full of cares
and troubles to suit me exactly i followed with no little spirit
and became more proud of my horses than i can well express until i
came to try them on the race-course where it was my luck what with
stakes and betting together to lose more money in a single day than
my father had ever made in two years together i then saw very clearly
that horse-racing was nothing better than gambling and therefore both
disreputable and demoralizing for which reason i instantly gave it up
heartily sick of the losses it had occasioned me

my overseer or steward--for such he may be considered--whom i always
esteemed a very sensible fellow for he was shrewd and energetic
and at least ten years my senior then advised me as i was a young
man with money enough to travel a little and see the world and
accordingly i went to new-york where i was robbed of my luggage and
money by a villain whose acquaintance i made in the steamboat and
whom i thought a highly intelligent gentlemanly personage though
as it afterward appeared he was a professor from sing-sing where he
had been sawing stone for two years the governor of new-york having
forgiven him as is the custom the five other years for which he was
committed for i believe a fraud committed on his own father

this loss drove me home again but being re-encouraged by my overseer
i filled my purse and set out a second time passing up the hudson
river with which i was prodigiously pleased though not with the
overslaugh where we stuck fast during six hours i then proceeded
to saratoga where i remained for two weeks on account of its being
fashionable but i declare to heaven i was never so tired of any
place in my life i then went to niagara which in spite of the great
noise it made i thought the finest place in the world and there i
think i should have continued all summer had it not been for the
crowds of tiresome people that were eternally coming and going and
the great labour of climbing up and down the stairs however i was so
greatly pleased with what i saw both at niagara and along the way
that i should have repeated my travels in after years as the most
agreeable way of passing time had it not been for the dangers and
miseries of such enterprises for first the coaches were perpetually
falling over or sticking in the mud or jolting over stones so that
one had no security of life or limb and secondly the accommodations
at the inns along the road were not to my liking the food being cooked
after the primitive systems of shem ham and japheth and the beds
stuck together in the rooms as if for boys at a boarding-school it
is possible that these things are better ordered now but from what
i have since seen and heard i am of opinion there is a fine field
for cooks carpenters and chamber-maids in the agricultural regions
of america in those days i loved ease and comfort too well to submit
to such evils as could be avoided and accordingly after a little
experience in the matter i ceased travelling altogether the pleasures
bearing no sort of proportion to the discomforts

my time still weighing upon my hands i was possessed with a sudden
idea which my steward however endeavoured to combat namely
that the tedium of my existence might be dispelled by matrimony and
i resolved to look around me for a wife after much casting about
i fixed my eyes upon a young lady of the village for i must inform
the reader that my farm was on the skirts of a village and a very
respectable one too although there were many lazy people in it who
i thought was well fitted to make me comfortable and as she did not
seem averse to my first advances i began to be quite particular until
all the old women in the country declared it was a match and all the
young fellows of my own age as well as all the girls i knew became
extremely witty at my expense these things however rather encouraged
me than otherwise i believed i was advancing my happiness by the
change i contemplated in my condition and i was just on the point of
making formal proposals to the young lady when an accident set me to
considering the enterprise entirely in a new light

my charmer lived in the house of a married sister who had a large
family of children--a pack of the most ill-bred imps i verily
believe that were ever gathered together in any one man's house but
for politeness sake during the first weeks of my courtship the young
sinners were kept out of my way and what with cuffing and feeding
with sugarplums were preserved in some sort of order so that i was
not annoyed by them after a while however and when matters had
proceeded some length it was thought unnecessary to treat me longer
as a stranger the children were suffered to take care of themselves
and the consequence was that in a short time i found myself in a
kind of pandemonium whenever i entered the house with such a whining
and squeaking and tumbling and bawling and fighting among the young
ones as greatly discomposed my nerves and to make the matter worse
the mother made no difficulty at times when the squabbling grew to a
height of taking a switch to one and boxing the ears of another and
scolding roundly at a third to reduce them to order and all this in
my presence and under the nose of my charmer

i began to fancy the married life could not be altogether so agreeable
as i had pictured it to my imagination and in this belief i was
confirmed by a visit to my sister who had three children of her own
all of whom as i now perceived for i had not noticed it before
having no particular inducement to make me observant were given to
squabbling and bawling just like other children while my sister did
her share of boxing and scolding i thought to myself what should i
do with a dozen children squeaking all day and night in my house and a
scolding wife dragooning them into submission

the thought disconcerted me and the fear of such a consummation
greatly chilled the ardour of my affection so that the young lady
observing my backwardness and taking offence at it cast her eyes upon
another wooer who had made her an offer and to my great satisfaction
married him on the spot

i was never more relieved in my life and i resolved to reflect longer
upon the subject before making advances of that nature a second time
my overseer who had from the first for i made him my confidant been
opposed to the match on the ground that i ought to enjoy my liberty
at least until i was thirty was greatly rejoiced at the rupture and
swore that i had made a lucky escape for he had always thought in his
own mind that the lady was at bottom though she concealed it from
me a tartar and fire-eater in this however he was mistaken for
from all i have heard of her since she has proved a most amiable and
sweet-tempered woman and her husband is said to be very happy with her




chapter iv


how to conduct a farm to the best advantage and steer clear of the
lawyers


it is not my intention to dwell longer upon the history of this period
of my life nor to recount in detail how my easy and indolent temper at
last proved the ruin of me i gave myself up to laziness neglecting
my affairs to such a degree that they soon became seriously entangled
and to make a long story short i found myself before i had completed
my twenty-eighth year reduced from independence and almost affluence
to a condition bordering upon actual poverty my farm under the
management of mr aikin jones for that was my steward's name went
gradually to ruin my orchards rotted away without being replanted my
meadows were converted into swamps my corn-fields filled with gullies
my improvements fell into decay and my receipts began to run short of
my expenses then came borrowing and mortgaging and by-and-by the
sale of this piece of land to remove the encumbrance upon that
until i suddenly found myself in the condition of my father when he
began the world that is to say the master of a little farm of forty
acres--the centre and nucleus of the fifteen hundred which he had
got possession of and bequeathed to me but which had so soon slipped
through my fingers there was this difference however between us the
land when my father obtained it was in good condition it was now
so well had it prospered under jones's hands entirely worn out and
empoverished and not worth a fourth part of its original value

to add to my chagrin i discovered that mr aikin jones whom i had
treated rather as a friend than servant had abused my confidence in
other words that he was a rogue and villain who had taken advantage
of my disinclination to business and my ignorance as i believe i
must call it to swindle me out of my property which he had the best
opportunities to do whether he effected his purpose by employing
my own funds or not i cannot say but it is very certain all the
different mortgages in which i was entangled came some how or other
by hook and by crook into his hands and he took care to make the
best use of them in a word mr jones became a rich man and i a poor
one and i had the satisfaction every day when i took a walk over my
forty-acre farm as the place was familiarly called though the true
name was watermelon hill to find myself stopped which way soever i
directed my steps by the possessions of mr aikin jones my old friend
and overseer whom i often saw roll by in his carriage while i was
trudging along through the mud

at the same time that i met with this heavy misfortune i had to endure
others that were vexatious enough my brother-in-law and sister had
their suspicions of mr jones and often cautioned me against him
though in vain--not that i had any very superstitious reliance on the
gentleman's integrity but because i could not endure the trouble of
examining into his proceedings and accounts and chose therefore to
believe him honest this and my general indolence and indifference to
my affairs incensed them both to that degree that my sister did not
scruple to tell me to my face that i had lost all the little sense i
ever possessed while my brother-in-law took the freedom of saying of
me in public that i was wrong in the upper story--in other words
that i was mad and he had the insolence to hint that it ran in my
blood--that i had inherited it from my mother she as i mentioned
before having lost her mind before her decease i was so much
irritated by these insults on their part that i quarrelled with them
both though by no means of a testy or choleric disposition and it was
many years before we were reconciled having therefore neither friends
nor family i was left to bear my misfortunes alone which was a great
aggravation of them all




chapter v


the author finds himself in trouble--some account of his servant
honest james jumble


i have always described myself as of an easy contented disposition
and such i was born but misfortune produces sad changes in our
tempers as it was soon my lot to experience before however i
describe the change that took place in mine it is fit i should let the
reader understand to what condition i was reduced by the perfidy of
jones--or as i should rather say by my own culpable neglect of my
affairs

my whole landed possessions consisted of a farm of forty acres which
i had after the fashion of some of my richer neighbours in other
states suffered to fall into the most wretched condition imaginable
my meadow-lands being broken in upon by the river and neglected
were converted into quagmires reed-brakes and cat-tail patches the
only use of which was to shelter wild-fowl and mire cattle however
my live-stock was scanty enough and the only sufferers were my
neighbours whose cows easily made their way through my fences and
stuck fast in the mud at their pleasure my fields were overgrown
here with mullein and st john's-wort and there with sand-burs and
poke-berries my orchards were in an equally miserable condition--the
trees being old rotten or worm-eaten half of them torn down by
the winds and the remainder fit for nothing but fire-wood my barn
was almost roofless and as for a stable i had so little occasion
for one that my old negro-man jim of whom i shall have more to say
hereafter or his wife dinah or both together thinking they could
do nothing better with it helped the winds to tear it to pieces
especially in the winter when it formed a very convenient wood-pile
my dwelling-house was also suffering from decay it was originally a
small frame building but my father had added to it one portion after
another until it became spacious and the large porches in front and
on the rear gave it quite a genteel janty air but this it could not
long keep the sun and rain gradually drove the white paint from the
exterior and the damps getting inside the fine paper-hangings pied
and spotted peeled from the walls the window-frames rotted and the
glasses left them one after another and one day in a storm one half
the front porch tumbled down and the remainder which i propped up as
well as i could had a mighty mean and poverty-stricken appearance
the same high wind carried away one of my chimneys which falling on
a corner of the roof crushed that into the garret and left one whole
gable-end in ruins

it must not be supposed that my property presented altogether this
wretched appearance at the moment of my losses it was in truth bad
enough then but i am now describing it as it appeared some few years
after when my miseries were accumulated in the greatest number and i
was just as poor as i could be

in all this period of trouble and vexation i had but one friend if i
dare call him such though i should have been glad half the time to be
rid of him this was my negro-man jim or jim jumble as he was called
of whom i spoke before--an old fellow that had been a slave of my
father and was left to me in his will he was a crabbed self-willed
old fellow whom i could never manage but who would have all things
his own way in spite of me as i had some scruples of conscience about
holding a slave and thought him of no value whatever but on the
contrary a great trouble i resolved to set him free and accordingly
mentioned my design to him when to my surprise he burst into a
passion swore he would not be free and told me flatly i was his
master and i should take care of him and the absurd old fool ended by
declaring if i made him a free man he would have the law of me he
would by ge-hosh

i never could well understand the cause of his extreme aversion to
being made free but i suppose having got the upper hand of me and
being wise enough to perceive the difference between living on the one
hand a lazy life without any care whatever as my slave and on the
other labouring hard to obtain a precarious subsistence as a free man
he was determined to stick by me to the last whether i would or not
some little affection for me as i had grown up from a boy as it were
under his own eye was perhaps at the bottom of his resolution but if
there were it was of a strange quality as he did nothing but scold
and grumble at me all day long i remember in particular that when
the match i spoke of before was broken off and he had heard of it he
came to me in a great passion and insolently asked what i meant by
courting a wife who would be a good mistress to him and not marrying
her and on my condescending to explain the reasons of my change of
mind he told me plumply i had no more sense than a nigger for women
was women and children children and he was tired living so long in a
house with none but me and massa jones for company

i suppose it was old jim's despair of my ever marrying that put him
upon taking a wife himself for one day not long after i was reduced
to the forty-acre farm he brought home a great ugly free negro-woman
named dinah whom he installed into the kitchen without the least
ceremony and without so much as even informing me of his intention
having observed her two or three times and seeing her at last come
bouncing into the dinner-room to wait on me i asked her who she was
and what she wanted to which she answered she was jim's wife and
jim had sent her in to take care of me

it was in this way the old rascal used me it was in vain to complain
he gave me to understand in his own language he knew what was what
and there was no possuming an old nigger like him and if i had made
him overseer instead of massa jones it would have been all the
better for me

and in truth i believe it would for jim would never have cheated
me except on a small scale and if he had done no work himself it is
very certain he would have made everybody else work for he was a hard
master when he had anybody under him

i may here observe and i will do the old fellow the justice
to confess that i found him exceedingly useful during all my
difficulties what labour was bestowed upon the farm was bestowed
almost altogether by him and his wife dinah it is true he did just
what he liked and without consulting me--planting and harvesting and
even selling what he raised as if he were the master and owner of all
things and laying out what money he obtained by the sales just as his
own wisdom prompted and finding i could do nothing better i even let
him have his own way and it was perhaps to my advantage that i did

but i grew poorer and poorer notwithstanding and at that period
which i shall ever be inclined to consider as the true beginning of my
eventful life i was reduced almost to the point of despair for my
necessities had compelled me to mortgage the few miserable acres i had
left and i saw nothing but utter ruin staring me in the face




chapter vi


sheppard lee experiences his share of the respect that is accorded to
honest poverty--his ingenious and highly original devices to amend
his fortune


it may be asked why i made no efforts to retrieve my fortunes i
answer to that that i made many but was so infatuated that i never
once thought of resorting to the most obvious rational and only
means that is to say of cultivating with industry my forty acres as
my father had done before me this idea so sluggish was my mind or so
confused by its distresses never once occurred to me or if it did
it presented so many dreary images and so long a prospect of dull and
disagreeable labour that i had not the spirit to pursue it the little
toil i was forced to endure--for my necessities now compelled me at
times to work with my own hands--appeared to me intolerably irksome
and i was glad to attempt any thing else that seemed to promise me good
luck and did not require positive labour

the first plan of bettering my fortune that i conceived was to buy
some chances in a lottery which i thought an easy way of making money
as indeed it is when a man can make any i had my trouble for my
pains with just as many blanks as i had bought tickets upon which i
began to see clearly that adventuring in a lottery was nothing short of
gambling as it really is and so i quitted it

i then resolved to imitate the example of a neighbour who had made
a great sum of money by buying and selling to advantage stock in a
southern gold-mining company and being very sanguine of success i
devoted all the money i could scrape together to the purpose and that
so wisely that a second instalment being suddenly demanded i had
nothing left to discharge it with and no means of raising any the
consequence of which was that i was forced to sell at the worst time
in the world and retired from the concern with just one fifth the sum
i had invested in it i saw then that i had no talent for speculating
and i began to have my doubts whether stock-jobbing was not just as
clear gambling as horse-racing and lottery speculation

i tried some ten or a dozen other projects with a view to better my
condition but as i came off with the same luck from all i do not
think it necessary to mention them i will however state as a proof
how much my difficulties had changed my mind on that subject that
one of them was of a matrimonial character my horror of squabbling
children and scolding wives melted away before the prospect of sheriffs
and executions and there being a rich widow in the neighbourhood
i bought me a new coat and made her a declaration but it was too
late in the day for me as i soon discovered for besides giving me
a flat refusal she made a point of revealing the matter to all her
acquaintance who did nothing but hold me up to ridicule

i found that my affairs were falling into a desperate condition and
not knowing what else to do i resolved to turn politician with the
hope of getting some office or other that might afford me a comfortable
subsistence

this was the maddest project that ever possessed my brain but it was
some time before i came to that conclusion but in truth from having
been the easiest and calmest tempered man in the world i was now
become the most restless and discontented and incapable of judging
what was wise and what foolish i reflected one day that of my old
school and college mates who were still alive there was not one who
had not made some advance in the world while i had done nothing but
slip backwards it was the same thing with dozens of people whom i
remembered as poor farmers boys with none of the advantages i had
possessed but who had outstripped me in the road to fortune some
being now rich cultivators some wealthy manufacturers and merchants
while two or three had got into the legislature and were made much
of in the newspapers one of my old companions had emigrated to the
mississippi where he was now a cotton-planter with a yearly revenue
of twenty or thirty thousand dollars another had become a great
lawyer in an adjacent state and a third whom i always thought a
very shallow ignorant fellow and who was as poor as a rat to boot
had turned doctor settled down in the village and besides getting
a great practice had married the richest and finest girl in all the
county there was no end to the number of my old acquaintances who had
grown wealthy and distinguished and the more i thought of them the
more discontented i became

my dissatisfaction was increased by discovering with what little
respect i was held among these happy people the doctor used to treat
me with a jocular sort of familiarity which i felt to be insulting
the lawyer who had eaten many a dinner at my table when i was able to
invite him began to make me low bows instead of shaking hands with
me and the cotton-planter who had been my intimate friend at college
coming to the village on a visit to his relations stared me fiercely
in the face when i approached him and with a lordly hum--ha asked me
who the devil i might be as for the others they treated me with as
little consideration and i began to perceive very plainly that i had
got into the criminal stage of poverty for all men were resolved to
punish me it is no wonder that poverty is the father of crime since
the poor man sees himself treated on all hands as a culprit

i had never before envied a man for enjoying more consideration in
the world than myself but the discovery that i was looked upon with
contempt filled me with a new subject for discontent i envied my
richer neighbours not only for being rich but for being what they
considered themselves my superiors in standing i may truly say i
scarce ever saw in those days a man with a good coat on his back
without having a great desire to beat him but as i was a peaceable
man my anger never betrayed me into violence




chapter vii


the author becomes a politician and seeks for an office--the result
of that project


my essay in politics was soon made i spent a whole week in finding
out who were the principal office-holders candidates and busybodies
both in the state and the general governments and which were the
principal parties there being so many that an honest man might easily
make a mistake among them being satisfied on these points i chose
the strongest party on the principle that the majority must always be
right and attended the first public meeting that was held where i
clapped my hands and applauded the speeches with so much spirit that
i was taken notice of and highly commended by several of the principal
leaders in truth i pleased them so well that they visited me at my
house and encouraged me to take a more prominent part in the business
of politics and this i did for at the next meeting i got up and
made a speech but what it was about i know no more than the man in
the moon otherwise i would inform the reader my only recollection of
it is that there was great slashing at the banks and aristocrats that
ground the faces of the poor for i was on what our opponents called
the hurrah side and these were the things we talked about i received
uncommon applause and in fact there was such a shouting and clapping
of hands that i was obliged to put an end to my discourse sooner than
i intended

but i found myself in great favour with the party and being advised
by the leaders who considered i had a talent that way to set about
converting all i knew in the county who were not of our party and they
hinting that i should certainly in case the county was gained for our
county happened to be a little doubtful at that time be appointed
to the postoffice in the village i mounted my old horse julius
cesar and set out with greater zeal than i had ever shown in my life
before i visited everybody that i knew and a great many that i did
not know and wherever i went i held arguments and made speeches
with a degree of industry that surprised myself for certainly i was
never industrious before it is certain also that there was never a
labourer in the field of politics that better deserved his reward--
never a soldier of the party ranks that had won a better right to a
share in the spoils of victory i do not pretend to say indeed that
i converted anybody to our belief for all seemed to have made up
their minds beforehand and i never yet knew or heard of a man that
could be argued out of his politics who had once made up his mind on
the subject i laboured however and that with astonishing zeal and
as i paid my own expenses and treated all thirsty souls that seemed
approachable in that way to good liquor i paid a good round sum
that i could ill spare for the privilege of electioneering and was
therefore satisfied that my claim to office would hold good

and so it did as was universally allowed by all the party but the
conviction of its justice was all i ever gained in reward of my
exertions the battle was fought and won the party was triumphant
and i was just rejoicing in the successful termination of my hopes
when they were blasted by the sudden appointment of another to the very
office which i considered my own that other was one of the aforesaid
leaders who had been foremost in commending my zeal and talents and
in assuring me that the office should be mine

i was confounded petrified enraged the duplicity and perfidy of my
new friends filled me with indignation it was evident they must all
have joined in recommending my rival to the office for he was a man
of bad character who must without such recommendations have missed
his aim all therefore had recommended him and all had promised their
suffrages to me the scoundrels said i to myself i perceived that
i had fallen among thieves it was clear that no party could be in the
right which was led by such unprincipled men there was corruption at
the heart of the whole body the party consisted of rogues who were
gaping after the loaves and fishes their honesty was a song--their
patriotism a farce in a word i found i had joined the wrong party
and i resolved to go over to the other sincerely repenting the
delusion that had made me so long the advocate of wrong and deception

but fortune willed otherwise i had arrived at the crisis of my fate
and before i could put my purpose into execution i was suddenly
involved in that tissue of adventure which i have no doubt will be
considered the most remarkable that ever befell a human being



chapter viii


a description of the owl-roost with mr jumble's ideas in relation to
captain kid's money


for five mortal days i remained at home chewing the bone of
reflection and a hard bone it was on the sixth there came a villanous
constable with a--the reader may suppose what i struck a bargain with
him and he took his leave and julius cesar also saddle bridle and
all whereby i escaped an introduction to the nearest justice of the
peace the next visit i had good reason to apprehend would be from
the sheriff for having failed to pay up the interest on the mortgage
the mortgagee had discoursed and that in no very mysterious strain
on the virtues of a writ of venditioni exponas or some other absurd
and scoundrelly invention of the lawyers i was at my wits end and
i wished that i was a dog in which case i should have gone mad and
bitten the new post-master and all his friends

very well said i to myself the forty-acre is no longer mine i
clapped on my hat and walked into the open air resolved to take a
look at it before the sheriff came to convince me it belonged to some
other person as i passed from the door i looked up to the broken
porch may it fall on the head of my successor i said

it was a summer eve--a day in july but a raw wind blew from the
northeast and the air was as chill as in november i buttoned my coat
and as i did so took a peep at my elbows i required no second look to
convince me that i was a poor man

the ruined meadows of which i have spoken lie on a little creek that
makes in from the delaware their shape is the worst in the world
being that of a triangle the longest leg of which lies on the water
hence the expense of embanking them is formidable--a circumstance for
which the muskrats have no consideration the apex of the angle is a
bog lying betwixt two low hillocks or swells of ground between which
crawls a brook scarce deep enough to swim a tadpole though an ox may
hide in the mud at the bottom it oozes from a turfy ledge or bar a
few feet higher than the general level of the hollow which terminates
above it in a circular basin of two acres in area this circular
basin is verdant enough to the eye the whole surface being covered
by a thick growth of alders arrow-wood water-laurels and other
shrubs that flourish in a swamp as well as a bountiful sprinkling of
cat-tails on the edges the soil is a vegetable jelly and how any
plant of a pound in weight could ever sustain itself on it i never was
able to comprehend it is thought to be the nearest road to the heart
of the chinese empire to find which all that is necessary to do is
to take a plunge into it head foremost and keep on until you arrive at
daylight among the antipodes

the whole place has a solitary and mournful appearance which is to
many made still more dreary and even sepulchral by the appearance of
a little old church built by the swedes many a year ago but now in
ruins and the graveyard around it these being but a short distance
off and on the east side of the hollow the spot is remote from my
dwelling and apparently from all others nevertheless there is a small
farmhouse--it was once mine--on a by-road not many rods from the old
church a path not often trodden leads from my house to the by-road
and crosses the hollow by the grassy ledge spoken of before it is the
shortest path to the village and i sometimes pursued it when walking
thither

this lonesome spot had a very bad name in our neighbourhood and was
considered to be haunted its common name was the owl-roost given
it in consequence of the vast numbers of these birds that perched
and i believe nested in the centre of the swamp where was a place
comparatively dry or supposed to be so for i believe no one ever
visited it and a clump of trees larger than those in other places
some called the place captain kid's hole after that famous pirate who
was supposed to have buried his money there as he is supposed to have
buried it in a hundred thousand other dismal spots along the different
rivers of america old jim jumble was a devout believer in the story
and often tried his luck in digging for the money but without success
which he attributed to the circumstance of his digging in the daytime
whereas midnight was in his opinion the only true time to delve for
charmed treasure but midnight was the period when the ghosts came down
from the old graveyard to squeak about the swamp and i never heard of
jim being found in that neighbourhood after nightfall the truth is
the owls never hear any one go by after dark without saluting him with
a horrible chorus of hooting and screeching that will make a man's
hair rise on his head and i have been sometimes daunted by them myself

to this place i directed my steps and being very melancholy i sat
down at the foot of a beech-tree that grew near the path i thought
of the owls and the ghosts and of captain kid into the bargain and
i marvelled to myself whether there could be any foundation for the
belief that converted such nooks into hiding-places for his ill-gotten
gold while i thought over the matter i began to wish the thing could
be true and that some good spirit might direct me to the spot where
the money lay hid for sure enough no one in the world had greater
necessity for it than i i conned over the many stories that old jim
had told me about the matter as well as all the nonsensical ceremonies
that were to be performed and the divers ridiculous dangers to be
encountered by those who sought the treasure all which were mere
notions that had entered his absurd head but which he had pondered
over so often and long that he believed they had been told him by
others

the great difficulty according to his belief and a necessary
preliminary to all successful operations was first to discover exactly
the spot where the treasure lay buried and indeed this seemed to
be a very needful preliminary the discovery was to be made only by
dreaming of the spot three nights in succession as to dreaming twice
that was nothing jim had twenty times dreamed two nights together that
he had fallen upon the spot but upon digging it discovered nothing
having been so lucky as to dream of a place three successive nights
then the proper way to secure the treasure as he told me would be
to select a night when the moon was at the full and begin digging
precisely at twelve o'clock saying the lord's prayer backwards all
the time till the money was found and here lay the danger a single
blunder in the prayer and wo betide the devotee for the devil who
would be standing by all the time would that moment pounce upon his
soul and carry it away in a flame of brimstone




chapter ix


sheppard lee stumbles upon a happy man and quarrels with him


while i sat pondering over these matters and wondering whether i
could say the prayer backwards and doubting for to my shame be
it spoken i had not often of late years said it forward i
heard a gun go off in the meadow and rising and walking that way
i discovered a sportsman who had just shot a woodcock which his dog
carried to him in his mouth i knew the gunner at first sight to be a
gentleman of philadelphia by the name of higginson a brewer who was
reputed to be very wealthy and who had several times before visited
our neighbourhood for the purpose of shooting i knew little of him
except his name having never spoken to him the neighbours usually
addressed him as squire though i knew not for what reason he was a
man of forty or forty-five years old somewhat fat and portly but with
a rosy hearty complexion looking the very personification of health
and content and indeed as i gazed at him strolling up and down with
his dog and gun i thought i had never before seen such a picture of
happiness

but the sight only filled me with gloom and anger here said i to
myself is a man rich and prosperous who passes his whole life in an
amusement that delights him goes whither he likes does what he will
eats drinks and is merry and the people call him squire wherever
he goes i wish i were he for surely he is the happiest man in the
world

while i pondered thus regarding him with admiration and hatred
together a bird rose at his feet and he shot it and the next moment
another which he served in the same way

i noted the exultation expressed in his countenance and i was filled
with a sudden fury i strode up to him while he was recharging his
piece and as i approached him he looked up and gave me a nod of so
much complacency and condescension together that it rendered me ten
times madder than ever

sir said i looking him full in the face before you shoot
any more birds here answer me a question who do you go for--the
administration or the opposition

this was a very absurd way of beginning a conversation with a stranger
but i was in such a fury i scarce knew what i said he gave me a stare
and then a smile and nodding his head good-humouredly replied

oh for the administration to be sure

you do sir i rejoined shaking my fist at him then sir let me
tell you sir you belong to a scoundrelly party and are a scoundrel
yourself sir and so sir walk off my place or i'll prosecute you
for a trespass

you insolent ragamuffin said he

ragamuffin was i sunk so low that a man trespassing on my own
property could call me ragamuffin

you poor miserable shote--

so degraded that i could be called a pig

you half-starved old sand-field jersey kill-deer--

a jersey kill-deer

you vagabond you beggar you dicky dout--

i was struck dumb by the multitude and intensity of his epithets and
before i could recover speech he shouldered his gun snapped his
fingers in my face and whistling to his dog walked off the ground
before he had gone six steps however he turned round gave me a hard
look and bursting into a laugh exclaimed tapping his forehead as he
spoke--

poor fellow you're wrong in your upper story

with that he resumed the path and crossed over to the old church
where i lost sight of him

wrong in my upper story it was the very phrase which tom alderwood
my brother-in-law had applied to me and which had given me such
mortal offence that i had never forgiven him and had refused to be
reconciled even when as my difficulties began to thicken about me
he came to offer me his assistance wrong in my upper story i was
so much confounded by the man's insolence that i remained rooted to
the spot until he had got out of sight and then not knowing what else
to do i returned home when i had a visit from old jim who entered
the apartment and not knowing i had sold my horse cried out massa
sheppard want money to shoe julius cesar morrow morning blacksmith
swear no trust no more

go to the devil you old rascal said i in a rage

guess i will said jim shaking his head follow hard after massa

that insinuation which struck me as being highly appropriate was
all i got for supper for it was jim's way when i offended him of an
afternoon to sneak off taking dinah with him and thus leave me to
shift for myself during the whole night as i could there was never a
more tyrannical old rascal than jim jumble




chapter x


sheppard lee has an extraordinary dream which promises to be more
advantageous than any of his previous ones


i went therefore supperless to bed but i dreamed of captain kid's
money and the character of my dream was quite surprising i thought
that my house had fallen down in a high wind as indeed it was like
enough to do and that i was sitting on a broken chair before the
ruins when squire higginson made his appearance looking however
like a dead man for his face was pale and he was swathed about with
a winding-sheet instead of a gun he carried a spade in his hand and
a great black pig followed at his heels in place of his dog he came
directly towards me and looking me full in the face said sheppard
lee what are you doing here but i was struck with fear and could
make no reply with that he spoke again saying the sheriff is
coming to levy on your property get up therefore and follow me
so saying he began to walk away whistling to the pig which ran at
his heels like a dog and i found myself impelled to follow him he
took the path to the owl-roost and arriving there came to a pause
saying sheppard lee you are a poor man and eaten up with discontent
but i am your friend and you shall have all your wishes he then
turned to the pig which was rooting under a gum-tree and blowing his
whistle said black pig show me some game or i'll trounce you
and immediately the pig began to run about snuffing and snorting and
coursing like a dog so that it was wonderful to behold him at last
the squire growing impatient and finding fault with the animal's ill
success for he discovered nothing took a whip from under his shroud
and fell to beating him after which the pig hunted more to his liking
and having coursed about us for a while ran up to the beech-tree
under which i had sat the day before and began with snout and hoof to
tear up the earth at its roots oho said squire higginson i never
knew black pig to deceive me we shall have fine sport now then
putting the spade into my hands he bade me dig exhorting me to be of
good heart for i was now to live a new life altogether but before i
struck the spade into the earth he drew a mark on the ground to guide
me and the figure was precisely that of a human grave not daunted
by this circumstance for in my dream it appeared natural enough i
began to dig and after throwing out the earth to a depth just equal
to the length of the spade i discovered an iron coffin the lid of
which was in three pieces and not being fastened in any way was
therefore easily removed judge of my transports when having lifted
up the piece in the middle i found the whole coffin full of gold and
silver some in the form of ancient coins but the most of it in bars
and ingots i would have lifted up the whole coffin and carried it
away at once but that was impossible i therefore began to fill my
pockets my hat my handkerchief and even my bosom until the squire
bade me cease telling me i should visit the treasure at the same hour
on the following night i then replaced the iron cover and threw the
earth again into the grave as the squire commanded and then leaving
him and running home as hard as i could in fear lest some one should
see me i fell into a miry place where i was weighed down by the mass
of gold i had about me and smothered in the midst of my dying agonies
i awoke and found that all was a dream

ah how much torment a poor man has dreaming of riches the dream made
me very melancholy and i went moping about all that day wishing
myself anybody or any thing but that i was and hiding in the woods at
the sight of any one who chanced to pass by for i thought everybody
was the sheriff i went to bed the following night in great disorder of
spirit and had no sooner closed my eyes than i dreamed the same dream
over again the squire made his appearance as before led me to the
owl-roost and set the black pig hunting until the grave was found in
a word the dream did not vary in a single particular from that i had
had the night before and when i woke up the next day the surprise
of such an occurrence filled me with new and superstitious ideas and
i awaited the next night with anxious expectations resolved if the
dream should be repeated again to go dig at the place and see what
should come of it

remembering what old jim had said in regard to the full of the moon
i went to a neighbour's to look at his almanack for i had none of my
own and discovered to my unspeakable surprise and agitation though
i had half known it before that the moon we then had would be at her
full between ten and eleven o'clock on the following morning

such a coincidence betwixt the time of my dreams and the proper period
for hunting the treasure since at the full moon was the proper time
was enough of itself to excite my expectations and the identity
between the two visions was so extraordinary that i began to believe
that the treasure did really exist in the owl-roost which being very
solitary and yet conveniently accessible from the river through the
medium of the creek was one of the best hiding-places in the world
and that i was the happy man destined to obtain it

i went to bed accordingly the third night with a strong persuasion that
the vision would be repeated i was not disappointed i found myself
again digging at the beech-roots and scraping up great wedges of gold
and silver from the iron coffin what was remarkable in this dream
however was that when i had picked up as much as i could carry the
squire nodded to me and said now sheppard lee you know the way to
captain kid's treasure and you can come to-morrow night by yourself
and what was further observable i did not dream of falling into a
miry place on this occasion but arrived safely home and beheld with
surprise and delight that my house which i had left in ruins was
standing up more beautiful than ever it had been newly painted from
top to bottom and the pillars of the porch were gilded over and
shining like gold

while enjoying this agreeable prospect i awoke and such was the
influence of the vision on my mind and the certain belief i now
cherished that the vast treasure was mine--a whole coffinful of gold
and silver--that i fell to shouting and dancing so that old jim
jumble who ran up into my chamber to see what was the matter was
persuaded i had gone mad and began to blubber and scold and take on
in the most diverting way in the world

i pacified him as well as i could but resolved to keep my secret until
i could surprise him with the sight of my treasure all collected
together in the house and i proceeded without delay to make such
preparations as were proper for the coming occasion i took a spade and
mattock and carried them to the hollow where i hid them among the
bushes but this i found difficult to do as secretly as i wished for
old jim either from suspecting what i was after or believing i had
lost my mind kept dogging me about so that it was near midday before
i succeeded in giving him the slip and carrying my tools to the hollow




chapter xi


in which the reader is introduced to a personage who may claim his
acquaintance hereafter


in this place to my dismay i stumbled upon a man who from the
character he had in the neighbourhood i was afraid was hunting the
treasure as well as myself he was an old german doctor called
feuerteufel which extraordinary name as i had been told signified
in german fire-devil he had come to our village about two weeks
before and nobody knew for what reason all day long he wandered about
among the woods swamps and marshes collecting plants and weeds
stones animals and snakes which he seemed to value very highly
some thought he was a counterfeiter in disguise and others called
him a conjurer many were of opinion he was hunting for gold-mines
or precious stones while others had their thoughts and said he was
the devil his appearance being somewhat grim and forbidding as for
myself having lighted upon him once or twice in the woods i did not
know what to think of him but i did not like his looks he was very
tall and rawboned with long arms and immense big hands his skin was
extremely dark and pock-marked and he had a mouth that ran from ear to
ear and long bushy black hair his eyes were like saucers and deep
sunk in their sockets with tremendous big black eyebrows ever frowning
above them and what made him look remarkable was that although he was
ever frowning with his eyes his mouth was as continually grinning in
a sort of laugh such as you see in a man struck with a palsy in the
head he was the terror of all the children and it was said the dogs
never barked at him

i found him in the hollow hard by the beech-tree and had scarce
time to fling my implements among the bushes before he saw me he was
standing looking over towards the old church where there was a funeral
procession for that morning the neighbours were burying a young man
that had taken laudanum for love two days before but had only expired
the previous evening

as soon as the german beheld me he started like a guilty man
and made as if he would have run away but suddenly changing his
mind he stepped towards me and just as we met he stooped down and
pulled a flower that struck his eye then rising up he grinned at
me and nodding said gooten morrow mine prudder it ish gooten
dag--though what he meant by gooten dag i know no more than the
man in the moon having never studied german i did not at all like his
appearance in this spot at such a time but i reflected at last that he
was only culling simples and had paused near the beech-tree to look
at the funeral as would have been extremely natural in any man but
i liked the appearance of the funeral still less at such a particular
time and i thought there was something ominous in it

but my mind was fixed upon the treasure i was soon to enjoy too firmly
to be long drawn off by any such doleful spectacle and accordingly
having waited impatiently until the attendants on the funeral had
all stalked away as well as the german doctor i stole towards the
beech-tree and surveyed the ground at its roots there were some
stones lying among them which i removed as well as the long grass
that waved over their tops and looking closely i thought i could
see among some of the smaller roots of the tree that were pleached
together on the surface of the earth a sort of arrangement very much
in shape of a grave this was a new proof to me that the treasure lay
below and i considered that my good angel had platted these roots
together in order to direct me in what spot to dig

i could scarce avoid beginning on the instant but i remembered that
was not the hour i therefore concealed my spade and mattock and went
home when the first thing i did was to hunt me up a book that had the
lord's prayer in it for i feared to trust to my memory alone and
write this out backwards with the greatest care and i then spent the
remainder of the day in committing the words to memory in that order
but i found it a difficult task

as the evening drew nigh i found myself growing into such a pitch of
excitement that fearing i should betray the secret to jim jumble who
was constantly prying in upon me i resolved to walk to the village
and there remain until the hour for seeking the treasure should draw
nigh i had another reason for this step for my watch having gone
some month or two before julius cesar to satisfy a hungry fellow to
whom i owed money i knew not how to be certain of the hour unless
by learning it of some one in the village and to the village i
accordingly went soon after sunset




chapter xii


sheppard lee visits the village makes a patriotic speech and leaves
the fence


having arrived at the village i proceeded to a tavern which was the
chief place of resort especially after nightfall for all the idlers
and topers of the town of whom there were great numbers the village
at that time being a place of but little business

i found some ten or a dozen already assembled in the bar-room
drinking brandy smoking chewing talking politics and swearing i
had no sooner entered than some of them who were discoursing loudly
concerning the purity and economy of the government and the honesty of
those who supported it appealed to me my electioneering pilgrimage
through the country having caused me to be looked upon as quite a
knowing politician to assist them in the argument they were holding

remembering the scurvy way in which i had been treated by the party i
felt strongly tempted to give them a piece of my mind on the other side
of the question but i thought of my buried treasure and conceiving
it unwise to begin the quarrel at that time i made them no answer
but sat down in a corner where i hoped to escape observation here i
employed myself conning over the prayer backwards until i was assured
i was perfect in the exercise

i then--still keeping aloof from the company--gave my mind up to a
consideration of what i should do when i had transferred captain kid's
hoards of gold from the coffin to my house

the first thing i resolved to do was to pay my debts which how
greatly soever they oppressed me were not actually very fearful in
amount after which i was determined to rebuild my house restore my
fields to their original condition and go to law with mr aikin jones
who i had no doubt had cheated me out of my property it did not occur
to me that by such a step i should get rid of my second fortune
as expeditiously as i had the first all that i thought on was the
satisfaction of having my revenge on the villain whom i should have
punished in perhaps a more summary way had it not been for my respect
for the laws and my being naturally a peaceable man but i did not
think long of mr jones the idea of the great wealth i was soon to
possess filled my mind and i gave myself up to the most transporting
reveries

from these i was roused by hearing some one near me pronounce the words
captain kid's money--the idea that was uppermost in my own mind
and looking round in a kind of perturbation i saw a knot of people
surrounding feuerteufel the german doctor one of whom was discoursing
on the subject of the treasure in the owl-roost and avowing his
belief that he--that is the german doctor--was conjuring after it
an imputation that gained great credit with the company there being
no other way to account for his visit to our village and his constant
perambulations through the woods and marshes in the neighbourhood of
the owl-roost

the german doctor to my great relief replied to this charge by
expanding his jaws as if he would have swallowed the speaker though he
was guilty of nothing beyond a laugh which was in depth and quality
of tone as if an empty hogshead had indulged in the same diversion
his voice was indeed prodigiously deep and hollow and even his laugh
had something in it solemn and lugubrious mine friends said he in
very bad english i fos can do men creat t'ings put i can no find no
captain kitt's money not at all i toes neffer looks for coldt except
in places fare gott puts it t'at iss in t'a coldt-mines with that
he laughed again and looking upon the people about him with great
contempt he walked up stairs to his chamber--for he lodged in the inn

soon after this occurrence and just when i had sunk again into a
revery a man stepped up to me and saluted me in a way well suited to
startle me

sir said he friend kill-deer before you scratch your head
any more on this bench answer me a question what do you go
for--brandy-toddy or gin-sling

it was squire higginson and he looked very good-humoured and waggish
but as i had dreamed of him so often and always as being in his
grave-clothes i was rather petrified at his appearance as if it were
that of a spectre rather than a mortal man as for our quarrel in the
meadow it had slipped my mind altogether until having recovered
my composure a little it was recalled to my recollection by the
associations arising out of his words

but i remembered the circumstance at last and being moreover offended
by his present freedom which was nothing less than sheer impertinence
i told him i desired to have nothing to say to him on which he fell
into a passion and told me i might go to the devil for a ragamuffin
and a turncoat politician but mad as he was he ended his speech by
bursting into a laugh and then tapping his forehead as before and
nodding his head and winking he left the bar-room to seek his chamber
--for he put up at the tavern as well as the german doctor

these insults threw me into some ferment and being irritated still
farther by the remarks of the company especially when some one asked
what the squire meant by calling me a turncoat politician i allowed
myself to be thrown into a passion in the course of which i gave such
of my old friends as were present to know that i had forsworn their
party and considered it to be composed of a pack of the corruptest
scoundrels in the country

this unexpected denunciation produced a great explosion my old friends
fell upon me tooth and nail as the saying is reviling me as a
traitor and apostate but on the other hand those of the opposition
who happened to be present ranged themselves on my side applauding
my honesty judgment and spirit to such a degree that i was more
than ever convinced i had been on the wrong side i met reproaches
with contempt and threats with defiance opposed words to words
and assertions to assertions for in politics we do not make use
of arguments and finding myself triumphantly victorious i mounted
into a chair and made a speech that was received by my new friends
with roars of applause intoxicated with these marks of approbation
i launched at once into a sea of declamation in which i might have
tossed about during the whole night had i not by chance while balking
for a word rolled my eyes upon the clock that stood opposite to me
in the bar and perceived that it wanted just a quarter of an hour
to twelve o'clock in a moment i forgot every thing but the treasure
that awaited me in the owl-roost i stopped short in the middle of a
sentence took one more look at the clock and then leaping down from
the chair rushed from the tavern without saying a word and to the
amazement of friend and foe ran at full speed out of the village and
this gait i continued until i had reached the old swedes church for i
had taken the footpath that led in that direction




chapter xiii


what befell the author on his way to the owl-roost


as it was now the full of the moon there was of course light enough
for my purpose but the sky was dappled with clouds very dense and
heavy some of which crossing the moon every minute or two there
was a constant alternation of light and darkness so that the trees
and all other objects were constantly changing their appearance now
starting up in bold relief white and silvery from the darkness and
now vanishing again into gloom

a cloud passed over the moon just as i reached the old church and the
wall of the burial-ground having fallen down at a certain place where
the rubbish obstructed the path it was my ill luck to break my shin
against a fragment the pain of which caused me to utter a loud groan
to my amazement and horror this interjection of suffering was echoed
from the grave-yard hard by a voice screaming out in awful tones
o lord o lord and casting my eyes round i beheld as i thought
three or four shapes that i deemed nothing less than devils incarnate
dancing about among the tomb-stones

i was seized with such terror at this sight that forgetting my hurt
and the treasure together i took to my heels and did not cease
running until i had left the church some quarter of a mile behind me
and i am not certain i should have come to a halt then had it not
been my fate to tumble over a cow that lay ruminating on the path
whereby besides half breaking my neck and cruelly scratching my nose
i stunned myself to that degree that it was some two or three minutes
before i was able to rise

i had thus time to recollect myself and reflect that i was running
away from captain kid's money the idea of losing which was not to be
tolerated a moment

but how to get to the owl-roost without falling into the hands of
the devils or spectres at the old church was what gave me infinite
concern the midnight hour--the only one for attempting the treasure
with success--was now close at hand so that there was no time left
me to reach the place by a roundabout course through the woods to the
right or over the meadows to the left i must pass the old church or
i must perhaps give up the treasure

there was no time to deliberate the figures i had seen and the cries
i had heard might have been coinages of my own brain nay the latter
were perhaps after all only the echoes of my own voice distorted
into something terrible by my fears i was not naturally superstitious
and had never before believed in ghosts but i cannot recollect what
precise arguments occurred to me at that moment to cause me to banish
my fears the hope of making my fortune was doubtless the strongest of
all and the moon suddenly shining out with the effulgence almost of
day i became greatly imboldened and in a word set forward again
resolved if met by a second apparition and driven to flight to
fly not backwards but forwards--that is in the direction of the
owl-roost

on this occasion it was my fortune to be saluted by an owl that sat
on the old wall among some bushes and hooted at me as i went by and
notwithstanding that the sound was extremely familiar to my ears i was
thrown into a panic and took to my heels as before though as i had
resolved i ran onward pursuing the path to the swamp it is quite
possible there may have been a crew of imps and disimbodied spirits
jumping among the graves as before but as i had the good fortune to
be frightened before i caught sight of them i did not stop to look for
them and for the same reason i heard no more awful voices shrieking
in my ears i reached the owl-roost and the memorable beech-tree
where the necessity of acting with all speed helped me to get rid of
my terror i knew that i had not a moment to spare and running to the
bushes where i had hidden my mattock and spade i fetched them to the
tree and instantly began to dig not forgetting to pray backwards all
the while as hard as i could






chapter xiv


sheppard lee digs for the buried treasure but makes a blow with the
mattock in the wrong place


i was but an ill hand at labour and of the use of the spade and
mattock i knew nothing the nature of the ground in which i was digging
made the task especially difficult and disagreeable there were
many big stones scattered about in the earth which jarred my arms
horribly whenever i stuck them so that all my efforts to the contrary
notwithstanding i was every minute or two interrupting my prayer
with expressions which were neither wise nor religious but highly
expressive of my torture of body and mind and then i was digging among
the toughest and vilest roots in the world some of which i thought i
should never get through for i had not remembered to provide myself
with an axe and i was afraid to go home for one lest some evil
accident or discovery might rob me of the expected treasure

accordingly i had to do with a tougher piece of labour than i had ever
undertaken before in my whole life and i reckon i worked a full hour
and a half before i had got the hole i was excavating as deep as i
supposed would be necessary i succeeded at last however in throwing
out so much earth that when i measured the depth of the pit with my
spade i found the handle just on a level with the surface of the
ground

but i was not so near the treasure as i supposed i struck my mattock
into the clay scarce doubting that i should hear the ring of the iron
coffin instead of reaching that however i struck a great stone and
with a force that made the mattock-helve fly out of my hands to my
chin which it saluted with a vigour that set all my teeth to rattling
knocking me down into the bargain

having recovered from the effects of this blow i fell to work again
thumping and delving until i had excavated to the depth of at least
five feet my heart began to fail me as well as my strength as i got
so deep into the earth without finding the gold for i began to fear
lest my dreams had after all deceived me in my agitation of mind i
handled my tools so blindly that i succeeded in lodging my mattock
which was aimed furiously at a root among the toes of my right foot
and the pain was so horribly acute that i leaped howling out of the
pit and sinking down upon the grass fell straightway into a trance





chapter xv


in which sheppard lee finds himself in a quandary which the reader will
allow to be the most wonderful and lamentable ever known to a human
being


when i awoke from this trance it was almost daybreak

i recovered in some confusion of mind and did not for a moment notice
that i was moving away from the place of my disaster but i perceived
there was something strange in my feelings and sensations i felt
exceedingly light and buoyant as if a load had been taken not merely
from my mind but from my body it seemed to me as if i had the power
of moving whither i would without exertion and i fancied that i swept
along without putting my feet to the ground nay i had a notion that
i was passing among shrubs and bushes without experiencing from them
any hinderance to my progress whatever i felt no pain in my foot
which i had hit such a violent blow and none in my hands that had
been wofully blistered by my work nor had i the slightest feeling of
weariness or fatigue on the whole my sensations were highly novel and
agreeable but before i had time to analyze them or to wonder at the
change i remembered that i was wandering away from the buried treasure

i returned to the spot but only to be riveted to the earth in
astonishment i saw stretched on the grass just on the verge of the
pit the dead body of a man but what was my horror when perusing the
ashy features in the light of the moon i perceived my own countenance
it was no illusion it was my face my figure and dressed in my
clothes and the whole presented the appearance of perfect death

the sight was as bewildering as it was shocking and the whole state
of things was not more terrifying than inexplicable there i lay on
the ground stiff and lifeless and here i stood on my feet alive
and surveying my own corpse stretched before me but i forgot my
extraordinary duality in my concern for myself--that is to say for
that part of me that eidolon or representative or duplicate of me
that was stretched on the grass i stooped down to raise the figure
from the earth in an instinctive desire to give myself aid but in
vain i could not lift the body it did not seem to me that i could
even touch it--my fingers strive as i might i could not bring into
contact with it

my condition or conditions for i was no longer of the singular
number at this time can be understood only by comparing my confusion
of senses and sensations to that which occurs in a dream when one
beholds himself dead surveys his body and philosophizes or laments
and is all the time to all intents and purposes without being
surprised at it two persons one of which lives and observes while
the other is wholly defunct thus i was or appeared to be without
bestowing any reflection upon such an extraordinary circumstance or
being even conscious of it two persons in one of which i lived but
forgot my existence while trembling at the death that had overcome
me in the other my true situation i did not yet comprehend nor
even dream of though it soon turned out to be natural enough and i
understood it

i was entirely overcome with horror at my unfortunate condition and
seeing that i was myself unable to render myself any assistance i ran
upon an impulse of instinct to the nearest quarter where it was to be
obtained this was at the cottage or little farmhouse which i spoke
of before as standing on the by-road a little beyond the old church
it was occupied by a man named turnbuckle whom i knew very well and
who was a very industrious honest man although a tenant of mr aikin
jones

i arrived at his house in an amazingly short space of time rather
flying as it seemed to me through the air than running over the
marsh and up the rugged hill it was the gray of the morning when i
reached his house and the family was just stirring within as i ran
towards the door his dogs of which he had a goodly number as is
common with poor men set up a dismal howling clapped their tails
between their legs and sneaked off among the bushes a thing that
surprised me much for they were usually very savage of temper i
called to turnbuckle by name and that in a voice so piteous that in
half a minute he and his eldest son came tumbling out of the house
in the greatest haste and wonder no sooner however had they cast
eyes on me than they uttered fearful cries the old man fell flat on
his face as if in a fit and the son ran back into the house as if
frightened out of his senses

help me thomas turnbuckle said i i am lying dead under the
beech-tree in the hollow come along and give me help

but the old man only answered by groaning and crying and at that
moment the door opened and his eldest son appeared with a gun which
he fired at me to my inexpressible terror

but if i was frightened at this how much more was i horrified when the
old man leaping up at the discharge roared out o lord a ghost a
ghost and ran into the house

i perceived it all in a moment the howling of the dogs which they
still kept up from among the bushes--the fear of turnbuckle and
his family all of whom old and young male and female were now
squeaking in the house as if old nick had got among them--my being
in two places together and a thousand other circumstances that now
occurred to me apprized me of the dreadful fact which i had not
before suspected i was a dead man--my body lay in the marsh under the
beech-tree and it was my spirit that was wandering about in search of
assistance

as this terrible idea flashed across my mind and i saw that i was a
ghost i was as much frightened as the turnbuckles had been and i took
to my heels to fly from myself until i recollected myself a little
and thought of the absurdity of such a proceeding but even this fatal
conception did not remove my anxiety in relation to my poor body--or
myself as i could not help regarding my body and i ran back to the
beech-tree in a kind of distraction hoping i might have been revived
and resuscitated in my absence

i reached the pit and stared wildly about me--my body was
gone--vanished i looked into the hole i had excavated there was
nothing in it but the spade and mattock and my hat which had fallen
from my head when i leaped out of it after hurting my foot i stared
round me again the print of my body in the grass where it had lain
was quite perceptible for it was now almost broad day but there was
no body there and no other vestige excepting one of my shoes which
was torn and bloody being the identical one i had worn on the foot
hurt by the mattock




chapter xvi


sheppard lee finds comfort when he least expects it the extraordinary
close of the catastrophe


what had become of me that is what had become of my body its
disappearance threw me into a phrensy and i was about to run home
and summon old jim jumble to help me look for it when i heard a dog
yelping and whining in a peculiarly doleful manner at some little
distance down in the meadow and i instantly ran in that direction
thinking that perhaps the bloodthirsty beast might be at that very
moment dragging it away to devour it--or hoping at the least to
light upon some one who could give me an account of it

i ran to a place in the edge of the marsh where were some willow-trees
and an old worm fence the latter overgrown with briers and
elder-bushes and there to my exceeding surprise i discovered the
body of squire higginson for he was stone dead lying against the
fence which was broken his head down and his heels resting against
the rails and looking as if while climbing it he had fallen down and
broken his neck his gun was lying at his side undischarged and his
dog whose yelping had brought me to the spot was standing by but i
must add that as soon as i approached him the animal betrayed as
much terror as turnbuckle's dogs had done and ran howling away in the
same manner

greatly incensed as i had been with squire higginson i felt some
concern to see him lying in this lamentable condition his face
blackened with blood as if he had perished from suffocation and
stooping down i endeavoured to take off his neckcloth and raise his
head in the hope that he might yet recover but i reckoned without my
host--i had forgotten that i was a mere phantom or spirit possessing
no muscular power whatever because no muscles for even in walking
and running as i was now aware i was impelled by some unknown power
within me and not at all carried by my legs i could not bring my hand
into contact either with his cravat or head and for a good reason
seeing there was no substance in me whatever but all spirit

i therefore ceased my endeavours and began to moralize in a mournful
mood upon his condition and mine he was dead and so was i but there
seemed to be this difference between us namely that i had lost my
body and he his soul--for after looking hard about me i could see
nothing of it his body as it lay there in the bushes was perfectly
useless to him and to all the world beside and my spirit as was
clear enough was in a similar predicament why might i not that is
to say my spirit--deprived by an unhappy accident of its natural
dwelling--take possession of a tenement which there remained no spirit
to claim and thus uniting interests together as two feeble factions
unite together in the political world become a body possessing life
strength and usefulness

as soon as this idea entered my mind or me for i was all mind i
was seized with the envy that possessed me when i first met the squire
shooting over my marshes how much better it would be i thought to
inhabit his body than my own in my own fleshly casing i should revive
only to poverty and trouble i had forgot all about captain kid's
money whereas if once in the body of squire higginson i should step
out into the world to possess riches respect content and all that
man covets oh that i might be squire higginson i cried

the words were scarce out of my mouth before i felt myself vanishing
as it were into the dead man's nostrils into which i--that is to say
my spirit--rushed like a breeze of air and the very next moment i
found myself kicking the fence to pieces in a lusty effort to rise to
my feet and feeling as if i had just tumbled over it

the devil take the fence and that jersey kill-deer that keeps it
in such bad order i cried as i rose up snatching at my gun and
whistling for my dog ponto my dog ponto it was even the truth
i was no more sheppard lee the poor and discontented--no longer a
disimbodied spirit wandering about only to frighten dogs out of their
senses but john hazlewood higginson esq solid and substantial in
purse and flesh with a rosy face and a heart as cheerful as the
morning which was now reddening over the whole east if i had wanted
any proof of the transformation beyond that furnished by my own senses
and sensations it would have been provided by my dog ponto who now
came running up leaping on and about me with the most extravagant joy

god be thanked i cried dancing about as joyously as the dog i am
now a respectable man with my pockets full of money farewell then
you poor miserable sheppard lee you ragamuffin you poor wretched
shote you half-starved old sand-field jersey kill-deer you vagabond
you beggar you dicky dout with the wrong place in your upper story
you are now a gentleman and a man of substance and a happy dog into
the bargain ha ha ha and here i fell a laughing out of pure joy
and giving my dog ponto a buss as if that were the most natural act
in the world and a customary way of showing my satisfaction i began
to stalk towards my old ruined house without exactly knowing for what
purpose but having some vague idea about me that i would set old jim
jumble and his wife dinah to shouting and dancing an amusement i would
willingly have seen the whole world engaged in at that moment




chapter xvii


a natural mistake which although it procures the author a rough
reception at his own house has yet the good effect to teach him the
propriety of adapting his manners to his condition


i had not walked twenty yards before a woodcock that was feeding on
the edge of the marsh started up from under my nose when clapping my
gun to my shoulder i let fly at him and down he came

aha ponto said i when did i ever fail to bring down a woodcock
bring it along ponto you rascal--rum-te ti ti rum-te ti ti
and i went on my way singing for pure joy without pausing to recharge
or to bag my game i reached my old house and began to roar out
without reflecting that i was now something more than sheppard lee
hillo jim jumble you old rascal get up and let me in

what you want hah said old jim poking his head from the
garret-window of the kitchen and looking as sour as a persimmon before
frost guess massa squire higginson drunk hah what you want s'pose
i'm gwyin to git up afo sunrise for not'in and for anybody but my
massa sheppard

why you old dog said i in a passion i am your master sheppard
that is your master john hazlewood higginson esquire for as for
sheppard lee the jersey kill-deer i've finished him you rascal
you'll never see him more so get down and let me into the house or
i'll--

you will hah said jim you will what

i'll shoot you you insolent scoundrel i exclaimed in a rage--as
if it were the most natural thing in the world for me to be in one and
as i spoke i raised my piece when bow--wow--wough went my old dog
bull who had not bitten a man for two years but who now rushed from
his kennel under the porch and seized me by the leg

get out bull you rascal said i but he only bit the harder which
threw me into such a fury that i clapped the muzzle of my gun to his
side and having one charge remaining blew him to pieces

golla-matty said old jim from the window whence he had surveyed
the combat golla-matty shoot old bull

and with that the black villain snatched up the half of a brick which
i suppose he kept to daunt unwelcome visiters and taking aim at me
he cast it so well as to bring it right against my left ear and so
tumbled me to the ground i would have blown the rascal's brains out
in requital of this assault had there been a charge left in my piece
or had he given me time to reload but as soon as he had cast the
brick he ran from the window and then reappeared holding out an old
musket that i remembered he kept to shoot wild ducks and muskrats in
the neighbouring marsh with seeing this formidable weapon and not
knowing but that the desperado would fire upon me i was forced to beat
a retreat which i did in double quick time being soon joined by my
dog ponto who had fled like a coward at the first bow-wough of the
bulldog and saluted in my flight by the amiable tones of dinah who
now thrust her head from the window beside jim's and abused me as
long as i could hear




book ii


containing sundry illustrations of the advantages of good living with
a few chapters on domestic felicity


chapter i


some passages in the life of john h higginson esq the happy
sportsman with a surprising affliction that befell the author


i went off in a towering rage to think of the reception i had met and
that too after an absence of a whole night i had been bitten by my own
dog and driven from my own doors by my own servants but there was
something in these circumstances to admonish me of the change that had
come over me they reminded me of a fact that was not always present to
my thoughts--to wit that i was no longer sheppard lee but mr john
hazlewood higginson a very different sort of personage altogether

to account for my forgetfulness of this important transformation i
must relate that although i had acquired along with his body all
the peculiarities of feeling propensity conversation and conduct
of squire higginson i had not entirely lost those that belonged
to sheppard lee in fact i may be said to have possessed at that
time two different characters one of which now governed me and now
the other though the squire's it must be confessed was greatly
predominant thus the moment after the transformation i found
myself endowed with a passion for shooting as if i had had it all my
life long a buoyant tone of mind and in addition as i by-and-by
discovered with somewhat a hot temper none of which had ever been
known to me before the difficulty was that i could not immediately
shake off my old sheppard lee habits and the influence of these
perhaps if one must scrutinize into the matter more than the
absolute retention of any other native peculiarities drove me into the
inconsistencies of which i was for a short time guilty but i will not
trouble the reader with philosophizing

i perceived from the repulse i had received from jim jumble that it
now became me to sink his old master altogether which i was very well
content to do and resolved accordingly although i could not help
thinking as i strode over the forty-acre farm how much satisfaction i
should have now that i was a rich man in putting it into fine order
but these thoughts were soon driven from my mind by ponto making a set
at some game and in a moment i was banging away right and left and
slaughtering the birds in the finest style imaginable

oh the delights of shooting woodcock it is rather hot work though
of a midsummer day and notwithstanding the prodigious satisfaction i
had in pursuing the sport i felt that my satisfaction would have been
still greater had i been a few stone lighter i began to think squire
higginson's fat rather inconvenient and i had the same opinion of a
touch of asthma or something of that nature which i found in his
lungs and besides there was a sort of whizzing and humming and
spinning in my head where they had been all the morning which were not
altogether agreeable

in consequence of these infirmities of my new body i began after a
while to weary of the sport and was just on the point of setting
off to the village to get my dinner when a crowd of men made their
appearance in the marsh and setting up a great shout at sight of
me began to run towards me i could not conceive the cause of such
a concourse nor could i imagine for what reason they directed their
steps towards me but hearing them utter the most furious cries and
perceiving that a multitude of dogs they had with them were rushing
against me as if to devour me i was seized with alarm and began to
retreat towards a wood that was not far off

this evidence of terror on my part only caused the people to utter
louder and more savage cries besides setting the dogs to running
faster and these ferocious animals gaining upon me and being on the
point of tearing me to pieces i was obliged to let fly my piece among
them whereby i shot one dead and disabled two or three others i then
defended myself with the breech of my gun until the men came up one
of whom tripped up my heels while the others seized and disarmed me
crying out that i was a murderer that i was found out and should be
hanged if there was any law in the county

i was confounded at this charge but how much greater was my amazement
when i understood as they haled me along towards the village which
they did very roughly that i was accused of having murdered sheppard
lee--that is my own identical self

this accusation appeared to me so preposterous that in spite of my
indignation for my fears had now subsided i burst into a laugh
which only made them rail at me more furiously than i can express
hear him said they he laughs he thinks because he is a rich man
he can shoot any poor man he pleases and buy himself off but we will
show him there's law in jersey for aristocrats as well as poor men and
that we can hang a purse-proud man as soon as a beggar

and so they went on reviling me as if i had been the greatest criminal
in the land and dragging me as they said to a squire who would soon
show me what law was

i tried to reason with them but it was all in vain i then fell into
a passion and cursed and swore at them in a way which i am certain i
never did before at any human being having always had while sheppard
lee a great horror of profanity but this was just as fruitless
an expedient as the other they dragged me on until we reached the
village where we found all in a hubbub men women and children
running about as if mad and exclaiming that squire higginson had
murdered sheppard lee and hid the body in the owl-roost swamp as
soon as they saw me they set up a shout and some low fellows among
them raged in such a degree that i thought they would have massacred
me in the street they crowded round me hustled me seized me by the
collar shook their fists in my face and in general testified such a
vindictive concern for the murder of poor sheppard lee as they called
him that i might have supposed there was never a man more widely
beloved than myself had i not known otherwise--or rather had i not
been too closely occupied to suppose any thing about it

in a word they carried me before squire andrew parkins who was a
fat man that i heartily despised and here they called upon him for
justice while i did the same thing swearing that i would prosecute
every rascal of them for assault and battery conspiracy defamation
and the lord knows what beside all of which it seems only inflamed
the mob against me the more they charged me with the murder and
the evidence they brought to support the charge appeared to justice
parkins sufficient to authorize his issuing a mittimus there were
twenty persons to swear i had two or three days before acknowledged
having had a quarrel with sheppard lee on his farm--that is the
forty-acre--and that he had ordered me off and there were twenty
more to swear i was a man of such a hot and furious temper that it
was a wonder i had not shot the poor man down on the spot then came
old turnbuckle and his son who swore that the ghost of sheppard lee
had come to them in the gray of the morning calling for help and
assuring them that he or his body lay murdered under the beech-tree
in the hollow that as soon as the phantom had vanished and they
recovered from their fears they roused the neighbours and sending
some to my house who learned i had not been at home all night the
others proceeded to the hollow where they found a freshly-dug grave
with spade and mattock in it and near it they lit upon my hat and one
of my shoes which latter was bloody as well as the grass on which
it lay that then looking round them they discovered me that is
john higginson sneaking away through the reeds on the marsh in a
suspicious way that at that moment old jim jumble was brought forward
who said i john hazlewood higginson had come to the house shot his
bulldog threatened to blow his brains out and bragged that i had
just finished or in other words murdered his master sheppard lee
and finally that this confirming the suspicions they all had against
me they pursued me i retreating and shooting their dogs like a
man conscious of guilt and anxious to escape and captured me not
without a furious resistance on my part

on the strength of this testimony i was committed to jail whither i
was conducted amid the shouts of the mob squire parkins doubtless to
beg off as well as he could afterward privately assured me that he
had committed me to prison not from any belief that i was guilty or
that the testimony really warranted such a step but because he was
afraid the people would otherwise murder me and considered that the
only way to protect me from their violence

meanwhile there was a great search made for my--that is sheppard
lee's--body the general belief being that i--that is john h
higginson--had cast it into the swamp after having been at the pains
to dig a grave wherein i at first designed to hide it and i do verily
believe that had my unfortunate old casing been found i should have
begun my new existence in the body of the man i had so much envied by
being hanged for the murder its sudden disappearance was therefore not
more extraordinary than it was really fortunate




chapter ii


the author being in prison makes a confidant of a deputy
attorney-general--the inconvenience of telling a truth which happens
to be somewhat incredible


my wrath gave way when i found myself in prison and hearing from the
jailer that the grand jury was then in session and the prosecuting
attorney actually engaged in framing a bill of endictment against me
to send up to its members i began to think the matter rather serious
and resolved to end it before it proceeded further

i had already experienced the ill effects of attempting to sustain the
character of sheppard lee while in the body of another man and for
this reason was resolved to be more cautious for the future but i now
perceived i had no better way of relieving myself of my troubles than
by making the prosecutor who had been an old friend of mine and had
always treated me with respect acquainted with my transformation
after which i had no doubt he would throw his bill of endictment into
the fire i sent for him accordingly but was obliged to repeat the
message before he thought fit to make his appearance

you have perhaps made a mistake mr higginson said he as he
entered you have occasion for counsel but none that i can imagine
for me for as to my giving you any advice in this unfortunate
affair--

the devil take the affair said i in no amiable voice it was to
get rid of it entirely that i sent for you for i must stop that cursed
endictment of yours i don't want it said of me hereafter that i was
once in my life endicted for a felony

oh sir said he with a smile we are in no hurry about these
things the bill will lie over till we can procure a little more
evidence and some of a better quality don't be in any alarm but
allow me to recommend you to employ counsel my friend sharphead i
think will be your best man

i don't want any counsel said i and sharphead may go to the devil
i want to confide to you the true secret of this extraordinary affair

faith sir said he looking at me in surprise if you can do that
the case is not so ridiculous as i thought really mr higginson i
was rather amused than otherwise at the charge brought against you
not supposing you knew any thing of or had any connexion whatever
with the disappearance of poor sheppard lee but since you talk of
secrets sir i must inform you i am not the person you should make
any confessions to i must again recommend you to employ counsel

and with that he was about leaving me but i arrested him stop
jack said i his name was john darling and he is very well known
in the state though he was turned out of office you and i are old
friends and we must have a talk together

at these words he gave me a hard stare looking more astonished than
ever

jack said i taking him by the hand i'll make you stare harder
than that sheppard lee is no more dead than i am though as for his
body i believe old nick has got it now my boy i take it you will
act as a friend in this matter and not blab my secret but the truth
is it is john h higginson who is dead and i who am living

the deuse it is said the lawyer whose amazement set me into a
capital humour and pray sir he added if john h higginson is
dead who are you

sheppard lee said i bursting into a laugh only that you see me
now in john h higginson's body

i then proceeded to inform him as i have informed the reader of my
digging for the treasure of my sudden death of the visit of my spirit
to old turnbuckle's of the disappearance of my body of my finding
and entering that of squire higginson in which he now saw me and in
fine of all the other circumstances connected with the transformation
all which he heard like a man whom the novelty of the relation
astounded into marble

upon my soul said he when i had done you have told me a most
surprising story and so you really think yourself sheppard lee--that
is sheppard lee's spirit in squire higginson's body

think myself sir said i a little fiercely

do you presume to slight my veracity sir or to doubt my common
sense

by no means said he i have the utmost respect for both your story
has completely satisfied me of your innocence a most wonderful story
sir truly a most wonderful story and repeating these words over and
over again he fell to nodding his head and musing staring at me all
the time like one who is lost in wonder and then suddenly rousing up
he burst into a roar of laughter seeing that i was incensed at his
merriment he hastened to apologize declaring that he was not laughing
at my story but at the absurdity he had been so nigh committing in
endicting me for my own murder and he added that my relation was
altogether the most remarkable he had ever heard in his life

i then gave him to understand i expected for very good and obvious
reasons that he would keep the story to himself which he faithfully
promised he then fell to cross-questioning me in relation to different
points and he was particularly curious to know what i supposed had
become of my body when not being able to satisfy him on that point
he himself suggested that perhaps squire higginson's spirit had taken
possession of it as i had done with his and carried it off for some
purpose or other and that we should soon have news of him an idea
that was so agreeable to him that he fell to laughing as hard as ever
sir said he shaking me by the hand in excellent good-humour we
will soon have you out of this dog-hole and that without betraying
your secret heaven forbid i should spoil the good fortune of my old
friend sheppard lee no sir i am no tale-bearer or blabber of
secrets comfort yourself sir i never had the least idea of endicting
you on this absurd charge nobody believes sheppard lee has been
murdered by you nor indeed by any one else no poor devil the
general opinion now is that he has taken himself off to get clear of
duns and sheriffs and as for the bloody shoe and hat why that's a
common way of turning pursuers off the scent by throwing dust in their
eyes the charge will be abandoned sir you will be liberated and
may if you like such amusement prosecute your captors by the dozen
for assault and battery farewell mr higginson--that is mr lee
fortune smiles upon you at last and you are a happy--a wonderful man
sir--farewell

the attorney then left me and so much diverted was he by my adventure
that i could hear him indulge peal after peal of mirth until he had
got out of the prison

now it may be supposed that my story from its reasonableness carried
conviction to the attorney's mind and so i was persuaded but i
reckoned without my host the hypocritical gentleman did not believe
a word of it however much he pretended to do so but in this he was
like the rest of the fraternity i never indeed knew a lawyer to
believe any thing unless he was paid for it and i forgot to present
my gentleman a fee my story therefore not being paid for or proved
according to law only convinced this skeptical person that i--the
unfortunate higginson as he called me--had suddenly lost my senses
and gone staring mad and in consequence disregarding all his promises
of secrecy he ran over the whole village diverting every one he could
lay hands on with an account of the poor squire's hallucination
as he termed it--that is to say his conceit that his body was now
inhabited by the soul of sheppard lee

but to give a certain personage his due or one of that personage's
representatives i must confess that darling who was at bottom a
good-natured fellow recollected one part of his promise and took
measures to effect my discharge from prison which was no very
difficult matter people being now pretty well aware of the folly
of the charge they had brought against me and the absurdity of the
evidence designed to support it the opinion was already entertained
that poor sheppard lee instead of being murdered had taken himself
out of the neighbourhood to avoid his creditors having left his hat
and shoe in the swamp only as blinds to those who might be most anxious
to secure his person and pursuers had already left the village to
discover his place of concealment




chapter iii


sheppard lee is visited by new friends released from prison and
carried to his new place of abode


another service that the attorney did me according to the jailer
through whom i discovered all these things was to despatch a messenger
to my friends in philadelphia with the news of my insanity and
imprisonment and a request that they should send proper persons to
take charge of me after being liberated and i was roused the following
morning by the appearance of some half a dozen kinsmen who had come to
the village for that purpose fully persuaded that they should find me
a raging lunatic

but the jailer's information had set me to reflecting upon my
difficulties all of which as i clearly perceived were owing to my
indiscretion in attempting to keep up the character of sheppard lee
while in another man's body i saw the necessity i was now placed under
to be mr john h higginson and nobody else for the future and so
i resolved to be--for i did not like the idea of being clapped into a
mad-house by my new friends

yet they took me so much by surprise that i was guilty of some few
inconsistencies for it was not immediately that i felt myself at case
in my new character

the truth is my situation was peculiar and embarrassing with the body
of mr higginson i had acquired all his distinctive peculiarities
as i mentioned before but many of these were in a manner stupified
within me and required to be renewed or resuscitated by processes
of association i was like a man who has been roused from a lethargy
which had destroyed or obscured his memory though not his instincts
and who betrays complete ignorance of past events and forgetfulness
of old friends until some accidental circumstance--a casual reference
to some past event the tone of a voice or other such cause--recalls
him it may be to sudden and complete though usually imperfect
consciousness

thus when i was roused up in the morning and beheld a good-looking
personage of about my own years shaking me by the shoulder i regarded
him only as some impertinent stranger intruding upon my privacy
saluted him with divers epithets expressive of rage and indignation
and concluded by asking him who the devil he was

what i said he with the most doleful visage in the world why
timothy--that is tim doolittle your brother-in-law--don't you know
me

and don't you know me and me and me your cousin tom this
and your old friend dick that cried they all with horrible long
faces the oddity of which after a while set me a laughing especially
when i came to recollect them all as i did by-and-by when they had
pronounced their names for at each name it seemed to me as if a film
fell from my eyes and some spirit within awakened me to a vague
recollection of the person to whom it belonged in a word i became
aware that i was surrounded by a knot of my oldest and best friends
all of them excellent jolly dogs and good fellows who were come to
escort me home and assured me that i was no longer a prisoner

i shook them all by the hand and contrasting for a moment in my mind
the melancholy condition in which i had lived as sheppard lee with
my present glorious state surrounded by friends and conscious of
possessing lands houses stocks schuylkill coal-mines and the lord
knows what other goods beside i fell into a rapture danced about my
cell and hugged every person present as well as the jailer and my
old friend darling the attorney who happened at that moment to enter

bravo said tim doolittle now you're the true jack higginson again
and i don't believe you are mad a bit

mad said i thinking it needful to explain away that imputation
no and i never was i tumbled over an old rotten fence and hurt my
head which was in consequence in a whiz all day yesterday but now
it is clear enough i think i said some silly things about one thing
and another but that's neither here nor there

ah said tim doolittle touching his forehead and looking as grave as
a bullfrog it's well it's no worse for i always thought you had a
turn for apoplexy but i'm glad you are so well it will be good news
for poor margaret

margaret who the deuse is she said i feeling quite strange at the
name

why my poor sister your wife to be sure said he

my wife i recollected that i had a wife but the recollection
made me feel i knew not exactly why as if i had been suddenly soused
into cold water it was a highly uncomfortable idea and accordingly i
hastened to get rid of it

let us leave this confounded place i said and we left the prison

the prospect of a fine sunshiny day infused animation into my mind
which was vastly increased when i stepped into a splendid new barouche
with a pair of bay horses worth a thousand dollars--for so much tim
gave me to understand i--that is to say my prototype--had given for
them scarce a month before--the whole establishment being therefore my
own what a happy man am i ah poor miserable sheppard lee farewell
now to poverty farewell to discontent

such were my secret ejaculations as we set out in my splendid barouche
followed by a train of gigs and carriages that contained my friends i
esteemed myself the happiest man in the world and i gave my last sigh
to the memory of sheppard lee

what a glorious time we had of it on our way to philadelphia i found
myself the richest man in the company--my pocketbook was full of
bank-notes--and i resolved to give my friends a blow-out we stopped at
a certain village and at a certain hotel therein the master of which
prepares the best dinners and has the best butt of genuine madeira in
all new-jersey let us rest and rejoice i said and we will drive
into town after nightfall

my friends agreed we ate drank and were merry and it was not until
after sunrise the next morning that we found ourselves in philadelphia
and in my--yes excellent reader--in my house in chestnut-street
south side two doors from the corner of--but it is needless to be
particular the house is yet standing in a highly aristocratic
neighbourhood and is not yet converted into a dry-goods shop

i reached my house i--but before i relate what befell me in that
splendid pile of red bricks which like its neighbours seems to be
blushing all the year round at its naked simplicity i must say a few
words more of sheppard lee




chapter iv


containing illustrations of the advantages of dying an unusual death
in times of high political excitement


i never felt the slightest inclination to revisit the scenes of my late
trouble and discontent but the newspapers which are the lights of the
age though occasionally somewhat smoky acquainted me with the events
that followed after my marvellous disappearance what has become of
sheppard lee was the cry after his creditors had sought for him
in vain during a space of two weeks and more no vestige of him was
discovered not the slightest clew to indicate his fate beyond those
already brought to light in the owl-roost it was impossible he could
have fled without leaving some traces and none were found and why
should he fly men at last began to ask he was in debt it was true
but what could he gain by absconding since his little property was
necessarily left behind him

in a word the improbabilities of his having voluntarily fled were so
great that men began to recur to their original idea of his having
been murdered but why was he murdered and by whom some few began
to revive the charges against me--that is to say against john h
higginson but brighter ideas were struck out and john h higginson
was forgotten an old friend of mine who never cared a fig for me
but who was ambitious to create a tumult and become the leader of a
party got up in a public place and recounted the history of william
morgan and his mysterious abduction and murder by the masons of the
empire state a terrible agitation at once seized his listeners poor
dear unfortunate sheppard lee they cried the masons have morganized
him for apostatizing from his oaths and revealing the secrets of the
society yes he has been morganized and giving way to their rage
they were on the point of tarring and feathering all the free-masons
they could lay their hands on when presto--as the conjurers say
they suddenly made discovery that the masons could not have murdered
me for divulging secrets inasmuch as i had never known them nor for
apostatizing as i had never been a mason in my life

but the tumult was not allowed to subside my old friends of the
administration finding that their strength was dwindling away in
the country and dreading the event of the coming election unless a
reaction could be got up in their favour suddenly burst into a fury
swore that i had been made away with by the opposition on account
of my remarkable zeal energy and success as an electioneerer and
political missionary and taking my old hat and shoe and carrying
them round the village in solemn procession they stopped in the
market-place where one of their chief orators--my faithful friend
the new postmaster--delivered a sort of funeral address in which
he compared the opponents of the administration to cut-throats and
cannibals pronounced them the enemies of liberty swore that no honest
patriot was safe among them and declared--his declaration being
illustrated by shouts and groans and grim faces--that i had perished
the victim of a murderous opposition

but as if that was not immortality enough for one of my humble
pretensions the opposition instantly turned the tables upon their
accusers witnesses stepped forward to prove that on the night when
i was seen for the last time i had in the bar-room of the first
hotel in the village publicly denounced the hurrah party as being
based upon deception and fraud and avowed my determination not only
instantly to leave it but to go my death thenceforth in opposition
see the bloody vindictiveness and malice of the hurrah party
they cried before the sun rose upon this unfortunate and honest
man--honest because he deserted his party the moment his eyes were
opened to its corruption--he was a living man no longer the bravoes
of this horrible gang of mid-night murderers who have trampled on our
rights and liberties and now trample on our lives met the unlucky
patriot as he returned to his lowly cot and--just heavens--where was
he now save in his bloody and untimely grave he the humble the
unoffending the honest the universally-esteemed the widely-beloved
the patriotic sheppard lee--waylaid and ambushed killed slain
murdered massacred the victim of a despotic and vindictive
cabal--the martyr of liberty the-- in short the noblest honestest
dearest best and most ill-used creature that ever dabbled in the
puddle of politics one might suppose that this outcry of the antis
backed as it was by the full proof of my change of politics would have
stopped the mouths of the hurrah-boys but it did no such thing they
only raved the louder as for the proof of my backsliding they treated
that with contempt proofs being as little regarded in politics as
arguments they accused the antis more zealously than before and the
antis recriminated with equal enthusiasm

there were some men in the village who strove to appease the ferment
by directing suspicion upon the german doctor and divers other
personages just as the humour of suspicion seized them furiously
accusing these suspected individuals of having had some hand in the
catastrophe but the german doctor and the other persons accused
had nothing to do with politics and were therefore suffered to go
their ways it is a great protection to one's reputation to keep
clear of politics the guilt of my murder was left to be borne by the
hurrah-boys and the antis one party or the other but as the evidence
was equally strong against either party and just as strong against
any one individual of either party as another it resulted that i was
murdered not only by both parties but by every man of both parties--a
peculiarity in my history that proved me to have possessed though i
never dreamed it before a vaster number both of energetic friends and
bloodthirsty enemies each man being both friend and enemy than any
other man in the whole world

how the antis and the hurrah-boys settled the affair among them i did
not care to inquire i was engrossed by the novelties and charms of a
new being and willing to forget that such a poor devil as sheppard lee
had ever existed




chapter v


the true meaning of the word podagra


let the reader judge of my transport when my elegant new barouche
and splendid pair of horses that cost me a thousand dollars drew up
before my house in chestnut-street i stood upon the kerb-stone and
surveyed it from top to bottom the marble of the steps basement and
window-sills was white as snow and the bricks were redder than roses
the windows were of plate glass and within them were curtains of
crimson damask fronted with hangings of white lace as fine and lovely
as a bride's veil of true paris blonde and a great bouquet of dahlias
wreathed around a blooming rose glittered in each it was evidently
the house of a man of wealth and figure

the neighbourhood it was equally manifest was of the highest vogue
and distinction on one side was the dwelling of a fashionable
tailor who built a house out of every ten coats that he cut on the
other side was the residence of a retired tavern-keeper and right
opposite on the other side of the street was the mansion of one of
the first aristocrats in the town who had had neither a tailor nor
a tavern-keeper in the family for a space of three full generations
there was no end to the genteel people in my neighbourhood here was
the house of a firstrate lawyer there of a shop-keeper who had not
sold any thing by retail for ten years here a croesus of a carpenter
who turned up his nose at the aristocrat and there a plutus of a
note-shaver who looked with contempt on the gentleman of chips in
short my house was in a highly fashionable neighbourhood and i felt
as i mounted my marble steps that jack higginson the brewer as my
brother tim always called me was as genteel a fellow among them as
you would find of a summer's day

i entered the house as proud as lucifer telling my friends that they
should crack a bottle or two of my best port for tim had given me a
hint that my cellar contained some of the best in the world and
said tim giving me a wink we may take our fun now as sister
margaret-- at that name i felt a cold creeping in my bones--as
sister margaret is still in the country the ague left me--i did not
think it he continued worth while to alarm her

the lord be thanked said i though why i said it i knew no more
than the man in the moon

we sat down we drank and we made merry--that is to say they made
merry as for myself a circumstance occurred which nipped my pleasure
in the bud and began to make me doubt whether in exchanging the
condition of sheppard lee for that of john h higginson i had not made
somewhat of a bad bargain

i had managed somehow or other in the course of the night to stump
my toe or wrench my foot and though the accident caused me but
little inconvenience at the time the member had begun gradually to
feel uneasy and now as i sat at my table it grew so painful that
i was forced to draw off my boot but this giving me little relief
and finding that my foot was swollen out of all shape and beauty my
brother tim pronounced it a severe strain and recommended that i
should call in my family physician dr boneset a very illustrious
man and fine fellow who at that moment chanced to drive by in his
coal-black gig which looked as physicians gigs usually look as if
in mourning for a thousand departed patients

what's the matter said the doctor

why doctor said i i have given my foot a confounded wrench i
scarce know how but it is as big and as hot as a plum-pudding

hum ay--very unlucky said the doctor off with your stocking and
let me look at your tongue pulse quite feverish fine port he said
drinking off a glass that tim had poured him and cocking his eye like
one who means to be witty fine port sir but one can't float in it
for ever without paying port-charges a very gentlemanly disease at
all events it lies between port and porter

port and porter disease said i slipping off my stocking as he
directed without well knowing what he meant my foot was as red as
a salamander swelled beyond all expression and while i drew the
stocking it hurt me most horribly

zounds doctor said i can that be a wrench

no said the doctor it's the wrencher--genuine podagra pon
honour

podagra said i podagra said tim and podagra said the others
what's that

gout said the doctor

gout cried my friends gout roared my brother tim and gout
yelled i starting from the doctor as if from an imp of darkness who
had just come to make claim to me it was the unluckiest leap in the
world i kicked over a chair as i started and the touch was as if i
had clapped my foot into the jaws of a roaring lion crunch went every
bone crack went every sinew and such a yell as i set up was never
before heard in chestnut-street

you see gentlemen--i'll take another glass of that port mr
doolittle--you see what we must all come to this is one of the
small penalties one must pay for being a gentleman when one dances
one must pay the piper now would my friend higginson there give a
whole year of his best brewing that all the pale ale and purple port
that have passed his lips had been nothing better than elder-wine
and bonny-clabber but never mind my dear sir said the son of
æsculapius with a coolness that shocked me as long as it's only in
your foot it's a small matter

a small matter--i grinned at him but the unfeeling wretch only
repeated his words--a small matter

i had never been sick before in my life as john h higginson my
worst complaints had been only an occasional surfeit or a moderate
attack of booziness and as sheppard lee i had never known any disease
except laziness which being chronic i had grown so accustomed to
that it never troubled me but now ah now my first step into the
world of enjoyment was to be made on red-hot ploughshares and pokers
my first hour of a life of content was to be passed in grinning and
groaning and--but it is hardly worth while to say it the gout should
be confined to religious people for men of the world will swear and
that roundly

for six days----six mortal days----did i lay upon my back enduring
such horrible twitches and twinges in my foot that i was more than
once on the point of ordering the doctor to cut it off and i do not
know how far that conceit might have gone had not the heartless
fellow who i believe was all the while making game of my torments
assured me that the only effect of the dismemberment would be to drive
the enemy into the other foot where it would play the same tricks over
again the gout said he has as great an affection for the human
body as a cat has for a house in which she has been well treated when
it once effects a lodgment and feels itself comfortable--

comfortable said i with a groan

in good easy quarters--

don't talk to me of easy quarters said i for if i were hacked
into quarters and that by the clumsiest butcher in the town i could
not be more uneasy in every quarter

i am talking said dr boneset not of you but of the disease and
what i meant to say was that when it once finds itself at home in a
good wholesome corporation of a man there you may expect to find it a
tenant for life

for life said i i am the most wretched man in existence oh
sheppard lee sheppard lee what a fool were you to think yourself
miserable--doctor i shall go mad

not while you have the gout said he tis a sovereign protection
against all that--but let us look at your foot and the awkward or
malicious creature managed to drop a tortoise and gold snuff-box of
about a pound and a half weight which he was always sporting right
upon the point of my great toe while he was looking at it had it been
a ton and a half instead of a pound and a half in weight it could not
have thrown me into greater torture and the--the man--he thought he
had settled the matter by making me a handsome apology he left me to
endure my pangs and to curse squire higginson's father grandfather
great-grandfather and in general all his forefathers who had
entailed such susceptible great toes upon the family in a word i was
in such a horrible quandary that i wished the devil would fly off with
my new body as he had done before with the old




chapter vi


sheppard lee's introduction to his wife and his suspicion that all is
not gold that glistens


but there is as philosophers say an unguent for every wound a solace
for every care and it was my fate to experience the consolation that
one provides beforehand against the gout as well as all other ills man
may anticipate in the person of a faithful spouse on the fourth day
of my malady and just at a moment when i was fairly yelling with pain
a lady neither young nor beautiful but dressed like a princess save
that her shoes were down at heel and her bonnet somewhat awry stepped
up to my bedside seized me by the hand and crying out oh my poor
dear husband burst into tears

her appearance acted like a charm even my foot that seemed to be
roasting over one of nott's patent anthracite blazers grew cool
and comfortable in the chill that was diffused over my whole body
complaint was silent at the sight of her pain vanished at her touch i
forgot that i had the gout and remembered only that i had a wife

i was struck dumb and presume i should not have groaned again for
twenty-four hours had not my consort in the exuberance of her
affection and grief thrown her arms around my neck and thereby
brought the whole weight of her body upon my foot which after
having tried all parts of the bed i had at last lodged upon the
very extremity of the feathers by which act of endearment my poor
unfortunate limb was crushed against the horrible log of mahogany that
made one side of the bed-stead and ground to pieces had my wife been
my wife twenty times over i must have uttered just as loud a cry as i
did and repeated it just as often

she started up and regarded me with severity

is that the way you use me said she--i believe i had rather pushed
her away but how could i help it--is that the way you welcome me
home whither i have come--leaving kinsfolk and friends--to nurse
you barbarous man you hate me yes and besides having no longer any
love for me you have not even the slightest regard for my feelings
but don't think mr higginson that i will be treated so any longer
you may break my heart--your poor margaret's heart--if you will
but--but-- and here the affectionate creature was so overcome that
she could not utter another word but sat down wringing her hands and
weeping as if i had broken her heart and she had not crushed my foot
but as far as my experience enables me to form any opinion on such a
subject i must say that wives have an extraordinary knack at turning
the tables on their husbands

for heaven's sake madam said i don't set me distracted--the
pain and her absurd reproaches together made me both frantic and
ferocious--don't make me believe that adam's wife was made out of the
bone of a gouty leg instead of a good sound rib

what do you mean by that sir said mrs higginson

only said i gritting my teeth that i have some thoughts she must
have been a piece of the sorest bone in his body

my wife marched up to the bed and looked me in the face my wrath
went out like a gas-light before a black frost my agonies again
disappeared there was no standing that look unless one could stand
the look of a jersey black-snake famous beyond all other snakes for
its powers of fascination and talking of snakes i must add that
while my wife gave me that look i felt as if one just turned out of
winter-quarters horribly cold and creepy were slipping down my back
she looked at me with mingled anger and disdain

how often have i told you mr higginson she said never to attempt
to be witty since you only expose your folly--i won't use any harder
word and whatever you do sir she added beginning to cry again
don't make a jest of your wife sir you're always doing it sir
you're always making me appear ridiculous to your friends and to
myself you treat me as if i were a fool--you--

madam said i endeavouring to appease her a little for i was quite
overcome by her violence remember that i have the gout and am
suffering the--

yes she cried and you are determined that everybody else shall
suffer as well as yourself and me in particular oh mr higginson
how can you use me so i'll never speak to you another word

and down she sat again weeping and wringing her hands harder than
ever and moping and whining the lord knows how long

sheppard lee sheppard lee i muttered but i took good care not to
mutter aloud you were not the most miserable dog in the world by a
great deal a gouty constitution and a perverse wife are--oh pangs and
purgatory

i hoped my consort being so greatly incensed would take herself out
of the room when i determined though it should cost me a howl for
every step to get up and lock the door on her come of it what might
but she was not of that mind she maintained her seat sobbing and
sighing and by taking off her hat and flinging it pettishly into
a corner made it manifest that she had determined to nurse me in
earnest though in a way entirely of her own happily the paroxysm of
suffering which was at its height when she entered soon subsided
and being left greatly exhausted and her sobs having somewhat of a
soporific quality i managed notwithstanding my mental disquiet to
fall fast asleep whereby i got rid for a time of an evil in many
respects equal to the gout itself

two days after i was able to leave my bed though not to walk had i
been i am strongly of opinion i should have walked out of my house--
out of the city of philadelphia--and perhaps out of the united states
of america--nay and upon a pinch out of the world itself to get rid
of my beloved wife who would have believed in our village that john
h higginson who seemed to have nothing in the world to do but to
slaughter woodcocks beat his dog ponto and ride about in a fine new
barouche with a pair of horses that cost a thousand dollars who had a
dwelling-house in chestnut-street a brewery in the northern liberties
with an ale-butt as big as the basin of the mediterranean a goodly
store of real estate in town and country bank-stock and coal-mines
and a thousand other of the good things of the world--who i say
would have believed that this same john h higginson was decidedly the
most miserable dog in the whole universe it was truth every word of
it and before i was six days old in my new body i wished--no not
that the devil had me--but i was more than willing he should have the
better half of me i had the gout my wife was a shrew and i was--a
henpecked husband

yes the reader may stare and bless his stars--the manly john h
higginson who seemed to have no earthly care or trouble and who was
so little deficient in spirit that he could quarrel with a jersey
farmer while trespassing on his grounds shoot his bull-dog and take
aim at his negro had long since succumbed to the superior spirit and
acknowledged the irresponsible supremacy of his wife in the field
and at a distance from his house he was a man of spirit and figure
but at home the most submissive of the henpecked resistance against a
petticoat government is as all know the most hopeless of resistance
a single man has often subverted a monarchy and overturned a republic
but history has not yet recorded an instance of successful rebellion on
the part of a married man against the tyranny of a wife the tongue of
woman is the only true sceptre for unlike other emblems of authority
it is both the instrument of power and the axe of execution john h
higginson attempted no resistance against the rule of his wife the
few explosions of impatience of which he was now and then guilty were
punished with a rigour that awed him into discretion on this subject i
feel myself eloquent and i could expatiate on it by the hour but i am
writing not so much the history of my reflections as of my adventures
and i must hasten on with my story




chapter vii


a comparison between dunning and scolding with some thoughts on
suicide


no one but a henpecked husband who may happen to be shut up in prison
with his wife can appreciate the horror of the situation in which
i now found myself placed the gout prevented my escaping even for
a moment from the sway of my spouse she truly had me tied to her
apron-string and as i may say by a cord that went round my sore
foot i was a martyr to two of the greatest ills that ever afflicted
a son of adam and the two together were not to be borne either if
alone i might perhaps have tolerated in consideration of the many
good things that marked my lot i might have endured the gout if i
had had a wife who instead of scolding at me would have suffered me
as a good wife should to do all the scolding myself or i might even
have submitted to the tyranny of my margaret had i been able to beat a
retreat when i grew tired of it but my wife and the gout together were
not to be borne by any human being they set me after a while quite
distracted

what pleasure had i in being the rich john h higginson it was in vain
that my brother-in-law tim who it appears was the junior partner
and factotum in the brewery as well as manager-general of my affairs
bragged to me of the astonishing rise in my property and declared
i was already worth a hundred thousand dollars in the midst of my
exultation i heard my wife's voice on the stairs and my joy oozed out
of the hair of my head i could only look at tim and groan and tim did
the same for poor fellow though only her brother he was as much
henpecked as myself never mind said tim consolatorily your foot
will be well by-and-by and then we shall have a jolly time together
but my comforter took great care on such occasions to sneak out of the
house in good time and so leave me to bear the evil by myself

in the course of two weeks or thereabouts my foot had so far
recovered that i was able to put it on the ground and hobble about a
little with a crutch but i had lost all hope of ever being able to
resume my exercises in the field i was therefore reduced to despair
and my wife becoming more intolerable every day i began to be so weary
of existence that i was once or twice on the point of making away with
myself

she was in truth the nonpareil of women and of scolders i have
called her a shrew but it must not be supposed she was of that species
to which men give the name of tartar she was none of your fierce
pepper-tempered creatures who wrangle in a loud voice over the whole
house and sometimes take broomsticks to the servants such viragoes
are in a measure sufferable for they are sometimes in a good-humour
my margaret was of the family of croakers as they are called that
is of a lugubrious grumbling complexion always sad and whining full
of suspicions and reproaches now in tears now in hysterics always
in an ill-humour and so keeping every one about her in a state of
misery i never knew a servant male or female old or young black
or white to remain in the house two weeks at a time except a poor
little negress that had been bound to me--that is my prototype--under
indentures and she after running away a dozen times began to mope
and pine and look so sorrowful that out of pity i sent her home
to her mother as for myself being incapable of flying and exposed
all day long to her lectures and reproaches i became melancholy and
desperate wished myself sheppard lee again with the constable and
sheriff both after me and twice or thrice as i have hinted before
resolved to put an end to my life

one day while i was reading the papers i fell upon the account of
a man who had hanged himself he was in good circumstances said
the journal and had a wife and three children no reason has been
assigned or suspected for his rash act

no doubt his wife was a shrew said i to myself and there was no
way of getting rid of her and so it was the wisest thing the poor man
could do

i thought over this occurrence so long that it produced a great
effect upon my mind and my wife leaving me one day more incensed and
desperate than ever i snatched up a bit of cord that lay in my way
and resolved to strangle myself forthwith i should have hanged myself
over the chamber door but was in dread i might slip down to the floor
and hurt my foot and thinking it more genteel to die in my bed i made
the cord into a noose or ring through which having placed it about
my neck i clapped a silver candlestick by means of which i thought i
might twist the cord tight enough to strangle me and so i might had i
possessed the nerve but in truth i no sooner found my breath a little
obstructed than i became alarmed with the idea of apoplexy which was
always frightful to me and so gave over my purpose

on another occasion i sent to an apothecary whom i knew for a vial
of prussic acid which takes life so expeditiously that as i
supposed one could have no time to be in pain but that i might know
in what manner it operated i gave a quantity to a neighbour's cat
which had found her way into my chamber and made friends with me
during my confinement and the creature was thrown into such horrible
convulsions and set up such a diabolical yell that although she was
stone-dead in less than half a minute i was convinced this was the
most uncomfortable way of dying that could be hit on

i had then some thoughts of drowning myself and only hesitated whether
i should try the experiment in the bath-tub or wait until i could bear
a ride over the paving-stones to the river as to cutting my throat or
blowing my brains out i had never the slightest idea of trying either
for in respect to the former besides that it makes such a horrible
puddle of blood about one's body it causes one to look as vulgar and
low-lived as a slaughtered bullock and as for the latter i was so
familiar with fire-arms that i knew them to be weapons one cannot
trifle with

but fortune that had served me such a scurvy trick in saddling me with
gout and a scolding wife along with the wealth of john h higginson
willed that i should employ none of these deadly expedients against my
life but get rid of my distresses in a manner much more remarkable and
novel




chapter viii


sheppard lee forms sundry acquaintances some of which are genteel


it was three full weeks before i left my chamber and during the last
days of that confinement the only amusement i had consisted in looking
from the window after properly poising my leg on a soft cushion upon
what passed in the streets and this as the reader may suppose i only
enjoyed when my wife left off tormenting me for a moment to go down
stairs and torment the servants

this was poor pastime for one of my habits and turn of mind but my
wife had made me contemplative and had it not been for the perpetual
dread of her return that i was under i think i might have extracted
some diversion from what i saw in the streets but being in constant
fear and vexation i looked on with a spirit too morose and cynical for
my own enjoyment

day after day between the hours of five and six in the afternoon
i observed mr cutclose the tailor descend from his marble steps
and climb upon the back of a horse to take the evening air he
rode like one who had taken his chief lessons on the shop-board
and i often wondered he did not draw up his legs and sit on the
saddle hunker-fashion at once but what particularly struck me
was the compliment he paid himself of wearing his own coats cut
american-fashion about the arm-holes and so keeping himself in
purgatory all day long he used to give parties every fortnight and
invite all the dandies whom he had down in his tick-book by which
means his entertainments were rendered highly genteel and fashionable

next door to mr cutclose lived the great lawyer of our square the
celebrated coke butterside esq i could see him sally out every
morning with his green bag which he carried in his own hands either
because he intended to be a candidate at the next congressional
election and would seem democratic or because he was afraid if
he intrusted it to another the devil might snap it up as his own
property he had a lordly self-satisfied air about him as if he felt
the full merit of his vocation and prided himself upon having more men
by the ears than any other in the whole city his bow was exceedingly
condescending and his look protecting

nearer at hand was the dwelling of the old note-shaver--old goldfist
as they called him though his true name was skinner he was horribly
rich and such a miserly insatiable old hunks that although he had
ostensibly retired from business he was originally a pawn-broker
for some six or seven years he still kept up his trade in a certain
way that was not so reputable as gainful and of which i shall have
occasion to say something by-and-by he was said to be a good friend of
such desperate young gentlemen as moved in high life and had passable
expectations from rich uncles and parents but he was said to hold his
friendship at very extortionate prices how such a skinflint as he
ever came to live in a good house and in a fashionable quarter was a
question not easy to solve but according to tim my brother-in-law's
story he came for economy having got the house of a demolished
aristocrat who had fallen into his clutches and found it in so
dilapidated a condition that he chose to live in it himself rather than
submit to the expense of preparing it for a tenant it brought him
moreover nearer to his customers and perhaps the old curmudgeon who
had a daughter and a brace of hopeful sons had a hope of thus getting
them into society

but one who lives at heaven's gate does not live in heaven as the
saying is old goldfist kept neither horses nor carriages nor did he
give parties i doubt whether he ever asked anybody to dine with him
in his life and as for his boys and his girl all of whom were grown
up he kept them in such a mean condition that they were not company
for genteel people everybody despised them especially cutclose the
tailor who turned up his nose at them and called them rooterers
which i am told for i never troubled myself to study the modern
languages there being so many of them is a french word signifying
low people

 perhaps roturiers rooterers is however good america french
--printer's devil

this old money-maker who had a stoop in the shoulders used to
parade the street up and down before his own door every sunshiny
day in a thread-bare brown coat to which he sometimes added a blue
spencer roundabout a silver-headed stick in one hand and a yellow
handkerchief in the other the latter he was wont every two or three
minutes to clap to his nose producing thereby an explosion which
notwithstanding the muffler over his nostrils was prodigiously strong
and sonorous and once to my knowledge it frightened a young lady
into the gutter

i could say a great deal more of this old gentle man whom everybody
despised but whom every man took off his hat to on account of his
wealth but i shall have occasion to speak of him hereafter

as for the rest of my neighbours i do not think them worthy of notice
i might indeed except mr periwinkle smith my opposite neighbour
spoken of before whom i knew to belong to that order of aristocracy
which is emphatically termed chip-chop and who was of such pure blood
that it had known no mechanical taint for three different generations
the nearest approach to such disgrace being found in a family of
ragamuffins who claimed to be mr smith's relations merely because
they were descended from his grandfather but who were very properly
discountenanced by him

this old gentleman had a daughter who seemed to be universally admired
judging from the numbers of visiters of both sexes who besieged her
father's door every morning to do her justice i must say she was very
handsome but she had the additional merit of being an only child and
therefore an heiress as was supposed i thought so myself until tim
who knew something of everybody's affairs assured me that her father's
estate was eaten up by mortgages that he was poor as a rat and would
die insolvent

among the many young gentlemen who paid court to the fair miss smith
i noticed one who besides being more assiduous in his attentions
seemed also to enjoy a greater share of her regard than others he was
a young fellow of uncommonly genteel figure that is he was long and
lank somewhat narrow in the shoulders but clean-limbed and straight
as an arrow he had a long face and hollow cheeks but what his jaws
lacked in flesh was made up to them in beard his whiskers which
were coal-black being as exuberant as if made by a brush-maker and
stretching from his temples to the point of his chin and so enveloping
his whole face he had besides a pair of peaked mustaches that would
have done honour to the grand seignior and with a turban and caftan
on he might have paid his respects to the alumni of any college in the
land without even the necessity of speaking bad latin he dressed
well walked with a step as easy and majestical as a stork or an
ostrich and was evidently a favourite with the ladies

 here sheppard lee seems to have had in his eye a very ingenious
loafer of pearl slip or thereabouts who some years since was seized
with the whim of travelling and bamboozling the politic especially
the learned part thereof by the aid of little dog-latin horribly
anglicized in idiom and pronunciation a stock of gothamic impudence
and features truly yankee and vernacular he convinced the cognoscenti
of one or more learned institutions that he was a highly unlucky son
of a turk born all the way off at damascus

his name tim told me was i d--that is to say isaac
dulmer--dawkins though in consideration of the rusticalness of the
first member of the triad and from regard to his feelings which
were outraged by its pronunciation his friends had universally
agreed to suppress it and in consequence he was called i dulmer
dawkins esquire that title being added because it is the only one
an american gentleman not in office or the militia can claim he
was as timothy assured me a dandy of the true style being a born
scion of the chip-chop order and as such admitted to all its honours
and immunities though without the support of any living relations
in society or as his ill luck would have it of connexions either
he was said to possess some little property in town and what was
still better to be the heir of a rich uncle without children whom he
expected to die within a reasonable period as for his town property
my brother tim doubted its existence altogether and would perhaps
have been as skeptical in regard to the uncle had he not known that
an uncle did really exist and a rich one too for he was largely
concerned in the distilling and lumbering business on the susquehanna

i am particular in making the reader acquainted with mr i dulmer
dawkins inasmuch as it was my fortune after a time to fall into a
connexion with him myself--as intimate as it was unexpected

when i first saw him i accounted him an ugly and uncouth personage
and i regarded him with contempt and dislike i had acquired along
with other peculiarities of john h higginson a hearty hatred for all
people who considered themselves better than myself for rich and
respectable as i was i soon perceived that i was considered a very
low vulgar personage by the true chip-chop aristocracy and i longed
greatly at times as i looked out of the window upon them to take some
of them by the ears and settle the matter of superiority between us in
that way

but as for mr dulmer dawkins i soon began to experience an interest
in him which was indeed of a somewhat envious complexion i frequently
saw him dancing along at the side of the fair miss smith and he
seemed so exceedingly happy and content and she cast upon him so many
approving glances that i could not help contrasting his condition with
mine there he strutted in the open street young active and hale
as ignorant of disease as of care and here sat i in a sick chamber
imprisoned with the gout there he moved at the side of a young and
elegant woman who eyed him with admiration doubtless also with
regard and who had such native amiableness and cheerfulness imprinted
together on her countenance that it was plain she must prove a
blessing rather than a curse to him who should be so happy as to wed
her while i miserable i was tied to such a wife as i could scarce
have the cruelty to wish bestowed upon my worst enemy contracted to an
ague married as i may say to a toothache i should have been glad to
exchange conditions with mr dulmer dawkins--ay by my honour if there
was ever honour in man--or with anybody else

from tim's account it seemed that my young gentleman had a longer face
than head in other words that nature had endowed him more bountifully
with beard than brains and in truth i judged by the way he showed
his teeth and rolled his eyes at the fair miss smith and a thousand
other little grimaces and affectations i was witness to that he
was neither more wise nor brilliant than the others of his tribe
but what of that wisdom and care go hand in hand and wit makes us
uncomfortable fools are the only happy people so i used to think
while i looked on mr i d dawkins and the fair miss smith

but it is an ill way to pass time peeping into millstones or reading
men's history out of their faces dulmer dawkins had his cares as well
as another i suddenly missed him from the street the fair miss smith
made her promenades attended by other admirers and for three whole
days mr dawkins was invisible on the fourth he reappeared i saw him
as he came up the street escorting another belle entirely unknown to
me but of a dashing appearance as he passed mr periwinkle smith's
house the fair miss smith issued from the door mr dawkins made her a
low and most elegant bow his companion waved her fan and they passed
on looking unutterable things at one another the fair miss smith
seemed confounded a flush appeared on her face and then vanished
she looked after her admirer and then with her attendants two young
coxcombs who were with her descended the steps and walked down the
street i saw her once turn her head half round as if to look again
after dulmer but her curiosity anger sorrow or whatever feeling it
was prompted the movement was restrained and she strode off at an
unusually rapid and unfashionable gait so so my turtles have been
quarrelling i said to myself and the fair miss smith is just a
jezebel like the rest of her confounded sex--it never occurred to me
to think a quarrel arising between two persons of different sexes could
be caused by any thing but the unreasonable behaviour of the lady

it was two weeks before i saw dulmer dawkins again and then i beheld
him under a new aspect




chapter ix


the author grows weary of his wife and mistakes the schuylkill for the
river lethe--the tragical adventure that befell a young gentleman in
that romantic tide with its effects upon the destinies of sheppard lee


it may be supposed since i was able to amuse my mind with such
observations that they detracted from the miseries of my condition
or at least assuaged in some measure my pangs but as well might one
believe that the condemned malefactor who looks out from his cart
on the volunteer companies escorting him to the gallows and admires
the splendid incoherence of their trappings--their infantry coats and
horsemen's hats their republican faces and imperial colours--feels
thereby less dissatisfaction with his shroud and coffin and the rope
coiled so inelegantly round his neck my observations were made only at
intervals that were both brief and rare my wife was the most attentive
creature that ever set a husband distracted and under the plea of
nursing me gave me so much of her company that i was gradually driven
to desperation in course of time i was happily able to get into my
barouche and thus for a short hour or two escape my tormentor had
that period been deferred a week later i should certainly have taken
an ounce of arsenic that i found lying in a closet though i knew it
was awful bad stuff to swallow

as soon as i found myself once more at liberty i began to con over
a project i had formed of deserting my dear margaret altogether and
this i resolved to put into execution the moment my foot should be well
enough for travelling but oh horror just as the doctor pronounced me
cured i was seized with a second paroxysm and beheld nothing before
me but eternal captivity and unmitigated wife

this attack was brought on by the mere triumph of restoration the
afternoon before i drove out upon the schuylkill with tim and another
friend and several other jolly dogs meeting us we stopped together
at a well-known house of entertainment on the banks of that river and
resolved to enjoy ourselves i declare in all sincerity that i was
very moderate both in eating and drinking but having sat at the table
until after nightfall and being well content to tarry longer i made
a sudden and rash resolution not to return that night at all nor upon
the following day either if i could avoid it but as it was necessary
to account for my absence to my wife i instructed tim to tell her i
had contracted a sudden fit of podagra which made it proper i should
not expose myself to the night-air with this fib in his mouth tim
who considered the whole thing a capital joke as indeed he did every
other of my devising returned to the city whither he was followed by
the others before midnight

now whether it was that the immoderate satisfaction i indulged in at
enjoying even a few hours of quiet was an excess capable of bringing
on a paroxysm of gout--whether it was the unwholesome night-air of
the schuylkill so famous for its agues and bilious fevers or whether
indeed it was not the lie i had invented which was punished upon me in
the reality of the affliction i had assumed--it is certain that i woke
up the next morning in quite a feverish condition and with all the
symptoms of returning podagra though i did not immediately suspect it
it was not until towards nightfall that i understood my situation

in the meanwhile tim had returned and again driven back to town
without me to assure my affectionate spouse that being entirely
recovered i thought it best to defer my return until the evening at
which time i proposed to be sick again so as to excuse my remaining
from home a second night in this way i designed to put off my return
from night till morning and from morning till night as long as i
could

feeling a little better about dinner-time i indulged in a hearty meal
and then lay down but i had not slept many hours before i dreamed the
devil was tugging at my foot with a pair of red-hot tongs and starting
up in anguish i perceived clearly enough that my malady had returned

miserable wretch that i am i cried why was i not content to
be sheppard lee was poverty worse than the gout was debt equal
in torment to a scolding wife what a fool i was to change my
condition--would that i was now a dog

i hobbled down to the porch of the inn not without pain for my foot
was awfully tender and began to picture to myself the misery that was
inevitably prepared for me the thought of living a month longer in the
same house with my wife entirely at her mercy drove me to despair in
the midst of which being roused by the sound of approaching wheels
i looked up and beheld my wife herself advancing as fast as my
elegant bays could bear her to pay me a visit i knew her by her white
feathers and my brother tim was sitting at her side

at this sight my philosophy forsook me altogether i fell into a
phrensy and disregarding the condition of my foot or rather sharpened
and confirmed in my purpose by the pangs it gave me i rushed down
to the river-side towards a spot where i knew there was deep water
resolved to throw myself in without a moment's delay and this without
considering that as it was hot weather i should spoil the water drunk
by my fellow-citizens this was an objection that partly occurred to
me before when debating the subject of drowning and i think it so
serious a one that i would recommend to the councils of philadelphia
to appoint a bailiff whose express duty should be to prevent people
drowning themselves in the basin and the same person might have an eye
to the drowned cats dogs pigs calves dead fish and swimming boys
that somewhat detract from the agreeableness of the water

i reached the place just as the barouche drew up at the door and
hopping forward i began to slip off my coat and waistcoat and draw
out my watch and pocketbook though for what purpose i am sure i
cannot say but what was my surprise to perceive myself forestalled
in my intentions by another person who stood upon the very rock from
which i designed to throw myself and was evidently preparing to
exercise justice upon himself in the same summary way he was a tall
lank personage of highly genteel figure and habit but his back being
towards me i could not see his face

i had scarce laid eyes upon him before with a very violent motion of
his arm he cast his hat into the stream and immediately afterward
his neck-cloth then slapping his hands together like one who is
about rushing into a fight and rushing into it with resolution he
exclaimed the devil take all women and tailors and leaped into the
river which instantly closed over his head

i was so petrified at his rashness that i forgot my own and stood
staring on the water as it came rushing in agitated ripples to the
shore lost in such confusion and horror that for a space of a minute
or more i neither moved hand nor foot the water which previous to
the plunge had been as smooth as a mirror was fast regaining its
tranquillity when on a sudden a great bubbling began to appear a few
yards below the rock and i saw the top of a man's head come to the
surface and immediately after sink again

at that sight my presence of mind was restored and being much
concerned that a young fellow as he appeared to be should perish so
miserably i rushed into the river and being a good diver had but
little trouble to fish him up and drag him to the shore but i pulled
him out a moment too late he was as dead as a herring or appeared to
be for his countenance was distorted and blue as an in digo-bag and
his mouth full of foam a circumstance which i regretted the more as i
no sooner looked him in the face than i recognised the features of my
friend if i may so call him mr i dulmer dawkins

as i was dragging the body to the shore a carriage came rattling along
the road which is there so near to the river that those who were in
it could easily perceive the act in which i was engaged and they
stopped it to give me assistance it was at that very moment that i
discovered who it was i was carrying and i was so much surprised at
the discovery that i cried out in a loud voice i d dawkins by the
lord

there was immediately a great screaming in the carriage and out
rushed my aristocratical neighbour mr periwinkle smith with two
young ladies one of whom was his daughter and such an uproar and
lamentation as they made about me were perhaps never before made by so
small a number of genteel people on any occasion i was particularly
affected by the expressions of the fair miss smith who seemed overcome
by grief and as i did not doubt she had an affection for the young
fellow i wondered what folly could have driven him into this act of
suicide

but my wonder was not very long-lived the cries of the two ladies had
reached the inn and drawn every soul therein to the scene of disaster
they came running towards us and i saw that my wife was among them

i could maintain my equanimity no longer in the bitterness of my heart
i muttered almost aloud and as sincerely as i ever muttered any thing
in my life i would i were this addle-pate dawkins were it only to be
lying as much like a drowned rat as he

i had not well grumbled the last word before a sudden fire flashed
before my eyes a loud noise like the roar of falling water passed
through my head and i lost all sensation and consciousness

chapter i

the inconveniences of being drowned--the first chapter of the history
of i d dawkins esq


when i recovered my wits i thought i had got into the place which is
never mentioned among polite people except at church i perceived a
horrible smell of gin whiskey hartshorn tobacco-smoke and spirits
of firstrate camphire as if these made up the constituents of the
atmosphere of darkness and i saw though very obscurely for the light
was dim and there seemed to be films over my eyes a number of figures
that moved to and fro uttering discordant noises one of them it
seems and i took it for granted he was the chief devil stood by me
pressing my ribs with a fist that felt marvellously heavy while with
the other he maintained a grasp upon my nose to which ever and anon he
gave a considerable tweak while another little less dreadful stood
at his side armed with some singular weapon shaped much like a common
fire-bellows the nozle of which he held at but a little distance from
my own there were four others of them each of whom had me by a leg or
arm pulling and slapping with much zeal and as i supposed preparing
me for a gridiron while divers others flitted about as i mentioned
before talking with voices that appeared to me louder than thunder

such were the observations which i made vaguely and confusedly for
there was a great stupor over most of my senses and which led me
to suspect i was in the place of torment in which suspicion i was
confirmed by a thousand pangs i felt all over my body so strange
racking and horrible that unless one were to have the toothache
gout earache gravel rheumatism headache a stumped toe and locked
jaw all together it would be impossible to form any just conception of
the nature and variety of my torments i had i verily believed the
paddle-wheel of a steamboat in my head which was revolving full thirty
times a minute with a hideous crashing and clamour and churning
my brains to atoms and by the same rule i conceived there was an
iron-foundry in my lungs and heart every cell and cavity of which was
full of hot castings

but it would require a greater space than the subject is worthy of to
describe the agonies i endured in those moments of torture and they
were perhaps the more poignant since i could neither move a muscle
nor vent my distresses in a single cry--which i was the more inclined
to do from conceiving myself in the kingdom of darkness

when i opened my eyes i heard him who had me by the nose yell out
something to the others upon which there was a great stir and outcry
among them and i distinctly heard one say after a great oath we'll
do well enough without a doctor

what said i to myself have they doctors here too do they follow
their patients

but continued the same voice we'll never finish the job till we
roll him over a barrel he'll never show game till the water's out of
him

these words it may be supposed were sufficient to give my mind the
right cue and relieve me of all apprehensions in relation to death
and condemnation on the contrary they confirmed me the more strongly
in my conceit how there should be water in me i knew not but my idea
was the inhuman imps wished to roll it out of me only to make me burn
the better fortunately for me another voice made answer and opposed
the atrocious proposal

no rolling on barrels it said nor hanging up by the
heels--hanging up by the heels thought i--it is against the rules
of the humane society and here they are

the humane society thought i is there a humane society among the
devils

the rule is the second voice went on as soon as the body shows
signs of life snaps its eyes and breathes to pour a little brandy
and water down

brandy and water said the first voice evidently in a passion and
i wonder if that a'n't against the rules of the temperance society
better give the man so much burning brimstone

the temperance society thought i--i might have brought myself to
believe they had a temperance society as well as a humane one in
the lower regions had it not been for the violent ardour of him who
pronounced its name i knew by his rage and fury he could belong to
no temperance society but in the united states of america and the
inference was therefore plain that instead of being in the other
world i was in the united states of america myself

but before i could infer myself into this happy belief i was confused
by a hot argument that grew up between the advocates of the two
societies who waxed quarrelsome until there was a sudden cry the
doctor has come which pacified them in a moment and satisfied me i
was neither dead nor buried

the doctor stalked up to me i thought i knew his features and voice
but my sight and hearing were still confused i have no doubt he
treated me secundum artem but in about five minutes i was as dead as
ever




chapter ii


a conversation betwixt the author and his bosom friend john tickle
esq


however it was not my fate to die in good earnest by-and-by i opened
my eyes feeling in very passable health though somewhat weak and
dejected

the devils or my late attendants whoever they were had all vanished
and with them noise darkness and the various ill odours that had
afflicted my nostrils i was lying in a very good bed and chamber with
curtained windows the curtains being closed to keep out the sunshine
that was playing on them and at my side there sat in an arm-chair a
young gentleman of a buckish appearance sound asleep the creaking
of the bed as i rose on my elbow roused him he started rubbed his
eyes and looking me in the face burst into a hearty laugh

bravo he cried i told old boneset so i could watch as comfortably
as ever a child's nurse of messina i thought i should have the child
wake me with crying i vow to gad i've been snoozing all night and so
you've opened your peepers like an honest man at last dawky--pray
what the devil made you drown yourself

and here the young gentleman seizing me by the hand fell a laughing
again and that with more zest than before

sah said i looking at him with both surprise and confusion for
though his voice and face seemed familiar to me i could not for the
life of me say who he was sa--ah really i--ah-- and here i stopped
for first i knew not what to say and secondly my bewildered looks
set him into such a roar of merriment that there was no saying a word
to him

come you dog said he with a grin here and a roar there don't be
comical just after coming out of the grave a man just fished out of a
river and rescued from death after a hard fight between the doctor and
the devil should be serious and ecclesiastical solemn of visage and
sanctified of conversation no joking you dog but get up absalomize
and talk no joking i say no joking with jack tickle

as he spoke he seized me by the shoulder and dragged me half out of
bed

ged and demmee said i remember my foot for my toe catching in
the bed-cord i suddenly recollected the gouty member

i will said he with another roar for the lord knows tis the
best part of you spoil dawky's foot and ruin him with women and
shoe-makers for ever the one ceases to adore and the other trusts no
longer

but i mean the gout said i

the fiddlestick and fiddle said he whoever heard of a poor dandy
living on tick having the gout up dawky my dog and tell me what
set you to drowning if twas about betty small twas a small matter
what drown for being jilted if twas about the tailor's bill twas
still more ridiculous i say dawky my fellow what made you drown
yourself

drown myself said i but i said it with a stare the odd behaviour
and expressions of the young gentleman who called himself jack tickle
a name that i never remembered to have heard before in my life
although his countenance was certainly highly familiar and certain
queer associations his appearance gave birth to the singularity of
my feelings and more than all the appearance of my foot and leg
the former of which instead of being tumid and red with gout was
white and of elegant shape while the latter which but the day before
had a calf to compare with any old quaker's in arch-street was now
as lank as a sword-blade i say these circumstances had the effect
to increase my confusion to that degree that i felt like one who is
asleep and knows it--provided one ever did or can feel so

in the midst of all i suddenly cast my eyes upon a goodly large
looking-glass that hung against the wall and saw my reflection
therein it was the image of mr i dulmer dawkins his exact
representation perfect in beard and visage save that the former was
in great disorder and the latter somewhat white and equally perfect
in figure as far as i could compare a man in buff and linen to one in
the full panoply of the tailor

my ged said i i am transformed again

and with that i made a hop up to the glass to look at myself closer
there was no mistaking the matter even if the looking-glass had i
looked at my legs and i gave a tweak at my mustaches my shoulders
were elegantly narrow and my foot as sound as a savage's i jumped up
cut a pigeon-wing and then descending attempted a ballet-dancer's
pirouette after which i looked again into the glass i was a young man
of twenty-five and the most elegant fellow i ever laid eyes on

i ran to jack and hugged him round the neck crying lard jack you
rogue i'm the most comical creature that ever lived

ay said he smothering with laughter and my embraces together but
what made you drown yourself

i recollected all about it and suddenly felt astonished i remembered
how i had jumped into the water and how i had fished myself out as
dead as a poker that is how mr higginson had fished me or rather
how i had fished mr dawkins i remembered how i john hazlewood
higginson had wished to be mr i dulmer dawkins and now i was mr i
dulmer dawkins himself and nobody but he i sat down on the bedside
marvelling how such a thing could be and the wonder of it was indeed
amazing that my spirit should creep into a man's body though strange
enough was not so prodigiously surprising but that my spirit and
body together for i did not know it had been otherwise disposed of
especially so corpulent a one as john h higginson's should get into
one--that was truly marvellous

but my study was brought to an end by tickle suddenly exclaiming with
a voice of concern curse him gad poor fellow i believe he has
washed his wits out he has gone mad

no more than you have said i shaking him by the hand but you must
allow it is a most extraordinary affair

pon honour yes said he laughing as hard as ever but what made
you throw yourself into the river

why said i in a hurry to save dawkins

to save dawkins said he looking at me as one would look at a
shoemaker who brings a pair of shoes home the day he has promised them

that is said i to save higginson

to save higginson he cried with such a roar of laughter as made
my teeth rattle why there were twenty people saw higginson drag you
out i say dawky no lillibullering--what did you jump into the river
for

i jumped said i quite in a quandary after my hat

at this answer my friend jack tickle threw himself upon the bed where
he rolled over and over until his coat was covered with down and
feathers which cooled his transports a little

i see said he i see it was the last of the family for hatters
tick was exhausted right dawky in such straits of credit i think i
should have jumped after mine who would not fight roast or drown
for his hat when it was the last decent one he ever expected to
have on his head i am glad this was the cause it makes me think
better of you i thought like the rest it was on account of your
disappointment from the adorable betty--

the devil take betty said i but without well knowing why

he has cried jack uproariously at least a poor devil has
she has thrown away her seventy thousand upon a fellow no more to be
compared with you than a tame goose with a wild one and instead of
spending it like a man the rascal will buy stocks and save it i
say dawky you must have been surprised at her conduct--as we all
were--really we thought you had her and there was no one more
certain than the fair miss smith

the devil take the fair miss smith said i

he will said tickle shaking his head and laughing or if he
don't i don't know who will for it is a clear matter--dad's done up
entirely and they say the sheriff is already making an inventory of
his chattels a great pity dawky for if she had but money miss
smith would be certainly an angel incarnate--a nymph a houri--the
finest woman in town i say dawky i think she almost had you




chapter iii


in which sheppard lee is prepared for the brilliant destiny that awaits
him


there were many things in the conversation of my friend tickle which i
did not exactly comprehend though i had a vague confused appreciation
of all and afterward understood him well enough the fact is i was
in the same difficulty which had beset me when scarce warm in the body
of mr higginson that is a confusion of characters propensities
and associations only that the last were imperfect as if my memory
had suddenly given way and besides the difficulty was in both cases
increased by the feeling of amazement with which for several hours
when properly conscious of it i pondered over the marvel of my
transformation how such a thing could happen or had happened i knew
no more than the man in the moon it was a new thing in the history of
man and there was nothing in philosophy at least such philosophy as
i had at that time to explain it i had certainly done nothing on my
part in either case to effect a change save merely wishing it and
it seemed to me that i possessed a power never before known to a human
being of transferring my spirit from body to body whenever i willed
at least under certain circumstances but on this subject i will have
more to say hereafter

happen how and by what means it might it was certain a transfer had
taken place and that i was no longer the poor miserable john h
higginson with the gout and a scolding wife the conception and full
consciousness of which were so rapturous that i suddenly bounded on
my feet and danced about like a madman now running to the glass to
admire my youthful and elegant appearance and now flinging my arms
round the neck of my friend and hugging him twenty times over

the conversation that passed between us was exceedingly joyous and
varied though as i said before i had but an imperfect understanding
of many things tickle said for which reason i will record no more of
his expressions lest they should confuse the reader's mind as they
did mine some things however i gathered from him in relation to my
catastrophe and resuscitation which are proper to be told

it seems that when i--that is john h higginson--wished i were or
might be the defunct dulmer dawkins i fell down under a sudden
stroke of apoplexy which was supposed to be caused by my exertions
to rescue the unfortunate beau and indeed i saw in the first
newspaper i looked into upon getting to philadelphia afterward a
long account of my demise with a highly eulogistic and affecting
account of my heroism in sacrificing my life for another's for as
the paragraph stated i was of a full and plethoric habit strongly
inclined to apoplexy of which i was aware myself as well as of the
danger of over exertion and therefore my act was the more truly
heroic the paper was of a highly democratic character and the notice
was closed by a ferocious warning to the young bug of aristocracy
meaning the elegant and fashionable i dulmer dawkins to remember
when wasting his trivial existence in that heartless society whose
pleasures were obtained at the expense of their worthier though poorer
fellow-creatures that the preservation of it had cost the nation one
of its most excellent citizens and the world a virtuous man and pure
patriot--by which i understood that john h higginson was of the
democratic party although that was a circumstance of which the gout
and my wife had kept me ignorant as long as i lived in his body

as for me--that is i d dawkins--being lugged into the tavern along
with my late tenement the body of john h higginson i was fallen
foul of by all hands and what with tweaking my nose beating my arms
scorching my legs with hot bricks flaying me with salt whiskey
spirits and such things and filling my lungs with dust and ashes
from an old fire-bellows i was brought to life again greatly to
the triumph of my tormentors before the appearance of a physician
who however subsequently assured me they had revived me with such
effect as to give him double trouble to keep me in the land of the
living afterward for it seems after being more dead than alive all
that night i had remained in a kind of stupor all the following day
from which i awoke on the second morning well enough as the doctor
prognosticated i would be but only after i had remained more than
thirty-six hours in a state of insensibility

as for my body--that is higginson's--it had the honour after being
cogitated over by the coroner of riding home in my splendid barouche
with the thousand-dollar hourses but whether my wife went with it or
not i never cared to inquire it was enough she was gone and oh
rapture of raptures gone for ever

my friend tickle illuminated me as to other matters especially in
relation to the fair miss smith with whom it seems and i recollected
all about it when he had set my new associations properly to work i
had been quite particular until he himself discovered the insolvency
of her father's estate when and this i began to recollect in the same
manner i instantly turned my attentions upon another--the fair miss
small--who jilted me these things i say i soon began to recall to
mind as well as many other incidents in the past life of i dulmer
dawkins and indeed in the course of a few days i was as much at
home in his body and among his affairs as he had ever been himself
but of this anon i learned that mr periwinkle smith after seeing
me lodged in the tavern had driven off to town to engage medical
assistance and this he did so effectually that i had no less than
seven doctors at one time to send me their bills which was a very
foolish thing of them

of these things i say i discoursed with my friend jack tickle
whose conversation together with the happy consciousness i had of my
transformation infused inexpressible vivacity into my spirits i was
marvellously pleased at the idea of being a fine young fellow with the
freedom of chip-chop society and i was impatient to return to the city
to enjoy my happiness

bravo said jack we'll walk in together but do you know dawky he
went on nodding and winking that this is a cursed no-credit place
and that the man below betrayed a certain vulgar anxiety about scot and
lot and the extra expenses you had put him to what do you say about
paying

really said i clapping my hands into my pockets i have forgotten
my pocketbook

to be sure you have said tickle laughing but why need you tell me
so i am no shop-keeper

i mean said i in alarm demmee that i have lost it and with that
hundred-dollar bill my brother tim--

your brother tim said tickle who's he

i was struck all aback i remembered that i was i d dawkins

tickle perceived my confusion and enjoyed it attributing it to
another cause

right said he grinning with delight but don't make any pretence
with me i didn't expect you to have any money and the lord be
thanked i have i'll square your account my dear fellow and help you
to a pigeon besides

with these words and many others not needful to be mentioned he
led the way down stairs where he became astonishingly grave and
dignified--a peculiarity i found myself falling into--slapped his ratan
against his legs called for his friend dawkins's bill and paid
it--that is i suppose he did for i stalked out upon the porch as if
i considered such vulgar matters beneath my notice

here being soon joined by tickle and the day proving uncommonly fine
we set out on foot towards the city and i was conducted by my friend
to the door of my own lodgings




chapter iv


in which sheppard lee has an interview with a lady who tells him a
secret


in and mount said tickle i see jem puddle in the street yonder
and i have an idea i can borrow fifty dollars of him i will drop round
on you by-and-by

so saying tickle started off and left me at the door of my lodgings
i had a sort of confused recollection of the place though i had never
seen it before in my life--the dingy bricks and weather-stained
marble the rickety old iron railing on the steps and the ugly
worn-out brass plate with the j sniggles engraved thereon rose on
my memory like old acquaintances who had grown out of it the house
might have been a fashionable one in its day nay for the matter of
that it was not so humble in appearance but that a gentleman might
have lived in it if too poor to inhabit a better and though out of
the world being in a street called eighth it was within hail of
chestnut nevertheless it was but a poor place compared with my late
dwelling my house in chestnut the recollection of which together
with the reflection that i entered this only as a lodger somewhat
abated the transport of my joy ah thought i what a pity in giving
up john h higginson's gout and wife i had also to give up his house
and money but the recollection of the two first-named possessions was
fresh upon me and i ceased to murmur

i ascended the steps and rang the bell somewhat faintly i must
acknowledge for though i had my friend tickle's assurance and a
confused consciousness of my own that i was at the right place there
was a certain strangeness in it naturally arising from my situation
that made me hesitate the door however opened and the reception
that followed convinced me i was not intruding where i was not known

the door was opened by a bouncing irish wench of some twenty-five
years or thereabouts with hair as yellow as a broom-whisk and
shoulders twice as broad as my own besides which she was not
handsome she had staring gray eyes brick-coloured cheeks a nose that
looked up at her forehead and a mouth not so ugly as spacious

i was about to pass by this fair apparition with no further notice than
a nod which i made somewhat instinctively but i was not fated to get
off so easily no sooner did she lay eyes upon me than she set up a
squeak oh hubbuboo and is it you misther dawkins dear and
threw her great beef-steak arms round my neck

an embrace from a creature of her attractions i could have easily
dispensed with yet i might have been affected by her joy at seeing
me return alive from the bottom of the river it was so truly natural
and exuberant had she not been in a great hurry to qualify it oh
murder dear she cried and i'm glad for they said bad luck
till'em the vagabones you was drownded dear and was after chating
me out iv my money for the washin and mindin

the washing and mending thought i do i patronise such a tasty body
as this and do i owe her money

but while i muttered thus within the girl giving me another hug that
i thought would have made my shoulders change place with one another
roared out in continuation--

och throth but the man must drown dape that chates nora magee of her
own musha hinny darlint jist pit yer finger into yer pocket and pull
me out the tin dollars and seventy cents that you owe me

certainly nora said i and succuba let me go but ged now nora
i cried for well i knew my pockets were as empty as the promises i
intended to make her and i was driven by a sort of instinct upon the
proper course for pacifying the harpy--a course i suppose that
i--that is my prototype the true dawkins--had often practised
before--i say nora don't talk of dollars and cents for i intend to
pay you in eagles and half-eagles some of these days when my uncle
comes and besides nora you jade you i intend to give you a buss
into the bargain as ged i believe i will now

and with that i returned the compliment she had paid me took the great
creature by the neck and yea faith and i presume i should have done
the same thing with my tailor if he could have been managed the same
way absolutely kissed her

och blessings on yer pritty face said she looking pleased and
disappointed together but wiping her mouth as if to prepare for a
second salute and that's the way you bamboozles me wid your uncles
and your thricks upon a poor cratur's modesty but oh misther
dawkins dear ye'r lookin sick and pokey and so i'll not be after
throubling you and i hopes your uncle will be soon in phillydelphy
for there's our ould sniggles the hungry ould nagur that i should be
saying so of the master o the house that gives me a dollar a week
and a new bonnet at christmas he's been rampin and roarin and
swearin like a turk my heavy hathred on him he'll be havin you up
before the constables and squires for the dirty rint-money the ould
divil that you owe him

the rent-money thought i and i began to have a sort of feeling
about me i do not know what but it was not agreeable i clapped my
hand into my pocket there was a pocketbook there but i had examined
it before and there was nothing in it my mind began to misgive me a
little it was apparent the worthy i d dawkins had not yielded me his
body without leaving me some of his debts to pay and as to what means
of discharging them he might have bequeathed i was yet in the dark

i ascended to my rooms of which i discovered i had a brace but i was
in some dudgeon to find them in the third story very odd said i to
myself that i should be a fashionable man and a dandy and live in a
third story my instincts had gone nigh as i climbed the stairs to
carry me into a chamber on the first floor but arrah now hinny
said nora you'd be after forgetting you agreed to give up the best
chambers till yer uncle comes to town--bad luck to him for keeping me
so long out iv my tin dollars

this uncle of mine thought i will settle all pothers but who he
was or what sort of claim i had upon him i knew no more than the man
in the moon my associations acted but slowly and imperfectly and when
i strove to look back upon the past history of my new body i felt
like a man who has clapped upon his nose his grandmother's spectacles
through which he can behold objects indeed but all so confused
distorted and mystified that they serve only to bewilder his vision
thus i beheld when i made the effort a jumble of events and persons
crowded together on my memory but without being able to seize upon any
one and examine it to my satisfaction i had an uncle it seemed but i
could not recall any thing like a recollection of having ever seen him
but time thought i will set these things right




chapter v


an inventory of a young gentleman's effects with some account of mr
sniggles his landlord


my chambers were but meanly furnished and this--but it needs not i
should acquaint the reader with the divers proofs that rose every
moment to convince me mr i d dawkins though a dandy was not a rich
one before i had rummaged an hour among his chattels i discovered
enough to set me into a cold shiver and almost make me repent having
taken possession of his body i found lying upon his table no less
than thirty-seven folded papers--the tribute doubtless of the two days
of his absence--of which eight were either billetsdoux or mere cards
of invitation to ladies parties and twenty-nine were letters from
tailors shoemakers c all of them requesting payment of money owed
and most of them as ferocious in spirit as they were original in style
and grammar in an old trunk which i ransacked as well as every chest
of drawers and closet in the rooms the keys were ready at hand in my
pocket i discovered a bushel or two of bills--i suppose there may
have been a thousand of them for they were of all dates--not one of
which had a receipt to it

but to make amends for this evil i found mr i d dawkins's wardrobe
in pretty good condition except in the article of shirts of which i
discovered but six and those none of the best however there were
three dozen good dickeys and a great abundance of loose collars
and wristbands with which i perceived i might do without shirts
altogether

but what gave me most pleasure and indeed quite consoled me under the
feelings of disappointment and doubt that had begun to rise was a
marvellous great quantity of love-letters locks of hair finger-rings
odd gloves c that i found scattered about each as was apparent
the tribute or spoil of some admiring fair aha said i i am a
devil of a fellow among the girls who can resist me the idea of
being a favourite among the women and the prospect i had of shooting
conquests among them right and left were infinitely agreeable ged
and demmee said i i will look about me now and fix for life i will
pick out the finest creature i can find who has a fortune and marry
her and then i say demm all tailors and other people i will marry a
wife eged

it was doubly remarkable i should make such a resolution having had
but lately such a lesson of the joys of matrimony but i found myself
fast growing another man i still retained a lively recollection of
mrs higginson but fancy pictured an angel in the anticipated mrs
dawkins dim visions--which seemed to be made up as much of crude
recollections as of half-formed anticipations--dim visions of lovely
eyes and noses floated over my brain i sank into a soft elysium-like
revery when i suddenly heard a voice somewhat tremulous and feeble
but rude as the screech of a strawberry-woman in spring saying

sir i say sir mr dawkins i shall trouble you i say for the
amount of that ere small account

the accents were more horrible to my soul than the grating of a
dentist's file upon the tenderest of grinders i looked up from my
feet which i had been admiring and beheld a visage somewhat iracund
and savage but so vulgar and plebeian in all its lineaments that my
fear was changed into contempt

and i say sare whoever you ah said i looking the fellow to the
soul what do you want he-ah who ah you

at these questions the man looked petrified he opened his mouth till
i thought his under jaw would drop off and stared at me in dumb
amazement i had some hopes he was about to fall down in a fit i am
not naturally of a bloodthirsty turn but i knew he was a dun and such
persons one always wishes the devil would snatch up but he recovered
his tongue and to do him justice i must confess he used it with a
spirit i did not look for in such a mean shrivelled-up body as he had

don't go for to insult me said the goth gritting his teeth and
spluttering his words through them as through a watering-pot i'll let
you know who i am i'll have my money or i'll have the worth on it out
on you for i won't be cheated no more for nothing and as for what i'm
doing here i'll let you know as how i'm master in my own house and
as mrs sniggles says--

sniggles said i recollecting that the rascal was my landlord and
creditor i started up and seizing the enraged little man by the hand
i begged his pardon

really my dear soul said i i was in a brown study and i didn't
know you pray how d'ye do how is mrs sniggles you must know i have
hardly yet got over my unfortunate fall into the water really sah i
was almost drowned and i had the misfortune to lose my pocketbook

none on your gammon on me said mr sniggles looking as intrepid as
ever for i don't believe none on it and i don't believe you're no
gentleman neither or you wouldn't keep me out of my money you see
mr dawkins do you see you've had my rooms five months and i ha'n't
seen the colour on your money over once it's all promise and no pay
and so as i was saying i won't be diddled no longer or i'll see the
end of it for as mrs sniggles says we can't afford to be diddled
for nothing

come sniggles said i don't be in a passion i'll pay you what's
the amount

seventeen weeks on the second story seven dollars a week--monstrous
cheap at that considerin there's breakfast in--one hundred and
nineteen dollars--and taking off the ten dollars you paid me as per
account one hundred and nine dollars four weeks on the third story
at five dollars and a half and good rooms too twenty-two dollars
and adding the ten dollars i paid the shoe-maker and the five dollars
sixty cents i loaned you to pay the fine at the mayor's office for
smashing the lamp makes jest a hundred and forty-one dollars sixty
cents no halves nor quarters precise and the sooner you shows me the
money the better

a confounded long bill that sniggles said i but i don't dispute
it and the moment my uncle comes to town--

the mean avaricious fellow had begun to look happy as he conned over
the hateful particulars of his account which he held in his hand but
no sooner had the words my uncle left my lips than he began to jump
up and down pulling his hair gritting his teeth and shaking his
fists like a mad-man and to my astonishment the contemptible fellow
waxed profane and actually cursed me and my uncle too his oaths
as may be supposed only made him appear more low-lived and vulgar
than before for cursing and swearing are the hardest things to do
genteelly that i know there are but few persons in the world who
can produce an oath with any thing like elegance it is the truest
criterion of gentility and in consequence i would recommend no person
to attempt one who is not confident of his high breeding

my landlord mr sniggles fell to cursing and swearing and insulted
me very grossly first by affecting to believe that no such person
as my uncle existed secondly by threatening to turn me out of his
house and thirdly by assuring me he would have his account in an
attorney's hands before i was an hour older it was in vain i exhorted
him to moderate his passion and strove to wheedle him into a better
humour i had forgotten or rather i did not yet know the true secret
of his character which was cowardice by addressing my arguments to
which i might have readily brought him to reason but in truth i was
frightened myself how i was to pay a bill of a hundred and forty-one
dollars sixty cents was a thing only to be guessed at and the prospect
of taking up my lodgings in the debtors apartments up arch-street was
as vinegar and wormwood to my imagination

the more i strove to sooth the wrath of mr sniggles the more
ferocious he became until at last he did nothing but dance round and
round me like a little dog barking at a big one that is tied to a
post crying out all the time frantic with despair and fury pay me
what you owe me pay this here bill here pay me my money or i'll have
you in jail with other expressions equally foolish and insulting




chapter vi


sheppard lee hears news of his uncle and mr sniggles is brought to
his senses


in the midst of my troubles up comes my friend tickle and pops into
the room he gave a stare at sniggles and next a grin and then just
as i was looking to be laughed at he made a spring and caught me round
the neck crying with uncommon exultation and eagerness--

i congratulate you dawkins you dog and mind you must lend me five
hundred dollars tomorrow

before i could answer a word to this surprising address he turned upon
sniggles and looking black as a thunder-cloud cried--

hah sniggles what is the fellow doing here dunning you for his
money the scoundrel hah what

i thought he would have kicked the poor man out of the room and so
thought sniggles also for though he exclaimed touch me if you dare
he ran to the door where he looked vastly alarmed and was able to
muster only a single expression of resolution i asks my money said
he and dang me but i'll have it for as mrs sniggles says i'll not
be diddled for nothing

pay the rascal his dirty money and then be done with him leave his
house and patronise him no more said jack then turning to me he
made three skips into the air clapped his hands and running up to me
and giving me a second embrace cried--

angels horses and women hug me kiss me and lend me that five
hundred dollars--your uncle has arrived

uncle what uncle said i

why your uncle wiggins--your rich old uncle--your dad of an
uncle--your bank and banker--your--but i say dawky you'll lend
me that five hundred won't you saw him at the hotel--just
arrived--asked anxiously for his nephew dawkins--bad look about the
eyes--will die in a month and then--then my fellow fourteen
thousand a year if it's fourteen hundred

fourteen thousand a year echoed i the words were also muttered over
by sniggles i caught the fellow's eye he looked confounded and uneasy

if that's so said he then i hope mr dawkins will pay me my money
and not take no offence for none wasn't intended

pay you your money said jack tickle stepping up to him in a rage
no you rapacious dun he sha'n't pay you a cent you shall sue him
and get judgment and wait six months for your money

no you rascallion said i i won't take that revenge of such a low
fellow i'll pay you your money and be done with you but jack i
say demmee let's be off let's run down to my uncle wiggins

wiggins said my landlord why you always said his name was
wilkins

and so it is said tickle wiggins p wilkins the rich and
well-known wiggins p wilkins but what do you want here have you had
your answer what do you mean by intruding here you'll get your money
and so if you please do mr dawkins and me the favour to walk down
stairs or--

well said my amiable creditor whose fury was quite overcome by
tickle's violence and his report of my uncle's arrival i always
said mr dawkins was a gentleman and would pay me one day or another
and one day's just as good as another and so i hopes he'll take no
offence but as for you and the likes of you mr tickle said the
little man endeavouring to assume courage i don't like to be abused
in my own house but howsomever as you're mr dawkins's friend i'll
say no more about it

and with that my gentleman walked down stairs

let us go said i let us run--let us fly

where said tickle

why to my uncle where is he

where cried tickle bursting into a roar of laughter are you as
big a fool as sniggles you didn't believe me ah lud is there nobody
witty but myself

and my uncle a'n't come then said i what made you say so

to rid you of a dun my fellow said jack i saw the rascal had
worked himself into a phrensy and that you were at your wit's end
i had pity on your distresses and so ran in with a huge lie as
irresistible as a broadsword to the rescue victory and jo pæan i
have routed the enemy and you are no longer in fear keep up the fire
and you are easy for a week

but my uncle really intends to leave me that fourteen thousand a
year said i

has he got it said jack giving me a comical stare

jack said i after pausing a little i want to ask you a favour

have but twenty-five in the world said tickle pulling out his
pocketbook but you shall have ten

it isn't that said i i want you to tell me my history

your history said tickle staring at me in surprise




chapter vii


in which sheppard lee is told his history


an idea had suddenly seized me and i must say that up to this time
it was the most brilliant one that ever entered my mind my ignorance
of mr i d dawkins's affairs was still highly inconvenient and
oppressive and i was determined with my friend's assistance to
remove it

tickle said i i really believe the doctor has only half
resuscitated me my body is pretty well but my mind is only so-so
would you believe it my memory is quite gone

as to your debts certainly said jack so is mine

ged said i tis gone altogether really it seems to me as if i
had only begun existence this morning my recollection of all events
and even persons known anterior to my sop in the river is so
imperfect you can't conceive would you believe it i really didn't
know that rogue sniggles and had to ask him his name the ladies
too jack--miss smith miss small and the rest that you were talking
about--who the deuse are they i have heard much talk of my uncle too
have i an uncle and if so who and what is he for i swear pon
honour jack i know no more than the man in the moon in a word jack
demmee i am in my second childhood and you must help me out of it
give me therefore my history my whole history and tell me all about
me for may i be dunned to death if i rightly know who i am

you don't said jack well that's funny but i have heard of such
things before is a dip in cold water then so hard on the memory
i say dawky my fellow couldn't we contrive some way to dip our
creditors but eged now dawky you a'n't serious

i am said i and i beg you'll give me an idea who i am and all
other things appertaining

oh said tickle who seemed vastly diverted by my embarrassment
that is soon done you are a dandy of pure blood and poor as a church
mouse but not yet out of favour your father who was a dandy before
you and in prime esteem having bought his way into notice with two or
three cargoes of indigo and young hyson for he was an india merchant
properly laid out in elegant entertainments gave up trade to live a
gentleman and died one leaving you an elegant fellow and ignoramus
as a gentleman's son should be to spend his leavings this you have
done dawky and most gloriously for five years none of us the sons
of nabobocracy could compare with you in dash flash and splash but
even phaeton fell horses galloped away buggies and curricles rolled
into the gutter and tailors looked alarmed--stocks flew out at the
window bricks and mortar took to themselves wings and your stockings
began to want darning then said dawkins i will marry a wife and
he looked loving at periwinkle's fair daughter and periwinkle's fair
daughter looked loving at dawkins and dawkins calling counsel of his
friend john tickle of ticklesbury manor beheld and lo periwinkle's
fair daughter's father's fine estate was fenced round with rows
of mortgages as thick and thorny as prickly-pears whereupon the
inconstant swain forgetting his vows ran to the elegant miss small
who smiled on him and married another and the loss of this adorable
fair fortune and all together with an uncommon fit of dunning
so affected my friend's spirits that he threw himself into the
schuylkill whence he was fished by a fellow called what-d-ye-call-it
a brewer

well said i but do you mean to say i have squandered all my
property

every sous said my friend it is just six weeks since you spent the
last dollar of the last term of your annuity

what annuity said i

why the five years annuity you bought of old goldfist is it
possible you don't recollect him don't you remember the row of
negro-houses you owned down in southwark

i don't said i

a piece of arrant cheating sheer swindling said tickle but
when did old skinner ever make an honest bargain the houses and
lot of ground worth two thousand as they stood but title good and
indefeisible and capable of being made worth twenty thousand i
remember you offered em to old goldfist for seven what said the old
hunks give me immediate possession and thereupon you shall have a
bonus of a thousand on the nail together with the same sum yearly
for five years provided you live so long--if not then as long as
you live snapped like a gudgeon and was bit and on the fifth
year--beginning of august last had the last integer of payment with
comfort of seeing a property you had sold for six thousand yielding
its possessor just that much a year

the geds said i has old goldfist six thousand a year

say sixty replied jack

tickle said i the old curmudgeon has a daughter i'll marry her

no you won't said my friend shaking his head mournfully old
goldfist is too well acquainted with your affairs and unless you have
his consent what will you get by her

tickle said i i must marry somebody or be ruined but stay
there's my uncle now my dear fellow who is he

faith said tickle i don't know always supposed he belonged to the
apocrypha and was used to argue duns into good manners nobody sues
a young fellow that has good expectations from a rich uncle but now
i think of it i believe you did once tell me you had an uncle--some
vagabond trading fellow or other--in the west but i never heard you
say you expected any thing of him i thought you called him wiggins
but sniggles says wilkins all's one however for i remember you said
he had brats of his own

i began to feel uncomfortable and upon questioning my friend further
i discovered that my situation was far from being agreeable i had a
horrible quantity of debts on my shoulders and no fund to discharge
them and what was worse i found that my means of subsistence were
not only precarious but i had good reason to fear they were any
thing but reputable my dear friend john tickle though a gentleman
and dandy it was plain was a personage who lived by his wits and
i began to see that mr i d dawkins was another from tickle's
expressions i perceived that our chief dependance lay in the noble
trade of pigeon-hunting as this is a word some of my readers may be
too unsophisticated to understand i will explain it and in very few
words as there are in the world young fellows of plebeian origin
but full pockets who are ambitious to figure in elegant society so
there are also in elegant society sundry youths of better fame than
fortune who are willing to patronise them provided any thing can
be made by their condescension in which case the happy phaeton is
taught to spend his money in ways most advantageous to his patrons
though by no means to his own profit such a young gentleman is then
called a pigeon and is allowed to flutter in the sunbeams while his
eagle-clawed friends are helping themselves to his feathers the last
of which being abstracted he is commonly called a fine fellow and
kicked out of their company i cannot pretend to say what degree of
relish my prototype the true i d dawkins may have had for such
a mode of existence but i must aver in my own defence that i had
throughout the whole adventure while in his body so much of sheppard
lee's original sense of honour and honesty hanging about me that i was
more than once shocked at the meanness and depravity of such a course
of life and when i first understood the thing from tickle i was so
ashamed of myself that had i lighted upon the body of any decent man
at the moment i do verily believe i should have done my best to get
into it and so put an end to mr i d dawkins altogether but men's
bodies are not like the dry-goods dealers boxes in market-street to
be stumbled into at any moment

it was some comfort to me to find that our practice in this particular
was so little known that both tickle and myself--but myself more
especially--were considered in the main very excellent exemplary
young men as far as dandies could be and were still allowed to mingle
in elegant society

as for tickle indeed i soon discovered he was in but doubtful odour
with the ladies at least with their mammas for he had been for
some years living on his wits but i on the contrary being pretty
universally regarded as the heir-expectant of a rich uncle and being
besides a prettier fellow was received with general favour and
approbation

having obtained from tickle as much of my or mr i d dawkins's
history as was necessary i gave my worthy friend to understand i
should need his advice and assistance in returning into society for
said i and very truly too i really sha'n't know anybody and shall
feel very awkward here i added are two invitations for this very
evening--one from mrs pickup and the other from the misses oldstyle
now who is mrs pickup and who are the oldstyles and where the
mischief do they live

it is very odd you should forget so much said tickle and then
proceeded to give me the information i wanted promising also to go
with me to both places himself and prompt me through all difficulties




chapter viii


a conversation with a tailor sheppard lee finds himself in a situation
truly appalling


having thus got upon the subject of the ladies we--that is tickle
and myself--fell into a highly agreeable conversation in the course
of which i lost sight of all my fears and anxieties until they were
suddenly recalled by the entrance--and a very unceremonious one it
was--of a tall fellow with hinge knees and crow-bar elbows fashionably
dressed but whom there was no mistaking for aught but a vulgarian i
knew his errand before he spoke and so did tickle who instantly cried
out

snip the tailor eged and another paroxysm of dunning

servant mr dawkins--servant mr tickle said the gentleman
giving each of us a scrape hope no intrusion and no offence wouldn't
go to controvert gentlemen on no account but talking of accounts mr
dawkins hope you'll excuse me wouldn't dun a gentleman for the world
but have a cussed note in bank for cloth and must make up the sum by
to-morrow and so if it's convenient mr dawkins shall be obliged
for the amount of bill

my uncle said i--

can't go that no more said the tailor can't go that no more
begging pardon bill outstanding nineteen months and over wouldn't
mind letting it run the year out but for the cussed pressure on the
money-market no money to be had nowhere

right said jack and what makes you suppose you will get it here
now snip my dear fellow make yourself short tis not convenient
just now for my friend dawkins to pay you

must take up that note said mr snip can't think of waiting no
longer

the rascal spoke resolutely though more cowardly-looking than
sniggles but who could withstand the rage and indignation of my friend
tickle

away you ungrateful loon said he is that the way you serve the
man that made you who would have employed you you botch if dawkins
had not taken you up and made you fashionable

ay demmee snip said i taking my cue from tickle i say wasn't i
the making of you and do you come dunning me didn't i recommend you
into notice and business didn't i send my friends to you

can't deny said the tailor won't controvert but must say can't
always get my money of mr dawkins's friends but don't mean no
offence wouldn't think of pressing mr dawkins always said he was my
friend wouldn't mind holding back if mr dawkins would send me good
pay-customers

well said i thinking the man was modest in his desires i will
you shall have three johnny raws before the week is out and you may
charge them double

very much obliged and won't controvert said mr snip humbly but
can't take no more promises

and you really insist upon having your money said tickle

ay said i re-echoing his indignation and putting on a dignity
that even awed myself you are determined to have your money and to
lose your business tickle hand me back that five hundred i lent you
or enough of it to pay the rascallion--shall have it again as soon as
i can run down and see my uncle wilkins i say tickle hand me the
money and let me pay the ungrateful rascal off

if i do said jack demmee encourage dunning never

he shall have his money said i here you snip you man you have
broken your own neck come back here to-morrow at half past twelve
with a receipt in full take your money and never look to make a
gentleman's coat again come tickle it is time i was with my uncle
you shall go along and dine with him a fine old cock i assure you

i surveyed the tailor my dignity and the sound of my uncle's name
had subdued him he slipped his bill into his pocket and looked
penitent

won't controvert a gentleman on no occasion he said always said
mr dawkins was my friend and as for mr dawkins's uncle--

yes said jack yes you said you did not believe in any such person
did not believe there was such a person

can't controvert no gentleman said the tailor looking as if he had
been rubbed down with his own goose but never said no such thing
mr tickle always believed in mr dawkins's uncle but only thought
perhaps he wouldn't pay--that is wasn't certain and didn't mean no
offence and so if mr dawkins will say a word for me now and then to
gentlemen that wants coats i'll leave it to his convenience hoping
he will excuse my coming up stairs without asking not having found no
servant and not supposing he would take no offence and--

and so the rascallion was going on heaping apology on apology and
about to depart in contrition for his offence when as my evil genius
would have it in popped mr sniggles foaming with wrath and looking
daggers and conflagration

trouble you for the amount of that ere small account said the
fellow don't believe in no more uncles won't be diddled no longer
for nothing all diddle about uncle--just as mrs sniggles says--no
more uncle than she has

what do you mean said jack tickle but his indignation no longer
daunted the dun who cried out with uncommon emphasis and effect--

had my doubts about the matter and told mrs sniggles said i mr
dawkins's uncle has come says mrs sniggles run down to the tavern
and see for no sitch thing a'n't certain till we knows it and so i
runs down to the mansion house and mr wilkins wasn't there and then
i runs to the united states hoping it was a mistake and mr wilkins
wasn't there and then i runs to this place and that place and mr
wilkins wasn't there and as mrs sniggles said mr wilkins wasn't
nowhere but twas all diddle and throwing dust in my eyes and so as
for this here account one hundred and forty-one dollars sixty--

don't controvert no one said mr snip who had listened all agape to
the outpourings of the other and now turned his battery upon me again
but can't think of keeping the account open no longer don't want to
be hard upon any gentleman but must have my money

one hundred and forty-one dollars sixty cents said sniggles

two hundred and thirty-seven said snip

but why should i detail the particulars of that eventful hour even
tickle's courage sank before the fire of the enraged assailants and
as for mine had it been fortified by a heart of steel and ribs of
brass it must have yielded to the horrors that followed duns follow
the same laws as flies and carrion-crows no sooner does one swoop at a
victim than down drop a thousand others to share the feast scarce had
my landlord and the tailor begun the assault when there sneaked into
the room a consumptive-looking fellow smelling strongly of leather and
rosin who displayed a greasy scrap of paper and added his pipe to the
others then came another with inky hands a black spot on his nose
and a new hat under his arm then another and another and another
until i believe there were fourteen different souls in the room or
rather bodies for i don't think they had one soul among them all
of them armed with long bills all clamorous for their money and all
each being encouraged by the example of the others as noisy mad and
ferocious as any mob of free and independent republicans i ever laid
eyes on such a siege of dunning was perhaps never endured except by
a poor dandy they dunned and they dinned they poked out their ugly
bills and they gave loose to their inhuman tongues--in a word they
conducted in such a manner that i was more than once inclined to jump
out the window being driven to complete desperation

in the midst of all and when i saw no escape whatever from my
persecutions they were brought to a close by a most unexpected
incident the door flew open and in rushed--not a fifteenth tormentor
as i expected--but an angel of light in the person of nora magee who
screamed out at the top of her voice--

och hinny darlint your uncle misther wiggins has come and in a
beautiful carriage and he looks as if he could pay your ditts twice
over sure now and ye'll ax him for my tin dollars




chapter ix


the author receives a visit from his uncle samuel wilkins esq and
is relieved from his tormentors


let the reader judge of the effect of such an announcement upon my
tormentors and myself i had an uncle then and he had arrived--nay
he had paid me a visit and was in the house i could hear him
stumping up the stairs my debtors were struck dumb and so was i
and at that moment of confusion he stepped into the room i looked at
the gentleman and upon my soul i was somewhat disappointed his
appearance was scarce genteel enough for my uncle he looked like
a country squire of low degree who might pass for a man of quality
better in an unsophisticated village of the backwoods than anywhere
else and he had an atrocious white fur hat with a big brim all
puckered and twisted like the outer casing of a cabbage there was a
vulgar vivacity and good-nature about his visage an air of presumption
and familiarity in his motions and his nose turned up on the whole
i did not like his appearance and my first impulse was to give him a
look of contempt but i recollected he was my uncle and had come in a
carriage and seeing him stand staring about in great astonishment as
not knowing what to make of such a rout of ragamuffins as i had about
me nor how to distinguish his nephew among them i stepped up to him
and taking him by the hand said--

my dear saw ah looking for me what my uncle wiggins

wiggins said he ods bobs don't you know the name of your own
uncle wilkins

wiggins said i ged twas a mere slip of the tongue

ods bobs said he and is this you ikey my boy the very picture
of your aunt poor mrs wilkins but ods bless her she's dead ha'n't
seen you since you was a baby do declare you're as big as sammy
come to live in your town ikey my dear tired of living among the
clodhoppers have plenty of money and mean to be a gentleman now glad
to see you ikey but i say ikey who is all these here people always
heard you was a great gentleman but don't much like your acquaintance
ikey

this was pronounced in an under voice much to my satisfaction for
the liberty the old gentleman took with my name was not grateful to my
feelings ikey indeed none but a vulgarian would have made so free
with me

but he was my uncle he said he was rich and i perceived he might be
made serviceable

i shook him by the hand a dozen times over swore i was so glad to see
him he could not conceive assured him--in his ear--the fellows he saw
were ambitious cobblers and stitchers who had come to beg my favour
and recommendation to the fashionable circles for my countenance was
a fortune and the rascals would persecute me declared my friend
tickle who stood enjoying the scene from a corner was a young blood
and intimate who had just lent me a thousand dollars to pay a poor
fellow who was in distress and concluded by assuring him that as i
did not like being obliged to a man not a near kinsman i would hand
the sum back again and borrow it of him if he had brought so much to
town with him

the warm welcome with which i began my speech greatly delighted my
uncle's heart as i saw my apology for the appearance of the duns
it was evident caused him to look upon me as a young fellow of great
importance and distinction the reference to the young blood who had
just lent me a thousand dollars confirmed his opinion of my lofty
stand among the rich and fashionable and to all these members of
my discourse he hearkened with respect and satisfaction but when i
arrived at my climax and professed a readiness to borrow that sum of
himself i thought his eyes would drop out of his head they stared out
so far in a word i perceived that let him be as rich as he might
he was not the man to lend me money for which reason i despised the
relationship more than ever and resolved to disown it as soon as my
convenience would permit but it was proper to make it useful at the
present moment

i turned round upon my duns who were yet in confusion gentlemen
said i giving them a bow of dismission i will remember your claims
you may depend upon me but at present as you see i must attend to
those of my excellent uncle you understand me ehem

ehem said they all and i thought they would have all turned
somersets so profound were their congees as one by one they sneaked
out of the room the only ones who hesitated were my landlord nora
magee and snip the tailor the first was probably overcome by a sense
of having dunned me too hard and despair of forgiveness on which
supposition i gave him a frown and waved my hand and he retired as
for nora she perhaps loitered to feast her eyes with the spectacle
of the rich man from whose pockets were to be drawn her ten dollars
but i gave her a wink a very vulgar way of conveying a hint i
confess--but one can't be genteel with one's creditors and she rolled
smiling away what kept the tailor i could not say till having given
him divers significant looks and gestures he began to drawl out can't
controvert no gentleman but-- when i stepped up to him took him by
the arm and led him from the apartment

what you dog said i in a familiar affectionate sort of way as
soon as i had him out of my uncle's hearing do you want to raise a
hubbub and put the old fellow in a passion come you rogue your
fortune's made--seven grown sons--seven broadcloth suits a year
extravagant dogs they--shall have them all you shall upon my
honour can twist the young apes round my finger and you shall
have'em seven times seven is forty-nine seven fifties is three
thousand and odd ged and demmee you'll make a fortune out of them

with that i pushed the giggling cormorant down stairs and ran back to
my uncle




chapter x


some account of sheppard lee's country kinsmen


adieu said tickle giving me a nod as much as to say make the
most of the old gentleman he then imitated the duns and left me a
circumstance for which i was not sorry for i was somewhat ashamed of
my uncle

fine-looking young fellow that said mr wilkins must be a rich dog
to lend you a thousand dollars but i say ikey--

uncle wiggins--that is wilkins said i i beg you won't call me by
any such vulgar nickname as ikey i can't abide nicknames they are
horrid plebeian

ods bobs said my uncle i call my son sammy sammy and sam too--

what said i have you a son

ods bobs said he why didn't you know i say nevvy your dad
and me was never good friends proud as a turkey-cock--thought me a
democrat and no great shakes but i snapped up his sister though and
so there was never no love lost between us never knew much about one
another especially him but i say nevvy ods bobs don't be a fool
and despise like your dad could buy him six times over if he was
alive and don't suppose you're much richer and don't value you a new
pin don't pretend you didn't know i had a son might as well say you
didn't know i had a daughter

the old gentleman looked somewhat incensed i hastened to pacify him
by assuring him i had had a violent fit of sickness and lost my memory
i then drew from him without difficulty as much of his history and
affairs as i cared to know

although of a vulgar stock his face had somehow or other captivated
the fancy of my father's sister who very ungenteelly ran off with
him and accompanied him to some interior village of the state where
the happy swain sold tapes and sugar that being his profession
here although discountenanced and despised by his wife's family he
gradually amassed wealth and in course of time mightily increased it
by laying his hands on those four great staples of the susquehanna
iron lumber coal and whiskey in fine having scraped together
enough for his purpose he yielded to a design which his wife had first
put into his plebeian head and which his children as they grew up
took care to stimulate into action this was to exchange his village
for the metropolis his musty warehouses for elegant saloons and live
during the remainder of his life a nabob and gentleman and in this
design as i discovered he expected to derive no little aid from my
humble self who being as he said a gentleman cut and dried and
knowing to all such matters could give him a hint or two about high
life and help his children the hopeful sammy and the interesting
pattie for such were their horrid names into good society the first
step of his design he had already taken having wound up his business
and got him to philadelphia with his brats both of whom were now
safely lodged in a hotel burning to make the acquaintance of their
fashionable cousin my distinguished self and to these worthy kinsfolk
he proposed to carry me forthwith

i debated the matter in my mind should i acknowledge the claims of a
brace of rustics with two such names sammy wilkins pattie wilkins
i felt that an old coat or a patched shoe could not more endanger my
reputation than two cousins named sammy and pattie but the old man
was rich and some good might arise from my condescension i agreed to
go with him and asked him at what hotel he had put up

oh said he at a mighty fine place--the what-d-ye-call-it in
market-street

in market-street said i and i thought his nose looked more
democratic than ever horrible vulgar beyond expression how came you
to stop in such a low place can't expect any decent man to go nigh
you must carry you to head's without a moment's delay or you'll be
ruined for ever

ods bobs said my uncle it's a very good tavern with eating
and drinking for a king but if it's not fashionable sha'n't stay
there no longer shall go with us nevvy and show us the way to
what-d-ye-call-it's the hack will just hold four

i go to a tavern in market-street the idea was offensive and ride
thither and afterward my three country kinsfolk with me to head's
in a hackney-coach the market-street tavern and the hackney-coach
finished my uncle wilkins i suddenly recollected a highly important
engagement which would deprive me of the pleasure of going round with
my excellent uncle that moment to make the acquaintance of my worthy
cousins nay i feared it would occupy me all that evening being an
engagement of a very peculiar nature i would see them the next day
when they were safely lodged at head's whither i recommended mr
wilkins to proceed bag and baggage instanter my uncle accepted my
excuses and agreed to follow my advice with a ready docility that
might have pleased me seeing that it showed the respect in which he
held me but i perceived in it nothing more than a willingness to be
put into leading-strings arising from his consciousness of inferiority

i got rid of him and resolved i would consider the pros and cons
before compromising my reputation by any public acknowledgment of
relationship

then being vastly tired by the varied business of the day i threw
myself on my bed where i slept during the remainder of the day very
soundly and agreeably




chapter xi


containing a morsel of metaphysics with a short account of the
author's experience in good society


i was roused about nine o'clock in the evening by tickle who came
according to promise to squire me to mrs pickup's and the misses
oldstyle's and dressing myself in mr dawkin's best i accompanied him
forthwith to the mansion of the former

it was yet summer and the season of gayety was therefore afar off all
genteel people were or were supposed to be out of town according to
the rule which at this season drives the gentry of london to their
country-seats the few of philadelphia who could imitate the lords and
ladies in this particular were now catching agues on the schuylkill
while the mass consisting of those whose revenues did not allow
any rustication on their own lands were killing sand-flies on the
seashore or gnawing tough beef and grumbling over bad butter at some
fashionable watering-place in the interior there were some however
as there always are who considered themselves genteel and who stayed
at home either because they were tired of agues sand-flies tough
beef and bad butter as they freely professed because they really
believed they were better off at home or because they were like
me and my friend tickle not rich enough to squander their money on
vanities and so stayed at home from necessity

of such persons one can always even in summer-time assemble enough to
make a party of some kind or other where the contented guests can be
uncommonly sociable eat ices and pity their friends who may be at
the moment roasting in a ball-room at saratoga

it was undoubtedly a great misfortune that i should make my first
introduction to good society at a time when it was to be seen only
in its minimum of splendour whereby i lost the opportunity of being
dazzled to the same degree in which i found myself capable of dazzling
others nevertheless i was vastly captivated by what i saw and
for the few brief weeks that my destiny permitted me to live among
the refined and exclusive i considered myself an uncommonly happy
individual

the reception i met at mrs pickup's convinced me that in entering
mr dawkins's body i had done the wisest thing in the world for
however much it endangered me with the tailors it proved the best
recommendation to the ladies i found myself ushered into a suite of
apartments magnificently furnished and lighted and not so over crowded
for the season was taken into consideration but that the moschetoes
had room to exercise their talents i thought i should be devoured by
mrs pickup she was so amazingly glad to see me but i perceived
by a sort of instinct i had acquired along with dawkins's body that
there was something plebeian about her although a very fine woman as
far as appearances went and indeed tickle assured me she was a mere
parvenue or upstart whom everybody despised and whom no one would
come nigh were it not for her wealth and the resolution she avowed to
give six different balls of the most splendid character in the course
of the season she had a daughter who was very handsome and a decided
speculation but i did not think much of her especially as i found she
was already engaged to be married

i found here that i knew everybody or what was the same thing that
everybody knew me and with tickle's help i soon found myself as
much at home with mr i d dawkins's fair acquaintances as if i had
known them all my life it was still as it had been before a virtue
and peculiarity of my recollections that they were always roused by
a few words of conversation with any one known to my prototype from
which i infer that the associations of the mind as well as many of
its other qualities are more dependant upon causes in the body than
metaphysicians are disposed to allow

this dependance it has been my fate to know and feel more extensively
perhaps than any other man that ever lived the spirit of sheppard lee
was widely different from those of john h higginson and i d dawkins
as i think the reader must have already seen and yet no sooner had
it entered the bodies of these two individuals than the distinction
was almost altogether lost certain it is that in stepping into each
i found myself invested with new feelings passions and propensities--
as it were with a new mind--and retaining so little of my original
character that i was perhaps only a little better able to judge and
reason on the actions performed in my new body without being able to
avoid them even when sensible of their absurdity

i do verily believe that much of the evil and good of man's nature
arises from causes and influences purely physical that valour and
ambition are as often caused by a bad stomach as ill-humour by bad
teeth that socrates in bonaparte's body could scarce have been
socrates although the combination might have produced a timoleon or
washington and finally that those sages who labour to improve the
moral nature of their species will effect their purpose only when they
have physically improved the stock strong minds may be indeed operated
upon without regard to bodily bias and rendered independent of it but
ordinary spirits lie in their bodies like water in sponges diffused
through every part affected by the part's affections changed with its
changes and so intimately united with the fleshly matrix that the
mere cutting off of a leg as i believe will in some cases leave the
spirit limping for life

but as i said before i am not writing a dissertation on metaphysics
nor on morals either and as my adventures will suggest such
reflections to all who care to indulge them i will omit them for the
present and hasten on with my story

and here the reader may expect of me a description of those scenes and
persons in fashionable life to which and whom i was now introduced
and if i valued the reader's approbation at a higher price than my own
conscience and reputation i should undoubtedly gratify him by putting
my imagination in requisition and painting at once some dozen or two
of such fanciful pictures as are found in novels of fashionable life
though never i opine in fashionable life itself in such i should
have occasion to represent gentlemen more elegant and witty and ladies
more charming and ethereal than are to be found in any of the ordinary
circles of society but as i am writing truth and not fiction and
represent things as i found not as i imagined them i declare that
the ladies and gentlemen of the exclusive circles to which i was
admitted were very much like the ladies and gentlemen of other circles
--that is as elegant and witty as they could be and as charming and
celestial as it pleased heaven--and that after due exercise of
judgment and memory i cannot in the adventures of three whole weeks
in such society remember a single person or thing worth describing
for which reason i will pass on to more important matters




chapter xii


sheppard lee makes the acquaintance of his cousin miss pattie wilkins


although i now look upon those three weeks of my life as three weeks of
existence out of which i cheated myself i was nevertheless so greatly
delighted at first by the way in which i spent them that i had almost
forgotten my uncle wilkins and when i did think of him it was only
with renewed contempt and indifference finding however that the old
fellow had called upon me three or four times during my absence from
my lodgings on as many different days and remembering what he had
said of his riches it occurred to me that i might as well pay him a
visit were it only to satisfy mr sniggles and nora magee both of
whom manifested great uneasiness at my undutiful conduct it occurred
to me moreover that although my uncle wilkins was not a lending man
my cousin sammy might be and as i had now existed four different
days without a single sixpence in my pocket and began to be heartily
ashamed of such a state of things i thought it would be as well to pay
the rustics a visit and putting on a new coat which snip had just sent
me to seal our reconciliation and secure my seven extravagant cousins
i started off forthwith

as my evil luck would have it i found the old gentleman on the point
of setting out to pay me a fifth visit and i had the satisfaction
just as i placed my foot on the porch of the hotel in full view of
some half a dozen respectable-looking people who were congregated
there to receive an embrace from mr samuel wilkins with the old
white fur hat accompanied by a vocal salutation of oho ikey my
boy and so you have come have you ods bobs but i began to think
you was ashamed of your relations

not i said i i am never ashamed of my relations and i looked
around me with dignity so that all present might perceive i was
condescending i supposed i should find some of the spectators
giggling but was agreeably surprised when i beheld among them nothing
but grave looks of respect indeed two or three old gentlemen that
i knew by sight and who were what you call stanch citizens--that
is rich old fellows not very genteel but highly respected--made me
low bows and i heard one of them as i passed with my uncle into the
hotel whisper to another it is the rich old rascal's nephew quite a
promising young man

i began to feel a greater esteem for my uncle for i saw that others
respected him everybody seemed to know him and make way for him
seeing which i grew more condescending than ever and instantly began
to apologize for my seeming neglect by pleading that i had been
engaged night and day in preparing the way for the admission of him and
my cousins sammy and pattie into good society

you want a house in a fashionable quarter said i--

ods bobs said he yes and i've been looking all over town from
the glass-works down to the navy-yard and seen a power of them

i flatter myself i can suit you said i and better than you can
yourself besides said i i have been looking for carriages and
horses

why said my uncle it's expensive keeping horses in a city and i
was against it but there's pattie says we can't do without em

exactly so said i you must live like a gentleman or there's no
getting or keeping in society and besides i have been stirring up
the beaux and belles to come and see my cousin the fair--i say uncle
eged has she no other name than pattie

yes said my uncle wilkins there's abby--that's abigail--martha
abigail wilkins called her after her grandmother and aunt and hoped
aunt abby would leave her something but she didn't

martha abigail wilkins worse and worse i despaired of doing any
thing if i even wished it for a creature with such a name

but what i had done--that is what i said i had done for i had done
nothing had produced a great effect on my uncle and put him into
such a good-humour with me that he seized me by the hand swore i
was the right sort of a dog after all and reaching the door of his
private parlour where the fair martha abigail was sitting he kicked
it open crying aloud

here pattie you puss here's your cousin ikey the dandy--as fine a
whole-hog fellow as ever you saw--ods bobs give m a buss

i looked upon the unsophisticated rustic who was called upon to
manifest her breeding in such an agricultural style and upon my soul
i was quite surprised to find in her the aforesaid pattie abigail
one of the nicest little creatures i had ever laid eyes on of a most
genteel figure tolerably well dressed considering she had been
brought up in the country and with a sweet prudish face that was
quite agreeable to look on

she smiled and she blushed then laughed and blushed again but
without waiting to be bidden a second time tripped up to me gave me
both her hands and saying cousin ikey how do you do with a voice
that was charming in every word save one--the infernal ikey--she very
innocently turned her cheek up to be saluted

i felt myself called upon to give her a lesson in politeness and
therefore put my lips to her hand saying cousin p--p--pattie--ehem
the girls will all call her petty-patty--petty-patty wilkins--i beg
your pardon but it is quite ungenteel and vulgar to kiss a lady that
is to say in common cases but--as i spoke i admired her beauty the
more and began to think the etiquette in such cases was absurd--but
as we are cousins i think that alters the case entirely

and with that i paid my respects to her cheek and upon my soul was
rather gratified than otherwise nay and upon an instinct which i know
not whether i owed to my soul or body i made an offer to repeat the
ceremony that i might be as condescending as possible when the little
minx to my surprise and indignation lifted up one of the hands i had
dropped and absolutely boxed me on the ear starting away at the same
time and saying with a most mischievous look of retaliation

i reckon i know manners as well as anybody

ged and upon my soul said i and marched up to the glass to restore
my left whisker to its beauty for she had knocked it out of its
equilibrium while my uncle wilkins fell foul of her and scolded her
roundly for her bad behaviour

it don't signify pa said the amiable pattie bursting into tears
i served cousin ikey no worse than cousin ikey served me for when
i wanted him to kiss me he wouldn't and if he had boxed my ear it
wouldn't have been half so bad for it was very rude of him not to kiss
me and say it was vulgar and he can't deny it

i have mentioned before i think the surprising facility women seem to
have of turning the tables upon a man in any contest that may happen
between the sexes for let a man be never so much in the right my
head for it the woman will soon prove him to be in the wrong

i found the truth of the maxim on the present occasion for there was
the pretty pattie who had just shocked my sensibilities wounded my
self-love violated my dignity and disordered my whisker by a buffet
on the cheek extremely well laid on considering the youth and sex
of the bestower now weeping and bewailing the injury i had done her
in moralizing over a kiss before taking it it occurred to me she was
an uncommon goose but she looked so wonderfully handsome pouting
her lips with such a beautiful pettishness that i was convinced i
had treated her very badly for which reason i stepped up to her and
begged her pardon so penitently that she relented and forgave me and
we were soon in a good-humour with one another

she seemed to me to be an odd creature disposed to be whimsical and
funny and i rather feared she was at bottom witty i say i feared
she was witty and lest the reader should draw wrong inferences from
the expression i think it right to inform him that while recording
my adventures in the body of mr i d dawkins i feel my old dawkins
habits revived so strongly in my feelings that i cannot avoid giving
some of the colouring of his character to the history of his body i do
not presume to say what women should be or what they should not in
confessing a fear that my cousin pattie was witty i only record the
horror with which i while a dandy in common with all others of the
class regarded any of the sex who were smarter or more sensible than
myself

my cousin pattie was then odd whimsical and i feared witty but
that remained to be proved she certainly acted in a manner highly
unsophisticated which arose from her youth for my uncle told me
she was not yet eighteen and her country breeding she had divers
rusticities of speech and a frankness of spirit that would at any
moment burst out in weeping and wailing or a fit of romping all which
was horridly ungenteel and a great objection to genteel people taking
notice of her

but on the other hand she was a positive beauty and although she
slouched about sometimes when forgetful her movements were commonly
graceful and lady-like

my judgment was therefore favourable beauty grace good clothes
and a grammatical way of speaking were as far as i knew the only
requisites for a fine woman and i thought it was possible to make her
one the two first requisites she already possessed good clothes were
to be had of a good milliner and as for her conversation i flattered
myself i could in a few lessons teach her to subdue all redundances
for in that particular she wanted nothing but pruning




chapter xiii


a further account of miss pattie wilkins


having made these observations in the course of a ten minutes
conversation i perceived i had no longer any reason to be ashamed of
her but on the contrary to congratulate myself on the relationship
then permitting myself to be affectionate and frank as a near kinsman
should i gave her freely to understand that with a little advice
and training which i would undertake to give her in a few lessons
she would be fit to shine in the very best society an admission that
set my uncle into an ecstasy of delight and triumph while it somewhat
discomposed the fair pattie she gave me a hearty stare a thing i was
glad to see for it looked lady-like then coloured a circumstance
i did not approve so much since blushing is girlish and ungenteel
and then burst out a laughing and concluded by seizing upon my hand
giving it a yeomanly shake and saying

very well cousin ikey you shall be my schoolmaster and teach me
all you know and as you say i think you can teach me in a very few
lessons

and here she looked as meek and quiet and almost as sanctimonious as
any saint i ever saw of a sunday

very good said i and the first lesson i will give you is never to
call me ikey again for that's vulgar but always mr dawkins or
just plain cousin or as we are so nearly related why i don't care
if you call me by my middle name dulmer

wouldn't dully be better said she as sweetly as could be it's
more affectionate and cousins ought to be affectionate

that's very true said i and upon my soul i thought her mouth was
the handsomest i had ever seen it is very true but it don't do to
be too familiar and besides dully don't sound a whit better than
pattie i wish to ged you had a better name than that and yet it
is the best of them all for martha is kitchen-like and abigail
wash-womanly--

and pat said my cousin--

pat said i struck with horror--

yes pat said she looking as if she would cry again it is the
most odious of nicknames and there's my brother sam who calls me
so all day long and there's pa who is not much better but i say
cousin i hope you'll take them to schooling too i won't say any
thing about pa but i reckon there's none of us will be the worse for a
little rubbing up

don't say reckon said i nor sam neither ged you have horrid
names among you but we'll do the best we can pattie--miss pattie
wilkins well the name is not so very bad as for your brother you
must always call him brother occasionally you may say wilkins and
it will sound aristocratic as being a family name but i say uncle
we can't do any thing till we have you in your own house and if you
mean to pass for a man of quality it must be a grand one--that is as
grand as can be had without building i say uncle if you please what
do you hold yourself worth

ods bobs said my uncle bristling up what's that any man's
business never blab a man's capital for--

oh said pattie pa's always thinking about trade and shop-keeping
but i'll tell you for i know all about it for he told me six months
ago and i know he's worth two-- and here the little beauty looked
as if she designed to make me her confidant at once and swell my very
soul with the greatness of her revealment--he's worth two hundred and
ninety thousand dollars and when he dies he is to leave me half a'n't
it grand

to leave you half one hundred and forty-five thousand dollars
said i so confounded by a sudden idea that entered my mind that i
could not even conceal it hang it if that's the case but i shall
certainly marry you and snap up that hundred and forty-five myself

would you said the imp looking so lovely and innocent and
willing that i positively threw my arms around her neck as if the
matter were already settled

ods bobs said my uncle none of your jokes here nevvy

as for pattie she jumped out of my arms though apparently more
pleased with the rudeness than with my former want of enthusiasm and
ran laughing to a chair

none of your jokes here nevvy i say cried mr wilkins and don't
talk to pattie about marrying for she has had enough of that already

i ha'n't pa said the daughter beginning to cry again you're
always twitting me with danny but i'm sure if you're willing i'd as
lief marry my cousin ikey--that is cousin dulmer--as anybody

who's danny said i

my uncle looked black but pattie answered boldly

why my sweetheart to be sure--danny baker--one of the truest
sweethearts you ever saw and oh so handsome but he was nothing but
one of pa's clerks and so we turned him off between us and because
i took his part and said it was no great harm in him to like me pa
is always twitting me about him and i can't abide it if i am to be
twitted about everybody that likes me i should like to know where will
be the end of it

i perceived that my little cousin had a good opinion of herself which
was proper enough but i reprobated the good-will she extended to her
admirer telling her that all clodhoppers were to be despised and
that she must now think of being liked by none but fine gentlemen my
counsel as i discovered afterward was peculiarly acceptable to my
uncle and greatly increased his respect for me and as for pattie she
dried her eyes and said she had as much spirit as anybody but danny
baker was no fool for all we might say of him

in short the interview was much more satisfactory than i had dared
to anticipate and finding my uncle and cousin were eager to have my
instructions and assistance so as to begin the world as soon and with
as much eclat as possible i summoned my wisdom and laid down the law
to them forthwith a house was to be immediately had and recollecting
the state of mr periwinkle smith's affairs i recommended that my
uncle should make proposals for his dwelling which was just the house
required and which i supposed mr smith or the sheriff for him would
soon bring to the hammer nay in the exuberance of my affection i
offered to begin the negotiation myself and visit mr periwinkle smith
that day whereby i might have an opportunity to return my thanks for
his friendly assistance at the schuylkill without exciting any false
hopes in the bosom of his daughter which i feared might be the result
if i went without an object

i then discoursed on the subject of carriages and horses furniture
tailors and mantuamakers and with such effect that i perceived
i should have the control of all my uncle's affairs directing his
expenses and making all his purchases which i saw would be highly
advantageous in reinstating my credit even if it led to no better
profit




chapter xiv


a short chapter containing an account of the author's cousin samuel
wilkins jr


having debated these matters to my satisfaction and theirs i was
about taking my leave when my cousin sammy unexpectedly entered the
apartment

his appearance struck me dumb and filled me with mingled terror and
despair what could i do with such a scarecrow his appearance was
death to my hopes of making the family fashionable he was a raw youth
of twenty or twenty-one but six feet high long-legged lantern-jawed
and round-shouldered he wore a white hat like his father but stuck
upon his head with a happy contempt of order and symmetry and his
coat hung down in a straight line from his shoulders as if cut to fit
the wall of a house he walked with a lazy grave swagger indicative
of vast serenity of mind and self-regard and--until i cured him of
the habit--with both hands in his pockets there was not an ounce of
brain in his whole head big as it was though from the gravity with
which he stared and whistled one in the face for staring and whistling
were two of his greatest characteristics it might have been supposed
otherwise i will not say the clown was ugly in visage or deformed in
person but he was a slouch from head to foot one could see at a look
that he considered himself a gentleman that he lived in the country
and that the highest exercise of his gentility had been to stalk about
from one mud-hole to another with his hands in his pockets

he did not seem at all daunted by my appearance but having surveyed
me with his great staring eyes he dragged one of his fists out of his
pocket and gave me a friendly grasp very much like the pinch of a
bear glad to see you hope you're well he said and said no more
but remained observing me with extreme gravity during the remainder of
the conference when i got up to depart he rose also and though i
could have well dispensed with such an escort attended me to the door
he uttered not a word until we came within view of the bar when the
great oaf opened his lips and said with an extremely knowing look i
say ikey my boy suppose we take a smaller

a smaller said i indignantly gentlemen in a city never drink
smallers

well then said the goose i don't care if we go the whole gill

come said i commiserating his ignorance you must never more talk
of such things none but vulgarians drink strong liquors slings
cocktails and even julaps are fit only for bullies gentlemen never
drink any thing but wine

wine's small stuff said my kinsman with great equanimity but i'm
for any thing that's genteel and dad says you're the boy for showing
us but od rabbit it it's a hard thing to play the gentleman in a
place where you a'n't up to it but i say now how do you think we'll
do--me and pat

i could scarce avoid laughing in the booby's face he asked his
question with such simplicity and complacency i perceived that
notwithstanding his lazy serenity and stolid gravity he was as anxious
to be made genteel as either of the others and quite as ready to
submit to my guidance i told him i had no doubt he would do very well
when i had polished him a little which i would soon do and i resolved
to begin the task without delay i carried him to a private apartment
ordered a carriage and a bottle of chateau-margaux to amuse us while
it was getting ready and gave him to understand i would immediately
take him to a tailor's and this i did in a very short time to the
infinite delight of my friend snip whom i ordered to make three or
four different suits for him without troubling myself to ask his
opinion about either i then carried him in the same way to a hatter
shoemaker and man-milliner leaving the jeweller watchmaker and so
on for a future occasion

these important matters being accomplished greatly to my own
advantage for i took care to speak of my uncle wilkins in a way to
produce the strongest effect i ordered the coachman to drive up to mr
periwinkle smith's whither i thought i might as well proceed while
i had a coach to carry me i gave my gawky cousin to understand my
business was to buy the house for his father at which he expressed
much satisfaction for everybody in philadelphia knows the house is a
very fine one and a desire to help me examine it but telling him
there were many fine ladies there who must not see him till he was
properly dressed i charged him to wait for me in the coach until i
returned




chapter xv


in which sheppard lee visits mr periwinkle smith and his fair
daughter and is intrusted with a secret which both astonishes and
afflicts him


i pulled the bell with a most dignified jerk and asked for mr
smith but the servant who grinned with approbation as at an old
acquaintance and doubtless considered that he knew more about the
matter than myself as philadelphia servants usually do ushered me
into the presence of mr smith's fair daughter

ah said i to myself as i cast my eye around the apartment and saw
that her levee consisted of but a single beau--a stranger whom i did
not know but who i learned afterward was a young millionaire from
boston--the world begins to suspect the mortgages and friends are
falling away poor dear miss smith--and i felt great compassion for
her

she seemed somewhat surprised at my appearance and i thought she
looked confused she was a marvellous fine creature and i was quite
sorry she was not rich

i saw she had a sneaking kindness for me yet but it was not right to
encourage her i hastened therefore to express my thanks for the
sympathy which i had been informed she had bestowed on me on the
memorable occasion of my dip in the schuylkill and regretted that the
indisposition consequent upon that disaster had prevented my calling
earlier i had not met the fair lady at mrs pickup's or the misses
oldstyle's or at the other two place where i had figured during the
last four evenings and although it was highly probable she knew my
indisposition had not prevented my going to these places yet my not
seeing her made the excuse perfectly genteel and fair yet she looked
at me intently--i thought sadly and reproachfully--for a moment and
then recovering herself expressed her pleasure to see me so well
restored and ended with great self-possession by presenting me to
her new admirer after this her manner was cooler and i thought her
pique rendered her a little neglectful it was certain she wished
me to observe that she had a high opinion of the new philander a
circumstance to which i was not so indifferent as i ought to have
been but in truth she was an elegant soul and the more i looked at
her the more i regretted she was not a fortune i felt myself growing
sentimental and to check the feeling i resolved to proceed to
business

i had no sooner asked after the old gentleman and expressed a desire
to see him than she gave me a look that bewildered me it expressed
surprise and inquiry mingled with what i should have fancied contempt
could i have believed anybody could entertain such a feeling for me
she rang the bell ordered my desire to be conveyed to her father and
in a few moments i was requested to walk up stairs to his study where
i found him in company with a gentleman of the law and a broker whose
face i knew and surrounded with papers

ah said i to myself things are now coming to a crisis he is
making an assignment

the gentleman of the law and the broker took their departure and mr
periwinkle smith gave me a hard look i began to suspect what he was
thinking of he was perhaps looking for me to make a declaration in
relation to his fair daughter

that he might not be troubled with such expectation long i instantly
opened my business and gave him to understand i came to make proposals
he opened his eyes and grinned for his house he looked astounded
which i had heard he was about to dispose of

indeed said he and then fell to musing a while pray mr dawkins
said he who sent you upon this wise errand

i did not like his tone but i answered i came on the part of my uncle
samuel wilkins of wilkinsbury hall--for i thought it as well to make
my kinsman's name sound lordly

very good said he but what made you suppose i intended to sell my
property

i liked this question still less than the other and mumbled
out something about common report and the general talk of my
acquaintance

ah said he now i understand giving me a grin which i did not
let us be frank with one another there was something said about
mortgages was there not--a heavy weight on my poor estate

thinking it was useless to mince the matter i acknowledged that such
was the report

and it is from the influence of that report i am to understand some
of the peculiarities of your--that is to say it is to that i am to
attribute your present application really mr dawkins i am afraid i
can't oblige you my house i like very well and--but i'll admit you
to a little secret and smiling with great suavity he laid his hand
on a pile of papers here said he are mortgages and other bonds
to the amount of some seventy thousand dollars they are my property
and not mortgages on my property the truth is and as you are an old
friend i don't scruple to tell you that having a little loose cash
which i did not know what to do with i took the advice of a friend
and invested it in the form in which you now see it and i believe it
is very safe the story of the mortgages was quite true only it was
told the wrong way

i was petrified and stood staring on the old gentleman with awe and
amazement

some people said he very good-naturedly might doubt the
propriety and even the honourableness of a private gentleman
investing money in this way but stocks are at a high premium and many
unsafe and money can't lie idle--i hope you are satisfied i am quite
sorry i can't oblige your uncle my house as i said i like extremely
well and i have besides promised it as a wedding-present to my
daughter

oh ye gods of greece and rome a wedding-present to his daughter i
resolved to make her a proposal without delay and i thought i might as
well break matters to the old gentleman

your daughter said i your beloved and excellent daughter--

will doubtless always be happy to welcome her old friend and admirer
mr dawkins said he and i thought he looked beautiful--though
i never thought so before he could not have spoken more plainly
i thought if he had said marry her at once i took my leave
intending to make love to her on the spot

i will have the pleasure to see you to the door said the old
gentleman and to the door he did see me i do not well know how it
happened but instead of entering the parlour again i found myself led
to the front door by the courteous mr smith and bowed handsomely out
to the great satisfaction of my cousin sammy who regarded proceedings
from the carriage window

good morning said mr periwinkle smith i can't sell my daughter's
house but i should be glad to have you for a neighbour and now i
recollect it there's higginson the brewer's house over the way there
advertised for sale and i am told it is very well finished

so am i said i to myself as the door closed on my face--finished
unutterably it occurred to me i was turned out of the house and
the suspicion was soon very perfectly confirmed i called on the fair
miss smith the next day and though i saw her by accident through the
window i was met by the cursed fib--not at home the same thing
was told me seven days in succession and on the eighth i saw to my
eternal wo and despair her marriage with my boston rival announced in
the papers he lives in philadelphia and can confirm my story but
this is anticipating my narrative

i say dawkins cried my cousin sammy i had cured him of the vulgar
ikey what does the old codger say

these words bawled by the rustic from the carriage window woke me
from a trance into which i had fallen the moment mr periwinkle smith
shut the door in my face

didn't he say there was a house over the way

i remembered the words--my own house for sale i knew it well it
was just the thing wanted--an elegant house provided genteel people
were in it i was on the point of running over and securing it when i
remembered mrs higginson a cold sweat bedewed my limbs no said i
i will go to tim doolittle--i can face him

to make matters short--for i have a long story to tell--i drove up to
higginson's brewery it is now doolittle and snagg's or was when
i heard last of it saw my late brother-in-law whom i thought a
very plebeian body and made such progress with him that in three
days time for my margaret had gone to mourn in the country the
house changed owners and my uncle wilkins marched into it as master
followed by sammy and pattie




chapter xvi


containing much instructive matter in relation to good society whereby
the ambitious reader can determine what are his prospects of entering
it


three days after i had established my uncle in his new house the fair
miss smith was married

it was a great blow to me and i mused with melancholy on the
fickleness of the sex wondering what it was in woman's nature that
enabled her so easily to change from one love to another i considered
myself very badly used and the more i thought of the wedding-present
and the seventy thousand dollars in bonds and mortgages the more
deeply did i feel my loss i read the announcement of her marriage in
the newspaper cursed her inconstancy and hard-heartedness and gave
myself up to grief the whole morning she had certainly used me ill
but by dinner-time i remembered i had served her pretty much in the
same way

besides my cousin pattie i always dined with my uncle wilkins
of course and intended soon to live with him altogether looked
uncommonly handsome and who knows said i to myself whether she
won't have more than miss smith after all in addition to this
great consolation i had another in a few days and the two together
quite comforted me for the loss of periwinkle's daughter but of this
in its place

in three days time as i have mentioned i had my uncle wilkins in his
new house and was busy polishing the family but the task was harder
than i supposed the rusticities of my uncle were inveterate and as
for sammy the only change i could effect in him was such as the tailor
effected for me i found him a clown and a clown i left him i should
have given him up after the first day had it not been that his father
kept him pretty well supplied with pocket-money which was an advantage
to me for i never could borrow any thing of my uncle i therefore
treated him civilly and carried him about to divers places taking
good care however that he should not fall into the hands of my friend
tickle or any other poor dandy

my cousin pattie was more docile and i perceived that as soon as i
should cure her of a mischievous habit she had of playing tricks upon
everybody in the house and myself too upon occasions she would be
fit for any society

as soon as my uncle had procured a carriage and i took care it should
be a good one--i made an effort to buy my fine old thousand-dollar
bays but mr doolittle would not part with them i took her out
airing and shopping to teach her how to behave in public and i
contracted with mrs pickup who lived close by and who it was
supposed on account of her six balls would make a favourable
sensation to chaperon her for the season i took care to bestow her
patronage among the aunts and sisters of my tradespeople in such a way
as to advance my own credit and thinking it would be to my advantage
to have such a friend near her i recommended nora magee to her for a
maid although nora was not quite so genteel as i should have wished

in short i did every thing that was proper to prepare her way for
the approaching season and as soon as i thought her fit to receive
company went round among all the leading fashionables and requested
them to visit her

it was here that the invaluable nature of my services on behalf of my
country kinsfolk was shown as i took care to make them understand for
without me to help them or some other equally genteel person my uncle
and cousins might as well have tried to get into congress as into good
society my request was not granted until i had answered ten thousand
different questions and removed as many scruples on the part of the
monarchs of the mode there were a thousand reasons why my uncle's
family should be denied admission into that elegant society they were
so ambitious to enter and nothing but the force of my recommendations
ensured them success

my labours on this occasion made me familiar with the principles
upon which republican aristocratic society is founded and as these
principles are not universally understood even in america i think
i can do nothing better than explain them for the benefit of all my
young and aspiring readers

the pretensions of any individual to enter the best society of the
republic depend upon his respectability and the measure of this is
determined by the character of his profession if he have one--if
not by that of his father i never knew even the most exclusive
and fastidious of examiners to carry his scrutiny so far back as a
grandfather for indeed all our grandfathers in america were pretty
much alike and the sooner we forget them the better

the first profession in point of dignity is that of a gentleman who
has nothing to do but to spend his revenue if he has one there are
some gentlemen well received in good society who live upon their wits
but they are born in it poor gentlemen not already in society had
better not try to get into it for rich men who have romantic daughters
are afraid of them a gentleman then always stands a fair chance of
being admitted and if his father was of a respectable profession
he is received with open arms the preference accorded to this class
is just since founded upon nature all occupations are more or less
disgraceful a strong proof of which is found in the fact that all
primitive nations such as the hottentots and north american indians
look upon them with contempt considering idleness and war as the only
business for gentlemen providence indeed ordained that men should
live by the sweat of their brows but it is horrid ungenteel to do so

the next profession in point of dignity is law and lawyers as i may
say form the true effective nobility of america for though the mere
gentlemen deem themselves higher and purer they are pretty generally
considered by others as only the lady-dowagers of society but the
lady-dowagers sometimes consider the gentility of lawyers doubtful

the third profession is that of arms which owes its consideration
mainly to the women who although the ministers of love and mercy to
man are wondrous fond of those who deal in blood and gunpowder these
are the only respectable professions in america

divinity physic merchandise agriculture and politics are the only
others from which a man is occasionally allowed to enter good society
but they are considered low and it is only peculiar circumstances
which can give any of their followers a claim to rise

i have said that the claim of the gentlemen to consider themselves the
highest class is founded in nature they form the nucleus of society
and around them as they are admitted the members of the other
professions establish the grand order of fashion according to their
creed law is a respectable profession because it keeps down the mob
or people by keeping them constantly by the ears and because it makes
money and arms they hold to be reputable because it does the same
thing and paves the way to the presidency divinity and physic they
consider to be naturally low occupations since their provinces are
only to take care of dirty souls and bodies merchandise is denounced
since it consists of both buying and selling whereas buying is the
only part of traffic that is fit for a gentleman agriculture is
contemned because there are so many clodhoppers engaged in it and
politics because it demands consociation with the mob

in these five professions however certain fortunate circumstances may
give a claim to notice parsons who are often doctors of divinity and
always reverends and physicians are titled gentry and this counts in
their favour and the same thing may be said of politicians when they
rise to be secretaries of departments or foreign ministers or become
renowned as orators great distinction will secure them favour for
they are then people that people look at merchants are allowed to be
respectable as soon as they are worth a million provided they have two
or three daughters and no sons and are willing to be splendid in their
entertainments an agriculturist of our own latitudes can never expect
to be made respectable but a planter of cotton or tobacco who owns a
hundred negroes and puts the name of his farm or the county he lives
in after his own has as good a chance as any

all other classes are vulgar and mechanical and therefore ineligible
men of science and genius are excluded on account of their manners
which are outlandish and their arrogant display of superiority which
is disagreeable and as for the actors dancers and singers that
are sometimes met with the two first are admitted because they are
foreign and famous and the last because they bring good music for
nothing

from this exposition of the code of society it will be seen that my
uncle wilkins could boast but slender claims to an introduction his
occupation had been vulgar and he had not made money enough to ennoble
him i trebled his two hundred and ninety thousand as is usual but i
could not deny that his son was named sammy and his daughter pattie

but what spoke highly in his favour was that whatever had been his
profession he had now abandoned it with the praiseworthy intention of
living a gentleman during the remainder of his life and what was also
advantageous he had pursued it at such a distance from the haunts of
fashion that his new friends might with the greatest propriety affect
an entire ignorance of it

his having a daughter too and but one son to divide with her his
eight hundred and seventy thousand--that is to say his two hundred and
ninety--was also a strong recommendation to those mammas who had sons
to provide for and his determination to indulge the fair pattie in
as many balls and parties as she desired was another circumstance to
propitiate favour

but to crown all i countenanced him and that settled the matter
in a few days time there was such a rattle and trampling at the
brewer's door as had never been known before the whole square was in
commotion being choked up with carriages and such was the throng of
genteel people rushing into the house that an unsophisticated dealer
in second-hand furniture supposing there was an auction to be held
stalked into the parlour and electrified everybody by wondering in
the way of a question not addressed to any particular person when the
sale was to begin

in short the thing was settled my uncle was dubbed a gentleman and
every occurrence went to show that in the approaching season his rank
would be confirmed and his daughter recognised as a belle by everybody
in town

but before that time a change came o'er the spirit of my fate and--but
i shall confess the whole affair to the reader




chapter xvii


in which sheppard lee relates the passion he conceived for his fair
cousin and his engagement to elope with her


my uncle wilkins it seems was not merely ambitious to get into good
society he was ambitious to have his daughter married and as he
said into the best family in the land an object not very difficult
to compass considering the fortune he intended to leave her but my
uncle was resolved her husband should be rich as well as distinguished
and i discovered the old curmudgeon had an extreme horror of poverty
perhaps one of the strongest reasons for his leaving the country was
a fear he had lest his adorable daughter should be snapped up by that
aforesaid danny baker whom my cousin had pronounced one of the truest
and handsomest sweethearts i ever saw although i never saw him at
all nor indeed any other extremely true and handsome sweetheart of
the male gender in all my life for those that are true are ugly and
those that are handsome are as uncertain as politics i say this was my
uncle's fear and indeed he confessed to me his belief that pattie
had really a sneaking kindness for the young rustic for which reason
he was anxious to have her married as soon as possible

i may here observe that if a bachelor is to judge of the excellence of
love by the character of its vocabulary he will discover no stirring
reason to lament his insensibility all the expressions on the subject
go to show that there is something mean and contemptible in the tender
passion which men otherwise profess to be the most heavenly of the
passions--as if indeed heaven had any thing to do with any of them
the moment a man begins to think a woman uncommonly charming he is
said to cast a sheep's eye on her when he feels a friendship for
her it becomes a sneaking kindness and the moment his heart is in
a hubbub he is deep in the mire from these terms and others that
might be mentioned it results as i have said namely--that men and
women who have experienced the tender passion are notwithstanding
their pretences to the contrary really ashamed of it that a lover is
a sheep and a sneaking fellow ordained to grovel in the mud at the
feet of his mistress and finally that a bachelor has no good reason
to execrate his stars for keeping him single

but i had other notions when i was in mr i d dawkins's body

i was entirely of my uncle's way of thinking and proposed to take her
myself to which my uncle replied in some perturbation none of your
jokes there ikey my boy and gave me plainly to understand that was
a thing he would never think of nay the proposition seemed to him so
unpalatable that i was compelled to pretend i had made it entirely in
jest though i demanded supposing i had been serious what objection
he could have to me oh none in the world said he except your
being so near of blood for a cousin-german is almost the same as a
brother

i understood the old hunks better than he thought he had somehow
or other found out that i had spent my fortune and was therefore
in that particular no better off than mr danny baker i saw too
clearly enough that he only valued me as a sort of stepping-stone into
society and that having once had all the advantage of me he could he
would be ready to forget all my benefits the curmudgeon he had found
out i had been borrowing money of his son sammy and he was already
longing for the time to come when he might safely discard me

i resolved to marry pattie in spite of him and began to cast about for
some device by which to secure her share of his two hundred and ninety
thousand which it was more than probable he would withhold in the
event of her marrying against his will this device i soon hit upon

i told him there was among all my acquaintance not above one man whom
i could recommend as a husband for pattie for though there were dozens
of genteel young fellows fortunes were by no means so plentiful my
friend tickle i assured him was just the man--a little gay to
be sure indeed quite dissipated and what was worse an enemy to
matrimony which was the more extraordinary as by marrying he might
come at once into possession of a splendid fortune and thereupon i
told him that jack's father who was a saint in his way and a bigot
to reclaim him had by will for i assured him the poor man was dead
bequeathed his superb estate to him only upon condition that he married
before the expiration of five years failing in which the whole
property now in the hands of trustees would revert to other persons
with the exception of a shabby annuity of a thousand a year the five
years i told my uncle wilkins were now nearly expired and jack
being in some alarm was already expressing an inclination to seek a
spouse but she must be a rich one otherwise he would never think of
her

this story which i fabricated for the purpose produced a strong
effect upon my uncle wilkins and i concluded it by recommending he
should without delay settle half his fortune upon pattie by legal
grant of dedi et concessi as the lawyers call it and register the
same in which event i would do all i could to bring the marriage
about not doubting that we should succeed since pattie was as i
averred just the sort of girl that tickle liked

my uncle was rather dumbfounded at the last proposal and swore he
would do no such thing he was not going he said to bribe anybody
to take his girl off his hands not he she should have her share when
he was dead and if she married to his liking why she should have
something before i might bring my friend tickle to see her if i would
and he would see what he thought of him

my uncle put a bold face upon the matter but i perceived he was eager
to make the acquaintance of my friend tickle and would be soon brought
to reason and indeed after having seen the intended son-in-law
and listened some half a dozen times over to my arguments he opened
his heart so far as to settle the sum of forty thousand dollars upon
pattie which--or rather the yearly interest of that sum for the
crafty old sly-boots took care to constitute himself trustee for the
girl and retain the principal in his own hands--he conditioned to pay
her after her marriage

i was provoked at his stinginess but as no better terms could be had
i thought i might as well bring the matter to a conclusion trusting
that something better would turn up after my marriage

i say my marriage for i had no thoughts of bestowing forty thousand
dollars or the interest thereof upon my friend tickle i made him my
confidant in the matter and easily prevailed upon him to assist me in
deceiving my uncle wilkins by appearing to pattie in the light of a
wooer as for pattie herself who i was persuaded had fallen in love
with me at first sight i made her a declaration which diverted and
delighted her beyond expression and revealing to her also my project
to secure her an independence she agreed to do her part in the play
pretend a great fancy for mr tickle and run away with me the moment
her father should make her the grant in question

the grant was made as i mentioned before but by that time i was in
a dilemma having made an engagement to elope with another lady who
was in some respects highly attractive and had fallen devouringly in
love with me indeed i may say she made me the first offer though it
was not leap-year but her situation excused her especially as it was
i she made love to she was the reader will be surprised to learn the
daughter of old skinner or goldfist the usurer and she was rather
handsome than otherwise the engagement was brought about as will be
shown in the next chapter




chapter xviii


in which sheppard lee recounts an engagement of a similar nature which
he formed with the fair alicia


my creditors looking with great certainty for their money now that
my long-talked-of uncle had got to town having waited a couple of
weeks for payment in vain began to besiege me in a highly importunate
way and as no assistance was to be had of my uncle and sammy's purse
was not so well filled as i could have wished i was reduced to great
straits

conversing on this subject with my friend tickle he advised me to
visit old goldfist as i that is my prototype the true dawkins had
often done before and see what could be had out of him on the strength
of my projected nuptials

the advice being as good as could be had for tickle's pockets were
as empty as my own i proceeded to the old fellow's house after
nightfall--for i did not care to be observed

having knocked at the door it was opened by no less a person than
skinner's fair daughter herself as i soon discovered and in fact i
had some faint recollection of having seen her before there was a lamp
on the pavement before the door by which i could see her very plainly
she blushed and smiled and looked confused and when i asked for her
father made me some answer which i did not understand but as she
invited me to enter i followed her into the house expecting to be led
to the money-lender she conducted me however to a parlour not over
and above well furnished for skinner was a notorious skinflint when
having vouchsafed to converse with her a while i again asked after her
father

she told me he was not at home but seeing me rise to depart she
stammered out an assurance that he would soon return which caused me
to resume my seat evidently to her great pleasure

seeing this i condescended to make myself agreeable and with such
effect that the simple-hearted foolish creature began to tell me how
often she had seen me at her father's house a year or two before when
she was a little school-girl as she said and how glad she was to
see me back again as if a year or two before we had been intimate
acquaintances when on the contrary as my associations assured me i
or my original had never taken the slightest notice of her--as in
truth why should i her father being so much beneath me

i believe i rather gave her a stare but she looked so admiringly at
me i could do no less than continue to be agreeable and to tell the
truth i was afterward amazed at my condescension

by-and-by there dropped in one of her brothers a very fine looking
young man for one of his rank in life but of a dissipated
under-the-table look and i thought somewhat julapized--which is
a word that among certain classes signifies that one is not sober
however he behaved with great decorum and instead of taking a
seat as i expected to make my acquaintance he gave me a nod and a
laugh as much as to say i know what you're after my boy and went
stumbling into the back part of the house

in a few moments after there came another equally good looking but not
so obliging for he helped himself to a seat without any ceremony and
with just as little proceeded to inform me he supposed i was after
dad but dad was fast on an arbitration and would not be home for at
least three hours

poor alicia for that was her name and in this particular she was
better provided than my cousin pattie gave her brother an angry look
for at this announcement i got up and took my leave she followed
me however to the door and told me if i would come at about eight
o'clock on the following evening i would find her papa at home and
she added softly that she would be glad to see me--she glad to see
me poor soul

i went though according to appointment and poor soul she was
glad to see me as was plain enough but sorry that papa had not yet
got through with that arbitration and so i could not see him unless
i would be so good as to wait until he came home and if i would it
would be charity for there was nobody in the house with her except old
barbara the housekeeper who was but poor company--and indeed she
had but poor company always living a very lonesome life of it c
c and she concluded by promising if i would sit down to play me a
tune upon the piano

she played me a tune accordingly and horrid work she made of it but
as she did her best i praised her and that pleased her she then
to show me that she was accomplished introduced me to divers bits of
paper with colours on them which she told me were drawings and as i
knew but little of such things i took her word for it after which she
exhibited some two or three dozen handsome-looking volumes in french
and italian of which languages i knew no more than dandies in general
and for that reason i told her such things were now considered bores
and left to children and schoolmasters

i perceived we were to have a tête-à-tête of it and i began to suspect
the lassie knew so when she invited me when this idea entered my
mind i felt a little indignant yet it was diverting to think of her
simplicity i thought i would amuse myself with her a little while and
unbend from the austerity of dignity which seemed to gratify her most

in this humour i permitted myself to be merry and easy and having
romped with her one way and another much to her delight i at last
seized upon her and gave her a buss whereupon she acted pretty much
as my cousin pattie had done before her--that is she laughed and
blushed and cried oh la but looking all the time any thing but
incensed

in short my condescension affected her to that degree that she
began to treat me as her most undoubted friend and in the height
of her confidence informed me that she was just eighteen years old
minus two months the very age of my cousin pattie that she was
her father's favourite as far as any one could be the favourite of
such a curmudgeon and that besides her fine expectations from him
she enjoyed in her own right a fortune of twenty thousand dollars--a
bequest from some old aunt or other--which she would come into
possession of as soon as the aforesaid two months and a few odd days
had expired

this was news that affected me very strongly and had her father been
a gentleman all things considered i believe i should have made her a
declaration on the spot

as it was i felt my soul growing tender towards her for though twenty
thousand dollars was but a small sum it was if i could take her word
for it certain which was not yet the case with any of my cousin
pattie's expectations however before i could digest the information
we were surprised by the turning of a dead-latch key in the front
door and alicia cried with a tone of disappointment oh la it is
papa--and so it was

the old gentleman looked upon the open piano and the books and
drawings upon the table with surprise and then upon me with
uneasiness

mr dawkins has been waiting papa said alicia

humph said old goldfist and pointed her to the door she stole me a
look and as she passed out raised her hand archly to her lips she
was rather free i confess but she had lived a secluded life and knew
no better

the old fellow gave me a sharp look coughed phthisically twice or
thrice and then with but little superfluous ceremony asked me what i
wanted

money said i

oh ay always money who is to pay it what's your security

my uncle wilkins said i

very good name don't doubt growled the bear the banks will take
it don't do any business of that sort

ged faith no said i i don't come for money at six per cent
but on the old terms of usury you know my uncle wilkins eh only two
children--a fortune of eight hundred and seventy thousand dollars

bah said the bull that will do for the girls and boys know all
about him one hundred and twenty and half of it in railroads--good
for nothing

two hundred and ninety bona fide said i and half of it in
bank-stock

know all about it said mr skinner but what's that to you has a
son of his own

and a daughter said i giving him a nod which brought a christian
look into his face and doubtless a christian feeling into his
hearts i took advantage of it to inform him that she and i were about
to elope and wanted a thousand dollars to bear our expenses assuring
him also that her father was on the eve of making her a grant of fifty
thousand dollars as soon as which was done we should be off at a
moment's warning to be brief i told the old fellow all that was
necessary for my purpose and made so good a story of it that i have
no doubt i should have got something out of him had not my evil genius
suddenly prompted me to refer to his own daughter alicia and ask him
what he intended to give her over and above her own twenty thousand

he looked as black as midnight and asked who told me she had such a
sum

i saw i had alarmed him and said i had it of a friend of mine a very
fine fellow who thought of taking her off his hands provided he would
add twenty more to it

want no fine fellows and no friends of yours said he gruffly
won't give her a cent and has nothing of her own all a fool's
story--told you so herself--a jade's trick never told a truth in her
life

the old miser's soul was up in arms the prospect of being called upon
in two months space to render up the girl's portion to a son-in-law
was so much scotch snuff thrown into his eyes if it did not blind
it at least distracted him and the reward i had for conjuring up the
vision was my own dismissal notwithstanding all my arguments to the
contrary with my pockets as empty as when i entered a rude assurance
that he had closed accounts with me and a highly impertinent request
that i would avoid troubling him for the future

so i got no money of him but his daughter fell in love with me
and the next day she sent me by the post a very tender and romantic
billetdoux in which she lamented her father's harshness and barbarity
hoped i would not think ill of her for venturing upon an apology and
concluded by informing me with agreeable simplicity that her father
was never at home between eight and nine o'clock in the evening when
the weather was clear from all which i understood that she was as
ready to run away with me as my cousin pattie

having pondered over the matter for a while it appeared to me proper
to encourage her enthusiasm so that in the event of my uncle wilkins
refusing to make pattie independent i might be certain of a wife
who could bring me something i had many objections indeed to the
lady's family and relations but the latter i could easily cut in case
of necessity and the other i considered scarce worth thinking of
her twenty thousand dollars was a strong recommendation and there
was no telling what her father might leave her if reconciled after
her marriage i liked my cousin pattie best but upon the whole i
considered it advisable to have a second string to my bow

with this impression on my mind i took occasion to drop in upon her
the first clear evening repeating the visit now and then as suited my
convenience and promised to run away with her upon the first fitting
occasion and this promise i resolved to keep provided my affairs with
my cousin pattie should render it advisable




chapter xix


the ingenious devices with which sheppard lee prepared the way for the
elopement


i had scarce brought my friend tickle upon the stage and introduced
him into my uncle's family before my mind began to misgive me i
suspected that instead of being content to play the stalking-horse for
my sole advantage he would take the opportunity to advance his own
interest and gain if he could my cousin pattie for himself

to remove all temptation and bind him more closely to be faithful i
told him of my adventure with alicia taking care however to conceal
her name for i did not wish to forego my advantages in that quarter
until convinced i could do so without loss described her claim to the
sixty thousand dollars for of course i trebled her inheritance and
concluded by engaging to make her over to him the moment i was myself
secure of pattie which would be the moment pattie was secure of an
independence

upon this promise tickle made me a thousand protestations of friendship
and disinterestedness and i felt my mind more easy

he acted his part assisted by pattie who at my suggestion feigned
suddenly to be violently in love with him and besieged her father
to the same end as myself the old gentleman at last com plied and
actually executed the deed of gift which i mentioned before by which
he secured to her the revenue accruing upon a sum of forty thousand
dollars the principal which he retained in his own hands in trust
to revert to her at his death and to this deed i was myself made a
witness

with these terms as it seemed there were no better to be had i
allowed myself to be satisfied and trusting to a final reconciliation
with my uncle wilkins to augment the dowry i ran to my cousin pattie
and informed her of her good fortune

she was filled with repture and began fairly to dance with joy she
told me i was the best and sweetest of cousins and vowed she would
love me to her dying day her joyous spirits fired my own and i
answered in terms equally ecstatic in short we agreed to elope that
very night and arranged our plan accordingly it was agreed i should
have a carriage in waiting at the corner of the street during the
evening and that pattie who was to feign herself unwell as an excuse
for not going to mrs pickup's first ball which was to take place
that evening should find some means to get her father out of the way
immediately after which i having disposed of the redoubtable sammy by
depositing him in the aforesaid mrs pickup's drawing-room was to make
my appearance and bear her in triumph to a reverend divine previously
secured for the ceremony

having settled all these things and sealed our engagement with a kiss
my adorable cousin admitted me to a secret which nearly froze my blood
with horror

she informed me that my friend tickle disregarding all his vows
of fidelity had been busy ever since i brought him into the house
besieging her on his own account that he had taken every occasion to
undermine me in her affections by disparaging my good qualities both
of soul and mind and especially by assuring her i was a great ass
and fortune-hunter those were his very words and finally that he
had so used the power his knowledge of our secret had given him by
occasional threats of betraying it to her father that she had been
compelled to accept his addresses and make him the same promise she
had just made me--that is to elope with him the perfidious fellow had
by some means got wind of the deed of gift and while i was engaged
in signing it he had paid my cousin a visit with the same object as
myself and she had promised to decamp with him nay at this moment
the villain was engaged in securing his carriage and his parson with
the prospect of chousing me out of my wife and fortune

my horror was however soon dissipated my cousin pattie had made the
engagement only in self-defence and she looked upon the whole affair
as the best joke in the world how we will cheat him said she the
base fellow and she danced about smiling and laughing and crying
together so that it was a delight to see her yes said she with
uncommon vivacity we will cheat him for i'm sure he deserves no
better for i'm sure he's just as much of a goose and fortune-hunter as
he said you were and i'm sure i despise a goose and fortune-hunter
above all things and i'm sure i know how to treat a goose and
fortune-hunter as well as anybody how we'll laugh at him to-morrow
how he'll stare when he finds i'm gone how papa will stare too how
sammy will stare and how he'll whistle oh dear i do love to cheat
people of all things i do cousin ikey and ods fishes i'm almost
half minded to cheat you too

and with that she flung her arms round my neck gave me a kiss and ran
laughing away to prepare for the hour of elopement

there was an extraordinary coincidence between the situation of my
cousin pattie and myself she had agreed to run away with two different
people at the same moment and so had i the day before my uncle proved
unusually crusty and self-willed and i began to think i should never
effect my point with him and what was equally dispiriting i fell
among duns who persecuted me with astonishing rancour my uncle's
appearance as it seemed serving rather to sharpen than to allay their
appetites for payment being thus goaded on by doubt and dunning i
resolved to make sure of goldfist's daughter which i did by visiting
her as soon as night came and proposing an elopement on the following
evening and this it was the more easy to put into execution since her
father as she told me was fast in bed with a sciatica or some such
vulgar disorder

no one could be more willing and delighted than the fair alicia and it
appeared that in anticipation of the happy event she had already made
all her preparations having as she assured me arranged with a friend
of hers at whose house she designed the ceremony to be performed
ordered secretly a whole trunk full of bride's clothes and notified an
old schoolmate whom she had engaged to wait upon her

i thought upon my soul she was taking matters pretty easily and
acting somewhat independently but she was ignorant of the world as i
said before and knew no better i was still more disgusted with the
thought of being shown off among her friends and told her a bridemaid
was wholly superfluous but she had made her mind up as to what was
right on such an occasion and i judged it proper to submit it was
agreed i should meet her at her friend's house at nine o'clock in the
evening and she hoped very modestly i thought that i would bring
some nice pretty fellow to wait on me that would make a good match
with her dear julia who was the nicest dear soul in the world

this nice dear soul as i afterward discovered and as i think proper
to inform the reader now that he may understand into what a slough of
democracy i was rushing was no less a personage than a cousin-german
of mr snip my tailor and her appointment to the honour of waiting
upon the bride of the distinguished i d dawkins was productive of a
casualty expected neither by herself nor by my adored alicia

i laughed in my sleeve at that hint of my alicia and yet i did after
all provide myself with an attendant and one who was perhaps better
suited than any other person i could have lighted on as an offset
and pendent to the fair julia this was my cousin sammy wilkins
and the reason of my appointing him was this he was although the
stupidest creature on earth of a meddling and prying nature and
had an extraordinary fancy to go sneaking after me whithersoever i
went--from admiration and affection perhaps but of that i was not
certain and at all events he was a great burden to me he discovered
my repeated visits to skinner's house and was seized with a stupid
curiosity to know the reason and what was still worse he made so
many observations on my attentions to and secret conferences with
his sister pattie that it was clear he suspected there was something
in the wind there too being kept in eternal torment lest he should
discover more than i liked or by his indiscreet tattling awake the
suspicions of others i saw no better means of averting the mischief
and turning his eyes from his sister than by taking him aside and
telling him with many injunctions to secrecy that i was courting old
skinner's rich daughter and wished to have him wait upon me at the
wedding

such confidence coupled with the intention to do him so much honour
entirely overcame his rustic imaginations he swore he approved of
marrying rich wives and was looking out for one himself and hoped i
would put him on the track of one which i promised and the clownish
juvenile was content he looked forward to the great event with a
measure of glee i had never seen him roused to before and he ordered a
new coat of snip that he might do honour to his service

it is quite true i never really intended he should trouble himself in
the matter but when the fated evening came when the loving alicia
arrayed in satin and white roses was awaiting her lover who was
preparing to run away with her rival i thought it better to despatch
him to my charmer than to leave him at mrs pickup's whence he might
stray at a moment's warning and indeed with no warning at all it
was quite necessary to have him out of the way for which reason i sent
him to the house where alicia was in waiting with a special message
to the lady to make his introduction the more easy and a thousand
instructions in relation to nothing

it was fortunate that my cousin sammy though as great a rustic as
ever lived was as little troubled with bashfulness as wisdom hence
i found no difficulty in despatching him to my inamorata whom he had
never laid eyes on and to her friends with regard to whom i was in
the same predicament i promised to follow him in a short time and
thus to my great joy succeeded in getting him out of the way




chapter xx


the guests that sheppard lee invited to his wedding


the appointed hour drew nigh and all things had gone on swimmingly
with one single exception the persecution i had endured from messrs
sniggles snip co the day before i was fated once more to endure
for going home to my lodgings about dusk to put on my best shirt
i found my chief creditors assembled in solemn divan or rather in
warlike ambush and such a troop of bears and wolves as they were was
perhaps never seen by an unfortunate gentleman before what had brought
them together especially at such an unlucky moment it was impossible
to divine but it seems they had had in consideration the state of
my affairs and prospects and had just come to the conclusion as i
entered that they were none the better off for the coming of my uncle
wilkins who for it appeared the villain sniggles had been sounding
him on the subject had disavowed all responsibility for my debts and
all disposition to discharge them in terms not to be mistaken it had
just been resolved nem con as the saying is that i had cheated
them that i was cheating them and that i would cheat them as long as
i could and that terms therefore should be kept with me no longer

to this moment my flesh creeps when i think of the yell the villains
set up when i stumbled among them and the audacity with which they
heaped on my devoted head their upbraidings menaces and maledictions
they used highly uncivil language and some laid their defiling fingers
upon my collar while all as with one voice cried out to carry me
before an alderman and make a public spectacle of me at once

i say my flesh yet creeps while i think of their ferocious conduct
and i shall remember it to my death-bed for of all the various
woes and grievances to which flesh is heir and which i have had
uncommon opportunities to test there are none more truly awful in my
recollections than a high case of dunning

it was several moments before i could utter a word in defence and when
i did having nothing better to say i assured the rascals i was just
on the eve of running away with my uncle's daughter and of course
would be soon able to answer all their scurvy demands i told them the
time was fixed the carriage and parson prepared and my fair pattie
in waiting but as i had told them many thousand things before which
were not always exactly true i found my present assurances received
with so little credit that i was obliged to give them ocular proof of
my honesty and fair-dealing i invited them to follow me to my uncle's
door and there station themselves until they beheld me come forth
conducting my bride to the carriage after which they might if they
would follow me in like manner to the parson and i engaged in the
confidence of my heart if i failed to bring out a wife according to
promise to follow them without any further demur to the alderman or
to old nick himself which was pretty much the same thing

this proposal being highly reasonable was accepted and i had the
honour of such an escort to my uncle's doors as was never before
enjoyed by a bridegroom the only one who did not accompany me to my
uncle's door was mr snip the tailor who passing a house where lived
as he said a young lady of his acquaintance stepped in to show one
of his customer's new coats that he had on promising to follow after
us in a moment as my stars or the father of sin would have it this
young lady was that identical dear julia his cousin-german of whom
i spoke before and whom he found rustling in satin just prepared
as she informed him to join her dear alicia skinner who was to be
married to the handsome mr dawkins at the house of their friend mrs
some-one-or-other

the tailor was thunderstruck as tailors doubtless often are assured
the dear julia she was mistaken and acquainted her with the true state
of the case the result of which was as may be understood when she
had carried her news to the expectant alicia a certain scene of a
highly interesting nature as for mr snip himself he rushed out of
the house to bring me to an explanation but when he reached the party
i had already taken refuge in my uncle's house




chapter xxi


containing a scialogue or curious conversation with nothing with a
discovery extremely astonishing to several persons


i found my cousin pattie also in her satins and nora magee whom she
had resolved to take with her decked out with extraordinary splendour
and what i thought was diverting enough the creature had a long
bridal veil like her mistress and as huge a cloak to conceal her
person from observation they were prepared to start with each her
bundle at hand and they hailed my appearance with delight

but there was a difficulty before us my uncle wilkins was yet in the
house and so was sammy as for the latter i soon got rid of him by
sending him to alicia as i mentioned before but my uncle we could
not remove my cousin's affectation of sickness to confirm which and
conceal her nuptial preparations she kept aloof in her chamber or
pretended to do so concerned him and he refused to leave the house
but being left to himself we knew he would soon drop asleep that
being one of his rustical propensities

by-and-by while we were discoursing upon our difficulties we heard a
carriage drive by and just as it passed the door the coachman gave
three loud cracks with his whip it was a sign i had agreed upon with
the fellow and i knew all was now in readiness i proposed that we
should instantly steal down stairs and--

at that moment i heard the front door softly open and shut

who's that said i

ah i'm sure i don't know said my cousin pattie turning so pale
i thought she was going to fall down in a faint perhaps it is mr
tickle yes she cried recovering her spirits and almost jumping for
joy--now we'll sort him i'll show him how i serve fortune-hunters
i reckon i'll lock him up in a closet i will and there he shall
kick his heels till morning and i don't care if the rats eat him i
don't--oh goody gracious he's coming up stairs she cried was
there ever anybody so impudent but i'll fix him here cousin ikey do
you run in here--pointing to her chamber--and don't let him see you

no said i thinking it proper to appear courageous i will face
the faithless rascal and punish his impertinence on the spot i
had no idea of doing any such thing which of course must have
alarmed my uncle and i intended to yield to pattie's fears and
importunity swallow my wrath for the present and conceal myself as
she recommended but my display of resistance awoke the indignation of
nora magee who cried och the divil take him thin does he mane to
rob us of our husbands and seizing me by the shoulders she thrust me
towards the chamber

run in cousin ikey said my cousin driving the irish barbarian
away but seizing me herself and urging me into the chamber while
she seemed dying with suppressed mirth you'll see how nora will sort
him--you'll hear it you mustn't speak a word and ods fishes you
must remember to behave yourself--here she seemed more diverted than
ever--ods fishes you must behave yourself in a lady's chamber

at that moment nora blew out the light so that we were left in
darkness and my cousin locked the door thus as i supposed dividing
us from the enemy i say pattie my soul said i whispering in her
ear what is nora going to do with him but she answered me not a
word and i took that as a hint to hold my own peace the next instant
i heard a rustling in the next room and the voice of jack tickle
saying softly and almost in my own words

i say pattie my soul what did you blow out the light for where are
you--oh you divine creature and i heard the smack of a kiss that
quite astonished me

pattie said i what the deuse is the meaning of that

but pattie was as dumb as before the rustling was transferred from the
antechamber i had taught my cousin to call it her boudoir into the
passage and i could tell by the creaking of a step that my friend
tickle was going down stairs

pattie said i what's in the wind now

but still pattie refused to answer me

while i was wondering at her silence now that there was no fear of
being overheard i again distinguished the sound of the house door
softly opened and shut

i say pattie said i what the devil is all that and pray why
don't you speak

it occurred to me that her silence was all owing to a fit of
bashfulness caused by her having me locked up in the chamber with her

pattie said i reaching out my hands but without being able to
reach her you shouldn't be bashful nor nothing considering we're to
be married in less than half an hour i say pattie what are we to do
now where are you

while i spoke i heard a carriage again rattle by the door and to my
astonishment the coachman saluted the house with three such cracks of
his whip as my own had given a few minutes before

pattie said i while a cold sweat broke over my limbs where are
you and why don't you speak

i felt about the door for her but felt in vain i listened for the
sound of her breath hoping she might have hidden herself out of sheer
mischief but not a breath was to be heard i went feeling about the
chamber and with as little effect

a horrible suspicion seized upon my fancy there were two doors to the
apartment one opening upon the passage the other into the boudoir
and both were locked as fast as doors could be where was the key my
cousin pattie turned when we entered the chamber together it was gone
i discovered its absence and looked round the chamber in astonishment
and dismay

at that moment some person in mr periwinkle smith's house which
was right opposite entered a front chamber therein with a light
which streamed into the windows of pattie's apartment with a lustre
sufficient to make every object visible my cousin pattie was not to be
seen i looked under the bed and into the bed examined the presses
and peeped behind the chairs but no cousin pattie was to be found she
had locked me in the chamber but not herself horror of horrors she
had played a trick upon me she had jilted me and--ay there was no
doubting it a moment longer--she had run off with my friend tickle
i'll show you how i serve fortune-hunters said she--lock him up in
a closet--kick his heels till morning--eaten up by rats--shall hear
yourself how i'll serve your rival tickle death and destruction and
after all she has run away with him--eloped in the very carriage i
provided married by the parson i engaged decamped with the forty
thousand i secured and i--i the unfortunate jilted cozened
i--was the person left kicking my heels in a closet

the idea filled me with phrensy and the light from mr periwinkle
smith's house being removed at the moment i tumbled over a chair that
lay in my way and besides breaking my head and shin woke up such a
din in the house that the very servants in the kitchen bounced up in
alarm and screamed out for assistance

what's the matter pattie said my uncle wilkins turning the key
which the faithless creature had left sticking in the outside of the
door and entering i say pattie ods bobs what's the--lord bless
us cousin ikey is that you what's the matter what are you doing in
pattie's chamber

i answered my uncle wilkins only by opening my mouth as wide as i
could and staring at him in anguish horror and despair

where's pattie said he in alarm

the question restored me to my faculties

eloped said i cheated me beyond all expression and run off with
my rival jack tickle

what a fool said my uncle recovering his composure i'm sure i
never opposed her

so much for not giving her to me said i

to you said my uncle

uncle wilkins said i from this moment i shall cut your
acquaintance pattie has jilted me so horribly you can't conceive and
has married jack tickle

well said my uncle where's the harm to be sure and a'n't he as
good now as worth ten thousand a year

not worth a cent said i shaking my fists at the old gentleman--and
then drumming on my own breast--not worth a cent and down in every
tailor's books in town except snip's who wouldn't trust him

oh you villain said my uncle wilkins how you've cheated me

he ran down stairs and i after him he was bent upon pursuing his
daughter--and so was i



chapter xxii


in which sheppard lee finds that he has made the fortune of his
friends without having greatly advantaged his own


as we reached the foot of the staircase the house door opened and in
came my friend tickle dragged along--not by our dear and faithless
pattie as we fondly supposed but by the raging nora magee

help murder help cried my friend tickle

och murder and twenty murders more upon ye ye chatin crathur and
won't ye marry me cried nora magee

my uncle wilkins and myself rushed forward lost in amazement and
separated the fury from her prey what is the matter cried both and
where is pattie

the devil is the matter cried jack panting and blowing and where
pattie is i know no more than you i thought i was running away with
her until i reached the squire's and then i found i had this wild
indian under her cloak who insisted i should marry her or else--

ay ye murderin faithless villain said nora magee i'll marry ye
or i'll have the breaches of promise and the damages out of ye och
but i have the law of ye for didn't my missus pattie promise ye should
marry me i say ye ugly-faced hin-souled tickle that they call ye i
have the law of ye and i'll be married before the squire or i'll have
the breaches out of ye

my breeches said jack you may have and my coat and waistcoat too
for may i be hanged and quartered if i am not cheated out of my very
skin

where's my daughter pattie said my uncle wilkins he looked at me
and i looked at him it was plain my cousin pattie had not run away
with my friend tickle

where could she be i began to recover my spirits when they were
suddenly put to flight by a knock at the door which being opened a
letter was thrown in the messenger instantly taking to his heels so
that no one beheld him it was a letter to my uncle wilkins he opened
it and read the following words--

dear papa and honoured father

this is to inform you that i don't like mr tickle and so can't
marry him and hope you will excuse me for following my own fancies
being now independent as you have made me for which i will remain
your dutiful loving daughter for life give my love to cousin dully
and tell him i consider him my best friend next to my dear papa and
my dear husband--for oh papa i'm really married and going off
travelling to-morrow

hope you'll forgive us papa and shall ever love and pray for you and
rest your loving dutiful children

 pattie and danny baker

danny baker roared my uncle danny baker groaned i the clodhopper
had got her and i had been only toiling in his service

oh you villain said my uncle wilkins this is all your doings

sir said i no hard words

you're a villain said my uncle you wanted to steal her yourself
and i a'n't sorry danny baker has choused you out of her and for that
reason i don't care if i forgive him yes sir i'll forgive danny
baker but for you sir i owe you a debt--

if you do said tickle pay him but we took no notice of him--my
uncle because he was enraged and i because i was devoured by the
greatness of my misfortune in truth the loss of my cousin pattie was
so unexpected that it had astounded me out of my faculties i was
reduced to a mere automaton conscious indeed of being in a horrible
quandary but incapable of seeing my way out of it when i suddenly
heard the voice as i thought or some one very like it of my cousin
sammy at the door

this roused me at once i remembered that at this moment my alicia was
waiting for me and i fell into a rapture

uncle wilkins said i you may say what you please jack tickle you
are a rascal nora magee you are a jade but it is all one to i d
dawkins i will marry my miss skinner

as i spoke i looked upon the door which opening disclosed a sight
that petrified me body and soul together it was the apparition of
my alicia in bridal array leaning upon the arm of my cousin sammy
and followed by a brace of youthful damsels decked in white flowers
all of whom stalked into the door with the solid step of flesh and
blood and advanced towards my uncle my alicia looking as silly and
shame-faced as could be while sammy on the contrary held up his head
and strutted like a turbaned turk in the midst of his harem

what the deuse is all this said jack tickle as for me i could not
speak a word being a hundred fold more amazed than before i looked at
my alicia who seeing me began to blush and bridle and simper and
hold fast to sammy's arm as for sammy he looked not a whit the less
turkish but marched up to his father as if charging him at the head of
a regiment

the old gentleman was as much astonished as myself and at last cried
out

ods bobs what's the matter sam have you been running away too

no said my cousin sammy i reckon i'm not gone yet but i've come
to get ready and first dad as in duty bound let's have a bit of
your blessing if you've no objection on me and my wife

your wife said i and said no more

well said my cousin sammy i reckon i may say so for you see
dawkins my boy when i saw lishy here i liked her and when july
here came and told us as how you had run off with sister pat wilkins
why then said i i may as well speak up for myself and so as the
parson was ready and lishy dressed up to be married already we made
but short work of the courtship and now as the saying is one and one
is one this here is my wife for better and for worse and i hope
neither you nor father has any objection




chapter xxiii


a crisis sheppard lee is reduced to great extremities and takes
refuge in the house of mourning


i never knew what my uncle wilkins replied to the aforesaid speech
the longest i ever heard my cousin sammy utter nor do i know what
reception he gave to the bride i made but one jump to the front
door where my horror was consummated my departure was greeted by an
uproarious cry but it proceeded from the street not the house i
found myself among the philistines whom an hour before i had myself
placed there in wait i had forgotten the barbarians which was natural
enough as they were my creditors but they had not forgotten me they
hailed my appearance on the steps with some such yell of wrath and
hunger as that with which the beasts of a menagerie express their joy
at the appearance of their daily meal

that cry was the finisher i leaped from the steps and took to my
heels not however without leaving in the hands of my tailor one tail
of the last coat he had made me which was i believe the only payment
i ever made him my hat flew into the gutter and that was perhaps
recovered by its maker in which case it was doubtless brushed up
and sold over again as a new one i fled like the wind my creditors
followed me the clatter of our footsteps and the uproar of their
interjections threw the street into a tumult some persons yelled
murder and others cried stop thief while the little boys catching
up the cry from a distance screamed out fire and ran to the nearest
engine-house to enjoy their evening amusement

how long i ran and whither it is quite impossible for me to say i
recollect doubling two or three times and diving into alleys to throw
my pursuers off the track my efforts were however in vain i found
myself lodged at last in a vile alley and hemmed in both on the front
and rear i made a leap at a garden gate which i cleared then running
forward and perceiving a back door in a house standing open i rushed
in scarce knowing what i did

i immediately discovered that i was in a sort of servants hall
or anteroom to the kitchen in which an old woman sat sleeping in
an arm-chair she was disturbed by the noise of my entrance and i
dreaded every moment to see her open her eyes and by her shrieks draw
my pursuers after me i was afraid however to retreat for in the
confusion of my mind i thought i heard my tormentors rushing to and
fro in the garden

in this uncertainty seeing a flight of stairs in one corner of the
room i darted up them without reflecting a moment upon what might be
the consequences but what evil could happen to me more horrid than
that i was fleeing i might stumble into a lady's chamber and throw her
into hysterics or i might find myself at the bedside of some valiant
personage sleeping with a brace of pistols under his pillow the
contents of which he might transfer to my body but such catastrophes
had now lost their terrors it was all one to i d dawkins as i had
said to my uncle wilkins i could receive no addition to my woes go
whither and do whatsoever i might

i rushed up the stairs therefore and entered a chamber where a
tallow candle burning all on one side stood flaring on a little
table among vials gallipots and other furniture of a sick chamber
throwing a dim and spectral light on a bed near to which it stood i
cast my eyes upon the bed and perceived i had nothing to fear either
from timorous ladies or nervous gentlemen




chapter xxiv


what happened in the dead-chamber--the dirge of a wealthy parent


upon that couch lay the ghastly spectacle of a human corse stiff and
cold it was that of an old man and i thought at first that he slept
but upon looking closer i perceived that he had been dead for at
least an hour and it appeared as if he had died untended by friend or
servant for the bedclothes had been nearly tossed from the bed in his
last convulsion and now lay tumbled about his limbs and the floor
just as they had fallen his features were greatly distorted having an
expression of rage upon them that was highly disagreeable to look on
yet i had a vague feeling that i had seen him before

while i was wondering who he could be i perceived a paper clutched in
his right hand and taking it to the light the secret was at once
revealed

it was a letter from my adorable alicia to her father dated that very
evening in which she gave him to understand in the most romantic
language in the world that his opposition to her wishes in relation to
her beloved dawkins had broken her heart--that she could never think
of marrying any one else as if indeed the old gentleman ever wished
her--that she could not live without her dawkins and accordingly
had made up her mind to fly with him afar from parental severity
and concluded by assuring him that when he read those lines penned
by a grieved and determined but still dutifully loving heart she
said nothing of her fingers she would be in the arms of a lawful
husband there was appended a postscript in which she expressed much
contrition hoped he would forgive her and hinted that she would be of
age in two months

i looked at the old man again and wondered i had not known him before
it was old skinner sure enough and the secret of his death was
readily explained he had been sick before and this elegant epistle
had finished him--or rather the necessity so romantically hinted at
in the conclusion of settling two months thereafter his guardian's
account with her husband had done his business i did not suppose the
wound in his parental feelings had done him much hurt but there was
more perhaps in that than any one would have thought that knew the
old miser

and there he lay then the owner of thousands and hundreds of
thousands with none to mourn him--nay with not even a hand to smooth
the bed-robe over his neglected body he had squandered health
happiness good name and perhaps self-approbation the true riches of
man in the pursuit of the lucre which cannot purchase back again one
of these treasures and notwithstanding which lucre he was now and
indeed had been at his death-hour no better off than the beggar in his
coffin of deal he had heaped up gold for his children that they might
begrudge him the breath drawn in pain and infirmity and rejoice in the
moment of his death he had--but why should i moralize over a subject
worn just as threadbare as any other the old fellow was a miser and
met the miser's fate nobody accused even his children of loving him
and while i stood by his side i had a stronger proof of their regard
than spoke in the neglected appearance of his deathbed i had scarce
entered the room before i heard from some of the apartments below the
sounds of mirth and festivity

they were not to be mistaken it was plain that some persons were
feasting and making merry in one of the old fellow's parlours and i
doubted not they were his two sons ralph and abbot both of whom had
very bad characters the latter in particular who was a notorious
profligate they were young men of promise i had heard but the
avarice of the parent had ruined them their education neglected from
indifference or a miserable spirit of parsimony their minds and
morals uncultivated--the consciousness of their father's wealth and
their own golden prospects at his decease stimulated them to excesses
which were perhaps rendered still more agreeable to their imaginations
and certainly more destructive to their weal by the difficulty of
indulging in them resulting from the niggardliness of their father

but the reign of denial was now over the rattle and crash of glasses
and vessels in the room below the tumbling down of chairs and tables
with the sounds of singing shouting and laughter proclaimed with
what a lusty lyke-wake the abandoned sons were honouring the memory of
their father--with what orgies of bacchus they were celebrating their
own deliverance from restraint suddenly the sound of the singing grew
louder as if some door between the revellers and the dead had been
opened and a moment after i perceived from the increase and direction
of the uproar that the sots were ascending the stairs and perhaps
approaching the chamber of death

an idea seized upon my mind i was heartily sick of mr i d dawkins's
body being ready at that moment to exchange it for a dog's and i was
incensed at the heartless and brutal rejoicings of the young skinners
it occurred to me if i could get my spirit into old goldfist's body i
should avoid all dunning for the future and give these two reprobate
sons of his such a lesson as would last them to their dying day

the idea came to me like a blaze of sunshine i remembered in a moment
the vast wealth of the deceased and i pictured to my imagination the
glorious use i should make of it i had always hated and despised the
old villain but a sudden affection for him now seized upon my soul i
had a strong persuasion in me resulting from my two former adventures
that i possessed the power of entering any human body which i found to
my liking and i resolved to exercise it or at the worst to make
proof of its existence for a third time of the manner of exercising
the power i knew but little i remembered however that on the former
occasions i had merely uttered a wish and the transformation was
instantly completed i stepped up to the body and chuckling with the
idea of chousing the unnatural sons out of their expected inheritance
i said old goldfist if you please i wish to be in your body

in less than a second of time i found myself starting up from the bed
as if i had just been roused from sleep by the noise of some falling
body and exclaiming what's that


i looked over the side of the bed and saw the body of i d dawkins
lying on the floor on its face the transformation was complete and
had been so instantaneous that my spirit heard through the organs of
its new tenement the downfall of its old i felt a little bewildered
indeed posed and remained upon my elbow staring about the room and i
may add that i was more disconcerted by the bacchanalian voices now at
the chamber door than by any thing else

the door opened and the young skinners entered i shall remember them
to my dying day they were both royally drunk and each armed with
a candle with which scattering the tallow over the floor as they
advanced they came staggering and hiccoughing into the chamber

i say bravo dad and no offence said the foremost but don't feel
so sorry as i ought and here's ralph a'n't sorry neither

led us a devilish hard life of it grumbled the other but shall
have something done for his soul by the catholics i say abby shall
buy that black horse and the buggie

and a tombstone for dad said the worthy abbot laying his candle
upon the table and striking an attitude like a dancing-master which
however he could not keep i say ralph he went on it isn't right
to say so but don't you feel good three hundred thousand apiece
dammee i say ralph let us dance

and the villains took hands and attempted a pas de deux as the
theatre people have it while the old woman who had been sleeping
below and was roused by the fall of my late body came running into
the room to see what was the matter by this time the dogs had
chasséd up so nigh to the bed that for the first time they laid
their eyes upon the reanimated countenance of their father

the effect was prodigious the moment before their faces were all
drunkenness and triumph--now they were all drunkenness and horror the
light of the candle held by ralph flashed over my visage but abbot was
the first to observe me resting on my elbow and staring at him with
looks of wrath and indignation

lord love us ralph said he dad's coming to

yes you villains said i i am coming to you unnatural undutiful
rascals i have come to

they looked upon me and upon one another unutterably confounded
and i wondered myself that i did not laugh at them their confusion
however only filled me with rage and i railed at them with as much
emphasis and sincerity as if i had been their father in earnest

they dropped on their knees but their rueful appearance only added to
my fury i stormed and i scolded until being quite exhausted with the
effort a film came over my eyes and i fell back in a swoon

chapter i


the private history of abram skinner the shaver


my swoon was i believe of no great duration and i awoke from it a
new man as well as an old one

yes i was changed and with a vengeance and into such a miserable
creature that had i justly conceived what i was to become in entering
old goldfist's body i doubt whether even the extremity in which i was
placed would have forced me upon the transformation i forgot that
the title to skinner's wealth was saddled with the conditions of age
infirmity and a thousand others equally disagreeable but i soon made
the discovery though it was some time before i discovered all

the first inconvenience of the transformation which i felt was a
thousand aches in my bones a great disturbance in my inner man and
a general sense of feebleness and impotency highly vexatious and
tormenting my eyesight was bad my hearing indistinct and indeed
all my senses were more or less confused my hand trembled when i
lifted it to my face my voice quavered while i spoke and every effort
to breath seemed to fill my lungs with coal-gas and ashes in a word i
was a man of sixty years or more with a constitution just breaking up
if not already broken

my resuscitation produced a hubbub of no ordinary character my
sons--for wonderful to be said i had sons and i soon felt as if
they were in reality mine--were confounded and so doubtless was
barbara the housekeeper to the latter of whom it was perhaps owing
that i ever recovered from my swoon for my two boys overcome with
horror and despair rushed out of the house and it was a week before i
saw their faces again

what added to the confusion was the discovery of my late body lying
on the floor no one being at all able to account for its appearance
to this day indeed the thing remains a mystery among tailors and
shop-keepers it was pretty generally considered that the unfortunate
i d dawkins met his death by dunning and i believe the coroner's
jury returned a verdict accordingly but how he made his way into the
chamber of the usurer to give up the ghost just at the moment the
other was resuming it was never known some supposed he had visited
the old gentleman to borrow money and had knocked his head against the
bedpost in despair upon finding the lender past lending speculation
was alive upon the subject for two full days and was then buried in
the young gentleman's grave along with his body and his memory for
the memory of a dandy passeth away unless recorded on the books of his
tailor

i was confined to my bed a week suffering with a complication of
disorders for though i possessed the power to reanimate a corpse i
had none to conjure away its diseases in this period i had leisure to
exchange all previous characteristics that might have clung to me for
those that more properly belonged to my new casing and when i rose
from my bed the transformation was in every particular complete my
soul had lost its identity it had taken its shape from the mould it
occupied it was the counterpart of the soul of abram skinner

my last act as i d dawkins was to chuckle over the prospect of
spending abram skinner's money my first as abram skinner was to take
care it should be spent neither by myself nor by any one else the
desire to enjoy myself had vanished the thoughts of fine clothes
horses and carriages and so on entered my mind no more the only idea
that possessed me was what am i worth how much more can i make myself
worth and the first thing i did when i could sit in a chair was to
ransack a certain iron chest that stood under my bed containing my
prototype's books of accounts over which i gloated with the mingled
anxiety and delight that had doubtless distinguished the studies of the
true goldfist

i found myself rich beyond all my previously-formed expectations
and glum and rigid as were now all my feelings i think i should
have danced around my chamber for joy had not the first flourish
of a leg introduced me to the pangs of rheumatism i indulged my
rapture therefore in a soberer way and while awaiting the period of
emancipation from my chamber arranged a thousand plans for increasing
my wealth

my sons had deserted me but i was not left entirely to solitude
i received divers visits from old fellows like myself who after
growling out a variety of wonder and congratulation at my return to
life proceeded to counsel with me on subjects the discussion of which
speedily brought me to the knowledge of my new condition where it had
not been supplied by the iron chest and my instincts

these persons formed a confraternity of which it seems i or rather
my prototype abram skinner was a prominent member and the objects
of the association were to secure to each member the fruits of his
ambition with as little danger and trouble as possible we were a
knot of what the censorious call stock-gamblers and by working in
common and playing into each other's hands without taking pains to
acknowledge any connexion we were pretty sure of our game

it is astonishing how soon i entered into the spirit of my new
character on previous occasions the adaption of soul to body was a
work of time but here it seemed the work of but a few hours the cause
was however simple abram skinner was possessed of but one or at
most two characteristics and with these i easily became familiar the
love of money was the ruling passion and this i honestly confess
came to me so naturally that i was not conscious while giving up my
whole soul to it of any change of character whatever before i left
the house i was as busy shaving notes receiving bonds mortgages and
pledges for abram skinner was a gambler of all work and devising
schemes for cornering and blowing high and low in the stock-market
as if i had been born to the business

i found on my books the records of all imaginable operations from the
mem of a thousand shares of the moonlight manufacturing company
bought of a b on time to the entry of mrs c ds silver spoons and
pitcher purchased abram skinner scorned all dealing on pawns
that being illegal to the unlicensed at such a sum but redeemable at
such another sum which was generally at fifty per cent advance on a
certain day or--forfeit here was a memorandum of a note bought at
half its value there of a mortgage taken in form of a purchase and in
other places a thousand other forfeitures such as marked the extent
and universality of business the skill the forethought and the
success of abram skinner the shaver

i have my compunctions when i think of the life i led that winter for
so long did i continue the life of a money-maker but i entreat the
reader to remember that i had got into abram skinner's body and that
the burden of my acts should be therefore laid upon his shoulders a
swearing gentleman once borrowed a quaker's great-coat with a promise
not to dishonour it by any profanity while it was on his back upon
returning it to his friend he was demanded if he had kept his promise
yes said the man of interjections with one of the most emphatic
but it has kept me lying all the time i never heard anybody doubt
that the lying was the fault of the coat and in like manner i hope
that the reader will not hesitate to attribute all my actions while in
abram skinner's body to abram skinner's body itself

besides my friends of the honest fraternity i had other visiters
before my infirmities permitted me to leave the house and the dealings
i had with them besides enabling me to get my hand in as the saying
is would afford the reader if described some insight into the
excellences of my new character

but i cannot pause over such pictures in detail the rulers then over
us to please the poor had got up a pressure in the money-market
whereby the poor were as is usual in such cases put under
contribution by the rich such a pressure however may be said to
please everybody though it puts everybody in a passion to the
rich who have money to lend it is as great a season of jubilee
as a rain-storm to ducks or a high wind to the bristly herd in an
apple-orchard and they are in a passion because they fear it will
be soon over to the poor who borrow their money at a higher rate
than usual it affords an opportunity to rail at the aristocracy and
the grinders of the poor which is a pleasing recreation after a bad
dinner at such times abram skinner was a happy man for he made money
without the trouble of stirring from his house every knock at the door
was the signal of a god-send every jerk at the bell was as the jingle
of coming dollars and cents




chapter ii


sheppard lee's first hit at money-making


it was at such a season that i entered the shaver's body the knocks
at my door were frequent and the demands of my visiters to be
brought into presence irresistible what cared they for my pains and
sickness--they wanted money what cared i for my pains and sickness
--i was anxious to make it i ordered my house-keeper barbara for
it seems i was such a niggard i had no other servant to admit all
well-dressed applicants for i scorned to deal with any other

the first person admitted was a woman very good looking but advanced
in years she kept a boarding-house but as barbara informed me
had seen better days having been the wife of a rich merchant who
failed was absurd enough to keep his books so straight as to allow no
opportunity for defrauding his creditors surrendered up every cent
of his property and died a beggar leaving a widow and six orphan
daughters to lament his honesty

she was in some little flurry and perturbation of spirits but i spoke
with a blandness that astonished myself until i found that this was
always my practice with a customer whom i was not tired of this
restored her to confidence and garrulity

her tale was soon told--her boarders were all very fine gentlemen
and ladies and good pay but the times were so hard they were just
at this moment compelled to pay with promises with which coin her
landlord was not so easily satisfied she would not distress poor mr
g who owed her a hundred and fifty dollars nor mr h nor mrs i
who were all in a peck of trouble just then but were well enough to do
in the world--no not she she had heard i was so good as often to lend
to people who wanted money for a few days even when the banks would
not provided they were good and safe and who was better and safer
than she with all her troubles and the lord he knew they were many
and enough she had always paid her debts and she defied anybody to
say the contrary and so she hoped i would be so good as to oblige her
with the small sum of two hundred-dollars which upon her honest word
she would pay as soon as she had the money

to this eloquent suggestion i answered and i doubt if the true abram
skinner could have answered better by lamenting her difficulties and
assuring her i was in as great trouble as herself not having a cent at
command that i could call my own the iron chest told another story
and there were divers handsome hundreds placed to my credit in three
or four different banks nevertheless i had a little money belonging
to a friend which i thought i might make so free as to lend to one of
her excellent character and standing but that would be taking a great
responsibility on my shoulders c c in terms which the reader can
easily imagine and i concluded by hinting that if she had any plate
or other valuables to deposite as a security it would save her the
trouble of giving her note and the inconvenience such an instrument
might prove to her if my friend's necessities should compel him to
throw it into the market

the widow delighted with my frankness and penetrated by my
friendliness ran home and returned with a basket of chattels to the
value of perhaps three hundred and fifty dollars

very good said i you shall have the money though i should have to
pay for it myself

sure said she but you are a good obliging man and i shall be much
beholden and sure but i thought all pawnbrokers had golden balls at
their doors

madam said i thank your good fortune that i am not a pawnbroker
had you gone to such a person you would have paid dear for your money
and perhaps lost your silver into the bargain now supposing this
silver to be worth three hundred dollars--

three hundred lack-a-daisies said the old lady why it cost more
than four hundred dollars for i remember the coffee-pot--

yes ma'am said i that was the cost of making i reckon the silver
at about three hundred dollars though that is a large allowance now
had you taken this to a pawnbroker what do you think he would have
loaned you on it

to be sure and i suppose but i can't say

one hundred dollars perhaps if a moderate fellow said i but i
am another sort of man i scorn to take any advantage of any one yes
said i feeling warm and virtuous i scorn them there fellows that
take advantage and grind down the poor to the last mite i mrs--
hum ha mrs--

mrs smith said the old lady eying me with admiration

i mrs smith will treat you in another way i will let you have
what you want--the full two hundred dollars for the space of thirty
days and charge you but twenty-five dollars for the favour

sure said mrs smith and that's dear

on the contrary madam said i it is but twelve and a half per
cent a month whereas money will often fetch fifteen

will it indeed said the foolish widow and sure but you must
know better than myself well then mr skinner let me have the two
hundred dollars and you shall have the plate in pawn

no ma'am said i none but a pawnbroker can do that a gentleman
like myself does this sort of thing in another manner for were i to
receive this silver as a pawn you might prosecute me for it in court
and make me pay a fine the way we do is this i buy the plate of
you for two hundred dollars taking a receipt from you for that
amount and granting you on my part a written permission to purchase
the same back again this day month for the sum of two hundred and
twenty-five dollars

la said the old lady is that the way but what if i should not get
the money in a month

why then said i with a look of benevolence why then i think i
must give you a month longer

sure and you are the best man in the world said mrs smith and you
think my silver won't be in no danger and you'll lock it up in some
big iron chest for thieves are quite thick already and your paper to
buy again will be just as good as a pawnbroker's certificate

i hastened to satisfy the old lady's mind on this and all other
subjects i then wrote out a receipt which i caused her to subscribe
being a due acknowledgment on her part of having sold me certain
specified articles of plate after which i delivered her a paper
in which without troubling myself to make any reference to the
conveyance i covenanted to sell her the same articles at the price
mentioned before at the expiration of thirty days

with this and the two hundred dollars which i now gave her the foolish
woman departed very well satisfied and as for me i actually rubbed my
hands together with the delight of having made such a good bargain i
say again old skinner himself could not have managed the affair with
greater address than myself and young as i was in his body i felt as
much satisfaction at having overreached a silly old woman as ever a
less avaricious man felt at deluding a young one this was small game
to be sure for a man who dabbled in stocks and counted profits not
by dollars but by hundreds and thousands but as i said before abram
skinner was a man of all work who thought no gain small enough to be
despised and who cheated a single tatterdemalion with as much zeal as
he would fleece a community

the end of the bargain was this in a month's time mrs smith called
on me again but without money whereupon i spoke to her with greater
benevolence than before assured her she need not be distressed
and renewed the engagement between us by adding twenty-five dollars
the interest upon the money advanced to the sums specified in
the conveyance and covenant and the same amount i added at the
expiration of the second month and this course i intended to pursue
for two months more until the amount of interest should swell the
purchase-money to three hundred dollars after which i designed to
close the bargain and consider the silver fairly purchased

if anybody supposes i treated the old woman ill--that i acted
dishonestly and even illegally in the matter--all i have to say is
that i only did what abram skinner the shaver had done a thousand times
before me and what i have no doubt other worthy gentlemen of his
tribe have done after me he who rides with the devil must put up with
his driving and he who deals with his nephews must look for something
warmer than burnt fingers

the transaction with mrs smith was a sample of divers others begun
and conducted on the same principles though involving more momentous
profits the system of forfeitures as practised by a skilful hand
is applicable to all species of property and i practised it with
great effect in the case of houses and lands and the lord knows what
besides the pressure continued long and i think i should have made
a handsome fortune in the course of the winter out of this single
branch of my business alone had not destiny arrested me in the midst
of a prosperous career and left the business to be settled by my
administrators




chapter iii


reflections on stock-jobbing and other matters


but this was but a branch and a small one of my profession my
noblest blows were struck at the community at large and struck
in that most magnificent of gambling-fields the stock-market my
skill here--for i inherited all the sagacity and daring that had
distinguished the original owner of my body--was such as to keep me at
the head of that confraternity of which i have spoken before i was the
very devil among the fancy stocks and had the good luck to originate
and conduct a stroke of cornering by which no less than twenty young
shop-keepers who were ambitious to be seen on change and in brokers
offices and to dare that achievement of audacity selling on time
were smashed like coal-candlesticks and half as many wiser and richer
desperadoes were driven to the verge of ruin

my chief strength indeed was shown in the management of small stocks
and especially those that were good for nothing and more especially
still in southern mining-companies it was here that we of the clipping
club as the members of the fraternity delighted to call themselves
found our fairest opportunity to prey upon those passions of cupidity
and terror which lay the ignorant at the mercy of the knowing no one
knew better than myself how to get up or depress such a stock i knew
how many ignorant widows poor parsons infirm artisans and other
needy persons were to be cajoled by the prospect of handsome and
increasing dividends to invest their petty savings when it could be
done at small premiums and i knew how easily the terror of loss could
drive them out of their investments to say the truth the principal
business of myself and my brother clippers was to bob for such minnows
and it is incredible how they bite though it is only to be bitten a
few words scattered at random and still fewer uttered in confidence
were enough to send shoals of these unlucky creatures to swallow what
we thought proper to sell and a few doubts and long faces added to
the throwing away at low prices of a few dozen shares sufficed to
convert the trembling holders into sellers whenever we deemed it
advisable to buy in this way i have known a pet stock to be tossed
up and down like a ball while every ascent and downfall served the
purpose of filling the pockets of the fraternity and emptying those of
the victims

in such occupations as these passed three months of my existence
and sinner that i am i thought that they passed very honestly the
spirit of abram skinner had left such a taint of rascality in his
body that my own was thoroughly imbued with it from which i infer
that a man's body is like a barrel which if you salt fish in it
once will make fish of every thing you put into it afterward a grain
of lying or thieving or any such spicy propensity infused into the
youthful breast by a tender parent will give a scent to the spirit
for life and as this is a fact i recommend parents to take no notice
of it--not supposing parents will take advice except by contraries
the passion of abram skinner destroyed every trait that had belonged
to sheppard lee and as for those i had taken from john h higginson
and i d dawkins they were lost in like manner i was abram skinner
and nothing but abram skinner i scarce remembered that i had ever been
any thing else i am free now to confess what i was not so certain of
then though i had my doubts on the matter at times--namely that in
labouring so hard after lucre i was only striving to sell my soul to
the greatest advantage

idleness is said to be the root of all evil the root of much evil i
never doubted it was but my experience in the body of abram skinner
has convinced me that the industry to which a man is goaded by the
love of money is the root of much greater evil--of a bigger upas
indeed than ever sprung from the bed of the sluggard the idler may
betake him to the bottle as the idler usually does and then lapse
into a reprobate which is a common consequence but at the worst his
crimes are committed at the expense of individuals the man of avarice
drinks out of his purse which intoxicates quite as deeply as the
bowl makes war upon communities preys legally upon his neighbour's
pocket and just as legally consigns his neighbour's children to want
and beggary from which it appears that he is a drunkard thief and
murderer just as naturally as the idler the latter by indulging his
propensity loses his character the former by indulging his loses
all those generous sentiments and feelings the sense of honour and
instinct of integrity upon which character should be founded the man
who enriches himself by extracting wealth from the soil and the bowels
of the earth or by the practice of any art or business which supplies
the necessaries of life or ministers to the convenience of society
makes his money virtuously and deserves to enjoy it in honour but he
who gains a fortune by the mere gambling legerdemain of speculation
by turning his neighbour's pockets wrong side out is--not so much
of a christian as he supposes my honest opinion formed after much
reflection and experience is that bulls and bears are as little
likely to go to heaven as any other animals

in regard to myself i am as free to confess that my course of life
while in abram skinner's body was deserving of all reprobation i hope
that the acts i then committed may be laid to old skinner's door but
for fear of a mistake i have endeavoured to repent them as being sins
of my own committing and this course i recommend to all those good
folks who are persuaded their peccadilloes are the fault of others and
for the same reason--namely lest they should be mistaken i confess
also that i had my doubts even at the time of committing them of the
righteousness of my acts and that i sometimes had bad dreams but the
fury of avarice stilled the pangs of conscience as the fury of wrath
and battle stills those of the wounded soldier having made these
admissions i will now betake me to my story

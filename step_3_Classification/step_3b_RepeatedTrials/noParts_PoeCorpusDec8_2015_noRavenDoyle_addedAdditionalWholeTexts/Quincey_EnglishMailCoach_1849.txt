section i the glory of motion


some twenty or more years before i matriculated at oxford mr palmer
at that time mp for bath had accomplished two things very hard to
do on our little planet the earth however cheap they may be held by
eccentric people in comets he had invented mail-coaches and he had
married the daughter of a duke he was therefore just twice as great
a man as galileo who did certainly invent or which is the same thing
footnote the same thing thus in the calendar of the church
festivals the discovery of the true cross by helen the mother
of constantine is recorded and one might think with the express
consciousness of sarcasm as the invention of the cross discover
the satellites of jupiter those very next things extant to mail-coaches
in the two capital pretensions of speed and keeping time but on the
other hand who did not marry the daughter of a duke

these mail-coaches as organised by mr palmer are entitled to a
circumstantial notice from myself having had so large a share in
developing the anarchies of my subsequent dreams an agency which they
accomplished st through velocity at that time unprecedented for they
first revealed the glory of motion dly through grand effects for
the eye between lamplight and the darkness upon solitary roads dly
through animal beauty and power so often displayed in the class of
horses selected for this mail service thly through the conscious
presence of a central intellect that in the midst of vast distances
footnote vast distances one case was familiar to mail-coach
travellers where two mails in opposite directions north and south
starting at the same minute from points six hundred miles apart met
almost constantly at a particular bridge which bisected the total
distance of storms of darkness of danger overruled all obstacles
into one steady co-operation to a national result for my own feeling
this post-office service spoke as by some mighty orchestra where a
thousand instruments all disregarding each other and so far in danger
of discord yet all obedient as slaves to the supreme baton of some
great leader terminate in a perfection of harmony like that of heart
brain and lungs in a healthy animal organisation but finally that
particular element in this whole combination which most impressed
myself and through which it is that to this hour mr palmer's
mail-coach system tyrannises over my dreams by terror and terrific
beauty lay in the awful political mission which at that time it
fulfilled the mail-coach it was that distributed over the face of the
land like the opening of apocalyptic vials the heart-shaking news
of trafalgar of salamanca of vittoria of waterloo these were the
harvests that in the grandeur of their reaping redeemed the tears and
blood in which they had been sown neither was the meanest peasant
so much below the grandeur and the sorrow of the times as to confound
battles such as these which were gradually moulding the destinies of
christendom with the vulgar conflicts of ordinary warfare so often
no more than gladiatorial trials of national prowess the victories of
england in this stupendous contest rose of themselves as natural te
deums to heaven and it was felt by the thoughtful that such victories
at such a crisis of general prostration were not more beneficial to
ourselves than finally to france our enemy and to the nations of all
western or central europe through whose pusillanimity it was that the
french domination had prospered

the mail-coach as the national organ for publishing these mighty
events thus diffusively influential became itself a spiritualised and
glorified object to an impassioned heart and naturally in the oxford
of that day all hearts were impassioned as being all or nearly all
in early manhood in most universities there is one single college
in oxford there were five-and-twenty all of which were peopled by young
men the élite of their own generation not boys but men none
under eighteen in some of these many colleges the custom permitted the
student to keep what are called short terms that is the four terms
of michaelmas lent easter and act were kept by a residence in the
aggregate of ninety-one days or thirteen weeks under this interrupted
residence it was possible that a student might have a reason for going
down to his home four times in the year this made eight journeys to
and fro but as these homes lay dispersed through all the shires of the
island and most of us disdained all coaches except his majesty's mail
no city out of london could pretend to so extensive a connexion with mr
palmer's establishment as oxford three mails at the least i remember
as passing every day through oxford and benefiting by my personal
patronage viz the worcester the gloucester and the holyhead mail
naturally therefore it became a point of some interest with us whose
journeys revolved every six weeks on an average to look a little into
the executive details of the system with some of these mr palmer had
no concern they rested upon bye-laws enacted by posting-houses for
their own benefit and upon other bye-laws equally stern enacted
by the inside passengers for the illustration of their own haughty
exclusiveness these last were of a nature to rouse our scorn from
which the transition was not very long to systematic mutiny up to this
time say or the year of trafalgar it had been the fixed
assumption of the four inside people as an old tradition of all
public carriages derived from the reign of charles ii that they the
illustrious quaternion constituted a porcelain variety of the human
race whose dignity would have been compromised by exchanging one word
of civility with the three miserable delf-ware outsides even to have
kicked an outsider might have been held to attaint the foot concerned
in that operation so that perhaps it would have required an act
of parliament to restore its purity of blood what words then could
express the horror and the sense of treason in that case which had
happened where all three outsides the trinity of pariahs made a vain
attempt to sit down at the same breakfast-table or dinner-table with
the consecrated four i myself witnessed such an attempt and on that
occasion a benevolent old gentleman endeavoured to soothe his three holy
associates by suggesting that if the outsides were indicted for this
criminal attempt at the next assizes the court would regard it as a
case of lunacy or delirium tremens rather than of treason england
owes much of her grandeur to the depth of the aristocratic element in
her social composition when pulling against her strong democracy i
am not the man to laugh at it but sometimes undoubtedly it expressed
itself in comic shapes the course taken with the infatuated outsiders
in the particular attempt which i have noticed was that the waiter
beckoning them away from the privileged salle-à-manger sang out
this way my good men and then enticed these good men away to the
kitchen but that plan had not always answered sometimes though
rarely cases occurred where the intruders being stronger than usual
or more vicious than usual resolutely refused to budge and so far
carried their point as to have a separate table arranged for themselves
in a corner of the general room yet if an indian screen could be found
ample enough to plant them out from the very eyes of the high table or
dais it then became possible to assume as a fiction of law that the
three delf fellows after all were not present they could be ignored
by the porcelain men under the maxim that objects not appearing and
objects not existing are governed by the same logical construction
footnote de non apparentibus etc

such being at that time the usage of mail-coaches what was to be done
by us of young oxford we the most aristocratic of people who were
addicted to the practice of looking down superciliously even upon the
insides themselves as often very questionable characters were we
by voluntarily going outside to court indignities if our dress and
bearing sheltered us generally from the suspicion of being raff
the name at that period for snobs footnote snobs and its
antithesis nobs arose among the internal factions of shoemakers
perhaps ten years later possibly enough the terms may have existed
much earlier but they were then first made known picturesquely and
effectively by a trial at some assizes which happened to fix the public
attention we really were such constructively by the place we
assumed if we did not submit to the deep shadow of eclipse we entered
at least the skirts of its penumbra and the analogy of theatres was
valid against us where no man can complain of the annoyances incident
to the pit or gallery having his instant remedy in paying the higher
price of the boxes but the soundness of this analogy we disputed
in the case of the theatre it cannot be pretended that the inferior
situations have any separate attractions unless the pit may be supposed
to have an advantage for the purposes of the critic or the dramatic
reporter but the critic or reporter is a rarity for most people the
sole benefit is in the price now on the contrary the outside of the
mail had its own incommunicable advantages these we could not forego
the higher price we would willingly have paid but not the price
connected with the condition of riding inside which condition we
pronounced insufferable the air the freedom of prospect the proximity
to the horses the elevation of seat these were what we required
but above all the certain anticipation of purchasing occasional
opportunities of driving

such was the difficulty which pressed us and under the coercion of this
difficulty we instituted a searching inquiry into the true quality and
valuation of the different apartments about the mail we conducted
this inquiry on metaphysical principles and it was ascertained
satisfactorily that the roof of the coach which by some weak men had
been called the attics and by some the garrets was in reality the
drawing-room in which drawing-room the box was the chief ottoman or
sofa whilst it appeared that the inside which had been traditionally
regarded as the only room tenantable by gentlemen was in fact the
coal-cellar in disguise

great wits jump the very same idea had not long before struck the
celestial intellect of china amongst the presents carried out by our
first embassy to that country was a state-coach it had been specially
selected as a personal gift by george iii but the exact mode of
using it was an intense mystery to pekin the ambassador indeed lord
macartney had made some imperfect explanations upon this point but
as his excellency communicated these in a diplomatic whisper at the
very moment of his departure the celestial intellect was very feebly
illuminated and it became necessary to call a cabinet council on the
grand state question where was the emperor to sit the hammer-cloth
happened to be unusually gorgeous and partly on that consideration
but partly also because the box offered the most elevated seat was
nearest to the moon and undeniably went foremost it was resolved by
acclamation that the box was the imperial throne and for the scoundrel
who drove he might sit where he could find a perch the horses
therefore being harnessed solemnly his imperial majesty ascended his
new english throne under a flourish of trumpets having the first lord
of the treasury on his right hand and the chief jester on his left
pekin gloried in the spectacle and in the whole flowery people
constructively present by representation there was but one discontented
person and that was the coachman this mutinous individual
audaciously shouted where am i to sit but the privy council
incensed by his disloyalty unanimously opened the door and kicked him
into the inside he had all the inside places to himself but such is
the rapacity of ambition that he was still dissatisfied i say he
cried out in an extempore petition addressed to the emperor through the
window i say how am i to catch hold of the reins anyhow was the
imperial answer don't trouble me man in my glory how catch
the reins why through the windows through the keyholes anyhow
finally this contumacious coachman lengthened the check-strings into a
sort of jury-reins communicating with the horses with these he drove
as steadily as pekin had any right to expect the emperor returned after
the briefest of circuits he descended in great pomp from his throne
with the severest resolution never to remount it a public thanksgiving
was ordered for his majesty's happy escape from the disease of a broken
neck and the state-coach was dedicated thenceforward as a votive
offering to the god fo fo whom the learned more accurately called fi
fi

a revolution of this same chinese character did young oxford of that
era effect in the constitution of mail-coach society it was a perfect
french revolution and we had good reason to say ça ira in fact
it soon became too popular the public a well-known character
particularly disagreeable though slightly respectable and notorious
for affecting the chief seats in synagogues had at first loudly
opposed this revolution but when the opposition showed itself to be
ineffectual our disagreeable friend went into it with headlong zeal
at first it was a sort of race between us and as the public is usually
from thirty to fifty years old naturally we of young oxford that
averaged about twenty had the advantage then the public took to
bribing giving fees to horse-keepers c who hired out their persons
as warming-pans on the box seat that you know was shocking to all
moral sensibilities come to bribery said we and there is an end
to all morality aristotle's zeno's cicero's or anybody's and
besides of what use was it for we bribed also and as our bribes
to those of the public were as five shillings to sixpence here again
young oxford had the advantage but the contest was ruinous to
the principles of the stables connected with the mails this whole
corporation was constantly bribed rebribed and often surrebribed a
mail-coach yard was like the hustings in a contested election and a
horse-keeper ostler or helper was held by the philosophical at that
time to be the most corrupt character in the nation

there was an impression upon the public mind natural enough from the
continually augmenting velocity of the mail but quite erroneous that
an outside seat on this class of carriages was a post of danger on the
contrary i maintained that if a man had become nervous from some
gipsy prediction in his childhood allocating to a particular moon
now approaching some unknown danger and he should inquire earnestly
whither can i fly for shelter is a prison the safest retreat or a
lunatic hospital or the british museum i should have replied oh no
i'll tell you what to do take lodgings for the next forty days on the
box of his majesty's mail nobody can touch you there if it is by
bills at ninety days after date that you are made unhappy if noters and
protesters are the sort of wretches whose astrological shadows darken
the house of life then note you what i vehemently protest viz that
no matter though the sheriff and under-sheriff in every county should be
running after you with his posse touch a hair of your head he cannot
whilst you keep house and have your legal domicile on the box of the
mail it is felony to stop the mail even the sheriff cannot do that
and an extra touch of the whip to the leaders no great matter if
it grazes the sheriff at any time guarantees your safety in fact a
bedroom in a quiet house seems a safe enough retreat yet it is liable
to its own notorious nuisances to robbers by night to rats to fire
but the mail laughs at these terrors to robbers the answer is packed
up and ready for delivery in the barrel of the guard's blunderbuss rats
again there are none about mail-coaches any more than snakes in von
troil's iceland footnote von troil's iceland the allusion is
to a well-known chapter in von troil's work entitled concerning
the snakes of iceland the entire chapter consists of these six
words there art no snakes in iceland except indeed now and then
a parliamentary rat who always hides his shame in what i have shown
to be the coal-cellar and as to fire i never knew but one in a
mail-coach which was in the exeter mail and caused by an obstinate
sailor bound to devonport jack making light of the law and the
lawgiver that had set their faces against his offence insisted on
taking up a forbidden seat footnote forbidden seat the very
sternest code of rules was enforced upon the mails by the post-office
throughout england only three outsides were allowed of whom one was
to sit on the box and the other two immediately behind the box none
under any pretext to come near the guard an indispensable caution
since else under the guise of a passenger a robber might by any one
of a thousand advantages which sometimes are created but always are
favoured by the animation of frank social intercourse have disarmed
the guard beyond the scottish border the regulation was so far relaxed
as to allow of four outsides but not relaxed at all as to the mode of
placing them one as before was seated on the box and the other three
on the front of the roof with a determinate and ample separation from
the little insulated chair of the guard this relaxation was conceded
by way of compensating to scotland her disadvantages in point of
population england by the superior density of her population might
always count upon a large fund of profits in the fractional trips of
chance passengers riding for short distances of two or three stages in
scotland this chance counted for much less and therefore to make good
the deficiency scotland was allowed a compensatory profit upon one
extra passenger in the rear of the roof from which he could
exchange his own yarns with those of the guard no greater offence was
then known to mail-coaches it was treason it was læsa majestas it
was by tendency arson and the ashes of jack's pipe falling amongst the
straw of the hinder boot containing the mail-bags raised a flame
which aided by the wind of our motion threatened a revolution in
the republic of letters yet even this left the sanctity of the box
unviolated in dignified repose the coachman and myself sat on resting
with benign composure upon our knowledge that the fire would have
to burn its way through four inside passengers before it could reach
ourselves i remarked to the coachman with a quotation from virgil's
æneid really too hackneyed 

 jam proximus ardet
 ucalegon

but recollecting that the virgilian part of the coachman's education
might have been neglected i interpreted so far as to say that perhaps
at that moment the flames were catching hold of our worthy brother and
inside passenger ucalegon the coachman made no answer which is my
own way when a stranger addresses me either in syriac or in coptic
but by his faint sceptical smile he seemed to insinuate that he knew
better for that ucalegon as it happened was not in the way-bill and
therefore could not have been booked

no dignity is perfect which does not at some point ally itself with the
mysterious the connexion of the mail with the state and the executive
government a connexion obvious but yet not strictly defined gave to
the whole mail establishment an official grandeur which did us service
on the roads and invested us with seasonable terrors not the
less impressive were those terrors because their legal limits were
imperfectly ascertained look at those turnpike gates with what
deferential hurry with what an obedient start they fly open at our
approach look at that long line of carts and carters ahead audaciously
usurping the very crest of the road ah traitors they do not hear us
as yet but as soon as the dreadful blast of our horn reaches them with
proclamation of our approach see with what frenzy of trepidation they
fly to their horses heads and deprecate our wrath by the precipitation
of their crane-neck quarterings treason they feel to be their crime
each individual carter feels himself under the ban of confiscation and
attainder his blood is attainted through six generations and nothing
is wanting but the headsman and his axe the block and the sawdust to
close up the vista of his horrors what shall it be within benefit of
clergy to delay the king's message on the high road to interrupt the
great respirations ebb and flood systole and diastole of the
national intercourse to endanger the safety of tidings running day and
night between all nations and languages or can it be fancied amongst
the weakest of men that the bodies of the criminals will be given up to
their widows for christian burial now the doubts which were raised
as to our powers did more to wrap them in terror by wrapping them in
uncertainty than could have been effected by the sharpest definitions
of the law from the quarter sessions we on our parts we the
collective mail i mean did our utmost to exalt the idea of our
privileges by the insolence with which we wielded them whether this
insolence rested upon law that gave it a sanction or upon conscious
power that haughtily dispensed with that sanction equally it spoke from
a potential station and the agent in each particular insolence of the
moment was viewed reverentially as one having authority

sometimes after breakfast his majesty's mail would become frisky and
in its difficult wheelings amongst the intricacies of early markets
it would upset an apple-cart a cart loaded with eggs c huge was
the affliction and dismay awful was the smash i as far as possible
endeavoured in such a case to represent the conscience and moral
sensibilities of the mail and when wildernesses of eggs were lying
poached under our horses hoofs then would i stretch forth my hands
in sorrow saying in words too celebrated at that time from the false
echoes footnote false echoes yes false for the words ascribed
to napoleon as breathed to the memory of desaix never were uttered at
all they stand in the same category of theatrical fictions as the cry
of the foundering line-of-battle ship vengeur as the vaunt of general
cambronne at waterloo la garde meurt mais ne se rend pas or as the
repartees of talleyrand of marengo ah wherefore have we not time
to weep over you which was evidently impossible since in fact we
had not time to laugh over them tied to post-office allowance in some
cases of fifty minutes for eleven miles could the royal mail pretend to
undertake the offices of sympathy and condolence could it be expected
to provide tears for the accidents of the road if even it seemed to
trample on humanity it did so i felt in discharge of its own more
peremptory duties

upholding the morality of the mail a fortiori i upheld its rights as
a matter of duty i stretched to the uttermost its privilege of imperial
precedency and astonished weak minds by the feudal powers which i
hinted to be lurking constructively in the charters of this proud
establishment once i remember being on the box of the holyhead mail
between shrewsbury and oswestry when a tawdry thing from birmingham
some tallyho or highflyer all flaunting with green and gold came
up alongside of us what a contrast to our royal simplicity of form and
colour in this plebeian wretch the single ornament on our dark ground
of chocolate colour was the mighty shield of the imperial arms but
emblazoned in proportions as modest as a signet-ring bears to a seal
of office even this was displayed only on a single panel whispering
rather than proclaiming our relations to the mighty state whilst the
beast from birmingham our green-and-gold friend from false fleeting
perjured brummagem had as much writing and painting on its sprawling
flanks as would have puzzled a decipherer from the tombs of luxor for
some time this birmingham machine ran along by our side a piece
of familiarity that already of itself seemed to me sufficiently
jacobinical but all at once a movement of the horses announced a
desperate intention of leaving us behind do you see that i said to
the coachman i see was his short answer he was wide awake yet
he waited longer than seemed prudent for the horses of our audacious
opponent had a disagreeable air of freshness and power but his motive
was loyal his wish was that the birmingham conceit should be full-blown
before he froze it when that seemed right he unloosed or to speak
by a stronger word he sprang his known resources he slipped our
royal horses like cheetahs or hunting-leopards after the affrighted
game how they could retain such a reserve of fiery power after the work
they had accomplished seemed hard to explain but on our side besides
the physical superiority was a tower of moral strength namely the
king's name which they upon the adverse faction wanted passing them
without an effort as it seemed we threw them into the rear with so
lengthening an interval between us as proved in itself the bitterest
mockery of their presumption whilst our guard blew back a shattering
blast of triumph that was really too painfully full of derision

i mention this little incident for its connexion with what followed a
welsh rustic sitting behind me asked if i had not felt my heart burn
within me during the progress of the race i said with philosophic
calmness no because we were not racing with a mail so that no glory
could be gained in fact it was sufficiently mortifying that such a
birmingham thing should dare to challenge us the welshman replied
that he didn't see that for that a cat might look at a king and a
brummagem coach might lawfully race the holyhead mail race us if
you like i replied though even that has an air of sedition but
not beat us this would have been treason and for its own sake i
am glad that the tallyho was disappointed so dissatisfied did the
welshman seem with this opinion that at last i was obliged to tell him
a very fine story from one of our elder dramatists viz that once
in some far oriental kingdom when the sultan of all the land with his
princes ladies and chief omrahs were flying their falcons a hawk
suddenly flew at a majestic eagle and in defiance of the eagle's
natural advantages in contempt also of the eagle's traditional royalty
and before the whole assembled field of astonished spectators from agra
and lahore killed the eagle on the spot amazement seized the sultan at
the unequal contest and burning admiration for its unparalleled result
he commanded that the hawk should be brought before him he caressed the
bird with enthusiasm and he ordered that for the commemoration of his
matchless courage a diadem of gold and rubies should be solemnly
placed on the hawk's head but then that immediately after this solemn
coronation the bird should be led off to execution as the most valiant
indeed of traitors but not the less a traitor as having dared to rise
rebelliously against his liege lord and anointed sovereign the eagle
now said i to the welshman to you and me as men of refined
sensibilities how painful it would have been that this poor brummagem
brute the tallyho in the impossible case of a victory over us
should have been crowned with birmingham tinsel with paste diamonds
and roman pearls and then led off to instant execution the welshman
doubted if that could be warranted by law and when i hinted at the
th of edward longshanks chap for regulating the precedency
of coaches as being probably the statute relied on for the capital
punishment of such offences he replied drily that if the attempt to
pass a mail really were treasonable it was a pity that the tallyho
appeared to have so imperfect an acquaintance with law

the modern modes of travelling cannot compare with the old mail-coach
system in grandeur and power they boast of more velocity not
however as a consciousness but as a fact of our lifeless knowledge
resting upon alien evidence as for instance because somebody
says that we have gone fifty miles in the hour though we are far from
feeling it as a personal experience or upon the evidence of a result
as that actually we find ourselves in york four hours after leaving
london apart from such an assertion or such a result i myself am
little aware of the pace but seated on the old mail-coach we needed
no evidence out of ourselves to indicate the velocity on this system
the word was not magna loquimur as upon railways but vivimus yes
magna vivimus we do not make verbal ostentation of our grandeurs
we realise our grandeurs in act and in the very experience of life the
vital experience of the glad animal sensibilities made doubts impossible
on the question of our speed we heard our speed we saw it we felt it
as a thrilling and this speed was not the product of blind insensate
agencies that had no sympathy to give but was incarnated in the
fiery eyeballs of the noblest amongst brutes in his dilated nostril
spasmodic muscles and thunder-beating hoofs the sensibility of the
horse uttering itself in the maniac light of his eye might be the last
vibration of such a movement the glory of salamanca might be the
first but the intervening links that connected them that spread the
earthquake of battle into the eyeballs of the horse were the heart of
man and its electric thrillings kindling in the rapture of the fiery
strife and then propagating its own tumults by contagious shouts and
gestures to the heart of his servant the horse but now on the new
system of travelling iron tubes and boilers have disconnected man's
heart from the ministers of his locomotion nile nor trafalgar has power
to raise an extra bubble in a steam-kettle the galvanic cycle is
broken up for ever man's imperial nature no longer sends itself forward
through the electric sensibility of the horse the inter-agencies are
gone in the mode of communication between the horse and his master out
of which grew so many aspects of sublimity under accidents of mists that
hid or sudden blazes that revealed of mobs that agitated or midnight
solitudes that awed tidings fitted to convulse all nations must
henceforwards travel by culinary process and the trumpet that once
announced from afar the laurelled mail heart-shaking when heard
screaming on the wind and proclaiming itself through the darkness to
every village or solitary house on its route has now given way for
ever to the pot-wallopings of the boiler thus have perished multiform
openings for public expressions of interest scenical yet natural in
great national tidings for revelations of faces and groups that could
not offer themselves amongst the fluctuating mobs of a railway station
the gatherings of gazers about a laurelled mail had one centre and
acknowledged one sole interest but the crowds attending at a railway
station have as little unity as running water and own as many centres
as there are separate carriages in the train

how else for example than as a constant watcher for the dawn and for
the london mail that in summer months entered about daybreak amongst the
lawny thickets of maryborough forest couldst thou sweet fanny of the
bath road have become the glorified inmate of my dreams yet fanny as
the loveliest young woman for face and person that perhaps in my whole
life i have beheld merited the station which even now from a distance
of forty years she holds in my dreams yes though by links of natural
association she brings along with her a troop of dreadful creatures
fabulous and not fabulous that are more abominable to the heart than
fanny and the dawn are delightful

miss fanny of the bath road strictly speaking lived at a mile's
distance from that road but came so continually to meet the mail that
i on my frequent transits rarely missed her and naturally connected her
image with the great thoroughfare where only i had ever seen her why
she came so punctually i do not exactly know but i believe with some
burden of commissions to be executed in bath which had gathered to
her own residence as a central rendezvous for converging them the
mail-coachman who drove the bath mail and wore the royal livery
footnote wore the royal livery the general impression was that
the royal livery belonged of right to the mail-coachmen as their
professional dress but that was an error to the guard it did belong
i believe and was obviously essential as an official warrant and as a
means of instant identification for his person in the discharge of his
important public duties but the coachman and especially if his place
in the series did not connect him immediately with london and the
general post-office obtained the scarlet coat only as an honorary
distinction after long or if not long trying and special service
happened to be fanny's grandfather a good man he was that loved his
beautiful granddaughter and loving her wisely was vigilant over her
deportment in any case where young oxford might happen to be concerned
did my vanity then suggest that i myself individually could fall
within the line of his terrors certainly not as regarded any physical
pretensions that i could plead for fanny as a chance passenger from
her own neighbourhood once told me counted in her train a hundred and
ninety-nine professed admirers if not open aspirants to her favour and
probably not one of the whole brigade but excelled myself in personal
advantages ulysses even with the unfair advantage of his accursed bow
could hardly have undertaken that amount of suitors so the danger might
have seemed slight only that woman is universally aristocratic it is
amongst her nobilities of heart that she is so now the aristocratic
distinctions in my favour might easily with miss fanny have compensated
my physical deficiencies did i then make love to fanny why yes about
as much love as one could make whilst the mail was changing horses a
process which ten years later did not occupy above eighty seconds but
then viz about waterloo it occupied five times eighty now four
hundred seconds offer a field quite ample enough for whispering into
a young woman's ear a great deal of truth and by way of parenthesis
some trifle of falsehood grandpapa did right therefore to watch me
and yet as happens too often to the grandpapas of earth in a contest
with the admirers of granddaughters how vainly would he have watched me
had i meditated any evil whispers to fanny she it is my belief would
have protected herself against any man's evil suggestions but he as
the result showed could not have intercepted the opportunities for
such suggestions yet why not was he not active was he not blooming
blooming he was as fanny herself

say all our praises why should lords  

stop that's not the line

say all our roses why should girls engross

the coachman showed rosy blossoms on his face deeper even than his
granddaughter's his being drawn from the ale-cask fanny's from
the fountains of the dawn but in spite of his blooming face some
infirmities he had and one particularly in which he too much resembled
a crocodile this lay in a monstrous inaptitude for turning round the
crocodile i presume owes that inaptitude to the absurd length of his
back but in our grandpapa it arose rather from the absurd breadth of
his back combined possibly with some growing stiffness in his legs
now upon this crocodile infirmity of his i planted a human advantage
for tendering my homage to miss fanny in defiance of all his honourable
vigilance no sooner had he presented to us his mighty jovian back what
a field for displaying to mankind his royal scarlet whilst inspecting
professionally the buckles the straps and the silvery turrets
footnote turrets as one who loves and venerates chaucer for his
unrivalled merits of tenderness of picturesque characterisation and of
narrative skill i noticed with great pleasure that the word torrettes
is used by him to designate the little devices through which the reins
are made to pass this same word in the same exact sense i heard
uniformly used by many scores of illustrious mail-coachmen to whose
confidential friendship i had the honour of being admitted in my younger
days of his harness than i raised miss fanny's hand to my lips and
by the mixed tenderness and respectfulness of my manner caused her
easily to understand how happy it would make me to rank upon her list
as no or in which case a few casualties amongst her lovers and
observe they hanged liberally in those days might have promoted me
speedily to the top of the tree as on the other hand with how
much loyalty of submission i acquiesced by anticipation in her award
supposing that she should plant me in the very rearward of her favour
as no most truly i loved this beautiful and ingenuous girl
and had it not been for the bath mail timing all courtships by
post-office allowance heaven only knows what might have come of it
people talk of being over head and ears in love now the mail was the
cause that i sank only over ears in love which you know still left a
trifle of brain to overlook the whole conduct of the affair

ah reader when i look back upon those days it seems to me that all
things change all things perish perish the roses and the palms of
kings perish even the crowns and trophies of waterloo thunder and
lightning are not the thunder and lightning which i remember roses
are degenerating the fannies of our island though this i say with
reluctance are not visibly improving and the bath road is notoriously
superannuated crocodiles you will say are stationary mr waterton
tells me that the crocodile does not change that a cayman in fact
or an alligator is just as good for riding upon as he was in the time
of the pharaohs that may be but the reason is that the crocodile
does not live fast he is a slow coach i believe it is generally
understood among naturalists that the crocodile is a blockhead it is
my own impression that the pharaohs were also blockheads now as
the pharaohs and the crocodile domineered over egyptian society this
accounts for a singular mistake that prevailed through innumerable
generations on the nile the crocodile made the ridiculous blunder of
supposing man to be meant chiefly for his own eating man taking a
different view of the subject naturally met that mistake by another he
viewed the crocodile as a thing sometimes to worship but always to
run away from and this continued till mr waterton footnote mr
waterton had the reader lived through the last generation he would
not need to be told that some thirty or thirty-five years back
mr waterton a distinguished country gentleman of ancient family in
northumberland publicly mounted and rode in top-boots a savage old
crocodile that was restive and very impertinent but all to no purpose
the crocodile jibbed and tried to kick but vainly he was no more able
to throw the squire than sinbad was to throw the old scoundrel who used
his back without paying for it until he discovered a mode slightly
immoral perhaps though some think not of murdering the old fraudulent
jockey and so circuitously of unhorsing him changed the relations
between the animals the mode of escaping from the reptile he showed to
be not by running away but by leaping on its back booted and spurred
the two animals had misunderstood each other the use of the crocodile
has now been cleared up viz to be ridden and the final cause of
man is that he may improve the health of the crocodile by riding him
a-fox-hunting before breakfast and it is pretty certain that any
crocodile who has been regularly hunted through the season and is
master of the weight he carries will take a six-barred gate now as well
as ever he would have done in the infancy of the pyramids

if therefore the crocodile does not change all things else
undeniably do even the shadow of the pyramids grows less and often
the restoration in vision of fanny and the bath road makes me too
pathetically sensible of that truth out of the darkness if i happen
to call back the image of fanny up rises suddenly from a gulf of forty
years a rose in june or if i think for an instant of the rose in
june up rises the heavenly face of fanny one after the other like the
antiphonies in the choral service rise fanny and the rose in june then
back again the rose in june and fanny then come both together as in
a chorus roses and fannies fannies and roses without end thick
as blossoms in paradise then comes a venerable crocodile in a royal
livery of scarlet and gold with sixteen capes and the crocodile is
driving four-in-hand from the box of the bath mail and suddenly we upon
the mail are pulled up by a mighty dial sculptured with the hours that
mingle with the heavens and the heavenly host then all at once we are
arrived at marlborough forest amongst the lovely households footnote
households roe-deer do not congregate in herds like the fallow
or the red deer but by separate families parents and children which
feature of approximation to the sanctity of human hearths added to
their comparatively miniature and graceful proportions conciliates
to them an interest of peculiar tenderness supposing even that this
beautiful creature is less characteristically impressed with the
grandeurs of savage and forest life of the roe-deer the deer and
their fawns retire into the dewy thickets the thickets are rich with
roses once again the roses call up the sweet countenance of fanny and
she being the granddaughter of a crocodile awakens a dreadful host of
semi-legendary animals griffins dragons basilisks sphinxes till
at length the whole vision of fighting images crowds into one towering
armorial shield a vast emblazonry of human charities and human
loveliness that have perished but quartered heraldically with
unutterable and demoniac natures whilst over all rises as a
surmounting crest one fair female hand with the forefinger pointing
in sweet sorrowful admonition upwards to heaven where is sculptured
the eternal writing which proclaims the frailty of earth and her
children


going down with victory


but the grandest chapter of our experience within the whole mail-coach
service was on those occasions when we went down from london with the
news of victory a period of about ten years stretched from trafalgar
to waterloo the second and third years of which period and
 were comparatively sterile but the other nine from to 
inclusively furnished a long succession of victories the least of
which in such a contest of titans had an inappreciable value of
position partly for its absolute interference with the plans of our
enemy but still more from its keeping alive through central europe the
sense of a deep-seated vulnerability in france even to tease the coasts
of our enemy to mortify them by continual blockades to insult them
by capturing if it were but a baubling schooner under the eyes of their
arrogant armies repeated from time to time a sullen proclamation of
power lodged in one quarter to which the hopes of christendom turned in
secret how much more loudly must this proclamation have spoken in the
audacity footnote audacity such the french accounted it and it
has struck me that soult would not have been so popular in london at
the period of her present majesty's coronation or in manchester
on occasion of his visit to that town if they had been aware of the
insolence with which he spoke of us in notes written at intervals from
the field of waterloo as though it had been mere felony in our army
to look a french one in the face he said in more notes than one
dated from two to four pm on the field of waterloo here are the
english we have them they are caught en flagrant délit yet no man
should have known us better no man had drunk deeper from the cup of
humiliation than soult had in when ejected by us with headlong
violence from oporto and pursued through a long line of wrecks to the
frontier of spain and subsequently at albuera in the bloodiest of
recorded battles to say nothing of toulouse he should have learned our
pretensions of having bearded the élite of their troops and having
beaten them in pitched battles five years of life it was worth paying
down for the privilege of an outside place on a mail-coach when
carrying down the first tidings of any such event and it is to be noted
that from our insular situation and the multitude of our frigates
disposable for the rapid transmission of intelligence rarely did any
unauthorised rumour steal away a prelibation from the first aroma of the
regular despatches the government news was generally the earliest news

from eight pm to fifteen or twenty minutes later imagine the mails
assembled on parade in lombard street where at that time footnote
at that time i speak of the era previous to waterloo and not in
st martin's-le-grand was seated the general post-office in what exact
strength we mustered i do not remember but from the length of each
separate attelage we filled the street though a long one and
though we were drawn up in double file on any night the spectacle
was beautiful the absolute perfection of all the appointments about the
carriages and the harness their strength their brilliant cleanliness
their beautiful simplicity but more than all the royal magnificence
of the horses were what might first have fixed the attention every
carriage on every morning in the year was taken down to an official
inspector for examination wheels axles linchpins pole glasses
lamps were all critically probed and tested every part of every
carriage had been cleaned every horse had been groomed with as much
rigour as if they belonged to a private gentleman and that part of the
spectacle offered itself always but the night before us is a night
of victory and behold to the ordinary display what a heart-shaking
addition horses men carriages all are dressed in laurels and
flowers oak-leaves and ribbons the guards as being officially his
majesty's servants and of the coachmen such as are within the privilege
of the post-office wear the royal liveries of course and as it is
summer for all the land victories were naturally won in summer they
wear on this fine evening these liveries exposed to view without any
covering of upper coats such a costume and the elaborate arrangement
of the laurels in their hats dilate their hearts by giving to them
openly a personal connexion with the great news in which already they
have the general interest of patriotism that great national sentiment
surmounts and quells all sense of ordinary distinctions those
passengers who happen to be gentlemen are now hardly to be distinguished
as such except by dress for the usual reserve of their manner in
speaking to the attendants has on this night melted away one heart
one pride one glory connects every man by the transcendent bond of
his national blood the spectators who are numerous beyond precedent
express their sympathy with these fervent feelings by continual hurrahs
every moment are shouted aloud by the post-office servants and summoned
to draw up the great ancestral names of cities known to history through
a thousand years lincoln winchester portsmouth gloucester oxford
bristol manchester york newcastle edinburgh glasgow perth
stirling aberdeen expressing the grandeur of the empire by the
antiquity of its towns and the grandeur of the mail establishment by
the diffusive radiation of its separate missions every moment you hear
the thunder of lids locked down upon the mail-bags that sound to each
individual mail is the signal for drawing off which process is the
finest part of the entire spectacle then come the horses into play
horses can these be horses that bound off with the action and gestures
of leopards what stir what sea-like ferment what a thundering of
wheels what a trampling of hoofs what a sounding of trumpets what
farewell cheers what redoubling peals of brotherly congratulation
connecting the name of the particular mail liverpool for ever with
the name of the particular victory badajoz for ever or salamanca
for ever the half-slumbering consciousness that all night long and
all the next day perhaps for even a longer period many of these mails
like fire racing along a train of gunpowder will be kindling at
every instant new successions of burning joy has an obscure effect of
multiplying the victory itself by multiplying to the imagination into
infinity the stages of its progressive diffusion a fiery arrow seems
to be let loose which from that moment is destined to travel
without intermission westwards for three hundred footnote three
hundred of necessity this scale of measurement to an american if
he happens to be a thoughtless man must sound ludicrous accordingly
i remember a case in which an american writer indulges himself in the
luxury of a little fibbing by ascribing to an englishman a pompous
account of the thames constructed entirely upon american ideas of
grandeur and concluding in something like these terms and sir
arriving at london this mighty father of rivers attains a breadth of
at least two furlongs having in its winding course traversed the
astonishing distance of one hundred and seventy miles and this
the candid american thinks it fair to contrast with the scale of the
mississippi now it is hardly worth while to answer a pure fiction
gravely else one might say that no englishman out of bedlam ever
thought of looking in an island for the rivers of a continent nor
consequently could have thought of looking for the peculiar grandeur of
the thames in the length of its course or in the extent of soil which
it drains yet if he had been so absurd the american might have
recollected that a river not to be compared with the thames even as to
volume of water viz the tiber has contrived to make itself heard of
in this world for twenty-five centuries to an extent not reached as
yet by any river however corpulent of his own land the glory of
the thames is measured by the destiny of the population to which it
ministers by the commerce which it supports by the grandeur of the
empire in which though far from the largest it is the most influential
stream upon some such scale and not by a transfer of columbian
standards is the course of our english mails to be valued the american
may fancy the effect of his own valuations to our english ears by
supposing the case of a siberian glorifying his country in these
terms these wretches sir in france and england cannot march half a
mile in any direction without finding a house where food can be had and
lodging whereas such is the noble desolation of our magnificent country
that in many a direction for a thousand miles i will engage that a dog
shall not find shelter from a snow-storm nor a wren find an apology for
breakfast miles northwards for six hundred and the sympathy of our
lombard street friends at parting is exalted a hundredfold by a sort of
visionary sympathy with the yet slumbering sympathies which in so vast a
succession we are going to awake

liberated from the embarrassments of the city and issuing into the
broad uncrowded avenues of the northern suburbs we soon begin to enter
upon our natural pace of ten miles an hour in the broad light of the
summer evening the sun perhaps only just at the point of setting we
are seen from every storey of every house heads of every age crowd to
the windows young and old understand the language of our victorious
symbols and rolling volleys of sympathising cheers run along us behind
us and before us the beggar rearing himself against the wall forgets
his lameness real or assumed thinks not of his whining trade but
stands erect with bold exulting smiles as we pass him the victory has
healed him and says be thou whole women and children from garrets
alike and cellars through infinite london look down or look up with
loving eyes upon our gay ribbons and our martial laurels sometimes
kiss their hands sometimes hang out as signals of affection
pocket-handkerchiefs aprons dusters anything that by catching the
summer breezes will express an aerial jubilation on the london side of
barnet to which we draw near within a few minutes after nine observe
that private carriage which is approaching us the weather being so
warm the glasses are all down and one may read as on the stage of a
theatre everything that goes on within it contains three ladies one
likely to be mamma and two of seventeen or eighteen who are probably
her daughters what lovely animation what beautiful unpremeditated
pantomime explaining to us every syllable that passes in these
ingenuous girls by the sudden start and raising of the hands on first
discovering our laurelled equipage by the sudden movement and appeal to
the elder lady from both of them and by the heightened colour on their
animated countenances we can almost hear them saying see see look
at their laurels oh mamma there has been a great battle in spain and
it has been a great victory in a moment we are on the point of passing
them we passengers i on the box and the two on the roof behind
me raise our hats to the ladies the coachman makes his professional
salute with the whip the guard even though punctilious on the matter
of his dignity as an officer under the crown touches his hat the
ladies move to us in return with a winning graciousness of gesture
all smile on each side in a way that nobody could misunderstand and
that nothing short of a grand national sympathy could so instantaneously
prompt will these ladies say that we are nothing to them oh no they
will not say that they cannot deny they do not deny that for this
night they are our sisters gentle or simple scholar or illiterate
servant for twelve hours to come we on the outside have the honour
to be their brothers those poor women again who stop to gaze upon
us with delight at the entrance of barnet and seem by their air of
weariness to be returning from labour do you mean to say that they are
washerwomen and charwomen oh my poor friend you are quite mistaken i
assure you they stand in a far higher rank for this one night they feel
themselves by birthright to be daughters of england and answer to no
humbler title

every joy however even rapturous joy such is the sad law of
earth may carry with it grief or fear of grief to some three miles
beyond barnet we see approaching us another private carriage nearly
repeating the circumstances of the former case here also the glasses
are all down here also is an elderly lady seated but the two
daughters are missing for the single young person sitting by the lady's
side seems to be an attendant so i judge from her dress and her air
of respectful reserve the lady is in mourning and her countenance
expresses sorrow at first she does not look up so that i believe she
is not aware of our approach until she hears the measured beating of
our horses hoofs then she raises her eyes to settle them painfully on
our triumphal equipage our decorations explain the case to her at once
but she beholds them with apparent anxiety or even with terror some
time before this i finding it difficult to hit a flying mark when
embarrassed by the coachman's person and reins intervening had given
to the guard a courier evening paper containing the gazette for the
next carriage that might pass accordingly he tossed it in so folded
that the huge capitals expressing some such legend as glorious victory
might catch the eye at once to see the paper however at all
interpreted as it was by our ensigns of triumph explained everything
and if the guard were right in thinking the lady to have received it
with a gesture of horror it could not be doubtful that she had suffered
some deep personal affliction in connexion with this spanish war

here now was the case of one who having formerly suffered might
erroneously perhaps be distressing herself with anticipations of
another similar suffering that same night and hardly three hours
later occurred the reverse case a poor woman who too probably
would find herself in a day or two to have suffered the heaviest
of afflictions by the battle blindly allowed herself to express an
exultation so unmeasured in the news and its details as gave to her the
appearance which amongst celtic highlanders is called fey this was at
some little town where we changed horses an hour or two after midnight
some fair or wake had kept the people up out of their beds and had
occasioned a partial illumination of the stalls and booths presenting
an unusual but very impressive effect we saw many lights moving about
as we drew near and perhaps the most striking scene on the whole
route was our reception at this place the flashing of torches and the
beautiful radiance of blue lights technically bengal lights upon
the heads of our horses the fine effect of such a showery and ghostly
illumination falling upon our flowers and glittering laurels footnote
glittering laurels i must observe that the colour of green
suffers almost a spiritual change and exaltation under the effect of
bengal lights whilst all around ourselves that formed a centre of
light the darkness gathered on the rear and flanks in massy blackness
these optical splendours together with the prodigious enthusiasm of the
people composed a picture at once scenical and affecting theatrical
and holy as we staid for three or four minutes i alighted and
immediately from a dismantled stall in the street where no doubt she
had been presiding through the earlier part of the night advanced
eagerly a middle-aged woman the sight of my newspaper it was that had
drawn her attention upon myself the victory which we were carrying
down to the provinces on this occasion was the imperfect one of
talavera imperfect for its results such was the virtual treachery of
the spanish general cuesta but not imperfect in its ever-memorable
heroism i told her the main outline of the battle the agitation of
her enthusiasm had been so conspicuous when listening and when first
applying for information that i could not but ask her if she had not
some relative in the peninsular army oh yes her only son was there
in what regiment he was a trooper in the d dragoons my heart sank
within me as she made that answer this sublime regiment which an
englishman should never mention without raising his hat to their memory
had made the most memorable and effective charge recorded in military
annals they leaped their horses over a trench where they could
into it and with the result of death or mutilation when they could
not what proportion cleared the trench is nowhere stated those
who did closed up and went down upon the enemy with such divinity of
fervour i use the word divinity by design the inspiration of god
must have prompted this movement for those whom even then he was calling
to his presence that two results followed as regarded the enemy this
d dragoons not i believe originally three hundred and fifty strong
paralysed a french column six thousand strong then ascended the hill
and fixed the gaze of the whole french army as regarded themselves
the d were supposed at first to have been barely not annihilated but
eventually i believe about one in four survived and this then was
the regiment a regiment already for some hours glorified and hallowed
to the ear of all london as lying stretched by a large majority upon
one bloody aceldama in which the young trooper served whose mother was
now talking in a spirit of such joyous enthusiasm did i tell her the
truth had i the heart to break up her dreams no to-morrow said i
to myself to-morrow or the next day will publish the worst for one
night more wherefore should she not sleep in peace after to-morrow
the chances are too many that peace will forsake her pillow this brief
respite then let her owe to my gift and my forbearance but if i
told her not of the bloody price that had been paid not therefore was
i silent on the contributions from her son's regiment to that day's
service and glory i showed her not the funeral banners under which the
noble regiment was sleeping i lifted not the overshadowing laurels from
the bloody trench in which horse and rider lay mangled together but i
told her how these dear children of england officers and privates
had leaped their horses over all obstacles as gaily as hunters to the
morning's chase i told her how they rode their horses into the midst of
death saying to myself but not saying to her and laid down their
young lives for thee o mother england as willingly poured out their
noble blood as cheerfully as ever after a long day's sport when
infants they had rested their weary heads upon their mother's knees or
had sunk to sleep in her arms strange it is yet true that she seemed
to have no fears for her son's safety even after this knowledge
that the d dragoons had been memorably engaged but so much was she
enraptured by the knowledge that his regiment and therefore that
he had rendered conspicuous service in the dreadful conflict a
service which had actually made them within the last twelve hours
the foremost topic of conversation in london so absolutely was fear
swallowed up in joy that in the mere simplicity of her fervent nature
the poor woman threw her arms round my neck as she thought of her son
and gave to me the kiss which secretly was meant for him


section ii the vision of sudden death


what is to be taken as the predominant opinion of man reflective and
philosophic upon sudden death it is remarkable that in different
conditions of society sudden death has been variously regarded as the
consummation of an earthly career most fervently to be desired or
again as that consummation which is with most horror to be deprecated
cæsar the dictator at his last dinner-party coena on the very
evening before his assassination when the minutes of his earthly career
were numbered being asked what death in his judgment might be
pronounced the most eligible replied that which should be most
sudden on the other hand the divine litany of our english church
when breathing forth supplications as if in some representative
character for the whole human race prostrate before god places such
a death in the very van of horrors from lightning and tempest from
plague pestilence and famine from battle and murder and from sudden
death good lord deliver us sudden death is here made to crown the
climax in a grand ascent of calamities it is ranked among the last of
curses and yet by the noblest of romans it was ranked as the first of
blessings in that difference most readers will see little more than
the essential difference between christianity and paganism but this
on consideration i doubt the christian church may be right in its
estimate of sudden death and it is a natural feeling though after all
it may also be an infirm one to wish for a quiet dismissal from
life as that which seems most reconcilable with meditation with
penitential retrospects and with the humilities of farewell prayer
there does not however occur to me any direct scriptural warrant for
this earnest petition of the english litany unless under a special
construction of the word sudden it seems a petition indulged rather
and conceded to human infirmity than exacted from human piety it is not
so much a doctrine built upon the eternities of the christian system
as a plausible opinion built upon special varieties of physical
temperament let that however be as it may two remarks suggest
themselves as prudent restraints upon a doctrine which else may
wander and has wandered into an uncharitable superstition the
first is this that many people are likely to exaggerate the horror of
a sudden death from the disposition to lay a false stress upon words
or acts simply because by an accident they have become final words or
acts if a man dies for instance by some sudden death when he happens
to be intoxicated such a death is falsely regarded with peculiar
horror as though the intoxication were suddenly exalted into a
blasphemy but that is unphilosophic the man was or he was not
habitually a drunkard if not if his intoxication were a solitary
accident there can be no reason for allowing special emphasis to this
act simply because through misfortune it became his final act nor
on the other hand if it were no accident but one of his habitual
transgressions will it be the more habitual or the more a transgression
because some sudden calamity surprising him has caused this habitual
transgression to be also a final one could the man have had any reason
even dimly to foresee his own sudden death there would have been a
new feature in his act of intemperance a feature of presumption and
irreverence as in one that having known himself drawing near to the
presence of god should have suited his demeanour to an expectation
so awful but this is no part of the case supposed and the only new
element in the man's act is not any element of special immorality but
simply of special misfortune

the other remark has reference to the meaning of the word sudden
very possibly cæsar and the christian church do not differ in the way
supposed that is do not differ by any difference of doctrine as
between pagan and christian views of the moral temper appropriate
to death but perhaps they are contemplating different cases both
contemplate a violent death a biathanatos death that is biaios
or in other words death that is brought about not by internal and
spontaneous change but by active force having its origin from without
in this meaning the two authorities agree thus far they are in
harmony but the difference is that the roman by the word sudden means
unlingering whereas the christian litany by sudden death means a
death without warning consequently without any available summons to
religious preparation the poor mutineer who kneels down to gather into
his heart the bullets from twelve firelocks of his pitying comrades dies
by a most sudden death in cæsar's sense one shock one mighty spasm
one possibly not one groan and all is over but in the sense
of the litany the mutineer's death is far from sudden his offence
originally his imprisonment his trial the interval between his
sentence and its execution having all furnished him with separate
warnings of his fate having all summoned him to meet it with solemn
preparation

here at once in this sharp verbal distinction we comprehend the
faithful earnestness with which a holy christian church pleads on behalf
of her poor departing children that god would vouchsafe to them the
last great privilege and distinction possible on a death-bed viz
the opportunity of untroubled preparation for facing this mighty trial
sudden death as a mere variety in the modes of dying where death in
some shape is inevitable proposes a question of choice which equally
in the roman and the christian sense will be variously answered
according to each man's variety of temperament meantime one aspect of
sudden death there is one modification upon which no doubt can
arise that of all martyrdoms it is the most agitating viz where it
surprises a man under circumstances which offer or which seem to offer
some hurrying flying inappreciably minute chance of evading it sudden
as the danger which it affronts must be any effort by which such an
evasion can be accomplished even that even the sickening necessity
for hurrying in extremity where all hurry seems destined to be
vain even that anguish is liable to a hideous exasperation in one
particular case viz where the appeal is made not exclusively to the
instinct of self-preservation but to the conscience on behalf of some
other life besides your own accidentally thrown upon your protection
to fail to collapse in a service merely your own might seem
comparatively venial though in fact it is far from venial but to
fail in a case where providence has suddenly thrown into your hands the
final interests of another a fellow creature shuddering between the
gates of life and death this to a man of apprehensive conscience
would mingle the misery of an atrocious criminality with the misery of a
bloody calamity you are called upon by the case supposed possibly to
die but to die at the very moment when by any even partial failure or
effeminate collapse of your energies you will be self-denounced as a
murderer you had but the twinkling of an eye for your effort and that
effort might have been unavailing but to have risen to the level of
such an effort would have rescued you though not from dying yet from
dying as a traitor to your final and farewell duty

the situation here contemplated exposes a dreadful ulcer lurking far
down in the depths of human nature it is not that men generally are
summoned to face such awful trials but potentially and in shadowy
outline such a trial is moving subterraneously in perhaps all men's
natures upon the secret mirror of our dreams such a trial is darkly
projected perhaps to every one of us that dream so familiar to
childhood of meeting a lion and through languishing prostration in
hope and the energies of hope that constant sequel of lying down before
the lion publishes the secret frailty of human nature reveals its
deep-seated falsehood to itself records its abysmal treachery perhaps
not one of us escapes that dream perhaps as by some sorrowful doom of
man that dream repeats for every one of us through every generation
the original temptation in eden every one of us in this dream has a
bait offered to the infirm places of his own individual will once again
a snare is presented for tempting him into captivity to a luxury of
ruin once again as in aboriginal paradise the man falls by his
own choice again by infinite iteration the ancient earth groans
to heaven through her secret caves over the weakness of her child
nature from her seat sighing through all her works again gives
signs of woe that all is lost and again the counter-sigh is repeated
to the sorrowing heavens for the endless rebellion against god it is
not without probability that in the world of dreams every one of us
ratifies for himself the original transgression in dreams perhaps
under some secret conflict of the midnight sleeper lighted up to the
consciousness at the time but darkened to the memory as soon as all
is finished each several child of our mysterious race completes for
himself the treason of the aboriginal fall

the incident so memorable in itself by its features of horror and so
scenical by its grouping for the eye which furnished the text for this
reverie upon sudden death occurred to myself in the dead of night
as a solitary spectator when seated on the box of the manchester and
glasgow mail in the second or third summer after waterloo i find it
necessary to relate the circumstances because they are such as could
not have occurred unless under a singular combination of accidents
in those days the oblique and lateral communications with many rural
post-offices were so arranged either through necessity or through
defect of system as to make it requisite for the main north-western
mail ie the down mail on reaching manchester to halt for a
number of hours how many i do not remember six or seven i think but
the result was that in the ordinary course the mail recommenced its
journey northwards about midnight wearied with the long detention at a
gloomy hotel i walked out about eleven o'clock at night for the sake
of fresh air meaning to fall in with the mail and resume my seat at
the post-office the night however being yet dark as the moon had
scarcely risen and the streets being at that hour empty so as to offer
no opportunities for asking the road i lost my way and did not reach
the post-office until it was considerably past midnight but to my
great relief as it was important for me to be in westmoreland by the
morning i saw in the huge saucer eyes of the mail blazing through
the gloom an evidence that my chance was not yet lost past the time
it was but by some rare accident the mail was not even yet ready to
start i ascended to my seat on the box where my cloak was still lying
as it had lain at the bridgewater arms i had left it there in imitation
of a nautical discoverer who leaves a bit of bunting on the shore of
his discovery by way of warning off the ground the whole human race
and notifying to the christian and the heathen worlds with his best
compliments that he has hoisted his pocket-handkerchief once and for
ever upon that virgin soil thenceforward claiming the jus dominii to
the top of the atmosphere above it and also the right of driving shafts
to the centre of the earth below it so that all people found after this
warning either aloft in upper chambers of the atmosphere or groping
in subterraneous shafts or squatting audaciously on the surface of
the soil will be treated as trespassers kicked that is to say
or decapitated as circumstances may suggest by their very faithful
servant the owner of the said pocket-handkerchief in the present case
it is probable that my cloak might not have been respected and the
jus gentium might have been cruelly violated in my person for in
the dark people commit deeds of darkness gas being a great ally of
morality but it so happened that on this night there was no other
outside passenger and thus the crime which else was but too probable
missed fire for want of a criminal

having mounted the box i took a small quantity of laudanum having
already travelled two hundred and fifty miles viz from a point
seventy miles beyond london in the taking of laudanum there was nothing
extraordinary but by accident it drew upon me the special attention
of my assessor on the box the coachman and in that also there was
nothing extraordinary but by accident and with great delight it drew
my own attention to the fact that this coachman was a monster in point
of bulk and that he had but one eye in fact he had been foretold by
virgil as

 monstrum horrendum informe ingens cui lumen ademptum

he answered to the conditions in every one of the items  a monster
he was dreadful shapeless huge who had lost an eye but
why should that delight me had he been one of the calendars in the
arabian nights and had paid down his eye as the price of his criminal
curiosity what right had i to exult in his misfortune i did not
exult i delighted in no man's punishment though it were even merited
but these personal distinctions nos identified in an
instant an old friend of mine whom i had known in the south for some
years as the most masterly of mail-coachmen he was the man in all
europe that could if any could have driven six-in-hand full
gallop over al sirat that dreadful bridge of mahomet with no side
battlements and of extra room not enough for a razor's edge leading
right across the bottomless gulf under this eminent man whom in greek
i cognominated cyclops diphrélates cyclops the charioteer i and
others known to me studied the diphrelatic art excuse reader a word
too elegant to be pedantic as a pupil though i paid extra fees it is
to be lamented that i did not stand high in his esteem it showed his
dogged honesty though observe not his discernment that he could
not see my merits let us excuse his absurdity in this particular by
remembering his want of an eye doubtless that made him blind to my
merits in the art of conversation however he admitted that i had the
whip-hand of him on the present occasion great joy was at our meeting
but what was cyclops doing here had the medical men recommended
northern air or how i collected from such explanations as he
volunteered that he had an interest at stake in some suit-at-law now
pending at lancaster so that probably he had got himself transferred
to this station for the purpose of connecting with his professional
pursuits an instant readiness for the calls of his lawsuit

meantime what are we stopping for surely we have now waited long
enough oh this procrastinating mail and this procrastinating
post-office can't they take a lesson upon that subject from me some
people have called me procrastinating yet you are witness reader
that i was here kept waiting for the post-office will the post-office
lay its hand on its heart in its moments of sobriety and assert that
ever it waited for me what are they about the guard tells me that
there is a large extra accumulation of foreign mails this night owing
to irregularities caused by war by wind by weather in the packet
service which as yet does not benefit at all by steam for an extra
hour it seems the post-office has been engaged in threshing out the
pure wheaten correspondence of glasgow and winnowing it from the chaff
of all baser intermediate towns but at last all is finished sound your
horn guard manchester good-bye we've lost an hour by your criminal
conduct at the post-office which however though i do not mean to part
with a serviceable ground of complaint and one which really is such
for the horses to me secretly is an advantage since it compels us to
look sharply for this lost hour amongst the next eight or nine and to
recover it if we can at the rate of one mile extra per hour off we
are at last and at eleven miles an hour and for the moment i detect no
changes in the energy or in the skill of cyclops

from manchester to kendal which virtually though not in law is the
capital of westmoreland there were at this time seven stages of eleven
miles each the first five of these counting from manchester terminate
in lancaster which is therefore fifty-five miles north of manchester
and the same distance exactly from liverpool the first three stages
terminate in preston called by way of distinction from other towns
of that name proud preston at which place it is that the separate
roads from liverpool and from manchester to the north become confluent
footnote confluent suppose a capital y the pythagorean letter
lancaster is at the foot of this letter liverpool at the top of the
right branch manchester at the top of the left proud preston at
the centre where the two branches unite it is thirty-three miles
along either of the two branches it is twenty-two miles along the
stem viz from preston in the middle to lancaster at the root
there's a lesson in geography for the reader within these first three
stages lay the foundation the progress and termination of our night's
adventure during the first stage i found out that cyclops was
mortal he was liable to the shocking affection of sleep a thing which
previously i had never suspected if a man indulges in the vicious habit
of sleeping all the skill in aurigation of apollo himself with the
horses of aurora to execute his notions avails him nothing oh
cyclops i exclaimed thou art mortal my friend thou snorest
through the first eleven miles however this infirmity which i grieve
to say that he shared with the whole pagan pantheon betrayed itself
only by brief snatches on waking up he made an apology for himself
which instead of mending matters laid open a gloomy vista of coming
disasters the summer assizes he reminded me were now going on at
lancaster in consequence of which for three nights and three days he
had not lain down on a bed during the day he was waiting for his own
summons as a witness on the trial in which he was interested or else
lest he should be missing at the critical moment was drinking with the
other witnesses under the pastoral surveillance of the attorneys during
the night or that part of it which at sea would form the middle watch
he was driving this explanation certainly accounted for his drowsiness
but in a way which made it much more alarming since now after several
days resistance to this infirmity at length he was steadily giving
way throughout the second stage he grew more and more drowsy in
the second mile of the third stage he surrendered himself finally and
without a struggle to his perilous temptation all his past resistance
had but deepened the weight of this final oppression seven atmospheres
of sleep rested upon him and to consummate the case our worthy guard
after singing love amongst the roses for perhaps thirty times without
invitation and without applause had in revenge moodily resigned himself
to slumber not so deep doubtless as the coachman's but deep enough
for mischief and thus at last about ten miles from preston it came
about that i found myself left in charge of his majesty's london and
glasgow mail then running at the least twelve miles an hour

what made this negligence less criminal than else it must have been
thought was the condition of the roads at night during the assizes
at that time all the law business of populous liverpool and also of
populous manchester with its vast cincture of populous rural districts
was called up by ancient usage to the tribunal of lilliputian lancaster
to break up this old traditional usage required a conflict with
powerful established interests a large system of new arrangements
and a new parliamentary statute but as yet this change was merely in
contemplation as things were at present twice in the year footnote
twice in the year there were at that time only two assizes even
in the most populous counties viz the lent assizes and the summer
assizes so vast a body of business rolled northwards from the southern
quarter of the county that for a fortnight at least it occupied the
severe exertions of two judges in its despatch the consequence of this
was that every horse available for such a service along the whole line
of road was exhausted in carrying down the multitudes of people who
were parties to the different suits by sunset therefore it usually
happened that through utter exhaustion amongst men and horses the road
sank into profound silence except the exhaustion in the vast adjacent
county of york from a contested election no such silence succeeding to
no such fiery uproar was ever witnessed in england

on this occasion the usual silence and solitude prevailed along the
road not a hoof nor a wheel was to be heard and to strengthen this
false luxurious confidence in the noiseless roads it happened also
that the night was one of peculiar solemnity and peace for my own
part though slightly alive to the possibilities of peril i had so far
yielded to the influence of the mighty calm as to sink into a profound
reverie the month was august in the middle of which lay my own
birthday a festival to every thoughtful man suggesting solemn and often
sigh-born footnote sigh-born i owe the suggestion of this
word to an obscure remembrance of a beautiful phrase in giraldus
cambrensis viz suspiriosæ cogitationes thoughts the county was
my own native county upon which in its southern section more than
upon any equal area known to man past or present had descended the
original curse of labour in its heaviest form not mastering the bodies
only of men as of slaves or criminals in mines but working through
the fiery will upon no equal space of earth was or ever had been the
same energy of human power put forth daily at this particular season
also of the assizes that dreadful hurricane of flight and pursuit as
it might have seemed to a stranger which swept to and from lancaster
all day long hunting the county up and down and regularly subsiding
back into silence about sunset could not fail when united with this
permanent distinction of lancashire as the very metropolis and citadel
of labour to point the thoughts pathetically upon that counter-vision
of rest of saintly repose from strife and sorrow towards which as
to their secret haven the profounder aspirations of man's heart are in
solitude continually travelling obliquely upon our left we were nearing
the sea which also must under the present circumstances be repeating
the general state of halcyon repose the sea the atmosphere the light
bore each an orchestral part in this universal lull moonlight and the
first timid tremblings of the dawn were by this time blending and the
blendings were brought into a still more exquisite state of unity by a
slight silvery mist motionless and dreamy that covered the woods and
fields but with a veil of equable transparency except the feet of
our own horses which running on a sandy margin of the road made but
little disturbance there was no sound abroad in the clouds and on the
earth prevailed the same majestic peace and in spite of all that
the villain of a schoolmaster has done for the ruin of our sublimer
thoughts which are the thoughts of our infancy we still believe in no
such nonsense as a limited atmosphere whatever we may swear with our
false feigning lips in our faithful hearts we still believe and must
for ever believe in fields of air traversing the total gulf between
earth and the central heavens still in the confidence of children that
tread without fear every chamber in their father's house and to whom no
door is closed we in that sabbatic vision which sometimes is revealed
for an hour upon nights like this ascend with easy steps from the
sorrow-stricken fields of earth upwards to the sandals of god

suddenly from thoughts like these i was awakened to a sullen sound as
of some motion on the distant road it stole upon the air for a moment
i listened in awe but then it died away once roused however i could
not but observe with alarm the quickened motion of our horses ten
years experience had made my eye learned in the valuing of motion and
i saw that we were now running thirteen miles an hour i pretend to no
presence of mind on the contrary my fear is that i am miserably and
shamefully deficient in that quality as regards action the palsy of
doubt and distraction hangs like some guilty weight of dark unfathomed
remembrances upon my energies when the signal is flying for action
but on the other hand this accursed gift i have as regards thought
that in the first step towards the possibility of a misfortune i see its
total evolution in the radix of the series i see too certainly and too
instantly its entire expansion in the first syllable of the dreadful
sentence i read already the last it was not that i feared for
ourselves us our bulk and impetus charmed against peril in any
collision and i had ridden through too many hundreds of perils that
were frightful to approach that were matter of laughter to look back
upon the first face of which was horror the parting face a jest for
any anxiety to rest upon our interests the mail was not built i
felt assured nor bespoke that could betray me who trusted to its
protection but any carriage that we could meet would be frail and light
in comparison of ourselves and i remarked this ominous accident of our
situation we were on the wrong side of the road but then it may be
said the other party if other there was might also be on the wrong
side and two wrongs might make a right that was not likely the same
motive which had drawn us to the right-hand side of the road viz
the luxury of the soft beaten sand as contrasted with the paved
centre would prove attractive to others the two adverse carriages
would therefore to a certainty be travelling on the same side and
from this side as not being ours in law the crossing over to the other
would of course be looked for from us footnote it is true that
according to the law of the case as established by legal precedents
all carriages were required to give way before royal equipages and
therefore before the mail as one of them but this only increased
the danger as being a regulation very imperfectly made known very
unequally enforced and therefore often embarrassing the movements on
both sides our lamps still lighted would give the impression of
vigilance on our part and every creature that met us would rely upon
us for quartering footnote quartering this is the technical
word and i presume derived from the french cartayer to evade a
rut or any obstacle all this and if the separate links of the
anticipation had been a thousand times more i saw not discursively
or by effort or by succession but by one flash of horrid simultaneous
intuition

under this steady though rapid anticipation of the evil which might be
gathering ahead ah what a sullen mystery of fear what a sigh of woe
was that which stole upon the air as again the far-off sound of a
wheel was heard a whisper it was a whisper from perhaps four miles
off secretly announcing a ruin that being foreseen was not the less
inevitable that being known was not therefore healed what could be
done who was it that could do it to check the storm-flight of these
maniacal horses could i not seize the reins from the grasp of the
slumbering coachman you reader think that it would have been in
your power to do so and i quarrel not with your estimate of yourself
but from the way in which the coachman's hand was viced between his
upper and lower thigh this was impossible easy was it see then
that bronze equestrian statue the cruel rider has kept the bit in
his horse's mouth for two centuries unbridle him for a minute if you
please and wash his mouth with water easy was it unhorse me then
that imperial rider knock me those marble feet from those marble
stirrups of charlemagne

the sounds ahead strengthened and were now too clearly the sounds of
wheels who and what could it be was it industry in a taxed cart was
it youthful gaiety in a gig was it sorrow that loitered or joy that
raced for as yet the snatches of sound were too intermitting from
distance to decipher the character of the motion whoever were the
travellers something must be done to warn them upon the other party
rests the active responsibility but upon us and woe is me
that us was reduced to my frail opium-shattered self rests the
responsibility of warning yet how should this be accomplished might i
not sound the guard's horn already on the first thought i was making
my way over the roof of the guard's seat but this from the accident
which i have mentioned of the foreign mails being piled upon the roof
was a difficult and even dangerous attempt to one cramped by nearly
three hundred miles of outside travelling and fortunately before i
had lost much time in the attempt our frantic horses swept round
an angle of the road which opened upon us that final stage where the
collision must be accomplished and the catastrophe sealed all was
apparently finished the court was sitting the case was heard the
judge had finished and only the verdict was yet in arrear

before us lay an avenue straight as an arrow six hundred yards
perhaps in length and the umbrageous trees which rose in a regular
line from either side meeting high overhead gave to it the character
of a cathedral aisle these trees lent a deeper solemnity to the early
light but there was still light enough to perceive at the further end
of this gothic aisle a frail reedy gig in which were seated a young
man and by his side a young lady ah young sir what are you about
if it is requisite that you should whisper your communications to this
young lady though really i see nobody at an hour and on a road so
solitary likely to overhear you is it therefore requisite that you
should carry your lips forward to hers the little carriage is creeping
on at one mile an hour and the parties within it being thus tenderly
engaged are naturally bending down their heads between them and
eternity to all human calculation there is but a minute and a half oh
heavens what is it that i shall do speaking or acting what help can
i offer strange it is and to a mere auditor of the tale might seem
laughable that i should need a suggestion from the iliad to prompt
the sole resource that remained yet so it was suddenly i remembered
the shout of achilles and its effect but could i pretend to shout like
the son of peleus aided by pallas no but then i needed not the shout
that should alarm all asia militant such a shout would suffice as might
carry terror into the hearts of two thoughtless young people and one
gig-horse i shouted and the young man heard me not a second time i
shouted and now he heard me for now he raised his head

here then all had been done that by me could be done more on my
part was not possible mine had been the first step the second was for
the young man the third was for god if said i this stranger is a
brave man and if indeed he loves the young girl at his side or loving
her not if he feels the obligation pressing upon every man worthy
to be called a man of doing his utmost for a woman confided to his
protection he will at least make some effort to save her if that
fails he will not perish the more or by a death more cruel for having
made it and he will die as a brave man should with his face to the
danger and with his arm about the woman that he sought in vain to
save but if he makes no effort shrinking without a struggle from his
duty he himself will not the less certainly perish for this baseness
of poltroonery he will die no less and why not wherefore should we
grieve that there is one craven less in the world no let him perish
without a pitying thought of ours wasted upon him and in that case
all our grief will be reserved for the fate of the helpless girl who
now upon the least shadow of failure in him must by the fiercest
of translations must without time for a prayer must within seventy
seconds stand before the judgment-seat of god

but craven he was not sudden had been the call upon him and sudden was
his answer to the call he saw he heard he comprehended the ruin
that was coming down already its gloomy shadow darkened above him and
already he was measuring his strength to deal with it ah what a vulgar
thing does courage seem when we see nations buying it and selling it for
a shilling a-day ah what a sublime thing does courage seem when some
fearful summons on the great deeps of life carries a man as if running
before a hurricane up to the giddy crest of some tumultuous crisis from
which lie two courses and a voice says to him audibly one way lies
hope take the other and mourn for ever how grand a triumph if even
then amidst the raving of all around him and the frenzy of the danger
the man is able to confront his situation is able to retire for a
moment into solitude with god and to seek his counsel from him

for seven seconds it might be of his seventy the stranger settled his
countenance steadfastly upon us as if to search and value every element
in the conflict before him for five seconds more of his seventy he sat
immovably like one that mused on some great purpose for five more
perhaps he sat with eyes upraised like one that prayed in sorrow
under some extremity of doubt for light that should guide him to the
better choice then suddenly he rose stood upright and by a powerful
strain upon the reins raising his horse's fore-feet from the ground
he slewed him round on the pivot of his hind-legs so as to plant the
little equipage in a position nearly at right angles to ours thus far
his condition was not improved except as a first step had been taken
towards the possibility of a second if no more were done nothing was
done for the little carriage still occupied the very centre of our
path though in an altered direction yet even now it may not be too
late fifteen of the seventy seconds may still be unexhausted and one
almighty bound may avail to clear the ground hurry then hurry for
the flying moments they hurry oh hurry hurry my brave young
man for the cruel hoofs of our horses they also hurry fast are the
flying moments faster are the hoofs of our horses but fear not for
him if human energy can suffice faithful was he that drove to his
terrific duty faithful was the horse to his command one blow one
impulse given with voice and hand by the stranger one rush from the
horse one bound as if in the act of rising to a fence landed the
docile creature's forefeet upon the crown or arching centre of the
road the larger half of the little equipage had then cleared our
over-towering shadow that was evident even to my own agitated sight
but it mattered little that one wreck should float off in safety if upon
the wreck that perished were embarked the human freightage the rear
part of the carriage was that certainly beyond the line of absolute
ruin what power could answer the question glance of eye thought of
man wing of angel which of these had speed enough to sweep between the
question and the answer and divide the one from the other light
does not tread upon the steps of light more indivisibly than did our
all-conquering arrival upon the escaping efforts of the gig that must
the young man have felt too plainly his back was now turned to us not
by sight could he any longer communicate with the peril but by the
dreadful rattle of our harness too truly had his ear been instructed
that all was finished as regarded any effort of his already in
resignation he had rested from his struggle and perhaps in his heart he
was whispering father which art in heaven do thou finish above what
i on earth have attempted faster than ever mill-race we ran past
them in our inexorable flight oh raving of hurricanes that must have
sounded in their young ears at the moment of our transit even in
that moment the thunder of collision spoke aloud either with the
swingle-bar or with the haunch of our near leader we had struck the
off-wheel of the little gig which stood rather obliquely and not quite
so far advanced as to be accurately parallel with the near-wheel the
blow from the fury of our passage resounded terrifically i rose in
horror to gaze upon the ruins we might have caused from my elevated
station i looked down and looked back upon the scene which in a moment
told its own tale and wrote all its records on my heart for ever

here was the map of the passion that now had finished the horse was
planted immovably with his fore-feet upon the paved crest of the
central road he of the whole party might be supposed untouched by the
passion of death the little cany carriage partly perhaps from the
violent torsion of the wheels in its recent movement partly from the
thundering blow we had given to it as if it sympathised with human
horror was all alive with tremblings and shiverings the young man
trembled not nor shivered he sat like a rock but his was the
steadiness of agitation frozen into rest by horror as yet he dared not
to look round for he knew that if anything remained to do by him it
could no longer be done and as yet he knew not for certain if their
safety were accomplished but the lady 

but the lady  oh heavens will that spectacle ever depart from my
dreams as she rose and sank upon her seat sank and rose threw up her
arms wildly to heaven clutched at some visionary object in the air
fainting praying raving despairing figure to yourself reader
the elements of the case suffer me to recall before your mind the
circumstances of that unparalleled situation from the silence and deep
peace of this saintly summer night from the pathetic blending of this
sweet moonlight dawnlight dreamlight from the manly tenderness of
this flattering whispering murmuring love suddenly as from the
woods and fields suddenly as from the chambers of the air opening in
revelation suddenly as from the ground yawning at her feet leaped upon
her with the flashing of cataracts death the crowned phantom with all
the equipage of his terrors and the tiger roar of his voice

the moments were numbered the strife was finished the vision was
closed in the twinkling of an eye our flying horses had carried us to
the termination of the umbrageous aisle at the right angles we wheeled
into our former direction the turn of the road carried the scene out of
my eyes in an instant and swept it into my dreams for ever


section iii dream-fugue

founded on the preceding theme of sudden death

 whence the sound
 of instruments that made melodious chime
 was heard of harp and organ and who moved
 their stops and chords was seen his volant touch
 instinct through all proportions low and high
 fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue

tumultuosissimamente


passion of sudden death that once in youth i read and interpreted by
the shadows of thy averted signs footnote averted signs i read
the course and changes of the lady's agony in the succession of her
involuntary gestures but it must be remembered that i read all this
from the rear never once catching the lady's full face and even her
profile imperfectly rapture of panic taking the shape which
amongst tombs in churches i have seen of woman bursting her sepulchral
bonds of woman's ionic form bending forward from the ruins of her
grave with arching foot with eyes upraised with clasped adoring
hands waiting watching trembling praying for the trumpet's call to
rise from dust for ever ah vision too fearful of shuddering humanity
on the brink of almighty abysses vision that didst start back that
didst reel away like a shrivelling scroll from before the wrath of fire
racing on the wings of the wind epilepsy so brief of horror wherefore
is it that thou canst not die passing so suddenly into darkness
wherefore is it that still thou sheddest thy sad funeral blights upon
the gorgeous mosaics of dreams fragment of music too passionate heard
once and heard no more what aileth thee that thy deep rolling chords
come up at intervals through all the worlds of sleep and after forty
years have lost no element of horror

lo it is summer almighty summer the everlasting gates of life and
summer are thrown open wide and on the ocean tranquil and verdant as
a savannah the unknown lady from the dreadful vision and i myself are
floating she upon a fairy pinnace and i upon an english three-decker
both of us are wooing gales of festal happiness within the domain of
our common country within that ancient watery park within the pathless
chase of ocean where england takes her pleasure as a huntress through
winter and summer from the rising to the setting sun ah what a
wilderness of floral beauty was hidden or was suddenly revealed upon
the tropic islands through which the pinnace moved and upon her deck
what a bevy of human flowers young women how lovely young men how
noble that were dancing together and slowly drifting towards us
amidst music and incense amidst blossoms from forests and gorgeous
corymbi from vintages amidst natural carolling and the echoes of sweet
girlish laughter slowly the pinnace nears us gaily she hails us and
silently she disappears beneath the shadow of our mighty bows but then
as at some signal from heaven the music and the carols and the sweet
echoing of girlish laughter all are hushed what evil has smitten the
pinnace meeting or overtaking her did ruin to our friends couch within
our own dreadful shadow was our shadow the shadow of death i looked
over the bow for an answer and behold the pinnace was dismantled the
revel and the revellers were found no more the glory of the vintage was
dust and the forests with their beauty were left without a witness upon
the seas but where and i turned to our crew where are the lovely
women that danced beneath the awning of flowers and clustering corymbi
whither have fled the noble young men that danced with them answer
there was none but suddenly the man at the mast-head whose countenance
darkened with alarm cried out sail on the weather beam down she
comes upon us in seventy seconds she also will founder

i looked to the weather side and the summer had departed the sea was
rocking and shaken with gathering wrath upon its surface sat mighty
mists which grouped themselves into arches and long cathedral aisles
down one of these with the fiery pace of a quarrel from a cross-bow
ran a frigate right athwart our course are they mad some voice
exclaimed from our deck do they woo their ruin but in a moment as
she was close upon us some impulse of a heady current or local vortex
gave a wheeling bias to her course and off she forged without a shock
as she ran past us high aloft amongst the shrouds stood the lady of
the pinnace the deeps opened ahead in malice to receive her towering
surges of foam ran after her the billows were fierce to catch her but
far away she was borne into desert spaces of the sea whilst still by
sight i followed her as she ran before the howling gale chased by
angry sea-birds and by maddening billows still i saw her as at the
moment when she ran past us standing amongst the shrouds with her
white draperies streaming before the wind there she stood with hair
dishevelled one hand clutched amongst the tackling rising sinking
fluttering trembling praying there for leagues i saw her as she
stood raising at intervals one hand to heaven amidst the fiery crests
of the pursuing waves and the raving of the storm until at last upon
a sound from afar of malicious laughter and mockery all was hidden for
ever in driving showers and afterwards but when i knew not nor how

sweet funeral bells from some incalculable distance wailing over the
dead that die before the dawn awakened me as i slept in a boat moored
to some familiar shore the morning twilight even then was breaking
and by the dusky revelations which it spread i saw a girl adorned
with a garland of white roses about her head for some great festival
running along the solitary strand in extremity of haste her running
was the running of panic and often she looked back as to some dreadful
enemy in the rear but when i leaped ashore and followed on her steps
to warn her of a peril in front alas from me she fled as from another
peril and vainly i shouted to her of quicksands that lay ahead faster
and faster she ran round a promontory of rocks she wheeled out of
sight in an instant i also wheeled round it but only to see the
treacherous sands gathering above her head already her person was
buried only the fair young head and the diadem of white roses around it
were still visible to the pitying heavens and last of all was visible
one white marble arm i saw by the early twilight this fair young head
as it was sinking down to darkness saw this marble arm as it rose
above her head and her treacherous grave tossing faltering rising
clutching as at some false deceiving hand stretched out from the
clouds saw this marble arm uttering her dying hope and then uttering
her dying despair the head the diadem the arm these all had sunk at
last over these also the cruel quicksand had closed and no memorial of
the fair young girl remained on earth except my own solitary tears and
the funeral bells from the desert seas that rising again more softly
sang a requiem over the grave of the buried child and over her blighted
dawn

i sat and wept in secret the tears that men have ever given to the
memory of those that died before the dawn and by the treachery of
earth our mother but suddenly the tears and funeral bells were hushed
by a shout as of many nations and by a roar as from some great king's
artillery advancing rapidly along the valleys and heard afar by echoes
from the mountains hush i said as i bent my ear earthwards to
listen hush this either is the very anarchy of strife or else and
then i listened more profoundly and whispered as i raised my head or
else oh heavens it is victory that is final victory that swallows
up all strife

immediately in trance i was carried over land and sea to some distant
kingdom and placed upon a triumphal car amongst companions crowned
with laurel the darkness of gathering midnight brooding over all the
land hid from us the mighty crowds that were weaving restlessly about
ourselves as a centre we heard them but saw them not tidings had
arrived within an hour of a grandeur that measured itself against
centuries too full of pathos they were too full of joy to utter
themselves by other language than by tears by restless anthems and
te deums reverberated from the choirs and orchestras of earth these
tidings we that sat upon the laurelled car had it for our privilege to
publish amongst all nations and already by signs audible through the
darkness by snortings and tramplings our angry horses that knew no
fear or fleshly weariness upbraided us with delay wherefore was it
that we delayed we waited for a secret word that should bear witness
to the hope of nations as now accomplished for ever at midnight
the secret word arrived which word was waterloo and recovered
christendom the dreadful word shone by its own light before us it
went high above our leaders heads it rode and spread a golden light
over the paths which we traversed every city at the presence of the
secret word threw open its gates the rivers were conscious as we
crossed all the forests as we ran along their margins shivered in
homage to the secret word and the darkness comprehended it

two hours after midnight we approached a mighty minster its gates
which rose to the clouds were closed but when the dreadful word that
rode before us reached them with its golden light silently they moved
back upon their hinges and at a flying gallop our equipage entered the
grand aisle of the cathedral headlong was our pace and at every altar
in the little chapels and oratories to the right hand and left of our
course the lamps dying or sickening kindled anew in sympathy with the
secret word that was flying past forty leagues we might have run in the
cathedral and as yet no strength of morning light had reached us when
before us we saw the aerial galleries of organ and choir every pinnacle
of fretwork every station of advantage amongst the traceries was
crested by white-robed choristers that sang deliverance that wept no
more tears as once their fathers had wept but at intervals that sang
together to the generations saying

 chant the deliverer's praise in every tongue

and receiving answers from afar

 such as once in heaven and earth were sung

and of their chanting was no end of our headlong pace was neither pause
nor slackening

thus as we ran like torrents thus as we swept with bridal rapture over
the campo santo footnote campo santo it is probable that most
of my readers will be acquainted with the history of the campo santo or
cemetery at pisa composed of earth brought from jerusalem from a bed
of sanctity as the highest prize which the noble piety of crusaders
could ask or imagine to readers who are unacquainted with england or
who being english are yet unacquainted with the cathedral cities of
england it may be right to mention that the graves within-side the
cathedrals often form a flat pavement over which carriages and horses
might run and perhaps a boyish remembrance of one particular
cathedral across which i had seen passengers walk and burdens carried
as about two centuries back they were through the middle of st
paul's in london may have assisted my dream of the cathedral
graves suddenly we became aware of a vast necropolis rising upon
the far-off horizon a city of sepulchres built within the saintly
cathedral for the warrior dead that rested from their feuds on earth of
purple granite was the necropolis yet in the first minute it lay
like a purple stain upon the horizon so mighty was the distance in the
second minute it trembled through many changes growing into terraces
and towers of wondrous altitude so mighty was the pace in the third
minute already with our dreadful gallop we were entering its suburbs
vast sarcophagi rose on every side having towers and turrets that upon
the limits of the central aisle strode forward with haughty intrusion
that ran back with mighty shadows into answering recesses every
sarcophagus showed many bas-reliefs bas-reliefs of battles and of
battle-fields battles from forgotten ages battles from yesterday
battle-fields that long since nature had healed and reconciled to
herself with the sweet oblivion of flowers battle-fields that were yet
angry and crimson with carnage where the terraces ran there did we
run where the towers curved there did we curve with the flight
of swallows our horses swept round every angle like rivers in flood
wheeling round headlands like hurricanes that ride into the secrets of
forests faster than ever light unwove the mazes of darkness our flying
equipage carried earthly passions kindled warrior instincts amongst
the dust that lay around us dust oftentimes of our noble fathers that
had slept in god from crécy to trafalgar and now had we reached the
last sarcophagus now were we abreast of the last bas-relief already
had we recovered the arrow-like flight of the illimitable central aisle
when coming up this aisle to meet us we beheld afar off a female child
that rode in a carriage as frail as flowers the mists which went before
her hid the fawns that drew her but could not hide the shells and
tropic flowers with which she played but could not hide the lovely
smiles by which she uttered her trust in the mighty cathedral and in
the cherubim that looked down upon her from the mighty shafts of its
pillars face to face she was meeting us face to face she rode as
if danger there were none oh baby i exclaimed shalt thou be the
ransom for waterloo must we that carry tidings of great joy to every
people be messengers of ruin to thee in horror i rose at the thought
but then also in horror at the thought rose one that was sculptured
on a bas-relief a dying trumpeter solemnly from the field of battle he
rose to his feet and unslinging his stony trumpet carried it in his
dying anguish to his stony lips sounding once and yet once again
proclamation that in thy ears oh baby spoke from the battlements of
death immediately deep shadows fell between us and aboriginal silence
the choir had ceased to sing the hoofs of our horses the dreadful
rattle of our harness the groaning of our wheels alarmed the graves
no more by horror the bas-relief had been unlocked unto life by horror
we that were so full of life we men and our horses with their fiery
fore-legs rising in mid air to their everlasting gallop were frozen
to a bas-relief then a third time the trumpet sounded the seals were
taken off all pulses life and the frenzy of life tore into their
channels again again the choir burst forth in sunny grandeur as from
the muffling of storms and darkness again the thunderings of our horses
carried temptation into the graves one cry burst from our lips as the
clouds drawing off from the aisle showed it empty before us whither
has the infant fled is the young child caught up to god lo afar
off in a vast recess rose three mighty windows to the clouds and on a
level with their summits at height insuperable to man rose an altar of
purest alabaster on its eastern face was trembling a crimson glory
a glory was it from the reddening dawn that now streamed through the
windows was it from the crimson robes of the martyrs painted on the
windows was it from the bloody bas-reliefs of earth there suddenly
within that crimson radiance rose the apparition of a woman's head and
then of a woman's figure the child it was grown up to woman's height
clinging to the horns of the altar voiceless she stood sinking
rising raving despairing and behind the volume of incense that night
and day streamed upwards from the altar dimly was seen the fiery font
and the shadow of that dreadful being who should have baptized her with
the baptism of death but by her side was kneeling her better angel
that hid his face with wings that wept and pleaded for her that
prayed when she could not that fought with heaven by tears for
her deliverance which also as he raised his immortal countenance
from his wings i saw by the glory in his eye that from heaven he had
won at last


v


then was completed the passion of the mighty fugue the golden tubes of
the organ which as yet had but muttered at intervals gleaming amongst
clouds and surges of incense threw up as from fountains unfathomable
columns of heart-shattering music choir and anti-choir were filling
fast with unknown voices thou also dying trumpeter with thy love
that was victorious and thy anguish that was finishing didst enter
the tumult trumpet and echo farewell love and farewell anguish rang
through the dreadful sanctus oh darkness of the grave that from the
crimson altar and from the fiery font wert visited and searched by the
effulgence in the angel's eye were these indeed thy children pomps of
life that from the burials of centuries rose again to the voice of
perfect joy did ye indeed mingle with the festivals of death lo as i
looked back for seventy leagues through the mighty cathedral i saw the
quick and the dead that sang together to god together that sang to the
generations of man all the hosts of jubilation like armies that ride
in pursuit moved with one step us that with laurelled heads were
passing from the cathedral they overtook and as with a garment they
wrapped us round with thunders greater than our own as brothers we
moved together to the dawn that advanced to the stars that fled
rendering thanks to god in the highest that having hid his face
through one generation behind thick clouds of war once again was
ascending from the campo santo of waterloo was ascending in the
visions of peace rendering thanks for thee young girl whom having
overshadowed with his ineffable passion of death suddenly did god
relent suffered thy angel to turn aside his arm and even in thee
sister unknown shown to me for a moment only to be hidden for ever
found an occasion to glorify his goodness a thousand times amongst
the phantoms of sleep have i seen thee entering the gates of the golden
dawn with the secret word riding before thee with the armies of the
grave behind thee seen thee sinking rising raving despairing a
thousand times in the worlds of sleep have i seen thee followed by
god's angel through storms through desert seas through the darkness
of quicksands through dreams and the dreadful revelations that are in
dreams only that at the last with one sling of his victorious arm he
might snatch thee back from ruin and might emblazon in thy deliverance
the endless resurrections of his love




joan of arc


footnote arc modern france that should know a great
deal better than myself insists that the name is not d'arc ie
of arc but darc now it happens sometimes that if a person whose
position guarantees his access to the best information will content
himself with gloomy dogmatism striking the table with his fist and
saying in a terrific voice it is so and there's an end of it one
bows deferentially and submits but if unhappily for himself won
by this docility he relents too amiably into reasons and arguments
probably one raises an insurrection against him that may never be
crushed for in the fields of logic one can skirmish perhaps as well
as he had he confined himself to dogmatism he would have intrenched
his position in darkness and have hidden his own vulnerable points
but coming down to base reasons he lets in light and one sees where
to plant the blows now the worshipful reason of modern france for
disturbing the old received spelling is that jean hordal a descendant
of la pucelle's brother spelled the name darc in but what of
that it is notorious that what small matter of spelling providence had
thought fit to disburse amongst man in the seventeenth century was all
monopolised by printers now m hordal was not a printer


what is to be thought of her what is to be thought of the poor
shepherd girl from the hills and forests of lorraine that like the
hebrew shepherd boy from the hills and forests of judea rose suddenly
out of the quiet out of the safety out of the religious inspiration
rooted in deep pastoral solitudes to a station in the van of armies
and to the more perilous station at the right hand of kings the hebrew
boy inaugurated his patriotic mission by an act by a victorious
act such as no man could deny but so did the girl of lorraine if
we read her story as it was read by those who saw her nearest adverse
armies bore witness to the boy as no pretender but so they did to the
gentle girl judged by the voices of all who saw them from a station of
good will both were found true and loyal to any promises involved in
their first acts enemies it was that made the difference between
their subsequent fortunes the boy rose to a splendour and a noonday
prosperity both personal and public that rang through the records
of his people and became a byword among his posterity for a thousand
years until the sceptre was departing from judah the poor forsaken
girl on the contrary drank not herself from that cup of rest which she
had secured for france she never sang together with the songs that rose
in her native domrémy as echoes to the departing steps of invaders
she mingled not in the festal dances at vaucouleurs which celebrated in
rapture the redemption of france no for her voice was then silent no
for her feet were dust pure innocent noble-hearted girl whom from
earliest youth ever i believed in as full of truth and self-sacrifice
this was amongst the strongest pledges for thy truth that never
once no not for a moment of weakness didst thou revel in the vision
of coronets and honour from man coronets for thee oh no honours
if they come when all is over are for those that share thy blood
footnote those that share thy blood a collateral relative of
joanna's was subsequently ennobled by the title of du lys daughter
of domrémy when the gratitude of thy king shall awaken thou wilt be
sleeping the sleep of the dead call her king of france but she will
not hear thee cite her by the apparitors to come and receive a robe
of honour but she will be found en contumace when the thunders of
universal france as even yet may happen shall proclaim the grandeur of
the poor shepherd girl that gave up all for her country thy ear young
shepherd girl will have been deaf for five centuries to suffer and to
do that was thy portion in this life that was thy destiny and not for
a moment was it hidden from thyself life thou saidst is short
and the sleep which is in the grave is long let me use that life so
transitory for the glory of those heavenly dreams destined to comfort
the sleep which is so long this pure creature pure from every
suspicion of even a visionary self-interest even as she was pure
in senses more obvious never once did this holy child as regarded
herself relax from her belief in the darkness that was travelling to
meet her she might not prefigure the very manner of her death she saw
not in vision perhaps the aerial altitude of the fiery scaffold
the spectators without end on every road pouring into rouen as to a
coronation the surging smoke the volleying flames the hostile faces
all around the pitying eye that lurked but here and there until nature
and imperishable truth broke loose from artificial restraints these
might not be apparent through the mists of the hurrying future but the
voice that called her to death that she heard for ever

great was the throne of france even in those days and great was he that
sat upon it but well joanna knew that not the throne nor he that sat
upon it was for her but on the contrary that she was for them
not she by them but they by her should rise from the dust gorgeous
were the lilies of france and for centuries had the privilege to spread
their beauty over land and sea until in another century the wrath
of god and man combined to wither them but well joanna knew early at
domrémy she had read that bitter truth that the lilies of france would
decorate no garland for her flower nor bud bell nor blossom would
ever bloom for her

 

but stay what reason is there for taking up this subject of joanna
precisely in the spring of might it not have been left till the
spring of or perhaps left till called for yes but it is
called for and clamorously you are aware reader that amongst the
many original thinkers whom modern france has produced one of the
reputed leaders is m michelet all these writers are of a revolutionary
cast not in a political sense merely but in all senses mad
oftentimes as march hares crazy with the laughing gas of recovered
liberty drunk with the wine cup of their mighty revolution snorting
whinnying throwing up their heels like wild horses in the boundless
pampas and running races of defiance with snipes or with the winds or
with their own shadows if they can find nothing else to challenge some
time or other i that have leisure to read may introduce you that
have not to two or three dozen of these writers of whom i can assure
you beforehand that they are often profound and at intervals are even
as impassioned as if they were come of our best english blood but now
confining our attention to m michelet we in england who know him
best by his worst book the book against priests etc know him
disadvantageously that book is a rhapsody of incoherence but his
history of france is quite another thing a man in whatsoever craft
he sails cannot stretch away out of sight when he is linked to the
windings of the shore by towing-ropes of history facts and the
consequences of facts draw the writer back to the falconer's lure
from the giddiest heights of speculation here therefore in his
france if not always free from flightiness if now and then off like
a rocket for an airy wheel in the clouds m michelet with natural
politeness never forgets that he has left a large audience waiting
for him on earth and gazing upward in anxiety for his return return
therefore he does but history though clear of certain temptations in
one direction has separate dangers of its own it is impossible so to
write a history of france or of england works becoming every hour
more indispensable to the inevitably political man of this day without
perilous openings for error if i for instance on the part of england
should happen to turn my labours into that channel and on the model of
lord percy going to chevy chase

 a vow to god should make
 my pleasure in the michelet woods
 three summer days to take

probably from simple delirium i might hunt m michelet into delirium
tremens two strong angels stand by the side of history whether french
history or english as heraldic supporters the angel of research on
the left hand that must read millions of dusty parchments and of pages
blotted with lies the angel of meditation on the right hand that must
cleanse these lying records with fire even as of old the draperies of
asbestos were cleansed and must quicken them into regenerated life
willingly i acknowledge that no man will ever avoid innumerable errors
of detail with so vast a compass of ground to traverse this is
impossible but such errors though i have a bushel on hand at m
michelet's service are not the game i chase it is the bitter and
unfair spirit in which m michelet writes against england even that
after all is but my secondary object the real one is joanna the
pucelle d'orléans herself

i am not going to write the history of la pucelle to do this or even
circumstantially to report the history of her persecution and bitter
death of her struggle with false witnesses and with ensnaring judges
it would be necessary to have before us all the documents and
therefore the collection only now forthcoming in paris footnote
only now forthcoming in began the publication from
official records of joanna's trial it was interrupted i fear by the
convulsions of and whether even yet finished i do not know but
my purpose is narrower there have been great thinkers disdaining the
careless judgments of contemporaries who have thrown themselves boldly
on the judgment of a far posterity that should have had time to review
to ponder to compare there have been great actors on the stage of
tragic humanity that might with the same depth of confidence have
appealed from the levity of compatriot friends too heartless for the
sublime interest of their story and too impatient for the labour of
sifting its perplexities to the magnanimity and justice of enemies to
this class belongs the maid of arc the ancient romans were too faithful
to the ideal of grandeur in themselves not to relent after a generation
or two before the grandeur of hannibal mithridates a more doubtful
person yet merely for the magic perseverance of his indomitable
malice won from the same romans the only real honour that ever he
received on earth and we english have ever shown the same homage to
stubborn enmity to work unflinchingly for the ruin of england to say
through life by word and by deed delenda est anglia victrix that
one purpose of malice faithfully pursued has quartered some people
upon our national funds of homage as by a perpetual annuity better
than an inheritance of service rendered to england herself has sometimes
proved the most insane hatred to england hyder ali even his son
tippoo though so far inferior and napoleon have all benefited by this
disposition among ourselves to exaggerate the merit of diabolic enmity
not one of these men was ever capable in a solitary instance of
praising an enemy what do you say to that reader and yet in
their behalf we consent to forget not their crimes only but which
is worse their hideous bigotry and anti-magnanimous egotism for
nationality it was not suffren and some half dozen of other french
nautical heroes because rightly they did us all the mischief they could
which was really great are names justly reverenced in england on the
same principle la pucelle d'orléans the victorious enemy of england
has been destined to receive her deepest commemoration from the
magnanimous justice of englishmen

joanna as we in england should call her but according to her
own statement jeanne or as m michelet asserts jean footnote
jean m michelet asserts that there was a mystical meaning at that
era in calling a child jean it implied a secret commendation of a
child if not a dedication to st john the evangelist the beloved
disciple the apostle of love and mysterious visions but really as
the name was so exceedingly common few people will detect a mystery in
calling a boy by the name of jack though it does seem mysterious
to call a girl jack it may be less so in france where a beautiful
practice has always prevailed of giving a boy his mother's
name preceded and strengthened by a male name as charles anne
victor victoire in cases where a mother's memory has been unusually
dear to a son this vocal memento of her locked into the circle of
his own name gives to it the tenderness of a testamentary relic or a
funeral ring i presume therefore that la pucelle must have borne the
baptismal name of jeanne jean the latter with no reference perhaps
to so sublime a person as st john but simply to some relative d'arc
was born at domrémy a village on the marches of lorraine and champagne
and dependent upon the town of vaucouleurs i have called her a
lorrainer not simply because the word is prettier but because
champagne too odiously reminds us english of what are for us imaginary
wines which undoubtedly la pucelle tasted as rarely as we english we
english because the champagne of london is chiefly grown in devonshire
la pucelle because the champagne of champagne never by any chance
flowed into the fountain of domrémy from which only she drank m
michelet will have her to be a champenoise and for no better
reason than that she took after her father who happened to be a
champenois

these disputes however turn on refinements too nice domrémy stood
upon the frontiers and like other frontiers produced a mixed race
representing the cis and the trans a river it is true formed the
boundary line at this point the river meuse and that in old days
might have divided the populations but in these days it did not there
were bridges there were ferries and weddings crossed from the right
bank to the left here lay two great roads not so much for travellers
that were few as for armies that were too many by half these two
roads one of which was the great highroad between france and germany
decussated at this very point which is a learned way of saying that
they formed a st andrew's cross or letter x i hope the compositor
will choose a good large x in which case the point of intersection the
locus of conflux and intersection for these four diverging arms
will finish the reader's geographical education by showing him to a
hair's-breadth where it was that domrémy stood these roads so grandly
situated as great trunk arteries between two mighty realmsfootnote
and reminding one of that inscription so justly admired by paul
richter which a russian czarina placed on a guide-post near moscow
this is the road that leads to constantinople and haunted for ever
by wars or rumours of wars decussated for anything i know to the
contrary absolutely under joanna's bedroom window one rolling away
to the right past m d'arc's old barn and the other unaccountably
preferring to sweep round that odious man's pig-sty to the left

on whichever side of the border chance had thrown joanna the same love
to france would have been nurtured for it is a strange fact noticed
by m michelet and others that the dukes of bar and lorraine had for
generations pursued the policy of eternal warfare with france on their
own account yet also of eternal amity and league with france in case
anybody else presumed to attack her let peace settle upon france and
before long you might rely upon seeing the little vixen lorraine flying
at the throat of france let france be assailed by a formidable enemy
and instantly you saw a duke of lorraine insisting on having his own
throat cut in support of france which favour accordingly was cheerfully
granted to him in three great successive battles twice by the english
viz at crécy and agincourt once by the sultan at nicopolis

this sympathy with france during great eclipses in those that during
ordinary seasons were always teasing her with brawls and guerilla
inroads strengthened the natural piety to france of those that were
confessedly the children of her own house the outposts of france as
one may call the great frontier provinces were of all localities the
most devoted to the fleurs de lys to witness at any great crisis the
generous devotion to these lilies of the little fiery cousin that in
gentler weather was for ever tilting at the breast of france could not
but fan the zeal of france's legitimate daughters while to occupy
a post of honour on the frontiers against an old hereditary enemy of
france would naturally stimulate this zeal by a sentiment of martial
pride by a sense of danger always threatening and of hatred always
smouldering that great four-headed road was a perpetual memento to
patriotic ardour to say this way lies the road to paris and that
other way to aix-la-chapelle this to prague that to vienna nourished
the warfare of the heart by daily ministrations of sense the eye that
watched for the gleams of lance or helmet from the hostile frontier the
ear that listened for the groaning of wheels made the highroad itself
with its relations to centres so remote into a manual of patriotic
duty

the situation therefore locally of joanna was full of profound
suggestions to a heart that listened for the stealthy steps of change
and fear that too surely were in motion but if the place were grand
the time the burden of the time was far more so the air overhead in
its upper chambers was hurtling with the obscure sound was dark with
sullen fermenting of storms that had been gathering for a hundred and
thirty years the battle of agincourt in joanna's childhood had reopened
the wounds of france crécy and poictiers those withering overthrows
for the chivalry of france had before agincourt occurred been
tranquilised by more than half a century but this resurrection of their
trumpet wails made the whole series of battles and endless skirmishes
take their stations as parts in one drama the graves that had closed
sixty years ago seemed to fly open in sympathy with a sorrow that echoed
their own the monarchy of france laboured in extremity rocked and
reeled like a ship fighting with the darkness of monsoons the madness
of the poor king charles vi falling in at such a crisis like the
case of women labouring in child-birth during the storming of a city
trebled the awfulness of the time even the wild story of the incident
which had immediately occasioned the explosion of this madness the case
of a man unknown gloomy and perhaps maniacal himself coming out of a
forest at noonday laying his hand upon the bridle of the king's horse
checking him for a moment to say oh king thou art betrayed and
then vanishing no man knew whither as he had appeared for no man knew
what fell in with the universal prostration of mind that laid france on
her knees as before the slow unweaving of some ancient prophetic
doom the famines the extraordinary diseases the insurrections of the
peasantry up and down europe these were chords struck from the same
mysterious harp but these were transitory chords there had been others
of deeper and more ominous sound the termination of the crusades the
destruction of the templars the papal interdicts the tragedies caused
or suffered by the house of anjou and by the emperor these were full
of a more permanent significance but since then the colossal figure
of feudalism was seen standing as it were on tiptoe at crécy for
flight from earth that was a revolution unparalleled yet that was a
trifle by comparison with the more fearful revolutions that were
mining below the church by her own internal schisms by the abominable
spectacle of a double pope so that no man except through political
bias could even guess which was heaven's vicegerent and which the
creature of hell the church was rehearsing as in still earlier forms
she had already rehearsed those vast rents in her foundations which no
man should ever heal

these were the loftiest peaks of the cloudland in the skies that to
the scientific gazer first caught the colors of the new morning in
advance but the whole vast range alike of sweeping glooms overhead
dwelt upon all meditative minds even upon those that could not
distinguish the tendencies nor decipher the forms it was therefore
not her own age alone as affected by its immediate calamities that lay
with such weight upon joanna's mind but her own age as one section in
a vast mysterious drama unweaving through a century back and drawing
nearer continually to some dreadful crisis cataracts and rapids were
heard roaring ahead and signs were seen far back by help of old men's
memories which answered secretly to signs now coming forward on the
eye even as locks answer to keys it was not wonderful that in such a
haunted solitude with such a haunted heart joanna should see angelic
visions and hear angelic voices these voices whispered to her for ever
the duty self-imposed of delivering france five years she listened
to these monitory voices with internal struggles at length she could
resist no longer doubt gave way and she left her home for ever in
order to present herself at the dauphin's court the education of this
poor girl was mean according to the present standard was ineffably
grand according to a purer philosophic standard and only not good for
our age because for us it would be unattainable she read nothing for
she could not read but she had heard others read parts of the roman
martyrology she wept in sympathy with the sad misereres of the romish
church she rose to heaven with the glad triumphant te deums of rome
she drew her comfort and her vital strength from the rites of the same
church but next after these spiritual advantages she owed most to the
advantages of her situation the fountain of domrémy was on the brink
of a boundless forest and it was haunted to that degree by fairies that
the parish priest curé was obliged to read mass there once a year
in order to keep them in any decent bounds fairies are important even
in a statistical view certain weeds mark poverty in the soil fairies
mark its solitude as surely as the wolf retires before cities does the
fairy sequester herself from the haunts of the licensed victualer a
village is too much for her nervous delicacy at most she can tolerate
a distant view of a hamlet we may judge therefore by the uneasiness
and extra trouble which they gave to the parson in what strength the
fairies mustered at domrémy and by a satisfactory consequence how
thinly sown with men and women must have been that region even in its
inhabited spots but the forests of domrémy those were the glories of
the land for in them abode mysterious powers and ancient secrets
that towered into tragic strength abbeys there were and abbey
windows like moorish temples of the hindoos that exercised even
princely power both in lorraine and in the german diets these had their
sweet bells that pierced the forests for many a league at matins or
vespers and each its own dreamy legend few enough and scattered
enough were these abbeys so as in no degree to disturb the deep
solitude of the region yet many enough to spread a network or awning
of christian sanctity over what else might have seemed a heathen
wilderness this sort of religious talisman being secured a man the
most afraid of ghosts like myself suppose or the reader becomes
armed into courage to wander for days in their sylvan recesses the
mountains of the vosges on the eastern frontier of france have never
attracted much notice from europe except in - for a few brief
months when they fell within napoleon's line of defence against the
allies but they are interesting for this among other features that
they do not like some loftier ranges repel woods the forests and the
hills are on sociable terms live and let live is their motto
for this reason in part these tracts in lorraine were a favourite
hunting-ground with the carlovingian princes about six hundred years
before joanna's childhood charlemagne was known to have hunted there
that of itself was a grand incident in the traditions of a forest or a
chase in these vast forests also were to be found if anywhere to
be found those mysterious fawns that tempted solitary hunters into
visionary and perilous pursuits here was seen if anywhere seen that
ancient stag who was already nine hundred years old but possibly a
hundred or two more when met by charlemagne and the thing was put
beyond doubt by the inscription upon his golden collar i believe
charlemagne knighted the stag and if ever he is met again by a king
he ought to be made an earl or being upon the marches of france a
marquis observe i don't absolutely vouch for all these things my own
opinion varies on a fine breezy forenoon i am audaciously sceptical
but as twilight sets in my credulity grows steadily till it becomes
equal to anything that could be desired and i have heard candid
sportsmen declare that outside of these very forests they laughed
loudly at all the dim tales connected with their haunted solitudes but
on reaching a spot notoriously eighteen miles deep within them they
agreed with sir roger de coverley that a good deal might be said on both
sides

such traditions or any others that like the stag connect distant
generations with each other are for that cause sublime and the sense
of the shadowy connected with such appearances that reveal themselves
or not according to circumstances leaves a colouring of sanctity over
ancient forests even in those minds that utterly reject the legend as a
fact

but apart from all distinct stories of that order in any solitary
frontier between two great empires as here for instance or in the
desert between syria and the euphrates there is an inevitable tendency
in minds of any deep sensibility to people the solitudes with phantom
images of powers that were of old so vast joanna therefore in her
quiet occupation of a shepherdess would be led continually to brood
over the political condition of her country by the traditions of the
past no less than by the mementoes of the local present

m michelet indeed says that la pucelle was not a shepherdess i beg
his pardon she was what he rests upon i guess pretty well it is the
evidence of a woman called haumette the most confidential friend of
joanna now she is a good witness and a good girl and i like her for
she makes a natural and affectionate report of joanna's ordinary life
but still however good she may be as a witness joanna is better and
she when speaking to the dauphin calls herself in the latin report
bergereta even haumette confesses that joanna tended sheep in her
girlhood and i believe that if miss haumette were taking coffee along
with me this very evening february  in which there would be
no subject for scandal or for maiden blushes because i am an intense
philosopher and miss h would be hard upon years old she would
admit the following comment upon her evidence to be right a
frenchman about forty years ago m simond in his travels mentions
accidentally the following hideous scene as one steadily observed and
watched by himself in chivalrous france not very long before the french
revolution a peasant was plowing and the team that drew his plow was
a donkey and a woman both were regularly harnessed both pulled alike
this is bad enough but the frenchman adds that in distributing his
lashes the peasant was obviously desirous of being impartial or if
either of the yokefellows had a right to complain certainly it was not
the donkey now in any country where such degradation of females could
be tolerated by the state of manners a woman of delicacy would shrink
from acknowledging either for herself or her friend that she had ever
been addicted to any mode of labour not strictly domestic because if
once owning herself a prædial servant she would be sensible that this
confession extended by probability in the hearer's thoughts to the
having incurred indignities of this horrible kind haumette clearly
thinks it more dignified for joanna to have been darning the stockings
of her horny-hoofed father m d'arc than keeping sheep lest she might
then be suspected of having ever done something worse but luckily
there was no danger of that joanna never was in service and my
opinion is that her father should have mended his own stockings since
probably he was the party to make the holes in them as many a better
man than d'arc does meaning by that not myself because though
probably a better man than d'arc i protest against doing anything of
the kind if i lived even with friday in juan fernandez either friday
must do all the darning or else it must go undone the better men that
i meant were the sailors in the british navy every man of whom mends
his own stockings who else is to do it do you suppose reader that
the junior lords of the admiralty are under articles to darn for the
navy

the reason meantime for my systematic hatred of d'arc is this there
was a story current in france before the revolution framed to ridicule
the pauper aristocracy who happened to have long pedigrees and short
rent rolls viz that a head of such a house dating from the crusades
was overheard saying to his son a chevalier of st louis chevalier
as-tu donné au cochon à manger now it is clearly made out by the
surviving evidence that d'arc would much have preferred continuing to
say ma fille as-tu donné au cochon à manger to saying pucelle
d'orléans as-tu sauvé les fleurs-de-lys there is an old english copy
of verses which argues thus

 if the man that turnips cries
 cry not when his father dies
 then tis plain the man had rather
 have a turnip than his father

i cannot say that the logic of these verses was ever entirely to my
satisfaction i do not see my way through it as clearly as could be
wished but i see my way most clearly through d'arc and the result
is that he would greatly have preferred not merely a turnip to his
father but the saving a pound or so of bacon to saving the oriflamme of
france

it is probable as m michelet suggests that the title of virgin or
pucelle had in itself and apart from the miraculous stories about
her a secret power over the rude soldiery and partisan chiefs of that
period for in such a person they saw a representative manifestation of
the virgin mary who in a course of centuries had grown steadily upon
the popular heart

as to joanna's supernatural detection of the dauphin charles vii among
three hundred lords and knights i am surprised at the credulity which
could ever lend itself to that theatrical juggle who admires more than
myself the sublime enthusiasm the rapturous faith in herself of this
pure creature but i am far from admiring stage artifices which not la
pucelle but the court must have arranged nor can surrender myself
to the conjurer's legerdemain such as may be seen every day for a
shilling southey's joan of arc was published in twenty years
after talking with southey i was surprised to find him still owning a
secret bias in favor of joan founded on her detection of the dauphin
the story for the benefit of the reader new to the case was this la
pucelle was first made known to the dauphin and presented to his
court at chinon and here came her first trial by way of testing
her supernatural pretensions she was to find out the royal personage
amongst the whole ark of clean and unclean creatures failing in this
coup d'essai she would not simply disappoint many a beating heart in
the glittering crowd that on different motives yearned for her success
but she would ruin herself and as the oracle within had told her
would by ruining herself ruin france our own sovereign lady victoria
rehearses annually a trial not so severe in degree but the same in
kind she pricks for sheriffs joanna pricked for a king but observe
the difference our own lady pricks for two men out of three joanna
for one man out of three hundred happy lady of the islands and the
orient she can go astray in her choice only by one-half to the
extent of one-half she must have the satisfaction of being right
and yet even with these tight limits to the misery of a boundless
discretion permit me liege lady with all loyalty to submit that now
and then you prick with your pin the wrong man but the poor child from
domremy shrinking under the gaze of a dazzling court not because
dazzling for in visions she had seen those that were more so but
because some of them wore a scoffing smile on their features how should
she throw her line into so deep a river to angle for a king where
many a gay creature was sporting that masqueraded as kings in dress
nay even more than any true king would have done for in southey's
version of the story the dauphin says by way of trying the virgin's
magnetic sympathy with royalty

 on the throne
 i the while mingling with the menial throng
 some courtier shall be seated

this usurper is even crowned the jeweled crown shines on a menial's
head but really that is un peu fort and the mob of spectators
might raise a scruple whether our friend the jackdaw upon the throne
and the dauphin himself were not grazing the shins of treason for
the dauphin could not lend more than belonged to him according to the
popular notion he had no crown for himself consequently none to lend
on any pretence whatever until the consecrated maid should take him to
rheims this was the popular notion in france but certainly it was
the dauphin's interest to support the popular notion as he meant to use
the services of joanna for if he were king already what was it that
she could do for him beyond orleans that is to say what more than a
merely military service could she render him and above all if he
were king without a coronation and without the oil from the sacred
ampulla what advantage was yet open to him by celerity above his
competitor the english boy now was to be a race for a coronation he
that should win that race carried the superstition of france along
with him he that should first be drawn from the ovens of rheims was
under that superstition baked into a king

la pucelle before she could be allowed to practise as a warrior was
put through her manual and platoon exercise as a pupil in divinity at
the bar of six eminent men in wigs according to southey v bk
iii in the original edition of his joan of arc she appalled the
doctors it's not easy to do that but they had some reason to
feel bothered as that surgeon would assuredly feel bothered who upon
proceeding to dissect a subject should find the subject retaliating as
a dissector upon himself especially if joanna ever made the speech to
them which occupies v - bk iii it is a double impossibility
st because a piracy from tindal's christianity as old as the
creation a piracy a parte ante and by three centuries d it is
quite contrary to the evidence on joanna's trial southey's joan of
ad cottle bristol tells the doctors among other secrets
that she never in her life attended st mass nor d the sacramental
table nor d confession in the meantime all this deistical
confession of joanna's besides being suicidal for the interest of her
cause is opposed to the depositions upon both trials the very best
witness called from first to last deposes that joanna attended these
rites of her church even too often was taxed with doing so and by
blushing owned the charge as a fact though certainly not as a fault
joanna was a girl of natural piety that saw god in forests and hills
and fountains but did not the less seek him in chapels and consecrated
oratories

this peasant girl was self-educated through her own natural
meditativeness if the reader turns to that divine passage in paradise
regained which milton has put into the mouth of our saviour when first
entering the wilderness and musing upon the tendency of those great
impulses growing within himself  -

 oh what a multitude of thoughts at once
 awakened in me swarm while i consider
 what from within i feel myself and hear
 what from without comes often to my ears
 ill sorting with my present state compared
 when i was yet a child no childish play
 to me was pleasing all my mind was set
 serious to learn and know and thence to do
 what might be public good myself i thought
 born to that end  

he will have some notion of the vast reveries which brooded over the
heart of joanna in early girlhood when the wings were budding that
should carry her from orleans to rheims when the golden chariot was
dimly revealing itself that should carry her from the kingdom of france
delivered to the eternal kingdom

it is not requisite for the honour of joanna nor is there in this place
room to pursue her brief career of action that though wonderful
forms the earthly part of her story the spiritual part is the saintly
passion of her imprisonment trial and execution it is unfortunate
therefore for southey's joan of arc which however should always
be regarded as a juvenile effort that precisely when her real glory
begins the poem ends but this limitation of the interest grew no
doubt from the constraint inseparably attached to the law of epic
unity joanna's history bisects into two opposite hemispheres and
both could not have been presented to the eye in one poem unless by
sacrificing all unity of theme or else by involving the earlier half
as a narrative episode in the latter which however might have been
done for it might have been communicated to a fellow-prisoner or
a confessor by joanna herself it is sufficient as concerns this
section of joanna's life to say that she fulfilled to the height of
her promises the restoration of the prostrate throne france had become
a province of england and for the ruin of both if such a yoke could be
maintained dreadful pecuniary exhaustion caused the english energy to
droop and that critical opening la pucelle used with a corresponding
felicity of audacity and suddenness that were in themselves portentous
for introducing the wedge of french native resources for rekindling the
national pride and for planting the dauphin once more upon his feet
when joanna appeared he had been on the point of giving up the struggle
with the english distressed as they were and of flying to the south of
france she taught him to blush for such abject counsels she liberated
orleans that great city so decisive by its fate for the issue of the
war and then beleaguered by the english with an elaborate application
of engineering skill unprecedented in europe entering the city after
sunset on the th of april she sang mass on sunday may th for the
entire disappearance of the besieging force on the th of june she
fought and gained over the english the decisive battle of patay on the
th of july she took troyes by a coup-de-main from a mixed garrison
of english and burgundians on the th of that month she carried the
dauphin into rheims on sunday the th she crowned him and there she
rested from her labour of triumph all that was to be done she had now
accomplished what remained was to suffer

all this forward movement was her own excepting one man the whole
council was against her her enemies were all that drew power from
earth her supporters were her own strong enthusiasm and the headlong
contagion by which she carried this sublime frenzy into the hearts of
women of soldiers and of all who lived by labour henceforward she
was thwarted and the worst error that she committed was to lend the
sanction of her presence to counsels which she had ceased to approve
but she had now accomplished the capital objects which her own visions
had dictated these involved all the rest errors were now less
important and doubtless it had now become more difficult for herself to
pronounce authentically what were errors the noble girl had achieved
as by a rapture of motion the capital end of clearing out a free space
around her sovereign giving him the power to move his arms with effect
and secondly the inappreciable end of winning for that sovereign
what seemed to all france the heavenly ratification of his rights by
crowning him with the ancient solemnities she had made it impossible
for the english now to step before her they were caught in an
irretrievable blunder owing partly to discord among the uncles of henry
vi partly to a want of funds but partly to the very impossibility
which they believed to press with tenfold force upon any french attempt
to forestall theirs they laughed at such a thought and while they
laughed she did it henceforth the single redress for the english
of this capital oversight but which never could have redressed it
effectually was to vitiate and taint the coronation of charles vii as
the work of a witch that policy and not malice as m michelet is
so happy to believe was the moving principle in the subsequent
prosecution of joanna unless they unhinged the force of the first
coronation in the popular mind by associating it with power given from
hell they felt that the sceptre of the invader was broken

but she the child that at nineteen had wrought wonders so great for
france was she not elated did she not lose as men so often have
lost all sobriety of mind when standing upon the pinnacle of success so
giddy let her enemies declare during the progress of her movement and
in the centre of ferocious struggles she had manifested the temper
of her feelings by the pity which she had everywhere expressed for
the suffering enemy she forwarded to the english leaders a touching
invitation to unite with the french as brothers in a common crusade
against infidels thus opening the road for a soldierly retreat she
interposed to protect the captive or the wounded she mourned over the
excesses of her countrymen she threw herself off her horse to kneel by
the dying english soldier and to comfort him with such ministrations
physical or spiritual as his situation allowed nolebat says the
evidence uti ense suo aut quemquam interficere she sheltered
the english that invoked her aid in her own quarters she wept as she
beheld stretched on the field of battle so many brave enemies that had
died without confession and as regarded herself her elation expressed
itself thus on the day when she had finished her work she wept for
she knew that when her triumphal task was done her end must be
approaching her aspirations pointed only to a place which seemed to her
more than usually full of natural piety as one in which it would give
her pleasure to die and she uttered between smiles and tears as
a wish that inexpressibly fascinated her heart and yet was half
fantastic a broken prayer that god would return her to the solitudes
from which he had drawn her and suffer her to become a shepherdess once
more it was a natural prayer because nature has laid a necessity upon
every human heart to seek for rest and to shrink from torment yet
again it was a half-fantastic prayer because from childhood upward
visions that she had no power to mistrust and the voices which sounded
in her ear for ever had long since persuaded her mind that for her no
such prayer could be granted too well she felt that her mission must be
worked out to the end and that the end was now at hand all went wrong
from this time she herself had created the funds out of which the
french restoration should grow but she was not suffered to witness
their development or their prosperous application more than one
military plan was entered upon which she did not approve but she still
continued to expose her person as before severe wounds had not taught
her caution and at length in a sortie from compiègne whether through
treacherous collusion on the part of her own friends is doubtful to this
day she was made prisoner by the burgundians and finally surrendered
to the english

now came her trial this trial moving of course under english
influence was conducted in chief by the bishop of beauvais he was
a frenchman sold to english interests and hoping by favour of the
english leaders to reach the highest preferment bishop that art
archbishop that shalt be cardinal that mayest be were the words that
sounded continually in his ear and doubtless a whisper of visions still
higher of a triple crown and feet upon the necks of kings sometimes
stole into his heart m michelet is anxious to keep us in mind that
this bishop was but an agent of the english true but it does not
better the case for his countryman that being an accomplice in the
crime making himself the leader in the persecution against the
helpless girl he was willing to be all this in the spirit and with
the conscious vileness of a cat's-paw never from the foundations of the
earth was there such a trial as this if it were laid open in all
its beauty of defence and all its hellishness of attack oh child of
france shepherdess peasant girl trodden under foot by all around
thee how i honour thy flashing intellect quick as god's lightning and
true as god's lightning to its mark that ran before france and laggard
europe by many a century confounding the malice of the ensnarer and
making dumb the oracles of falsehood is it not scandalous is it not
humiliating to civilization that even at this day france exhibits
the horrid spectacle of judges examining the prisoner against himself
seducing him by fraud into treacherous conclusions against his own
head using the terrors of their power for extorting confessions from
the frailty of hope nay which is worse using the blandishments
of condescension and snaky kindness for thawing into compliances of
gratitude those whom they had failed to freeze into terror wicked
judges barbarian jurisprudence that sitting in your own conceit
on the summits of social wisdom have yet failed to learn the first
principles of criminal justice sit ye humbly and with docility at the
feet of this girl from domrémy that tore your webs of cruelty into
shreds and dust would you examine me as a witness against myself was
the question by which many times she defied their arts continually she
showed that their interrogations were irrelevant to any business before
the court or that entered into the ridiculous charges against her
general questions were proposed to her on points of casuistical
divinity two-edged questions which not one of themselves could have
answered without on the one side landing himself in heresy as then
interpreted or on the other in some presumptuous expression of
self-esteem next came a wretched dominican that pressed her with an
objection which if applied to the bible would tax every one of its
miracles with unsoundness the monk had the excuse of never having read
the bible m michelet has no such excuse and it makes one blush
for him as a philosopher to find him describing such an argument
as weighty whereas it is but a varied expression of rude mahometan
metaphysics her answer to this if there were room to place the whole
in a clear light was as shattering as it was rapid another thought to
entrap her by asking what language the angelic visitors of her solitude
had talked as though heavenly counsels could want polyglot interpreters
for every word or that god needed language at all in whispering
thoughts to a human heart then came a worse devil who asked her
whether the archangel michael had appeared naked not comprehending the
vile insinuation joanna whose poverty suggested to her simplicity that
it might be the costliness of suitable robes which caused the demur
asked them if they fancied god who clothed the flowers of the valleys
unable to find raiment for his servants the answer of joanna moves
a smile of tenderness but the disappointment of her judges makes one
laugh exultingly others succeeded by troops who upbraided her with
leaving her father as if that greater father whom she believed herself
to have been serving did not retain the power of dispensing with his
own rules or had not said that for a less cause than martyrdom man and
woman should leave both father and mother

on easter sunday when the trial had been long proceeding the poor girl
fell so ill as to cause a belief that she had been poisoned it was
not poison nobody had any interest in hastening a death so certain m
michelet whose sympathies with all feelings are so quick that one would
gladly see them always as justly directed reads the case most truly
joanna had a twofold malady she was visited by a paroxysm of the
complaint called homesickness the cruel nature of her imprisonment
and its length could not but point her solitary thoughts in darkness
and in chains for chained she was to domrémy and the season
which was the most heavenly period of the spring added stings to this
yearning that was one of her maladies nostalgia as medicine calls
it the other was weariness and exhaustion from daily combats with
malice she saw that everybody hated her and thirsted for her blood
nay many kind-hearted creatures that would have pitied her profoundly
as regarded all political charges had their natural feelings warped by
the belief that she had dealings with fiendish powers she knew she was
to die that was not the misery the misery was that this consummation
could not be reached without so much intermediate strife as if she were
contending for some chance where chance was none of happiness or were
dreaming for a moment of escaping the inevitable why then did
she contend knowing that she would reap nothing from answering her
persecutors why did she not retire by silence from the superfluous
contest it was because her quick and eager loyalty to truth would not
suffer her to see it darkened by frauds which she could expose but
others even of candid listeners perhaps could not it was through
that imperishable grandeur of soul which taught her to submit meekly
and without a struggle to her punishment but taught her not
to submit no not for a moment to calumny as to facts or to
misconstruction as to motives besides there were secretaries all
around the court taking down her words that was meant for no good to
her but the end does not always correspond to the meaning and
joanna might say to herself these words that will be used against me
to-morrow and the next day perhaps in some nobler generation may rise
again for my justification yes joanna they are rising even now in
paris and for more than justification

woman sister there are some things which you do not execute as well as
your brother man no nor ever will pardon me if i doubt whether
you will ever produce a great poet from your choirs or a mozart or
a phidias or a michael angelo or a great philosopher or a great
scholar by which last is meant not one who depends simply on an
infinite memory but also on an infinite and electrical power of
combination bringing together from the four winds like the angel of
the resurrection what else were dust from dead men's bones into the
unity of breathing life if you can create yourselves into any of
these great creators why have you not

yet sister woman though i cannot consent to find a mozart or a michael
angelo in your sex cheerfully and with the love that burns in depths
of admiration i acknowledge that you can do one thing as well as the
best of us men a greater thing than even milton is known to have done
or michael angelo you can die grandly and as goddesses would die were
goddesses mortal if any distant worlds which may be the case are
so far ahead of us tellurians in optical resources as to see distinctly
through their telescopes all that we do on earth what is the grandest
sight to which we ever treat them st peter's at rome do you fancy
on easter sunday or luxor or perhaps the himalayas oh no my friend
suggest something better these are baubles to them they see in other
worlds in their own far better toys of the same kind these take my
word for it are nothing do you give it up the finest thing then we
have to show them is a scaffold on the morning of execution i assure
you there is a strong muster in those far telescopic worlds on any
such morning of those who happen to find themselves occupying the right
hemisphere for a peep at us how then if it be announced in some
such telescopic world by those who make a livelihood of catching
glimpses at our newspapers whose language they have long since
deciphered that the poor victim in the morning's sacrifice is a woman
how if it be published in that distant world that the sufferer wears
upon her head in the eyes of many the garlands of martyrdom how if
it should be some marie antoinette the widowed queen coming forward on
the scaffold and presenting to the morning air her head turned gray by
sorrow daughter of caesars kneeling down humbly to kiss the guillotine
as one that worships death how if it were the noble charlotte corday
that in the bloom of youth that with the loveliest of persons that
with homage waiting upon her smiles wherever she turned her face to
scatter them homage that followed those smiles as surely as the carols
of birds after showers in spring follow the reappearing sun and the
racing of sunbeams over the hills yet thought all these things cheaper
than the dust upon her sandals in comparison of deliverance from hell
for her dear suffering france ah these were spectacles indeed for
those sympathising people in distant worlds and some perhaps would
suffer a sort of martyrdom themselves because they could not testify
their wrath could not bear witness to the strength of love and to the
fury of hatred that burned within them at such scenes could not
gather into golden urns some of that glorious dust which rested in the
catacombs of earth

on the wednesday after trinity sunday in being then about nineteen
years of age the maid of arc underwent her martyrdom she was conducted
before mid-day guarded by eight hundred spearmen to a platform of
prodigious height constructed of wooden billets supported by occasional
walls of lath and plaster and traversed by hollow spaces in every
direction for the creation of air currents the pile struck terror
says m michelet by its height and as usual the english purpose
in this is viewed as one of pure malignity but there are two ways of
explaining all that it is probable that the purpose was merciful on
the circumstances of the execution i shall not linger yet to mark the
almost fatal felicity of m michelet in finding out whatever may injure
the english name at a moment when every reader will be interested
in joanna's personal appearance it is really edifying to notice the
ingenuity by which he draws into light from a dark corner a very unjust
account of it and neglects though lying upon the highroad a very
pleasing one both are from english pens grafton a chronicler but
little read being a stiff-necked john bull thought fit to say that
no wonder joanna should be a virgin since her foule face was a
satisfactory solution of that particular merit holinshead on the other
hand a chronicler somewhat later every way more important and at
one time universally read has given a very pleasing testimony to the
interesting character of joanna's person and engaging manners neither
of these men lived till the following century so that personally this
evidence is none at all grafton sullenly and carelessly believed as
he wished to believe holinshead took pains to inquire and reports
undoubtedly the general impression of france but i cite the case
as illustrating m michelet's candour footnote amongst the many
ebullitions of m michelet's fury against us poor english are four which
will be likely to amuse the reader and they are the more conspicuous
in collision with the justice which he sometimes does us and the very
indignant admiration which under some aspects he grants to us our
english literature he admires with some gnashing of teeth he pronounces
it fine and sombre but i lament to add skeptical judaic
satanic in a word antichristian that lord byron should figure as a
member of this diabolical corporation will not surprise men it will
surprise them to hear that milton is one of its satanic leaders many
are the generous and eloquent frenchmen besides chateaubriand who
have in the course of the last thirty years nobly suspended their own
burning nationality in order to render a more rapturous homage at the
feet of milton and some of them have raised milton almost to a level
with angelic natures not one of them has thought of looking for him
below the earth as to shakspere m michelet detects in him a most
extraordinary mare's nest it is this he does not recollect to have
seen the name of god in any part of his works on reading such words
it is natural to rub one's eyes and suspect that all one has ever seen
in this world may have been a pure ocular delusion in particular i
begin myself to suspect that the word la gloire never occurs in any
parisian journal the great english nation says m michelet has one
immense profound vice to wit pride why really that may be true
but we have a neighbour not absolutely clear of an immense profound
vice as like ours in colour and shape as cherry to cherry in short
m michelet thinks us by fits and starts admirable only that we are
detestable and he would adore some of our authors were it not that so
intensely he could have wished to kick them

 m michelet thinks to lodge an arrow in our sides by a very odd
remark upon thomas à kempis which is that a man of any conceivable
european blood a finlander suppose or a zantiote might have written
tom only not an englishman whether an englishman could have forged tom
must remain a matter of doubt unless the thing had been tried long ago
that problem was intercepted for ever by tom's perverseness in choosing
to manufacture himself yet since nobody is better aware than m
michelet that this very point of kempis having manufactured kempis is
furiously and hopelessly litigated three or four nations claiming to
have forged his work for him the shocking old doubt will raise
its snaky head once more whether this forger who rests in so much
darkness might not after all be of english blood tom it may be
feared is known to modern english literature chiefly by an irreverent
mention of his name in a line of peter pindar's dr wolcot fifty years
back where he is described as

 kempis tom
 who clearly shows the way to kingdom come

few in these days can have read him unless in the methodist version of
john wesley among those few however happens to be myself which arose
from the accident of having when a boy of eleven received a copy of
the de imitatione christi as a bequest from a relation who died
very young from which cause and from the external prettiness of
the book being a glasgow reprint by the celebrated foulis and gaily
bound i was induced to look into it and finally read it many times
over partly out of some sympathy which even in those days i had with
its simplicity and devotional fervour but much more from the savage
delight i found in laughing at tom's latinity that i freely grant to m
michelet is inimitable yet after all it is not certain whether the
original was latin but however that may have been if it is possible
that m michelet footnote if m michelet can be accurate however
on consideration this statement does not depend on michelet the
bibliographer barbier has absolutely specified sixty in a separate
dissertation soixante traductions among those even that have not
escaped the search the italian translations are said to be thirty as
to mere editions not counting the early mss for half a century before
printing was introduced those in latin amount to and those in
french to meantime it is very clear to me that this astonishing
popularity so entirely unparalleled in literature could not have
existed except in roman catholic times nor subsequently have lingered
in any protestant land it was the denial of scripture fountains
to thirsty lands which made this slender rill of scripture truth so
passionately welcome can be accurate in saying that there are no
less than sixty french versions not editions observe but separate
versions existing of the de imitatione how prodigious must have
been the adaptation of the book to the religious heart of the fifteenth
century excepting the bible but excepting that only in protestant
lands no book known to man has had the same distinction it is the most
marvellous bibliographical fact on record

 our english girls it seems are as faulty in one way as we english
males in another none of us men could have written the opera omnia
of mr à kempis neither could any of our girls have assumed male attire
like la pucelle but why because says michelet english girls and
german think so much of an indecorum well that is a good fault
generally speaking but m michelet ought to have remembered a fact in
the martyrologies which justifies both parties the french heroine for
doing and the general choir of english girls for not doing a female
saint specially renowned in france had for a reason as weighty as
joanna's viz expressly to shield her modesty among men worn a male
military harness that reason and that example authorised la pucelle
but our english girls as a body have seldom any such reason and
certainly no such saintly example to plead this excuses them yet
still if it is indispensable to the national character that our young
women should now and then trespass over the frontier of decorum it then
becomes a patriotic duty in me to assure m michelet that we have such
ardent females among us and in a long series some detected in naval
hospitals when too sick to remember their disguise some on fields
of battle multitudes never detected at all some only suspected and
others discharged without noise by war offices and other absurd
people in our navy both royal and commercial and generally from deep
remembrances of slighted love women have sometimes served in disguise
for many years taking contentedly their daily allowance of
burgoo biscuit or cannon-balls anything in short digestible or
indigestible that it might please providence to send one thing at
least is to their credit never any of these poor masks with their
deep silent remembrances have been detected through murmuring or what
is nautically understood by skulking so for once m michelet has an
erratum to enter upon the fly-leaf of his book in presentation copies

 but the last of these ebullitions is the most lively we english at
orleans and after orleans which is not quite so extraordinary if
all were told fled before the maid of arc yes says m michelet you
did deny it if you can deny it mon cher i don't mean to
deny it running away in many cases is a thing so excellent that no
philosopher would at times condescend to adopt any other step all of
us nations in europe without one exception have shown our philosophy
in that way at times even people qui ne se rendent pas have deigned
both to run and to shout sauve qui peut at odd times of sunset
though for my part i have no pleasure in recalling unpleasant
remembrances to brave men and yet really being so philosophic they
ought not to be unpleasant but the amusing feature in m michelet's
reproach is the way in which he improves and varies against us the
charge of running as if he were singing a catch listen to him they
showed their backs did these english hip hip hurrah three times
three behind good walls they let themselves be taken hip hip
nine times nine they ran as fast as their legs could carry them
hurrah twenty-seven times twenty-seven they ran before a girl
they did hurrah eighty-one times eighty-one this reminds one of
criminal indictments on the old model in english courts where for fear
the prisoner should escape the crown lawyer varied the charge perhaps
through forty counts the law laid its guns so as to rake the accused
at every possible angle while the indictment was reading he seemed a
monster of crime in his own eyes and yet after all the poor fellow
had but committed one offence and not always that n b not having
the french original at hand i make my quotations from a friend's copy
of mr walter kelly's translation which seems to me faithful spirited
and idiomatically english liable in fact only to the single reproach
of occasional provincialisms

the circumstantial incidents of the execution unless with more space
than i can now command i should be unwilling to relate i should fear
to injure by imperfect report a martyrdom which to myself appears so
unspeakably grand yet for a purpose pointing not at joanna but at m
michelet viz to convince him that an englishman is capable of thinking
more highly of la pucelle than even her admiring countrymen i shall
in parting allude to one or two traits in joanna's demeanour on the
scaffold and to one or two in that of the bystanders which authorise
me in questioning an opinion of his upon this martyr's firmness the
reader ought to be reminded that joanna d'arc was subjected to an
unusually unfair trial of opinion any of the elder christian martyrs
had not much to fear of personal rancour the martyr was chiefly
regarded as the enemy of cæsar at times also where any knowledge
of the christian faith and morals existed with the enmity that arises
spontaneously in the worldly against the spiritual but the martyr
though disloyal was not supposed to be therefore anti-national and
still less was individually hateful what was hated if anything
belonged to his class not to himself separately now joanna if hated
at all was hated personally and in rouen on national grounds hence
there would be a certainty of calumny arising against her such as
would not affect martyrs in general that being the case it would
follow of necessity that some people would impute to her a willingness
to recant no innocence could escape that now had she really
testified this willingness on the scaffold it would have argued nothing
at all but the weakness of a genial nature shrinking from the instant
approach of torment and those will often pity that weakness most who
in their own persons would yield to it least meantime there never
was a calumny uttered that drew less support from the recorded
circumstances it rests upon no positive testimony and it has a
weight of contradicting testimony to stem and yet strange to say m
michelet who at times seems to admire the maid of arc as much as i do
is the one sole writer among her friends who lends some countenance to
this odious slander his words are that if she did not utter this word
recant with her lips she uttered it in her heart whether she said
the word is uncertain but i affirm that she thought it

now i affirm that she did not not in any sense of the word thought
applicable to the case here is france calumniating la pucelle here
is england defending her m michelet can only mean that on a priori
principles every woman must be presumed liable to such a weakness that
joanna was a woman ergo that she was liable to such a weakness that
is he only supposes her to have uttered the word by an argument which
presumes it impossible for anybody to have done otherwise i on the
contrary throw the onus of the argument not on presumable tendencies of
nature but on the known facts of that morning's execution as recorded
by multitudes what else i demand than mere weight of metal absolute
nobility of deportment broke the vast line of battle then arrayed
against her what else but her meek saintly demeanour won from the
enemies that till now had believed her a witch tears of rapturous
admiration ten thousand men says m michelet himself ten thousand
men wept and of these ten thousand the majority were political enemies
knitted together by cords of superstition what else was it but her
constancy united with her angelic gentleness that drove the fanatic
english soldier who had sworn to throw a fagot on her scaffold as his
tribute of abhorrence that did so that fulfilled his vow suddenly
to turn away a penitent for life saying everywhere that he had seen
a dove rising upon wings to heaven from the ashes where she had stood
what else drove the executioner to kneel at every shrine for pardon to
his share in the tragedy and if all this were insufficient then i
cite the closing act of her life as valid on her behalf were all other
testimonies against her the executioner had been directed to apply his
torch from below he did so the fiery smoke rose upward in billowing
volumes a dominican monk was then standing almost at her side wrapped
up in his sublime office he saw not the danger but still persisted
in his prayers even then when the last enemy was racing up the fiery
stairs to seize her even at that moment did this noblest of girls think
only for him the one friend that would not forsake her and not
for herself bidding him with her last breath to care for his own
preservation but to leave her to god that girl whose latest breath
ascended in this sublime expression of self-oblivion did not utter the
word recant either with her lips or in her heart no she did not
though one should rise from the dead to swear it

 

bishop of beauvais thy victim died in fire upon a scaffold thou upon
a down bed but for the departing minutes of life both are oftentimes
alike at the farewell crisis when the gates of death are opening and
flesh is resting from its struggles oftentimes the tortured and the
torturer have the same truce from carnal torment both sink together
into sleep together both sometimes kindle into dreams when the mortal
mists were gathering fast upon you two bishop and shepherd girl when
the pavilions of life were closing up their shadowy curtains about
you let us try through the gigantic glooms to decipher the flying
features of your separate visions

the shepherd girl that had delivered france she from her dungeon
she from her baiting at the stake she from her duel with fire as she
entered her last dream saw domrémy saw the fountain of domrémy saw
the pomp of forests in which her childhood had wandered that
easter festival which man had denied to her languishing heart that
resurrection of springtime which the darkness of dungeons had
intercepted from her hungering after the glorious liberty of
forests were by god given back into her hands as jewels that had been
stolen from her by robbers with those perhaps for the minutes of
dreams can stretch into ages was given back to her by god the bliss
of childhood by special privilege for her might be created in this
farewell dream a second childhood innocent as the first but not
like that sad with the gloom of a fearful mission in the rear this
mission had now been fulfilled the storm was weathered the skirts even
of that mighty storm were drawing off the blood that she was to reckon
for had been exacted the tears that she was to shed in secret had
been paid to the last the hatred to herself in all eyes had been faced
steadily had been suffered had been survived and in her last fight
upon the scaffold she had triumphed gloriously victoriously she had
tasted the stings of death for all except this comfort from her
farewell dream she had died died amid the tears of ten thousand
enemies died amid the drums and trumpets of armies died amid peals
redoubling upon peals volleys upon volleys from the saluting clarions
of martyrs

bishop of beauvais because the guilt-burdened man is in dreams haunted
and waylaid by the most frightful of his crimes and because upon that
fluctuating mirror rising like the mocking mirrors of mirage in
arabian deserts from the fens of death-most of all are reflected the
sweet countenances which the man has laid in ruins therefore i know
bishop that you also entering your final dream saw domrémy that
fountain of which the witnesses spoke so much showed itself to your
eyes in pure morning dews but neither dews nor the holy dawn could
cleanse away the bright spots of innocent blood upon its surface by
the fountain bishop you saw a woman seated that hid her face but
as you draw near the woman raises her wasted features would domrémy
know them again for the features of her child ah but you know them
bishop well oh mercy what a groan was that which the servants
waiting outside the bishop's dream at his bedside heard from his
labouring heart as at this moment he turned away from the fountain and
the woman seeking rest in the forests afar off yet not so to escape
the woman whom once again he must behold before he dies in the forests
to which he prays for pity will he find a respite what a tumult what
a gathering of feet is there in glades where only wild deer should run
armies and nations are assembling towering in the fluctuating crowd
are phantoms that belong to departed hours there is the great english
prince regent of france there is my lord of winchester the princely
cardinal that died and made no sign there is the bishop of beauvais
clinging to the shelter of thickets what building is that which hands
so rapid are raising is it a martyr's scaffold will they burn the
child of domrémy a second time no it is a tribunal that rises to the
clouds and two nations stand around it waiting for a trial shall my
lord of beauvais sit again upon the judgment-seat and again number the
hours for the innocent ah no he is the prisoner at the bar already
all is waiting the mighty audience is gathered the court is hurrying
to their seats the witnesses are arrayed the trumpets are sounding
the judge is taking his place oh but this is sudden my lord have you
no counsel counsel i have none in heaven above or on earth beneath
counsellor there is none now that would take a brief from me all
are silent is it indeed come to this alas the time is short the
tumult is wondrous the crowd stretches away into infinity but yet i
will search in it for somebody to take your brief i know of somebody
that will be your counsel who is this that cometh from domrémy who is
she in bloody coronation robes from rheims who is she that cometh with
blackened flesh from walking the furnaces of rouen this is she the
shepherd girl counsellor that had none for herself whom i choose
bishop for yours she it is i engage that shall take my lord's brief
she it is bishop that would plead for you yes bishop she when
heaven and earth are silent

the english mail-coach


in october there appeared in blackwood's magazine an article
entitled the english mail-coach or the glory of motion there was
no intimation that it was to be continued but in december there
followed in the same magazine an article in two sections headed by a
paragraph explaining that it was by the author of the previous article
in the october number and was to be taken in connexion with that
article one of the sections of this second article was entitled the
vision of sudden death and the other dream-fugue on the above
theme of sudden death when de quincey revised the papers in for
republication in volume iv of the collective edition of his writings
he brought the whole under the one general title of the english
mail-coach dividing the text as at present into three sections or
chapters the first with the sub-title the glory of motion the second
with the sub-title the vision of sudden death and the third with the
sub-title dream-fugue founded on the preceding theme of sudden death
great care was bestowed on the revision passages that had appeared in
the magazine articles were omitted new sentences were inserted and
the language was retouched throughout masson cf as to the revision

 he had married the daughter of a duke mr john palmer a native of
bath and from about the energetic proprietor of the theatre royal
in that city had been led by the wretched state in those days of
the means of intercommunication between bath and london wand his own
consequent difficulties in arranging for a punctual succession of good
actors at his theatre to turn his attention to the improvement of the
whole system of post-office conveyance and of locomotive machinery
generally in the british islands the result was a scheme for
superseding on the great roads at least the then existing system of
sluggish and irregular stage-coaches the property of private persons
and companies by a new system of government coaches in connexion
with the post-office carrying the mails and also a regulated number of
passengers with clockwork precision at a rate of comparative speed
which he hoped should ultimately be not less than ten miles an hour the
opposition to the scheme was of course enormous coach proprietors
innkeepers the post-office officials themselves were all against
mr palmer he was voted a crazy enthusiast and a public bore
pitt however when the scheme was submitted to him recognized its
feasibility on the th of august the first mail-coach on mr
palmer's plan started from london at o'clock in the morning and
reached bristol at o'clock at night and from that day the success of
the new system was assured mr palmer himself having been appointed
surveyor and comptroller-general of the post-office took rank as an
eminent and wealthy public man m p for bath and what not and lived

married the daughter of a duke and in a footnote to that paragraph he
gives the lady's name as lady madeline gordon from an old debrett

alexander fourth duke of gordon was first married on the d of april
 to sir robert sinclair bart and next on the th of november

bia thanatos death by violence is not classical hart but the

it should be further remarked that neither of the two compounds cited

 woman's ionic form in thus using the word ionic de quincey
doubtless has in mind the character of ionic architecture with its tall
and graceful column differing from the severity of the doric on the one
hand and from the floridity of the corinthian on the other probably he
is thinking of a caryatid cf the following version of the old story of
the origin of the styles of greek architecture in vitruvius iv chap i
gwilt's translation quoted by hart they measured a man's foot and
finding its length the sixth part of his height they gave the column
a similar proportion that is they made its height six times the
thickness of the shaft measured at the base thus the doric order
obtained its proportion its strength and its beauty from the human
figure with a similar feeling they afterward built the temple of diana
but in that seeking a new proportion they used the female figure as
a standard and for the purpose of producing a more lofty effect they
first made it eight times its thickness in height under it they placed
a base after the manner of a shoe to the foot they also added volutes
to its capital like graceful curling hair hanging on each side and the
front they ornamented with cymatia and festoons in the place of hair
on the shafts they sunk channels which bear a resemblance to the folds
of a matronal garment thus two orders were invented one of a masculine
character without ornament the other bearing a character which
resembled the delicacy ornament and proportion of a female the
successors of these people improving in taste and preferring a more
slender proportion assigned seven diameters to the height of the doric
column and eight and a half to the ionic

 the endless resurrections of his love the following which masson
prints as a postscript was a part of de quincey's introduction to the
volume of the collective edition containing this piece

the english mail-coach this little paper according to my original
intention formed part of the suspiria de profundis from which for
a momentary purpose i did not scruple to detach it and to publish it
apart as sufficiently intelligible even when dislocated from its place
in a larger whole to my surprise however one or two critics not
carelessly in conversation but deliberately in print professed their
inability to apprehend the meaning of the whole or to follow the links
of the connexion between its several parts i am myself as little
able to understand where the difficulty lies or to detect any lurking
obscurity as these critics found themselves to unravel my logic
possibly i may not be an indifferent and neutral judge in such a case i
will therefore sketch a brief abstract of the little paper according
to my original design and then leave the reader to judge how far this
design is kept in sight through the actual execution

thirty-seven years ago or rather more accident made me in the dead
of night and of a night memorably solemn the solitary witness of an
appalling scene which threatened instant death in a shape the most
terrific to two young people whom i had no means of assisting except
in so far as i was able to give them a most hurried warning of their
danger but even that not until they stood within the very shadow
of the catastrophe being divided from the most frightful of deaths by
scarcely more if more at all than seventy seconds

such was the scene such in its outline from which the whole of this
paper radiates as a natural expansion this scene is circumstantially
narrated in section the second entitled the vision of sudden death

but a movement of horror and of spontaneous recoil from this dreadful
scene naturally carried the whole of that scene raised and idealised
into my dreams and very soon into a rolling succession of dreams
the actual scene as looked down upon from the box of the mail was
transformed into a dream as tumultuous and changing as a musical fugue
this troubled dream is circumstantially reported in section the third
entitled dream-fugue on the theme of sudden death what i had beheld
from my seat upon the mail the scenical strife of action and passion
of anguish and fear as i had there witnessed them moving in ghostly
silence this duel between life and death narrowing itself to a
point of such exquisite evanescence as the collision neared all these
elements of the scene blended under the law of association with
the previous and permanent features of distinction investing the mail
itself which features at that time lay st in velocity unprecedented
dly in the power and beauty of the horses dly in the official
connexion with the government of a great nation and thly in the
function almost a consecrated function of publishing and diffusing
through the land the great political events and especially the great
battles during a conflict of unparalleled grandeur these honorary
distinctions are all described circumstantially in the first or
introductory section the glory of motion the three first were
distinctions maintained at all times but the fourth and grandest
belonged exclusively to the war with napoleon and this it was
which most naturally introduced waterloo into the dream waterloo i
understand was the particular feature of the dream-fugue which my
censors were least able to account for yet surely waterloo which in
common with every other great battle it had been our special privilege
to publish over all the land most naturally entered the dream under the
licence of our privilege if not if there be anything amiss let the
dream be responsible the dream is a law to itself and as well quarrel
with a rainbow for showing or for not showing a secondary arch
so far as i know every element in the shifting movements of the dream
derived itself either primarily from the incidents of the actual scene
or from secondary features associated with the mail for example the
cathedral aisle derived itself from the mimic combination of features
which grouped themselves together at the point of approaching
collision viz an arrow-like section of the road six hundred yards
long under the solemn lights described with lofty trees meeting
overhead in arches the guard's horn again a humble instrument in
itself was yet glorified as the organ of publication for so many great
national events and the incident of the dying trumpeter who rises from
a marble bas-relief and carries a marble trumpet to his marble lips
for the purpose of warning the female infant was doubtless secretly
suggested by my own imperfect effort to seize the guard's horn and to
blow the warning blast but the dream knows best and the dream i say
again is the responsible party

there is a handsome parish church in the town
 woodstock i am told so at least for i never
saw it having scarce time when at the place to
view the magnificence blenheim its painted
halls and tapestried bowers and then return indue
season to dine in hall with my learned friend
the provost being one those occasions
on which a man wrongs himself extremely if he
lets his curiosity interfere with his punctuality i
had the church accurately described to me with
woodstock
a view to this work but as i have some reason
to doubt whether my informant had ever seen the
inside it himself i will be content to say that
it is now a handsome edifice most part which
was rebuilt forty or fifty years since although it
still contains some arches the old chantry
founded it is said by king john but it is to
this more ancient part the building that my
story refers
upon a morning in the september or
beginning october in the year being a
day appointed for a solemn thanksgiving for the
decisive victory at worcester a respectable audience
was assembled in the old chantry or chapel
 king john the condition the church
and character the audience both bore witness
to the rage civil war and the peculiar spirit 
the times the sacred edifice showed many marks
 dilapidation the windows once filled with
stained glass had been dashed to pieces with
pikes and muskets as matters and pertaining
to idolatry the carving on the readingdesk
was damaged and two fair screens beautiful
sculptured oak had been destroyed for the same
woodstock 
pithy and conclusive reason the high altar had
been removed and the gilded railing which was
once around it was broken down and carried off
the effigies several tombs were mutilated and
now lay scattered about the church
torn from their destined niche unworthy meed
 knightly counsel or heroic deed
the autumn wind piped through empty aisles in
which the remains stakes and premisses roughhewn
timber as well as a quantity scattered
hay and trampled straw seemed to intimate that
the hallowed precincts had been upon some late
emergency made the quarters a troop horse
the audience like the building was abated
in splendour none the ancient and habitual
worshippers during peaceful times were now to
 seen in their carved galleries with hands shadowing
their brows while composing their minds
to pray where their fathers had prayed and after
the same mode worship the eye the
yeoman and peasant sought in vain the tall form
 old sir henry lee ditchley as wrapped
in his laced cloak and with beard and whiskers
duly composed he moved slowly through the
woodstock
aisles followed by the faithful raastiflp or bloodhound
which in old time had saved his master by
his fidelity and which regularly followed him to
church bevis indeed fell under the proverb
which avers he is a good dog which goes to
church f for bating an occasional temptation to
warble along with the accord he behaved himself
as decorously as any the congregation and
returned as much edified perhaps as some 
them the damsels woodstock looked as
vainly for the laced cloaks jingling spurs slashed
boots and tall plumes the young cavaliers
 this and other highborn houses moving
through the streets and the churchyard with the
careless ease which indicates perhaps rather an
overweening degree selfconfidence yet shows
graceful when mingled with good humour and
courtesy the good old dames too in their
white hoods and black velvet gowns their daughters
 the cynosure neighbouring eyes 
where were they all now who when they entered
the church used to divide men's thoughts
between them and heaven but ah alice
lee so sweet so gentle so condescending in thy
woodstock

loveliness thus proceeds a contemporary annalist
whose manuscript we have deciphered
why is my story to turn upon thy fallen fortunes
 and why not rather to the period when
in the very dismounting from your palfrey you
attracted as many eyes as if an angel had descended
 as many blessings as if the benignant being
had come fraught with good tidings no
creature wert thou an idle romancers imagination
 no being fantastically bedizened with inconsistent
perfections thy merits made me love
thee well and for thy faults i think they made
me love thee better
with the house lee had disappeared from
the chantry king john others gentle blood
and honoured lineage freemantles winklecomes
drycotts c for the air that blew over
the towers oxford was unfavourable to the
growth puritanism which was more general
in the neighbouring counties there were among
the congregation however one or two that by
their habits and demeanour seemed country gentlemen
 consideration and there were also present
some the notables the town woodstock
cutlers or glovers chiefly whose skill in
 woodstock
steel or leather had raised them to a comfortable
livelihood these dignitaries wore long black
cloaks plaited close at the neck and like peaceful
citizens carried their bibles and membrane
at their girdles instead knife or
sword this respectable but least numerous
part the audience were such decent persons as
had adopted the presbyterian form faith renouncing
the liturgy and hierarchy the church
 england and using under the tuition the
rev nehemiah holdenough much famed for the
length and strength his powers predication
with these grave seniors sate their goodly dames
in ruff and gorget like the portraits which in
catalogues paintings are designed wife a
burghmaster and their pretty daughters whose
study like that chaucers physician was not
always in the bible but who were on the contrary
when a glance could escape the vigilance
 their honoured mothers inattentive themselves
and the cause inattention in others
but besides these dignified persons there
were in the church a numerous collection the
lower orders some brought thither by curiosity
but many them unwashed artificers bee

woodstock 
wintered in the theological discussions the
time and as many various sects as there are
colours in the rainbow the presumption 
these learned thebes being in exact proportion
to their ignorance the last was total and the first
boundless their behaviour in the church was
anything but reverential or edifying most 
them affected a cynical contempt for all that was
only held sacred by human sanction the church
was to these men but a steeplehouse the clergyy
man an ordinary person her ordinances dry
bran and sapless pottage unfitted for the spiritualized
palates the saints and the prayer an
address to heaven to which each acceded or not
as in his too critical judgment he conceived fit
the elder amongst them sate or lay on the
benches with their high steeplecrowned hats
pulled over their severe and knitted brows waiting
for the presbyterian parson as mastiffs sit
in dumb expectation the bull that is to be
brought to the stake the younger mixed some
 them a bolder licence manners with their
heresies they gazed round on the women yawned
coughed and whispered eat apples and cracked
woodstock
ed nuts as if in the gallery a theatre ere the
piece commences
besides all these the congregation contained
a few soldiers some in corslet and steel caps
some in buff and others in red coats these men
 war had their chandeliers with ammunition
slung round them and rested on their pikes and
muskets they too had their peculiar doctrines
on the most difficult points religion and united
the extravagances enthusiasm with the most
determined courage and resolution in the field
the burghers woodstock looked on these
military saints with no small degree awe for
though not often sullied with deeds plunder
or cruelty they had the power both absolutely
in their hands and the peaceful citizens had
no alternative save submission to whatever the
illregulated and enthusiastic imaginations their
martial guides might suggest
after some time spent in waiting for him mr
holdenough began to walk up the aisles the
chapel not with the slow and dignified carriage
with which the old rector was yore wont to
maintain the dignity the surplice but with a
woodstock 
hasty step like one who arrives too late at an appointment
and bustles forward to make the best
use his time he was a tall thin man with
an adust complexion and the vivacity his eye
indicated some irascibility temperament his
dress was brown not black and over his other
vestments he wore in honour calvin a geneva
cloak a blue colour which fell backward from
his shoulders as he posted on to the pulpit his
grizzled hair was cut as short as shears could perform
the feat and covered with a black silk skullcap
which stuck so close to his head that the two
ears expanded from under it as if they had been
intended as handles by which to lift the whole
person moreover the worthy divine wore spectacles
and a long grizzled peaked beard and he
carried in his hand a small pocketbible with silver
clasps upon arriving at the pulpit he
paused a moment to take breath then began to
ascend the steps by two at a time
but his course was arrested by a strong hand
which seized his cloak it was that one who
had detached himself from the group soldiery
he was a stout man middle stature with a
woodstock
quick eye and a countenance which though plain
had yet an expression that fixed the attention
his dress though not strictly military partook 
that character he wore large hose made 
calvesleather and a tuck as it was then called or
rapier tremendous length balanced on the
other side by a dagger the belt was morocco
garnished with pistols
the minister thus intercepted in his duty
faced round upon the party who had seized him
and demanded in no gentle tone the meaning 
the interruption
friend quoth the intruder is it thy purpose
to hold forth to these good people 
ay marry is it said the clergyman and
such is my bounden duty woe to me if i preach
not the gospel prithee friend let me not in my
labour
nay said the man warlike mien i am
myself minded to hold forth therefore do thou
desist or if thou wilt do by mine advice remain
and fructify with those poor goslings to whom i
am presently about to shake forth the crumbs 
comfortable doctrines
woodstock 
give place thou man satan said the
priest waxing wroth respect mine order my
cloth
i see no more to respect in the cut thy
cloak or in the cloth which it is fashioned
said the other than thou didst in the bishop's
rocket they were black and white thou art blue
and brown sleeping dogs every one you
lying down loving to slumber shepherds that
starve the flock but will not watch it each looking
to his own gain hum
scenes this indecent kind were so common
at the time that no one thought interfering
 the congregation looked on in silence the
better class scandalized and the lower orders
some laughing and others backing the soldier or
minister as their fancy dictated meantime the
struggle waxed fiercer mr holdenough clamoured
for assistance
mr mayor woodstock he exclaimed
wilt thou be among those wicked magistrates
who bear the sword in vain citizens will you
not help your pastor worthy aldermen will
you see me strangled on the pulpit stairs by this
 woodstock
man bufl'and belial but lo i will overcome
him and cast his cords from me
as holdenough spoke he struggled to ascend
the pulpit stairs holding hard on the bannisters
his tormentor held fast by the skirts the cloak
which went nigh to the choking the wearer
until as he spoke the words last mentioned
in a halfstrangled voice mr holdenough dexterously
slipped the string which tied it round
his neck so that the garment suddenly gave
way the soldier fell backwards down the steps
and the liberated divine skipped into his pulpit
and began to give forth a psalm triumph
over his prostrate adversary but a great hubbub
in the church marred his triumph and although
he and his faithful clerk continued to sing the
hymn victory their notes were only heard by
fits like the whistle a curled during a gale 
wind
the cause the tumult was as follows the
mayor was a zealous presbyterian and witnessed
the intrusion the soldier with great indignation
from the very beginning though he hesitated to
interfere with an armed man while on his legs and
woodstock 
capable resistance but no sooner did he behold
the champion independency sprawling on
his back with the diviners geneva cloak fluttering
in his hands than the magistrate rushed forward
exclaiming that such insolence was not to be
endured and ordered his constables to seize the
prostrate champion proclaiming in the magnanimity
 wrath i will commit every redcoat 
them all i will commit him were he noll cromwell
himself
the worthy mayor's indignation had overmastered
his reason when he made this mistimed
vaunt for three soldiers who had hitherto stood
motionless like statues made each a stride in
advance which placed them betwixt the municipal
officers and the soldier who was in the act 
arising then making at once the movement 
resting arms according to the manual as then practised
their musketbutts rang on the church pavement
within an inch the gouty toes master
mayor the energetic magistrate whose efforts
in favour order were thus checked cast one
glance on his supporters but that was enough to
show him that force was not on his side all
had shrunk back on hearing that ominous clatter
 woodstock
 stone and iron he was obliged to descend to
expostulation
what do you mean my masters said he 
is it like a decent and godfearing soldiery
who have wrought such things for the land as
have never before been heard to brawl and
riot in the church or to aid abet and comfort a
profane fellow who hath upon a solemn thanksgiving
excluded the minister from his own pulpits

we have nought to do with thy church as
thou call'st it said he who by a small feather
in front his morion appeared to be the corporal
 the party we see not why men gifts
should not be heard within these citadels superstition
as well as the voice the men crape
 old and the men cloak now wherefore
we will pluck yon jack presbyter out his
wooden sentinelbox and our own watchman shall
relieve the guard and mount thereon and cry
aloud and spare not
nay gentlemen said the mayor if such
be your purpose we have not the means to withstand
you being as you see peaceful and quiet
woodstock 
men but let me first speak with this worthy minister
nehemiah holdenough to persuade him
to yield up his place for the time without farther
scandal
the peacemaking mayor then interrupted
the quavering holdenough and the clerk and
prayed both to retire else there would he said
be certainly strife
 strife replied the presbyterian divine
with scorn no fear strife among men that
dare not testify against this open profanation 
the church and daring display heresy would
your neighbours banbury have brooked such
an insult 
come come mr holdenough said the
mayor put us not to mutiny and cry clubs
i tell you once more we are not men war or
blood
not more than may be drawn by the point
 a needle said the preacher scornfully ye
tailors woodstock for what is a glover buta
tailor working on kidskin i forsake you in
scorn your faint hearts and feeble hands and
will seek me elsewhere a flock which will not fly
vol i b
 woodstock
from their shepherd at the braying the first
wild ass which cometh from out the great deserts

so saying the aggrieved divine departed from
his pulpit and shaking the dust from his shoes
left the church as hastily as he had entered it
though for a different reason the citizens saw
his retreat with sorrow and not without a compunctious
feeling as if they were not playing the
most courageous part in the world the mayor
himself and several others left the church to follow
and appease him
the independent orator late prostrate was
now triumphant and inducting himself into the
pulpit without farther ceremony he pulled a
bible from his pocket and selected his text
from the fortyfifth psalm gird thy sword
upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory
and thy majesty and in thy majesty ride prosperously
 upon this theme he commenced one
 those wild declamations common at the period
in which men were accustomed to wrest
and pervert the language scripture by adapting
it to modern events the language which
in its literal sense was applied to king david
woodstock 
and typically referred to the coming the
messiah was in the opinion the military
orator most properly to be interpreted oliver
cromwell the victorious general the infant
commonwealth which was never destined
to come age gird on thy sword exclaimed
the preacher emphatically and was not
that a pretty bit steel as ever dangled from a
corslet or rung against a steel saddle ay ye
prick up your ears now ye cutlers woodstock
as if ye should know something a good
fox broadsword did you forge it i trowel was
the steel quenched with water from rosamond's
well or the blade blessed by the old cuckolds
 godson you would have us think i
warrant me that you wrought it and welded
it grinned and polished it and all the while it
never came on a woodstock stithy you were
all too busy making whittles for the lazy crapemen
 oxford bouncing priests whose eyes
were so closed up with fat that they could not
see destruction till she had them by the throat
but t can tell you where the sword was forged
and tempered and welded and grinned and
 woodstock
polished when you were as i said before making
whittles for false priests and daggers for
dissolute g d d nme cavaliers to cut the people
 england's throat with it was forged at
long marston moor where blows went faster
than ever rung hammer on anvil and it was tempered
at naseby in the best blood the cavaliers
 and it was welded in ireland against the
walls drogheda and it was grinned on scottish
lives at dunbar and now late it was
polished in worcester till it shines as bright as
the sun in the middle heaven and there is no
light in england that shall come nigh unto it
here the military part the congregation raised
a hum approbation which being a sound
ike the hear hear the british house 
commons was calculated to heighten the enthusiasm
 the orator by intimating the sympathy
 the audience and then resumed the
preacher rising in energy as he found that his
audience partook in these feelings what sayeth
the text ride on prosperously do not stop 
do not call a halt do not quit the saddle pursue
the scattered fliers sound the trumpet not
woodstock j
a levant or a flourish but a point war sound
boot and saddle to horse and away a charge i
follow after the young man what part have
we in him slay take destroy divide the spoil 
blessed art thou oliver on account thine honour
 thy cause is clear thy call is undoubted
never has defeat come near thy leading staff nor
disaster attended thy banner ride on flower 
england's soldiers ride on chosen leader 
god's champions gird up the loins thy resolution
and be steadfast to the mark thy high
calling 
another deep and stern hum echoed by the
ancient elbowed arches the old chantry gave
him an opportunity an instant's repose when
the people woodstock heard him and not
without anxiety turn the stream his oratory
into another channel
but wherefore ye people woodstock
do i say these things to you who claim no portion
in our david no interest in england's son
 jesse you who were fighting as well as
your might could and it was not very formidable
for the late man under that old bloodthirsty pawoodstock

past sir jacob aston are you not now plotting
or ready to plot for restoring as ye call it the
young man the unclean son the slaughtered
tyrant the fugitive after whom the true hearts
 england are now following that they may
take and slay him why should your rider
turn his bridle our way say you in your hearts 
we will none him if we may help ourselves
we will rather turn us to wallow in the mire 
monarchy with the sow that was washed but new
lys come men woodstock i will ask and
do you answer me hunger ye still after the
fleshpots the monks godson and ye will
say nay but wherefore except that the pots
are cracked and broken and the fire is extinguished
wherewith thy oven used to boil and again
i ask drink ye still the well the fornications
 the fair rosamond eye will say nay but
wherefore 
here the orator ere he could answer the question
in his own way was surprised by the following
reply very pithily pronounced by one the
congregation because you and the like 
you have left us no brandy to mix with it
woodstock 
all eyes turned to the audacious speaker who
stood beside one the thick sturdy saxon pillars
which he himself somewhat resembled being
short stature but very strongly made a squat
broad littlejohn sort figure leaning on a
quarterstaff and wearing a jerkin which though
now sorely stained and discoloured had once been
 the lincoln green and showed remnants 
having been laced there was an air careless
goodhumoured audacity about the fellow and
though under military restraint there were some
 the citizens who could not help crying out
well said joceline johffe
jolly joceline call ye him proceeded the
preacher without showing either confusion or displeasure
at the interruption i will make him
joceline the jail if he interrupts me again
one your parkkeepers i warrant that can
never forget they have borne c r upon their
badges and buglehorns even as a dog bears his
owner's name on his collar a pretty emblem for
christian men but the brute beast hath the
better him the brute heareth his own coat
and the caitiff thrall wears his master's i have
 woodstock
seen such a wag make a rope's wag ere now
where was i oh rebuking you for your
backsliding men woodstock yes then
ye will say ye have renounced popery and ye have
renounced prelacy and then ye wipe your mouth
like pharisees as ye are and who but you for
purity religion but i tell you ye are but
like jehu the son nisi who broke down the
house baal yet departed not from the sons 
jeroboam even so ye eat not fish on friday with
the blinded papists nor mincedpies on the twen
tyfifth day december like the slothful relations
but ye will gorge on sack posset each
night in the year with your blind presbyterian
guide and ye will speak evil dignities and
revile the commonwealth and ye will glorify
yourselves in your park woodstock and say
was it not walled in first any other in england
and that by henry son william called 
the conqueror and ye have a princely lodge
therein and call the same a royal lodge and
ye have an oak which ye call the king's oak and
ye steal and eat the venison the park and ye
say this is the king's venison we will wash it
woodstock 
down with a cup to the king's health better we
eat it than those roundheaded commonwealth
knaves but listen unto me and take warning
for these things come we to controversy with
you and our name shall be a cannonshot
before which your lodge in the pleasantness
whereof ye take pastime shall be blown into
ruins and we will be as a wedge to split asunder
the king's oak into billets to heat a brown baker's
oven and we will spark your park and
slay your deer and eat them ourselves neither
shall you have any portion thereof whether
in neck or haunch ye shall not haft a tenpenny
knife with the horns thereof neither shall
ye cut a pair breeches out the hide for all
ye be cutlers and glovers and ye shall have
no comfort or support neither from the sequestrated
traitor henry lee who called himself ranger
 woodstock nor from any on his behalf
for they are coming hither who shall be called
mahershalalhashbaz because he maketh haste
to the spoil
here ended this wild effusion the latter part
 which fell heavy on the souls the poor citie
woodstock 
sens woodstock as tending to confirm a
report an unpleasing nature which had been
lately circulated the communication with london
was indeed slow and the news which it transmitted
were uncertain no less uncertain were the
times themselves and the rumours which were
circulated exaggerated by the hopes and fears
 so many various factions but the general
stream report so far as woodstock was concerned
had late run uniformly in one direction
day after day they had been informed that the
fatal fiat parliament had gone out for selling
the park woodstock destroying its lodge
dispersing its forest and crazing as far as they
could be crazed all traces its ancient fame
many the citizens were likely to be sufferers on
this occasion as several them enjoyed either
by sufferance or right various convenient privileges
 pasturage cutting fire wood and the like
in the royal chase and all the inhabitants the
little borough were hurt to think that the scenery
 the place was to be destroyed its edifices ruined
and its honours rent away this is a patriotic
sensation often found in such places which
woodstock 
ancient distinctions and longcherished recollect
tions former days render so different from
towns recent date the natives woodstock
felt it in the fullest force they had trembled at
the anticipated calamity but now when it was
announced by the appearance those dark stern
and at the same time omnipotent soldiers now
that they heard it proclaimed by the mouth 
one their military preachers they considered
their fate as inevitable the causes disagreement
among themselves were for the time forgotten
as the congregation dismissed without psalmody
or benediction went slowly and mournfully
homeward each to his own place abode
chapter 
come forth old man thy daughter's side
is now the fitting place for thee 
when time hath quelle the oak's bold pride
the youthful tendril yet may hide
the ruins the parent tree
when the sermon was ended the military
orator wiped his brow for notwithstanding the
coolness the weather he was heated with the
vehemence his speech and action he then descended
from the pulpit and spoke a word or two
to the corporal who commanded the party soldiers
who replying by a sober nod intelligence
drew his men together and marched them
in order to their quarters in the town
the preacher himself as if nothing extraordinary
had happened left the church and sauntered
through the streets woodstock with the
air a stranger who was viewing the town withwoodstock

out seeming to observe that he was himself in his
turn anxiously surveyed by the citizens whose
furtive yet frequent glances seemed to regard him
as something alike suspected and dreadful yet
on no account to be provoked he heeded them
not but stalked on in the manner affected by the
distinguished fanatics the day a stiff solemn
pace a severe and at the same time a contemplative
look like that a man incensed at the interruptions
which earthly objects forced upon
him obliging him by their intrusion to withdraw
his thoughts for an instant from celestial things
innocent pleasures what kind soever they held
in suspicion and contempt and innocent mirth
they abominated it was however a cast mind
that formed men for great and manly action as
it adopted principle and that an unselfish character
for the ruling motive instead the gratification
 passion some these men were indeed
hypocrites using the cloak religion only as a
covering for their ambition but many really possessed
the devotional character and the severe
republican virtue which others only affected by
far the greater number hovered between these
 woodstock
extremes felt to a certain extent the power 
religion and complied with the times in affecting
a great deal
the individual whose pretensions to sanctity
written as they were upon his brow and gait have
given rise to the above digression reached at
length the extremity the principal street
which terminates upon the park woodstock
a battlemented portal gothic appearance defended
the entrance to the avenue it was 
mixed architecture but on the whole though
composed the styles different ages when
it had received additions had a striking and
imposing effect an immense gate composed 
rails hammered iron with many a flourish and
scroll displaying as its uppermost ornament the
illfated cypher c r was now decayed partly
with rust partly from the effects violence
the stranger paused as if uncertain whether
he should demand or assay entrance he looked
through the grating down an avenue skirted by
majestic oaks which led onward with a gentle
curve as if into the depths some ample and ancient
forest the wicket the large iron gate being
woodstock 
left unwittingly open the soldier was tempted to
enter yet with some hesitation as he that intrudes
upon ground which he conjectures may be prohibited
 indeed his manner showed more reverence
for the scene than could have been expected
from his condition and character he slackened
his stately and consequential pace and at
length stood still and looked around him
not far from the gate he saw rising from the
trees one or two ancient and venerable turrets
bearing each its own vane rare device glittering
in the autumn sun these indicated the
ancient hunting seat or lodge as it was called
which had since the time henry been occasionally
the residence the english monarchs
when it pleased them to visit the woods oxford
which then so abounded with game that according
to old fuller huntsmen and falconers
were nowhere better pleased the situation which
the lodge occupied was a piece flat ground now
planted with sycamores not far from the entrance
to that magnificent spot where the spectator first
stops to gaze upon blenheim to think marls
woodstock
borough's victories and to applaud or criticise
the cumbrous magnificence hamburgh's style
there too paused our military preacher but
with other thoughts and for other purpose than
to admire the scene around him it was not long
afterwards when he beheld two persons a male
and a female approaching slowly and so deeply
engaged in their own conversation that they did
not raise their eyes to observe that there stood a
stranger in the path before them the soldier
took advantage their state abstraction and
desirous at once to watch their motions and avoid
their observation he glided beneath one the
huge trees which skirted the path and whose
boughs sweeping the ground on every side insured
him against discovery unless in case an
actual search
in the meantime the gentleman and lady continued
to advance directing their course to a rustic
seat which still enjoyed the sunbeams and
was placed adjacent to the tree where the stranger
was concealed
the man was elderly yet seemed bent more
woods took 
by sorrow and infirmity than by the weight 
years he wore a mourning cloak over a dress
 the same melancholy colour cut in that picturesque
form which vandyke has rendered immortal
but although the dress was handsome
it was put on and worn with a carelessness which
showed the mind the wearer ill at ease his
aged yet still handsome countenance had the
same air consequence which distinguished his
dress and his gait a striking part his appearance
was a long white beard which descended
far over the breast his slashed doublet and
looked singular from its contrast jn colour with
his habit
the young lady by whom this venerable gentleman
seemed to be in some degree supported
as they walked arm in arm was a slight and
sylphlike form with a person so delicately made
and so beautiful in countenance that it seemed
the earth on which she walked was too grossly massive
a support for a creature so aerial but mortal
beauty must share human sorrows the eyes 
the beautiful being showed tokens tears her
colour was heightened as she listened to her aged
vol i c 
 woodstock
companion and it was plain from his melancholy
yet displeased look that the conversation was as
distressing to himself as to her when they sate
down on the bench we have mentioned the gentleman's
discourse could be distinctly overheard
by the evesdropping soldier but the answers 
the young lady reached his ear rather less distinctly

it is not to be endured said the old man
passionately it would stir up a paralytic
wretch to start up a soldier my people have
been thinned i grant you or have fallen off
from me in these times i owe them no grudge
for it poor knaves what should they do when
the pantry has no bread and the buttery no ale 
but we have still about us some rugged foresters
 the old woodstock breed old as myself most
 them what that old wood seldom warps
in the wetting i will hold out the old house
and it will not be the first time that i have held
it against ten times the strength that we hear
 now immml
alas my dear father said the young
lady in a tone which seemed to intimate his proposal
 defence to be altogether desperate
woodstock 
and why alas said the gentleman angrily 
is it because i shut my door on a score or two
 these bloodthirsty hypocrites 
but their masters can as easily send a regiment
or an army if they wills replied the lady 
and what good would your present defence do
excepting to exasperate them to your utter destruction

be it so alice replied her father i have
lived my time and beyond it i have outlived
the kindest and most princelike masters
what do i do on the earth since the dismal
thirtieth january the parricide that day
was a signal to all true servants charles stuart
to avenge his death or die as soon after as they
could find a worthy opportunity
do not speak thus sir said alice lee 
it does not become your gravity and your
worth to throw away that life which may yet be
 service to your king and country it will not
and cannot always be thus england will not
long endure the rulers which these bad times
have assigned her in the meanwhile here
a few words escaped the listener's ears and
 woodstock
beware that impatience which makes bad
worse
worse exclaimed the impatient old man
what can be worse is it not at the worst already
 will not these people expel us from the
only shelter we have left dilapidate what remains
 royal property under my charge make the
palace princes into a den thieves and then
wipe their mouths and thank god as if they had
done an alms deed 
still said his daughter there is hope behind
and i trust the king is ere this out their
reach we have reason to think well my brow
ther albert's safety
ay albert there again said the old man
in a tone reproach had it not been for thy
entreaties i had gone to worcester myself but
i must needs lie here like a worthless hound
when the hunt is up when who knows what service
i might have shown an old man's head is
sometimes useful when his arm is but little worth
but you and albert were so desirous that he
should go alone and now who can say what has
become him 
woodstock 
 nay nay father said alice we have
good hope that albert escaped from that fatal
day young abney saw him a mile from the field
young abney lied i believe said the father
in the same humour contradiction 
 young abney's tongue seems quicker than his
hands but far slower than his horse's heels when
he leaves the roundheads behind him i would
rather albert's dead body were laid between
charles and cromwell than hear he fled as early
as young abney
my dearest father said the young lady
weeping as she spoke what can i say to comfort
you 
comfort me say'st thou girl i am sick 
comfort an honourable death with the ruins 
woodstock for my monument were the only
comfort to old henry lee yes by the memory
 my father i will make good the lodge against
these rebellious robbers
 yet be ruled dearest father said the maiden
 and submit to that which we cannot gainsay
my uncle everard 
here the old man caught at her unfinished
 woodstock
words thy uncle everard wench well get
on what thy precious and loving uncle
everard 
nothing sir she said if the subject displeases
you
 displeases me he replied why should it
displease me or if it did why should'st thou
or any one affect to care about it what is it
that hath happened late years what is it can
be thought to happen that astrologer can guess at
which can give pleasure to us 
fate she replied may have in store the
joyful restoration our banished prince
too late for my time alice said the knight
 if there be such a white page in the heavenly
 it will not be turned until long after my
day but i see thou wouldn't escape me in a
word what thy uncle everard 
nay sir said alice god knows i would
rather be silent for ever than speak what might
as you would take it add to your present distemperature

distemperature said her father oh thou
art a sweetlipped physician and would'st i warwoodstock
s
rant me drop nought but sweet balm and ho 
ney and oil on my distemperature if that is
the phrase for an old man's ailment when he is
well nigh heartbroken once more what thy
uncle everard 
his last words were uttered in a high and
peevish tone voice and alice lee answered
her father in a trembling and submissive tone
i only meant to say sir that i am well assured
that my uncle everard when we quit this
place 
that is to say when we are kicked out it
by cropeared canting villains like himself but
on with thy bountiful uncle what will he do 
will he give us the remains his worshipful
and economical housekeeping the fragments 
a thricesacked capon twice aweek and a plentiful
fast on the other aye days will he give us
beds beside his half starved nags and put them
under a short allowance straw that his sister's
husband that i should have called my deceased
angel by such a name and his sister's daughter
may not sleep on the stones or will he send usa
noble each with a warning to make it last for
 woodstock
he had never known the readypenny so hard to
come by or what else will your uncle everard
do for us get us a furlough to beg why i
can do that without him
 you misconstrue him much answered alice
with more spirit than she had hitherto displayed 
and would you but question your own heart
you would acknowledge i speak with reverence
that your tongue utters what your better judgment
would disown my uncle everard is neither
a miser nor a hypocrite neither so fond the
goods this world that he would not supply our
distresses amply nor so wedded to fanatical opinions
as to exclude charity for other sects beside
his own
 ay ay the church england is a sect
with him i doubt not and perhaps with thee too
alice said the knight what is a muggles
man or a ranter or a brownish but a sectary 
and thy phrase places them all with jack presbyter
himself on the same footing with our learned
prelates and religious clergy such is the cant
 the day thou livest in and why shouldst thou
not talk like one the wise virgins and psalmwoodstock

singing sisters since though thou hast a profane
old cavalier for a father thou art own niece to
uncle everard 
if you speak thus my dear fathers said
alice what can i answer you hear me but
one patient word and i shall have discharged my
uncle everard's commissions
oh it is a commission then surely i suspected
so much from the beginning nay have
some sharp guess touching the ambassador also
come madam do your errand and you shall
have no reason to complain my patience
then sir replied his daughter my uncle
everard desires you would be courteous to the
commissioners who come here to sequestrate the
parks and the property or at least heedfully to
abstain from giving them obstacle or opposition 
it can he says do no good even on your own
principles and it will give a pretext for proceeding
against you as one in the worst degree 
malignity which he thinks may otherwise be
prevented nay he has good hope that if you
follow his counsel the committee may through
the interest he possesses be inclined to remove the
 woodstock
sequestration your estate on a moderate fine
thus says my uncle and having communicated
his advice i have no occasion to urge your patience
with farther argument
it is well thou dost not alice answered sir
henry lee in a tone suppressed anger forby
the blessed rood thou hast well nigh led me
into the heresy thinking thee no daughter
 mine ah my beloved companion who art
now far from the sorrows and cares this weary
world could'st thou have thought that the daughter
thou didst clasp to thy bosom would like the
wicked wife job become a temptress to her father
in the hour affliction and recommend to
him to make his conscience truckle to his interest
and to beg back at the bloody hands his master's
and perhaps his son's murderers a wretched
remnant his property he has been robbed 
why wench if i must beg think'st thou i will
sue to those who have made me a mendicant na
i will never show my grey beard worn in sorrow
for my sovereign's death to move the compassion
 some proud sequestrator who perhaps was one
 the parricides no if henry lde must sue
woodstock 
for food it shall be some sound loyalist like
himself who having but half a loaf remaining will
not nevertheless refuse to share it with him for
his daughter she may wander her own way
which leads her to a refuge with her wealthy
roundhead kinsfolk but let her no more call
him father whose honest indigence she has refused
to share 
you do me injustice sir answered the
young lady with a voice animated yet faltering
 cruel injustice god knows your way is my
way though it lead to ruin and beggary and
while you tread it my arm shall support you while
you will accept an aid so feeble
 thou worst me girl answered the old
cavalier thou worst me as will shakspeare
says thou speaks lending me thy arm but
thy secret thought is thyself to hang upon markham
everard's
my father my father answered alice in a
tone deep grief what can thus have altered
your clear judgment and kindly heart accursed
be these civil commotions not only do they
destroy men's bodies but they pervert their souls
 woodstock
and the brave the noble the generous become
suspicious harsh and mean why upbraid me
with markham everard have i seen or spoke
with him since you discharged him my company
with terms less kind i will speak it truly than
was due even to the relationship betwixt you 
why think i would sacrifice to that young man
my duty to you know that were i capable 
such criminal weakness markham everard were
the first to despise me for it
she put her handkerchief to her eyes but she
could not hide her sobs nor conceal the distress
they intimated the old man was moved
i cannot tell he said what to think it
thou seem'st sincere and wert ever a good and
kindly daughter how thou hast let that rebel
youth creep into thy heart i wot not perhaps it
is a punishment on me who thought the loyalty 
my house was like undefiled ermine yet here
is a damned spot and on the fairest gem all 
my own dear alice but do not weep we have
enough to vex us where is it that shakspeare
hath it 
woodstock 
gentle daughter
give even way unto ray rough affairs 
put you not on the temper the times
nor be like them to percy troublesome 
i am glad to hear you quote your favourite
again sir our little jars are ever well nigh
ended when shakspeare comes in play
his was the closetcompanion my
blessed master said sir henry lee after the
bible with reverence for naming them together
he felt more comfort in it than any other and
as i have shared his disease why it is natural i
should take his medicine albeit i pretend not
to my master's art in explaining the dark passages
 for i am but a rude man and rustically
brought up to arms and hunting
you have seen shakspeare sir said the
yoimg lady
silly wench replied the knight he died
when i was a mere child thou hast heard me
say so twenty times but thou would'st lead the
old man away from the tender subject well
though i am not blind i can shut my eyes and
follow ben jonson i knew and could tell thee
many a tale our meetings at the mermaid
 woodstock
where if there was much wine there was much
wit also we did not sit blowing tobacco in
each other's faces and turning up the whites 
our eyes as we turned up the bottom the winepot
old ben adopted me as one his sons in
the muses i have shown you have i not the
verses to my much beloved son the worshipful
sir henry lee ditchley knight and baronet
 
i do not remember them at present sir replied
alice
i fear ye lie wench said her father but
no matter thou can'st not get any more fooling
out me just now the evil spirit hath left
saul for the present we are now to think what
is to be done about leaving woodstock or defending
it
my dearest father said alice can you
still nourish a moment's hope making good the
place r
i know not wench replied sir henry i
would fain have a parting blow at them tis certain
 and who knows where a blessing may alight 
but then my poor knaves that must take part
woodstock 
with me in so hopeless a quarrel that thought
hampers me i confesses
oh let it do so sir replied alice there
are soldiers in the town and there are three regiments
at oxford
ah poor oxford exclaimed sir henry
whose vacillating state mind was turned by
a word to any new subject that suggested itself
 seat learning and loyalty these rude
soldiers are unfit inmates for thy learned halls
and poetical bowers but thy pure and brilliant
lamp shall defy the foul breath a thousand
churls were they to blow at it like boreas the
burning bush shall not be consumed even by the
heat this persecution
true sir said alice and it may not be
useless to recollect that any stirring the royalists
at this unpropitious moment will make them
deal yet more harshly with the university which
they consider as being at the bottom everything
which moves for the king in these parts
 it is true wench replied the knight and
small cause would make the villains sequestrate
the poor remains which the civil wars have left to
 
 woodstock
the colleges that and the risk my poor fellows
 well thou hast disarmed me girl i
will be as patient and calm as a martyr
pray god you keep your word sir replied
his daughter but you are ever so much moved
at the sight any these men that 
 would you make a child me alice 
said sir henry why know you not that i
can look upon a viper or a toad or a bunch 
engendering adders without any worse feeling
than a little disgust and though a roundhead
and especially a redcoat are in my opinion more
poisonous than vipers more loathsome than toads
more hateful than knotted adders yet can i overcome
my nature so far that should one them
appear at this moment thyself should see how
civilly i would entreat him
as he spoke the military preacher abandoned
his leafy screen and stalking forward stood unexpectedly
before the old cavalier who stared at
him as if he had thought that his expressions had
actually raised a devil
who art thou at length said sir henry
in a raised and angry voice while his daughter
woodstock 
clung to this arm in terror little confident that
her father's pacific resolutions would abide the
shock this unwelcome apparition
i am ones replied the soldier who neither
fear nor shame to call myself a poor daylabourer
in the great work england humph ay a
simple and sincere upholder the good old
cause
 and what the devil do you seek here said
the old knight fiercely
the welcome due to the steward the lords
commissioners answered the soldier
welcome art thou as salt would be to sore
eyes said the cavalier but who be your commissioners
man 
the soldier with little courtesy held out a
scroll which sir henry took from him betwixt
his finger and thumb as if it were a letter from a
pesthouse and held it at as much distance from
his eyes as his purpose reading it would permit
he then read aloud and as he named the
parties one by one he added a short commentary
on each name addressed indeed to alice but in
vol i d
 woodstock
such a tone that showed he cared not for its being
heard by the soldier
desboroitgh the ploughman dosborough 
as grovelling a clown as is in england a fellow
that would be best at home like an ancient scythian
under the tilt a waggon d n him
harrison a bloodyminded ranting enthusiast
who read the bible to such purpose that he never
lacked a text to justify a murder d n him too
bletson a trueblue commonwealth's man one
 harrison's rota club with his noddle full 
newfangled notions about government the clearest
object which is to establish the tail upon
the head a fellow who leaves you the statutes
and laws old england to prate rome and
greece sees the areopagus in westminsterhall
and takes old noll for a roman consul 
add he is like to prove a dictator amongst
them instead never mind d n bletson too
friend said the soldier i would willingly
be civil but it consists not with my duty to
hear these godly men in whose service i am
spoken after this irreverent and unbecoming
fashion and albeit i know that you malignant
woodstock 
think you have a right to make free with that
damnation which you seem to use as your own
portion yet it is superfluous to invoke it against
others who have better hopes in their thoughts
and better words in their mouths
thou art but a canting varlet replied the
knight and yet thou art right in some sense 
for it is superfluous to curse men who already are
damned as black as the smoke hell itself
i prithee forbear continued the soldier
for manners sake if not for conscience grisly
oaths suit ill with gray beards
nay that is truth if the devil spoke it said
the knight and i thank heaven i can follow
good counsel though old nick gives it and so
friend touching these same commissioners bear
them this message that sir henry lee is keeper
 woodstock park with right waif and stray
vert and venison as complete as any them have
to their estate that is if they possess any estate
but what they have gained by plundering honest
men nevertheless he will give place to those
who have made their might their right and will
 woodstock
not expose the lives good and true men where
the odds are so much against them and he
protests that he makes this surrender neither as
acknowledging these so termed commissioners
nor as for his own individual part fearing their
force but purely to avoid the loss english
blood which so much hath been spilt in these
late times
it is well spoken said the steward the
commissioners and therefore i pray you let
us walk together into the house that thou may'st
deliver up unto me the vessels and gold and silver
ornaments belonging unto the egyptian pharaoh
who committed them to thy keeping
 what vessels exclaimed the fiery old
knight and belonging to whom unbaptized
dog speak civil the martyr in my presence
or i will do a deed misbecoming me on that
caitiff corpse thine and shaking his daughter
from his right arm the old man laid his hand
on his rapier
his antagonist on the contrary kept his temper
completely and waving his hand to add impression
woodstock s
to his speech he said with a calmness which aggravated
sir henry's wrath nay good friend
i prithee be still and brawl not sit becomes not
gray hairs and feeble arms to rail and rant like
drunkards put me not to use the carnal weapon
in mine own defence but listen to the voice 
reason see'st thou not that the lord hath decided
this great controversy in favour us and
ours against thee and thine wherefore render
up thy stewardship peacefully and deliver up tome
the chattels the man charles stuart
patience is a good nag but she will bolt
said the knight unable longer to rein in his wrath
he plucked his sheathed rapier from his side
struck the soldier a severe blow with it and instantly
drawing it and throwing the scabbard
over the trees placed himself in a posture defence
with his sword's point within half a yard 
the steward's body the latter stepped back with
activity threw his long cloak from his shoulders
and drawing his long tuck stood upon his guard
the swords clashed smartly together while alice
in her terror screamed wildly for assistance but
the combat was short duration the old 
woodstock
cavalier had attacked a man as cunning fence ashe
himself or a little more so and possessing all
the strength and activity which time had deprived
sir henry and the calmness which the
other had lost in his passion they had scarce
exchanged three passes ere the sword the
knight flew up in the air as if it had gone in
search the scabbard and burning with shame
and anger sir henry stood disarmed at the
mercy his antagonist the republican showed
no purpose abusing his victory nor did he
either during the combat or after the victory was
won in any respect alter the sour and grave composure
which reigned upon his countenance a
combat life and death seemed to him a thing
as familiar and as little to be feared as an ordinary
bout with foils
thou art delivered unto my hands he said
and by the law arms i might smite thee under
the fifth rib even as asahel was struck dead
by abner the son nun as he followed the
chase on the hill ammah that lieth before
giah in the way the wilderness gibeon 
but far be it from me to spill thy remaining drops
woodstock 
 blood true it is thou art the captive my
sword and my spear nevertheless seeing that
there may be a turning from thine evil ways and
a returning to those which are good if the lord
enlarge thy date for repentance and amendment
wherefore should it be shortened by a poor sinful
mortal who is speaking truly but thy fellowworm
p
sir henry lee remained still confused and unable
to answer when there arrived a fourth person
whom the cries alice had summoned to
the spot this was joceline joliffe one the
underkeepers the walk who seeing how matters
stood brandished his quarterstaff a weapon
from which he never parted and having made it
describe the figure eight in a flourish through
the air would have brought it down with a vengeance
upon the head the steward had not sir
henry interposed
we must trail bats now joceline our time
 shouldering them is passed it skills not striving
against the hill the devil rules the roast
and makes our slaves our tutors
at this moment another auxiliary rushed out
woodstock
 the thicket to the knights assistance it eras
the large wolfdog in strength a mastiff in form
and almost in fleetness a greyhound which we
have already mentioned bevis was the noblest 
the kind which ever pulled down a stag tawnycoloured
like a lion with a black muzzle and blackfeet
just edged with a line white round the
toes he was as tractable as he was strong and
bold just as he was about to rush upon the soldier
the words peace bevis v from sir henry
converted the lion into a lamb and instead 
pulling the soldier down he walked round and
round and snuffed as if using all his sagacity to
discover who the stranger could be towards
whom though so questionable an appearance
he was enjoined forbearance apparently he was
satisfied for he laid aside his doubtful and threatening
demonstrations lowered his ears smoothed
down his bristles and wagged his tail
sir henry who had great respect for the sagacity
 his favourite said in a low voice to alice
bevis is thy opinion and counsels submission
there is the finger heaven in this to
punish the pride ever the fault our house 
woodstock 
friend he continued addressing the soldier
thou hast given the finishing touch to a lesson
which ten years constant misfortune have been
unable fully to teach me thou hast distinctly
shown me the folly thinking that a good cause
can strengthen a weak arm god forgive me for
the thought but i could almost turn infidel and
believe that heaven's blessing goes ever with
the longest sword but it will not be always thus
god knows his time reach me my toledo jofeline
yonder it lies and the scabbard see where
it hangs on the tree do not pull at my cloak
alice and look so miserably frightened i shall
be in no hurry to betake me to bright steel again
i promise thee for thee good fellow i thank
thee and will make way for thy masters without
 farther dispute or ceremony joceline johffe is
nearer thy degree than i am and will make surrender
to thee the lodge and household stuff
withhold nothing joliffe let them have all
for me i will never crossthe threshold again 
but where to rest for a night i would trouble
no one in woodstock hum ay it shall be so
alice and i joceline will go down to thy hut by
s woodstock
rosamond's well we will borrow the shelter 
thy roof for one night at least thou wilt give us
welcome wilt thou not how now a clouded
brow 
joceline certainly looked embarrassed directed
first a glance to alice then looked to heaven
then to earth and last to the four quarters the
horizon and then murmured out certainly 
without question might he but run down to put
the house in order
order enough order enough for those that
may soon be glad clean straw in a barn said
the knight but if thou hast an ill will to harbour
any obnoxious or malignant persons as the
phrase goes never shame to speak it out man
tis true i took thee up when thou wert but a
ragged robin made a keeper thee and so forth
what that sailors think no longer the
wind than when it forwards them on the voyage
thy betters turn with the tide why should not
such a poor knave as thou 
god pardon your honour for your harsh
judgment said joliife the hut is yours such
as it is and should be were it a king's palace as
woodstock 
i wish it were even for your honour's sake and
mistress alice only i could wish your honour
would condescend to let me step down before incase
any neighbour be there or or just to put
matters something into order for mistress alice
and your honour just to make things something
seemly and shapely
not a whit necessary said the knight
while alice had much trouble in concealing her
agitation if thy matters are unseemly they are
fitter for a defeated knight if they are unshapely
why the liker to the rest a world which is
all shaped go thou with that man what is
thy name friend 
joseph tomkins is my name in the flesh
said the steward men call me honest joe
and trusty tomkins
if thou hast deserved such names considering
what trade thou hast driven thou art a jewel
indeed said the knight yet if thou hast not
never blush for the matter joseph for if thou
art not in truth honest thou hast all the better
chance to keep the fame it the title and the
go woodstock
thing itself have long walked separate ways farewell
to thee and farewell to fair woodstock 
so saying the old knight turned round and
pulling his daughter's arm through his own they
walked onward into the forest in the same posture
in which they were introduced to the reader
woodstock
chapter iii
now ye wild blades that make loose inns your stage
to vapour forth the aces this sad age
stout edgehill fight the wherries and the west
and northern clashes where you still fought best 
your strange escapes your dangers void fear
when bullets flew between the head and ear
whether you fought by damme or the spirit
 you i speak
legend captain jones
joseph tomkins and joliffe the keeper remained
for some time in silence as they stood
together looking along the path in which the
figures the knight ditchley and pretty
mistress ace had disappeared behind the trees
they then gazed on each other in doubt as
men who scarce knew whether they stood on hostile
or on friendly terms together and were at
a loss how to open a conversation they heard
the knight's whistle summon bevis but though
the good hound turned his head and pricked his
cars at the sound yet he did not obey the call
 woodstock
but continued to snuff around joseph tomkinss
cloak
thou art a rare one i fear me said the
keeper looking to his new acquaintance i
have heard men who have charms to steal
both dogs and deer
trouble thyself not about my qualities
friend said joseph tomkins but bethink
thee doing thy master's bidding
joceline did not immediately answer but at
length as if in sign truce stuck the his
quarterstaff upright in the ground and leant
upon it as he said gruffly so ray tough old
knight and you were at drawn bilbo by way 
afternoon service sir preacher well for you i
came not up till the blades were done jingling
or i had rung evensong upon your pate
the independent smiled grimly as he replied
nay friend it is well for thyself for never
should sexton have been better paid for the
knell he tolled nevertheless why should there
be war betwixt us or my hand be against thine 
thou art but a poor knave doing thy master's
order nor have i any desire that my own blood
or thine should be shed touching this matter
woodstock 
thou art i understand to give me peaceful possession
 the palace woodstock so called 
though there is now no palace in england no nor
shall be in the days that come after until we shall
enter the palace the new jerusalem and the
reign the saints shall commence on earths
pretty well begun already friend tompkins
said the keeper you are little short being
kings already upon the matter as it now stands 
and for your jerusalem i wot not but woodstock
is a pretty nestegg to begin with well will
you show will you on will you take sasine and
livery you heard my orders
humph i know not said tomkins i
must beware ambuscades and i am alone
here moreover it is the high thanksgiving
appointed by parliament and owned to by the
army also the old man and the young woman
may want to recover some their clothes and
personal property and i would not that they
were baulked on my account wherefore if
thou wilt deliver me possession tomorrow morning
it shall be done in personal presence my
own followers and the presbyterian man the
mayor so that the transfer may be made before
 woodstock
witnesses whereas were there none with us but
thou to deliver and i to take possession the men
 belial might say go to trusty tomkins hath
been an edomite honest joe hath been as an
ishmaelite rising up early and dividing the spoil
with them that served the man yea they that
wore beards and green jerkins as in remembrance
 the man and his governments
joceline fixed his keen dark eyes upon the
soldier as he spoke as if in design to discover
whether there was fair play in his mind or not
he then applied his five fingers to scratch a large
shock head hair as if that operation was
necessary to enable hit to come to a conclusion
this is all fair sounding brother said he but
i tell you plainly there are some silver mugs and
platters and flagons and so forth in yonder house
which have survived the general sweep that sent
all our plate to the smeltingpot to put our knight's
troop on horseback now if thou takes not these
off my hand i may come to trouble since it maybe
thought i have finished their numbers 
whereas i being as honest a fellow 
as ever stole venison said tomkins nay
i do owe thee an interruption
woodstock
go to then replied the keeper if a stag
may have come to mischance in my walk it was
no way in the course dishonesty but merely
to keep my old dame's pan from rusting but
for silver porringers tankards and such like i
would as soon have drunk the melted silver as
stolen the vessel made out it so that i would
not wish blame or suspicion fell on me in this
matter and therefore if you will have the
things rendered even now why so and if not
hold me blameless
ay truly said tomkins and who is to
hold me blameless if they should see cause to
think anything finished not the right worshipful
commissioners to whom the property the
estate is as their own therefore as thou say'st
we must walk warily in the matter to lock up
the house and leave it were but the work 
simple ones what mayest thou to spend the
night there and then nothing can be touched
without the knowledge us both 
why concerning that answered the keeper
 i should be at my hut to make matter
vol i e
 woodstock
somewhat conformable for him and mistress
alice for my old dame joan is something
dunny and will scarce know how to manage 
and yet to speak truth by the mass i would
rather not see sir henry tonight since what has
lapped today hath roused his spleen and it is
a pera venture he may have met something at
the hut which will scarce tend to cool it
it is a pity said tomkins that being a
gentleman such grave and goodly presence
he should be such a malignant cavalier and that
he should like the rest that generation 
vipers have clothed himself with curses as with
a garment
 which is as much as to say the tough old
knight hath a habit swearing said the keeper
grinning at a pun which has been repeated
since his time but who can help it it comes
 use and wont were you now in your bodily
self to light suddenly on a maypole with all
the blithe morrisdancers prancing around it to
the merry pipe and tabor with bells jingling
ribbons fluttering lads frisking and laughing
woodstock g
lasses leaping till you might see where the scarlet
garter fastened the lightblue hose i think some
feeling resembling either natural sociality or
old use and wont would get the better friend
even thy gravity and thou wouldst fling thy
cuckolds steeplehat one way and that bloodthirsty
longsword another and trip like the
noodles hogsnorton when the pigs play on
the organ
the independent turned fiercely round on the
keeper and replied how now mr green jerkin
 what language is this to one whose hand
is at the plough i advise thee to put curb on
thy tongue lest thy ribs pay the forfeit
nay do not take the high tone with me
brother answered joceline remember thou
hast not the old knight sixtyfive to deal with
but a fellow as bitter and prompt as thyself
it may be a little more so younger at all events
and prithee why shouldst thou take such umbrage
at a maypole i would thou hadst known
one phil hazeldine these parts he was the
best morrisdancer betwixt oxford and bedford
 woodstock
the more shame to him answered the independent
 and i trust he has seen the error
 his ways and made himself as if a man 
action he easily might fit for better company
than woodhunters deerstealers maid marion
swashbucklers deposed revellers bloody brawlers
maskers and mummers lewd men and light
women fools and fiddlers and carnal selfpleases
 every description
well replied the keeper you are out 
breath in time for here we stand before the famous
maypole woodstock
they paused in an open space meadowland
beautifully skirted by large oaks and sycamores
one which as king the forest stood a little
detached from the rest as if scorning the vicinity
 any rival it was scathed and gnarled
in the branches but the immense trunk still
showed to what gigantic size the monarch the
forest can attain in the groves merry england
that is called the king's oak said joce
line the oldest men woodstock know not
how old it is they say henry used to sit under
woodstock 
it with fair rosamond and see the lasses dance
and the lads the village run races and wrestle
for belts or bonnets
i nothing doubt it friend said tomkins 
a tyrant and a harlot were fitting patron and
patroness for such vanities
thou may'st say thy say friend replied
the keeper so thou hottest me say mine there
stands the maypole as thou seest half a flightshot
from the king's oak in the midst the
meadow the king gave ten shillings from the
customs woodstock to make a new one yearly
besides a tree fitted for the purpose out the
forest now it is warped and withered and twisted
like a wasted briarrod the green too used
to be closeshaved and rolled till it was smooth
as a velvet mantle now it is rough and overgrown

well well friend joceline said the independent
 but where was the edification all
this what use doctrine could be derived
from a pipe and tabor or was there ever aught
like wisdom in a bagpipe 
 woodstock
 you may ask better scholars that said
joceline but methinks men cannot be always
grave and with the hat over their brow a young
maiden will laugh as a tender flower will blow 
ay and a lad will ike her the better for it just
as the same blithe spring that makes the young
birds whistle bids the blithe fawns skip there
have come worse days since the jolly old times
have gone by i tell thee that in the holidays
which you mr longford have put down i
have seen this greensward alive with merry maidens
and manly fellows the good old rector himself
thought it was no sin to come for a while
and look on and his goodly cassock and scarf
kept us all in good order and taught us to limit
our mirth within the bounds discretion we
might it may be crack a broad jest or pledge
a friendly cup a turn too often but it was in
mirth and good neighbourhood ay and if there
was a bout at singlestick or a bellyful boxing
it was all for love and kindness and better
a few dry blows in drink than the bloody doings
we have had in sober earnest since the presby
woodstock 
ter's cap got above the bishop's mitre and we
exchanged our goodly rectors and learned doctors
whose sermons were all bolstered up with
as much greek and latin as might have confounded
the devil himself for weavers and cobblers
and such other pulpit volunteers as as
we heard this morning it will out
well friend said the independent with
patience scarce to have been expected i quarrel
not with thee for nauseating my doctrine if
thine ear is so much tickled with tabor tunes and
morris tripping truly it is not likely thou should'st
find pleasant savour in more wholesome and sober
food but let us to the lodge that we may go
about our business there before the sun sets
 troth and that may be advisable for more
reasons than one said the keeper for there
have been tales about the lodge which have made
men afeard to harbour there after nightfall
were not yon old knight and yonder damsel
his daughter wont to dwell there said the
independent my information said so
ay truly did they said eocene and
 woodstock
when they kept a jolly household all went well
enough for nothing banishes fear uke good ale
but after the best our men went to the wars
and were slain at naseby flight they who were
left found the lodge more lonesome and the old
knight has been much deserted his servants 
marry it might be that he has lacked silver
 late to pay groom and lackey
 a potential reason for the diminution a
household said the soldier
right sir even so replied the keeper
they spoke steps in the great gallery heard
by dead the night and voices that whispered
at noon in the matted chambers and the servants
pretended that these things scared them
away but in my poor judgment when martinmas
and whitsuntide came round without a 
the old bluebottles servingmen began
to think creeping elsewhere before the frost
chilled them no devil so frightful as that which
dances in the pocket where there is no cross to
keep him out
you were reduced then to a petty household
 said the independent
woodstock 
ay marry were we said joceline but
we kept some halfscore together what with bluebottles
in the lodge what with green caterpillars
 the chase like him who is yours to command
 we stuck together till we found a call to
take a morning's ride somewhere or other
 to the town worcester said the soldier
where you were crushed like vermin and palmer
worms as you are
you may say your pleasure replied the
keeper i'll never contradict a man who has
got my head under his belt our backs are at
the wall or you would not be here
nay friend said the independent thou
rises nothing by thy freedom and trust in me
i can be hon camarado to a good soldier although
i have striven with him even to the going down 
the sun but here we are in front the lodge
they stood accordingly in front the old
gothic building irregularly constructed and at
different times as the humour the english
monarchs led them to taste the pleasures woodstock
chase and to make such improvements for
ff woodstock
their own accommodation as the increasing luxury
 each age required the oldest part the
structure had been named by tradition fair rosamond's
tower it was a small turret great
height with narrow windows and walls massive
thickness the tower had no opening to
the ground or means descending a great part
 the lower portion being solid masonwork it
was traditionally said to have been accessible only
by a sort small drawbridge which might be
dropped at pleasure from a little portal near the
summit the turret to the battlements another
tower the same construction but twenty feet
lower and containing only a winding staircase
called in woodstock love's ladder because it
is said that by ascending this staircase to the
top the tower and then making use the
drawbridge henry obtained access to the chamber
 his paramour
this tradition had been keenly impugned by
dr rochecliffe the former rector woodstock
who insisted that what was called rosamond's
tower was merely an interior keep or citadel to
woodstock 
which the lord or warden the castle might retreat
when other points safety failed him and
either protract his defence or at the worst stipulate
for reasonable terms surrender the people
 woodstock jealous their ancient traditions
did not relish this new mode explaining
them away and it is even said that the mayor
whom we have already introduced became presbyterian
in revenge the doubts cast by the
rector upon this important subject rather choosing
to give up the liturgy than his fixed belief
in rosamond's tower and love's ladder
the rest the lodge was considerable extent
and different ages comprehending a nest
 little courts surrounded by buildings which
corresponded with each other sometimes withindoors
sometimes by crossing the courts and frequently
in both ways the different heights 
the building announced that they could only be
connected by the usual variety staircases which
exercised the limbs our ancestors in the sixteenth
and earlier centuries and seem sometimes
to have been contrived for no other purpose
 woodstock
the varied and multiplied fronts this irregular
building were as dr rochecliffe was wont to
say an absolute banquet to the architectural antiquary
as they certainly contained specimens 
every style which existed from the pure norman
 henry anjou down to the composite half
gothic half classical architecture elizabeth
and her successor accordingly the rector was
himself as much enamoured woodstock as
ever was henry fair rosamond and as his
intimacy with sir henry lee permitted him entrance
at all times to the royal lodge he used
to spend whole days in wandering about the antique
apartments examining measuring studying
and finding out excellent reasons for architectural
peculiarities which probably only owed
their existence to the freakish fancy a gothic
artist but the old antiquarian had been expelled
from his living by the intolerance and troubles
 the times and his successor nehemiah holdenough
would have considered an elaborate investigation
 the profane sculpture and architecture
 blinded and bloodthirsty papists togewoodstock

ther with the history the dissolute amours 
old norman monarchs as httle better than a
bowing down before the calves bethel and a
drinking the cup abominations we return
to the course our story
there is said the independent tomkins
after he had carefully perused the front the
building many a rare monument olden
wickedness about this miscalled royal lodge 
verily i shall rejoice much to see the same destroyed
yea burned to ashes and the ashes
thrown into the brook kedron or any other
brook that the land may be cleansed from the
memory thereof neither remember the iniquity
with which their fathers have sinned
the keeper heard him with secret indignation
and began to consider with himself whether as
they stood but one to one and without chance 
speedy interference he was not called upon by
his official duty to castigate the rebel who used
language so defamatory but he fortunately recollected
that the strife must be a doubtful one
that the advantage arms was against him 
to woodstock
and that in especial even if he should succeed
in the combat it would be at the risk severe
retaliation it must be owned too that there
was something about the independent so dark
and mysterious so grim and grave that the more
open spirit the keeper felt oppressed and if
not overawed at least kept in doubt concerning
him and he thought it wisest as well as safest
for his master and himself to avoid all subjects
 dispute and know better with whom he was
dealing before he made either friend or enemy
 him
the great gate the lodge was strongly bolted
but the wicket opened on joceline's raising
the latch there was a short passage ten feet
which had been formerly closed by a portcullis
at the inner while three loopholes opened on
either side through which any daring intruder
might be annoyed who having surprised the
first gate must be thus exposed to a severe fire
before he could force the second but the machinery
 the portcullis was damaged and it
now remained a fixture brandishing its jaw well
woodstock 
furnished with iron fangs but incapable dropping
it across the path invasion
the way therefore lay open to the great
hall or outer vestibule the lodge one 
 this long and dusky apartment was entirely
occupied by a gallery which had in ancient times
served to accommodate the musicians and minstrels
there was a clumsy staircase at either side
 it composed entire logs a foot square 
and in each angle the ascent was placed byway
 sentinel the figure a norman footsoldier
having an open casque on his head which
displayed features as stern as the painter's genius
could devise their arms were buffjackets or
shirts mail round bucklers with spikes in the
centre and buskins which adorned and defended
the feet and ancles but left the knees bare these
wooden warders held great swords or maces in
their hands like military guards on duty many
an empty hook and brace along the walls the
gloomy apartment marked the spots from which
arms long preserved as trophies had been in the
pressure the war once more taken down to do
u
 woodstock
service in the field like veterans whom extremity
 danger recalls to battle on other rusty
fastenings were still displayed the hunting trophies
 the monarchs to whom the lodge belonged
and the sylvan knights to whose care
it had been from time to time confided
at the nether the hall a huge heavy
stonewrought chimneypiece projected itself ten
feet from the wall adorned with many a cypher
and many a scutcheon the royal house 
england in its present state it yawned like the
arched mouth a funeral vault or perhaps
might be compared to the crater an extinguished
volcano but the sable complexion 
the massive stonework and all around it showed
that the time had been when it sent its huge fires
blazing up the huge chimney besides puffing
many a volume smoke over the heads the
jovial guests whose royalty or nobility did not
render them sensitive enough to quarrel with
such slight inconvenience on these occasions it
was the tradition the house that two cartloads
 wood was the regular allowance for the fire
woodstock 
between noon and curfew and the andirons or
dogs as they were termed constructed for retaining
the blazing fire wood on the hearth were
wrought in the shape lions such gigantic size
might well warrant the legend there were long
seats stone within the chimney where in despite
 the tremendous heat monarchs were sometimes
said to have taken their station and amused themselves
with broiling the tumbles or dowsets the
deer upon the glowing embers with their own
royal hands tradition was here also ready with
her record to show what merry gibes such as
might be exchanged between prince and peer
had flown about at the merry banquet which
followed the michaelmas hunt she could tell
too exactly where king stephen sat when he
darned his own princely hose and the odd
tricks he had put upon little winking the tailor
 woodstock
most this rude revelry belonged to the plantagenet
times when the house tudor acceded
to the throne they were more chary their royal
presence and feasted in halls and chambers far
vol i f
 woodstock
within abandoning the outmost hall to the yeomen
 the guard who mounted their watch there
and passed away the night with wassail and mirth
exchanged sometimes for frightful tales apparitions
and sorceries which made some those
grow pale in whose ears the trumpet a french
foeman would have sounded as jollily as a summons
to the woodland chase
joceline pointed out the peculiarities the
place to his gloomy companion more briefly than
we have detailed them to the reader the independent
seemed to listen with some interest at
first but flinging it suddenly aside he said ina
solemn tone perish babylon as thy master
nebuchadnezzar hath perished he is a wanderer
and thou shalt be a waste place yea and a
wilderness yea a desert salt in which there
shall be thirst and famines
 there is like to be enough both tbnights
said joceline unless the good knights larder
be somewhat fuller than it is wont
 we must care for the creaturecomforts
said the independent but in due season when
woodstock 
our duties are done whither lead these entrances


that to the right replied the keeper leads
to what are called the stateapartments not used
since the year sixteen hundred and thirtynine
when his blessed majesty 
how sir interrupted the independent ina
voice thunder doest thou speak charles
stuart as blessing or blessed beware the proclamation
to that effect
i meant no harm answered the keeper
suppressing his disposition to make a harsher reply
 my business is with bolts and bucks not
with titles and state affairs but yet whatever
may have lapped since that poor king was followed
with blessings enough from woodstock
for he left a glove full broad pieces for the
poor the place 
peace friend said the independent i
will think thee else one those besotted and
blinded papists who hold that bestowing alms
is an atonement and washing away the wrongs
and oppressions which have been wrought by
 woodstock 
the almsgiver thou mayest then these were the
apartments charles stuart 
and his father james before him and
elizabeth before him and bluff king henry
who builded that wing before them all
and there i suppose the knight and his
daughter dwelt 
no replied joceline sir henry lee
had too much reverence for for things which
are now thought worth no reverence at all besides
the staterooms are unaired and in indifferent
order since hate years the knight ranger's
apartment lies by that passage to the left
and whither goes yonder stair which seems
both to lead upwards and downwards 
upwards replied the keeper it leads to
many apartments used for various purposes 
sleeping and other accommodation downwards
to the kitchen offices and vaults the castle
which at this time the evening you cannot
see without lights
we will to the apartments your knight
thence said the independent is there fitting
accommodation there 
woodstock s
such as has served a person condition
whose lodging is now worse appointed answered
the honest keeper his bile rising so fast that he
added in a muttering and inaudible tone so it
may well serve a cropeared knave like thee
he acted as the usher however and led on
towards the ranger's apartments
this suite opened by a short passage from the
hall secured at time need by two oaken doors
which could be fastened by large bars the same
that were drawn out the wall and entered
into square holes contrived for their reception
on the other side the portal at the 
this passage a small anteroom received them
into which opened the sittingapartment the
good knight which in the style the times
might have been termed a fair summer parlour 
lighted by two oriel windows so placed as to command
each them a separate avenue leading
distant and deep down into the forest the principal
ornament the apartment besides two or
three family portraits less interest was a tall
fulllength picture which hung above the chime
which like that in the hall was 
 woodstock
heavy stonework ornamented with carved scutcheons
emblazoned with various devices the
portrait was that a man about fifty years 
age in complete plate armour and painted in
the harsh and dry manner holbein probably
indeed the work that artist as the dates corresponded
the formal and marked angles
points and projections the armour were a
good subject for the harsh pencil that early
school the face the knight was from the
fading the colours pale and dim like that 
some being from the other world yet the lines
expressed forcibly pride and exultation he
pointed with his leadingstaff or truncheon to the
background where in such perspective as the
artist possessed were depicted the remains a
burning church or monastery and four or five
soldiers in red cassocks bearing away in triumph
what seemed a brazen font or laver above their
heads might be traced in scroll lee victor sic
voluit right opposite to the picture hung ina
niche in the wall a complete set tilting armour
the black and gold colours and ornaments
woodstock 
 which exactly corresponded with those exhibited
in the portrait
the picture was one those which from
something marked in the features and expression
attract the observation even those who
are ignorant art the independent looked
at it until a smile passed transiently over his
clouded brow whether he smiled to see the
grim old cavalier employed in desecrating a religious
house an occupation much conforming
to the practice his own sect whether he smiled
in contempt the old painter's harsh and
dry mode working or whether the sight 
this remarkable portrait revived some other ideas
the underkeeper could not decide
the smile passed away in an instant as the
soldier looked to the oriel windows the recesses
within them were raised a step or two from the
wall in one was placed a walnuttree readingdesk
and a huge stuffed armchair covered with
spanish leather a little cabinet stood beside
with some its shuttles and drawers open displaying
hawksbells dogwhistles instruments for
trimming a falcon's feathers bridlebits various
 woodstock
constructions and other trifles connected with
sylvan sport
the other little recess was differently furnished
there lay some articles needlework on a
small table besides a lute with a having
some airs pricked down in it and a frame for
working embroidery some tapestry was displayed
around the recess with more attention to ornament
than was visible in the rest the apartment 
the arrangement a few bowpots with such
flowers as the fading season afforded showed
also the superintendence female taste
tomkins cast an eye careless regard upon
these subjects female occupation then stepped
into the farther window and began to turn the
leaves a folio which lay open on the readingdesk
apparently with some interest joceline
who had determined to watch his motions without
interfering with them was standing at some
distance in dejected silence when a door behind
the tapestry suddenly opened and a pretty village
maid tripped out with a napkin in her hand
as if she had been about some household duty
how now sir impudence she said to
woodstock 
joceline in a smart tone what do you here
prowling about the apartments when the master
is not at home 
but instead the answer which perhaps she
expected joceline joliffe cast a mournful glance
towards the soldier in the oriel window as if to
make what he said fully intelligible and replied
with a dejected appearance and voice alack
my pretty phoebe there come those here that
have more right or might than any us and
will use little ceremony in coming when they will
and staying while they please
he darted another glance at tom king who
still seemed busy with the before him then
sidled close to the astonished girl who had continued
looking alternately at the keeper and at
the stranger as if she had been unable to understand
the words the first or to comprehend
the meaning the second being present
 go whispered joliffe approaching his
mouth so near her cheek that his breath waved
the curls her hair go my dearest phoebe
trip it as fast as a fawn down to my lodge i
will soon be there and
 woodstock
your lodge indeed said phoebe you are
very bold for a poor killbuck that never frightened
anything before save a dun deer your
lodge indeed i am like to go there i think
hush hush phoebe there is no time for
jesting down to my hut i say like a deer for
the knight and mrs alice are both there and i
fear will not return hither again all's naught
girl and our evil days are come at last with a
vengeance we are fairly at bay and fairly hunted
down
can this be joceline said the poor girl
turning to the keeper with an expression 
fright in her countenance which she had hitherto
averted in rural coquetry
as sure my dearest phoebe as 
the rest the asseveration was lost in phcebes
ear so closely did the keeper's lips approach it 
and if they approached so very near as to touch
her cheek grief like impatience hath its privileges
and poor phoebe had enough serious
alarm to prevent her from demurring upon such
a trifle
but no trifle was the approach joceline's
woodstock 
lips to phoebe's pretty though sunburnt cheek
in the estimation the independent who a utthe
before the object joceliiie's vigilance had
been in his turn the observer the keeper's
demeanour so soon as the interview betwixt
phoebe and him had become so interesting and
when he remarked the closeness joceline's argument
he raised his voice to a pitch harshness
that would have rivalled that a saw and
which at once made joceline and phoebe spring
six feet apart each in contrary directions and
if cupid was the party must have sent him
out at the window like a wildduck flying from
a culverin instantly throwing himself into the
attitude a preacher and a reprover vice
how now he exclaimed shameless and
impudent as you are what chambering and
wantoning in our very presence how would
you play your pranks before the steward the
commissioners the high court parliament
as ye would in a booth at the fulsome fair or
amidst the trappings and tracings a profane
dancingschool where the scoundrel minstrels
make their ungodly weapons to squeak kiss
 woodstock
and be kind the fiddler's blind fbut here
he said dealing a perilous thump upon the
volume here is the king and high priest 
those vices and follies here is he whom men
 folly profanely call nature's miracle here is
he whom princes chose for their cabinetkeeper
and whom maids honour take for their bedfellow
 here is the prime teacher fine words
foppery and folly here dealing another
thump upon the volume and oh revered the
roxburgh it was the first folio beloved the
bannatyne it was hemmings and rondel it
was the edition princeps on thee he continued
 on thee william shakspeare i charge
whatever such lawless idleness and immodest
folly hath defiled the land since thy day 
by the mass a heavy accusation said joce
line the bold recklessness whose temper could
not be long overawed odds pitlikins is our
master's old favourite will stratford to answer
for every buss that has been snatched since
james's time a perilous reckoning truly but
i wonder who is possible for what lads and lasses
did before his day 
woodstock 
scoff not said the soldier lest i being
called thereto by the voice within me do deal
with thee as a scorner verily i say that since
the devil fell from heaven he never wanted
agents on earth yet nowhere hath he met with
a wizard having such infinite power over men's
souls as this pestilent fellow shakspeare seeks
a wife a foul example for adultery here she shall
find it would a man know how to train his
fellow to be a murderer here shall he find tutoring
 would a lady marry a heathen negro
she shall have chronicled example for it would
any one scorn at his maker he shall be furnished
with a jest in this would he defy his brother
in the flesh he shall be accommodated with
a challenge would you be drunk shakspeare
will cheer you with a cup would you plunge in
sensual pleasures he will soothe you to indulgence
as with the lascivious sounds a lute
this i say this is the wellhead and source
 all those evils which have overrun the land like
a torrent making men scoffers doubters deniers
murderers makebates and lovers the winepot
haunting unclean places and sitting long at
 woodstock
the eveningwine away with him away with
him men england to tophet with his wicked
 and to the vale hinnom with his accursed
bones verily but that our march was
hasty when we passed stratford in the year s
with sir william waller but that our march
was hasty 
 because prince rupert was after you with
his cavaliers muttered the incorrigible joce
line
i say continued the zealous trooper raising
his voice and extending his arm but that our
march was by command hasty and that we turned
not aside in our riding closing our ranks each
one upon the other as becomes men war i
bad torn on that day the bones that preceptor
 vice and debauchery from the grave and given
them to the next dunghill i would have made
his memory a scoff and a hissing 
that is the bitterest thing he has said yet
observed the keeper poor will would have
liked the hissing worse than all the rest
will the gentleman say any more inquired
phoebe in a whisper lackaday he talks
woodstock 
brave words if one knew but what they meant
but it is a mercy our good knight did not see him
ruffle the at that rate mercy on us there
would certainly have been bloodshed but oh
the father see how he is twisting his face about 
is he ill the colic think'st thou joceline 
or may i offer him a glass strong waters 
 hark thee hither wench f said the keeper
he is but loading his blunderbuss for another
volley and while he turns up his eyes and
twists about his face and clenches his fist and
shuffles and tramples with his feet in that fashion
he is bound to take no notice anything i
would be sworn to cut his purse if he had one
from his side without his feeling it
la joceline said phoebe and if he abides
here in this turn times i dare say the gentleman
will be easily served
care not thou about that said joliffe 
 but tell me softly and hastily what is in the
pantry 
small housekeeping enough said phoebe
 a cold capon and some comfits and the great
standing venison pasty with plenty spice a
manchet or two besides and that is all
 woodstock
well it will serve for a pinchwrap thy
cloak round thy comely body get a basket and
a brace trenchers and towels they are heinously
impoverished down yonder carry down the
capon and the marches the pasty must abide
with this same soldier and me and the piecrust
will serve us for bread
rarely said phoebe i made the paste
myself it is as thick as the walls fair rosamond's
tower
which two pair jaws would be long in
gnawing through work hard as they might said
the keeper stck
was at present fastened conceiving that this was
some precaution johffes old housekeeper 
whose deafness they were all aware sir henry
raised his voice to demand admittance but in
vain irritated at this delay he pressed the door
at once with foot and hand in a way which the
frail barrier was unable to resist it gave way accordingly
and the knight thus forcibly entered
the kitchen or outward apartment his servant
in the midst the floor and with a posture
which indicated embarrassment stood a youthful
stranger in a ridingsuit
 this may be my last act authority here
said the knight seizing the stranger by the collar
 but i am still ranger woodstock for
this night at least who or what art thou 
the stranger dropped the ridingmantle in
which his face was muffled and at the same time
fell on one knee
your poor kinsman markham everard he
said who came hither for your sake although
he fears you will scarce make him welcome for
this own
sir henry started back but recovered himself
in an instant as one who recollected that he had
woodstock 
a part dignity to perform he stood erect
therefore and replied with considerable assumption
 stately ceremony 
fair kinsman it pleases me that you are
come to woodstock upon the very first night
that for many years which have past is likely to
promise you a worthy or a welcome receptions
now god grant it be so that i rightly hear
and duly understand you said the young man 
while alice though she was silent kept her looks
fixed on her father's face as if desirous to know
whether his meaning was kind towards his nephew
which her knowledge his character inclined
her greatly to doubt
the knight meanwhile darted a sardonic look
first on his nephew then on his daughter and
proceeded i need not i presume inform mr
markham everard that it cannot be our purpose
to entertain him or even to offer him a seat in
this poor hut
i will attend you most willingly to the lodge
said the young gentleman i had indeed j urged
you were already there for the evening and feared
to intrude upon you but if you would permit
me my dearest uncle to escort my king woos
woodstock
man and you back to the lodge believe me
amongst all which you have so often done 
good and kind you never conferred benefit that
will be so dearly prized
you mistake me greatly mr markham everard
replied the knight it is not our purpose
to return to the lodge tonight nor by our
lady tomorrow neither i meant but to intimate
to you in all courtesy that at woodstock
lodge you will find those for whom you are fitting
society and who doubtless will afford you
a willing welcome which i sir in this my present
retreat do not presume to offer to a person
 your consequence
for heaven's sake said the young man
turning to alice tell me how i am to understand
language so mysterious
alice to prevent his increasing the restrained
anger her father compelled herself to answer
though it was with difficulty we are expelled
from the lodge by soldiers
expelled by soldiers exclaimed everard
in surprise there is no legal warrant for this
none at all answered the knight in the
same tone cutting irony which he had all along
woodstock 
used and yet as lawful a warrant as for aught
that has been wrought in england this twelvemonth
and more you are i think or were an
innsofcourtman marry sir your enjoyment
 your profession is like that lease which a prodigal
wishes to have a wealthy widow you
have already survived the law which you studied
and its expiry doubtless has not been without
a legacy some decent pickings some merciful
increases as the phrase goes you have deserved
it two ways you wore buff and bandalier
as well as wielded pen and ink i have not
heard if you held forth too
think me and speak me as harshly as
you will sir said everard submissively i
have but in this evil time guided myself by my
conscience and my father's commands
o an you talk conscience said the old
knight i must have mine eye upon you as
hamlet says never yet did puritan cheat so
grossly as when he was appealing to his conscience
 and as for thy father 
he was about to proceed in a tone the same
invective when the young man interrupted him
 woodstock
by saying in a firm tone sir henry lee you
have ever been thought noble say me what
you will but speak not my father what the
ear a son should not endure and which yet his
arm cannot resent to do me such wrong is to
insult an unarmed man or to beat a captive
sir henry paused as if struck by the remark
 thou hast spoken truth in that mark
wert thou the blackest puritan whom hell ever
vomited to distract an unhappy country
 be that as you will to think it replied everard
 but let me not leave you to the shelter
 this wretched hovel the night is drawing to
storm let me but conduct you to the lodge
and expel these intruders who can as yet at least
have no warrant for what they do i will not
linger a moment behind them save just to deliver
my father's message grant me but this much
for the love you once bore me 
yes mark answered his uncle firmly but
sorrowfully thou speaks truth i did love
thee once the brighthaired boy whom i taught
to ride to shoot to hunt whose hours happiness
were spent with me wherever those gras
ill
ver labours were employed i did love that boy
ay and i am weak enough to love even the
memory what he was but he is gone mark
he is gone and in his room i only behold an
avowed and determined rebel to his religion and
to his king a rebel more detestable on account
 his success the more infamous through the
plundered wealth with which he hopes to gild
his villainy but i am poor thou think'st and
should hold my peace lest men say speak sirrah
when you should know however that
indigent and plundered as i am i feel myself
dishonoured in holding even but this much talk
with the tool usurping rebels go to the
lodge if thou wilt yonder lies the way but
think not that to regain my dwelling there or all
the wealth i ever possessed in my wealthiest days
i would willingly accompany thee three steps on
the greensward if i must be thy companion it
shall be only when thy redcoats have tied my
hands behind me and bound my legs beneath my
horse's belly thou may'st be my fellowtraveller
then i grant thee if thou wilt but not sooner
alice who suffered cruelly during this 
woodstock
hogue and was well aware that farther argument
would only kindle the knight's resentment still
more highly ventured at last in her anxiety to
make a sign to her cousin to break off the interview
and to retire since her father commanded his
absence in a manner so peremptory unhappily
she was observed by sir henry who concluding
that what he saw was evidence a private understanding
betwixt the cousins his wrath acquired
new fuel and it required the utmost exertion
 selfcommand and recollection all that was
due to his own dignity to enable him to veil his
real fury under the same ironical manner which
he had adopted at the beginning this angry ininterview

 if thou art afraid he said to trace our
forestglades by night respected stranger to
whom i am perhaps bound to do honour as my
successor in the charge these walks here seems
to be a modest damsel who will be most willing
to wait on thee and be thy bowbearer only
for her mother's sake let there pass some slight
form marriage between you ye need no licence
or priest in these happy days but may be
buckled like beggars in a ditch with a hedge for
woodstock 
a churchroof and a tinker for a priest i crave
pardon you for making such an officious and
simple request perhaps you are a ranter or
one the family love or hold marriage rites
as unnecessary as knipperdoling or jack 
ley den
for mercy s sake forbear such dreadful jesting
my father and do you markham begone
in god's name and leave us to our fate your
presence makes my father rave
jesting said sir henry i was nevermore
serious raving i was never more composed
 i could never brook that falsehood
should approach me i would no more bear by
my side a dishonoured daughter than a dishonoured
sword and this unhappy day hath shown
that both can fail 
sir henry said young everard load not
your soul with a heavy crime which be assured
you do in treating your daughter thus unjustly
it is long now since you denied her to me when
we were poor and you were powerful i acquiesced
in your prohibition all suit and intercourse
god knoweth what i suffered but i
vol i h
 woodstock
acquiesced neither is it to renew my suit that
i now come hither and have i do acknowledge
sought speech her not for her own sake only
but for yours also destruction hovers over you
ready to close her pinions to stoop and her talons
to clutch yes sir look contemptuous as
you will such is the case and it is to protect both
you and her that i am here
 you refuse then my free gift said sir
henry lee or perhaps you think it loaded
with too hard conditions 
shame shame on you sir henry t said
everard waxing warm in his turn have your
political prejudices so utterly warped every feeling
 a father that you can speak with bitter
mockery and scorn what concerns your own
daughter's honour hold up your head fair
alice and tell your father he has forgotten nature
in his fantastic spirit loyalty know
sir henry that though i would prefer your
daughter's hand to every blessing which heaven
could bestow on me i would not accept it my
conscience would not permit me to do so when
i knew it must withdraw her from her duty to
you
woodstock 
your conscience is over scrupulous young
man carry it to some dissenting rabbi and he
who takes all that comes to net will teach thee
it is sinning against our mercies to refuse any
good thing that is freely offered to us
 when it is freely offered and kindly offered
not when the offer is made in irony and insult
fare thee well alice if aught could make me
desire to profit by thy father's wild wish to cast thee
from him in a moment unworthy suspicion it
would be that while indulging in such sentiments
sir henry lee is tyrannically oppressing the creature
who all others is most dependent on his
kindness who ail others will most feel his
severity and whom all others he is most
bound to cherish and support 
do not fear for me mr everard exclaimed
alice aroused from her timidity by a dread 
the consequences not unlikely to ensue where
civil war set relations as well as fellowcitizens
in opposition to each other oh begone i
conjure you begone nothing stands betwixt me
and my father's kindness but these unhappy family
divisions but your illtimed presence here
for heaven's sake leave us 
 woodstock
soh mistress answered the hot old cavalier
 you play lady paramount already and
who but youyou would dictate to our train i
warrant like general and began but i tel
thee no man shall leave my house and humble
as it is this is now my house while he has
aught to say to me that is to be spoken as this
young man now speaks with a bent brow and a
lofty tone speak out sir and say your worst 
 dear not my temper mrs alice said everard
with equal firmness and placidity manner
 and you sir henry do not think that if
i speak firmly i mean therefore to speak in anger
or officiously you have taxed me with much
and were i guided by the wild spirit romantic
chivalry much which even from so near a relative
i ought not as being by birth and in the
world's estimation a gentleman to pass over
without reply is it your pleasure to give me
patient hearing 
if you stand on your defence answered the
stout old knight god forbid that you should
not challenge a patient hearing ay though your
pleading were two parts disloyalty and one blab
woodstock 
phemy only be brief this has already lasted
but too long
 in the northwest angle it is from a window
in what they call victor lee's apartments
well resumed wildrake i had been
long one lundsford's lads and well used to
patrolling duty so rat me says i if i leave a
light in my rear without knowing what it means
besides mark thou hadst said so much to me
 thy pretty cousin i thought i might as well
have a peep if i could
thoughtless thoughtless incorrigible young
man to what dangers do you expose yourself
and your friends in mere wantonness but goon

by this fair moonshine i believe thou art
jealousy mark everard replied his gay companion
 there is no occasion for in any case i
who was to see the lady was steeled by honour
against the charms my friend's chloe then
the lady was not to see me so could make no
comparisons to thy disadvantage thou knowest 
lastly as it fell out neither us saw the other
at all
 that i am well aware mrs alice left the
lodge long before sunset and never returned
 woodstock
what didst thou see to introduce with such pre
face
 nay no great matter replied wildrake 
only getting upon a sort buttress for i can
climb like any cat that ever mewed in any gutter
and holding on by the vines and creepers
which grew around i obtained a station where i
could see into the inside that same parlour
thou spokes just now
and what saw'st thou there once more demanded
everard
nay no great matter as i said before replied
the cavalier for in these times it is no
new thing to see churls carousing in royal or
noble chambers i saw two stallions engaged
in emptying a solemn stoup strong waters and
dispatching a huge venison pasty which for
their convenience they had placed on a lady's
workingtable one them was trying an air on
a lute
the profane villains exclaimed everard
it was alice's
well said comrade i am glad your phlegm
can be moved i did but throw in these incidents
woodstock 
 the lute and the table to try if it was possible
to get a spark human spirit out you besanctified
as you are
what like were the men said young everard

the one a slouchhatted longcloaked surface
fanatic like the rest you whom i took
to be the steward or commissary i heard spoken
 in the town the other was a short sturdy fellow
with a woodknife at his girdle and a long
quarterstaff lying beside him a blackhaired
knave with white teeth and a merry countenance
 one the underrangers or bowbearers
 these walks i fancy
they must have been desborough's favourite
trusty tomkins said everard and joce
line joliffe the keeper tomkins is desboroughs
right hand an independent and hath pouring
forth as he calls them some think that his gifts
have the better his grace i have heard his
abusing opportunities
they were improving them when i saw
them replied wildrake and made the bottle
smoke for it when as the devil would have
 woodstock
it a stone which had been dislodged from the
crumbling buttress gave way under my weight
a clumsy fellow like thee would have been so
long thinking what was to be done that he
must needs have followed it before he could
make up his mind but i mark i hopped like
a squirrel to an ivy twig and stood fast was
well nigh shot though for the noise alarmed
them both they looked to the oriel and saw me
on the outside the fanatic fellow took out a pistol
 as they have always such texts in readiness
hanging beside the little clasped bible thou
know'st the keeper seized his huntingpole i
treated them both to a roar and a grin thou
must know i can grimace like a baboon i learned
the trick from a french player who could twist
his jaws into a pair nutcrackers and therewithal
i dropped myself sweetly on the grass and
ran off so trippingly keeping the dark side the
wall as long as i could that i am well nigh persuaded
they thought i was their kinsman the
devil come among them uncalled they were
abominably startled
thou art most fearfully rash wildrake
woodstock 
said his companion we are now bound for the
house what if they should remember thee 
why it is no treason is it no one has paid
for peeping since tom coventry's days and
if he came in for a reckoning belike it was fora
better treat than mine but trust me they will
no more know me than a man who had only
seen your friend noll at a conventicle saints
would know the same oliver on horseback and
charging with his lobstertailed squadron or the
same noll cracking a jest and a bottle with
wicked waller the poetae
hush not a word oliver as thou dost
value thyself and me it is ill jesting with the
rock you may split on but here is the gate 
we will disturb these honest gentlemen's recreations

as he spoke he applied the large and ponderous
knocker to the halldoor
rattattattoo said wildrake there is
a fine alarm to you cuckolds and roundheads
he then halfmimicked halfsung the march so
called 
 woodstock
cuckolds come dig cuckolds come dig 
round about cuckolds come dance to my jig 
by heaven this passes midsummer frenzy
said everard turning angrily to him
not a bit not a bit replied wildrake it
is but a slight expectoration just like what one
makes before beginning a long speech i will be
grave for an hour together now i have got that
point war out my head
as he spoke steps were heard in the hall and
the wicket the great door was partly opened
but secured with a chin in case accidents
the visage tomkins and that joceline
beneath it appeared at the chink illuminated by
the lamp which the latter held in his hand and
tomkins demanded the meaning this alarm
i demand instant admittance i said everard
 joliffe you know me well 
i do sirs replied joceline and could admit
you with all my heart but alas sir you
see i am not keykeeper here is the gentleman
whose warrant i must walk by the lord help
me seeing times are such as they be r
i
woodstock 
and when that gentleman who i think maybe
master desborough's valet 
his honour's unworthy secretary an it please
you interposed tomkins while wildrake whispered
in everard's ear i will be no longer secretary
mark thou wert quite right the clerk
must be the more gentlemanly calling
 and if you are master desboroughs secretary
i presume you know me and my condition well
enough said everard addressing the independent
 not to hesitate to admit me and my attendant
to a night's quarters in the lodge 
surely not surely not said the independent
 that is if your worship thinks you would
be better accommodated here than up at the
house entertainment in the town which men
unprofitably call saint george's inn there is
but confined accommodation here your honour
and we have been frayed out our lives already
by the visitation satan albeit his fiery
dart is now quenched
this may be all well in its place sir secretary
said everard and you may find a corner
for it when you are next tempted to play the
i
 woodstock
preacher but i will take it for no apology for
keeping me here in the cold harvest wind and if
not presently received and suitably too i will
report you to your master for insolence in your
office
the secretary desborough did not dare
offer farther opposition for it was well known
that desborough himself only held his consequence
as a kinsman cromwell and the lord
general who was well nigh paramount already
was known to be strongly favourable both to the
elder and younger everard it is true they were
presbyterians and he an independent and that
though sharing those feelings correct morality
and more devoted religious feeling by which
with few exceptions the parliamentarian party
were distinguished the everardss were not disposed
to carry these attributes to the extreme enthusiasm
practised by so many others at the time
yet it was well known that whatever might be
cromwell's own religious creed he was not uniformly
bounded by it in the choice his favourites
but extended his countenance to those who
could serve him even although according to the
woodstock 
phrase the time they came out the darkness
 egypt the character the elder everard
stood very high for wisdom and sagacity besides
being a good family and competent fortune
his adherence would lend a dignity to any side
he might espouse then his son had been a distinguished
and successful soldier remarkable for
the discipline he maintained among his men the
bravery which he showed in the time action
and the humanity with which he was always ready
to qualify the consequences victory such
men were not to be neglected when many signs
combined to show that the parties in the state
who had successfully accomplished the deposition
and death the king were speedily to quarrel
among themselves about the division the spoils
the two everardss were therefore much courted
by cromwell and their influence with him supposed
to be so great that trusty mr secretary
tomkins cared not to expose himself to risk by
contending with colonel everard for such a trifle
as a night's lodging
joceline was active on his side more lights
were obtained more wood thrown on the fire 
vol i k
 woodstock
and the two newlyarrived strangers were introduced
into victor lee's parlour as it was called
from the picture over the chimneypiece which
we have already described it was several minutes
ere colonel everard could recover his general
stoicism deportment so strongly he was
impressed by finding himself in the apartment
under whose roof he had passed so many the
happiest hours his life there was the cabinet
which he had seen opened with such feelings
 delight when sir henry lee deigned to give
him instructions in fishing and to exhibit hooks
and lines together with all the materials for making
the artificial fly then little known there
hung the ancient family picture which from
some odd mysterious expressions his uncle
relating to it had become to his boyhood nay
his early youth a subject curiosity and fear
he remembered how when left alone in the
apartment the searching eye the old warrior
seemed always bent upon his in whatever part
 the room he placed himself and how his childish
imagination was perturbed at a phenomenon
for which he could not account
woodstock 
with these came a thousand more dear and
warmer recollections his early attachment to
his pretty cousin alice when he aided at her
lessons brought water for her flowers or accompanied
her while she sung and he remembered
that while her father looked at them with a goodhumoured
and careless smile he had once heard
him mutter and if it should turn out so why
it might be best for both and the theories 
happiness he had reared on these words all
these visions had been dispelled by the trumpet
 war which called sir henry lee and himself
to opposite sides and the transactions this very
day had shown that even everard's success as a
soldier and a statesman seemed absolutely to prohibit
the chance their being revived
he was waked out this unpleasing reverie
by the approach joceline who being possibly
a seasoned toper had made the additional arrangements
with more expedition and accuracy
than could have been expected from a person
engaged as he had been since nightfall
he now wished to know the colonel's directions
for the night
 woodstock
would he eat anything 
no
 did his honour choose to accept sir henry
lee's bed which was ready prepared 
yes
that mistress alice lee should be prepared
for the secretary
on pain thine ears no replied everard
 where then was the worthy secretary to be
quartered 
in the dogkennel if you list replied colonel
everard but added he stepping to
the sleepingapartment alice which opened
from the parlour locking it and taking out the
key no one shall profane this chamber
had his honour any other commands for the
night 
none save to clear the apartment yonder
man my clerk will remain with me i have
orders which must be written out yet stay
thou gayest my letter this morning to mistress
alice 
 i did
woodstock 
 tell me good joceline what she said when
she received it 
she seemed much concerned sir and indeed
i think that she wept a little but indeed she
seemed very much distressed
 and what message did she send to me 
none may it please your honour she began
to say tell my cousin everard that i will
communicate my uncle's kind purpose to my father
if i can get fitting opportunity but that i
greatly fear and there checked herself as it
were and said i will write to my cousin and
as it may be late ere i have an opportunity 
speaking with my father do thou come for my
answer after service so i went to church myself
to while away the time but when i returned
to the chase i found this man had summoned
my master to surrender and right or wrong i
must put him in possession the lodge i
would fain have given your honour a hint that
the old knight and my young mistress were like
to take you on the form but i could not mend
the matter
thou hast done well good fellow and i will
 woodstock
remember thee and now my masters he said
advancing to the brace clerks or secretaries
who had in the meanwhile sate quietly down beside
the stonebottle and made up acquaintance
over a glass its contents let me remind
you said the colonel that the night wears
late
there is something cries tinkle tinkle in the
bottle yet said wildrake in reply
hem hem hem coughed the colonel 
the parliamentarian service and if his lips did
not curse his companion's imprudence i will not
answer for what arose in his heart well 
he said observing that wildrake had filled his
own glass and tomkins's take that parting
glass and begone
would you not be pleased to hear first
said wildrake how this honest gentleman saw
the devil tonight look through a pane yonder
window and how he thinks he had a mighty
strong resemblance to your worship's humble
slave and varlet scribbler would you but hear
this sir and just sip a glass this very recommendable
strong waters
woodstock 
i will drink none sir said colonel everard
sternly and i have to tell you that you have
drunken a glass too much already mr tompkins
sir i wish you good night
a word in season at parting said tompkins
standing up behind the long leathern back
 a chair hemming and snuffling as if preparing
for an exhortation
excuse me sir replied markham everard
sternly you are not now sufficiently yourself
to guide the devotion others
woe be to them that reject said the secretary
 the commissioners stalking out the
room the rest was lost in shutting the door or
suppressed for fear offence
and n ow fool wildrake begone to thy bed 
yonder it lies pointing to the knight's apartment
what thou hast secured the lady's for thyself
 i saw thee put the key in thy pocket
i would not indeed i could not sleep in
 apartment i can sleep nowhere but i will
watch in this armed chair i have made him place
 wood for repairing the fire good now go to bed
 thyself and sleep off thy liquor
 woodstock
liquor i laugh thee to scorn mark 
thou art a milksop and the son a milksop and
knowest not what a good fellow can do in the way
 crushing an honest cup
the whole vices his faction are in this
poor fellow individually said the colonel to
himself eying his protege askance as the other
retreated into the bedroom with no very steady
pace he is reckless intemperate dissolute 
and if i cannot get him safely shipped for france
he will certainly be both his own ruin and mine 
yet withal he is kind brave and generous and
would have kept the faith with me which he now
expects from me and in what consists the merit
 our truth if we observe not our plighted word
when we have promised to our hurt i will take
the liberty however to secure myself against farther
interruption on his part
so saying he locked the door communication
betwixt the sleepingroom to which the cavalier
had retreated and the parlour and then
after pacing the floor thoughtfully returned to
his seat trimmed the lamp and drew out a number
 letters i will read these over once
woodstock 
more he said that if possible the thought 
public affairs may expel this keen sense personal
sorrow gracious providence where is
this to we have sacrificed the peace our
families the warmest wishes our young hearts
to right the country in which we were born and
to free her from oppression yet it appears that
every step we have made towards liberty has but
brought us in view new and more terrific perils
as he who travels in a mountainous region is by
every step which elevates him highest placed ina
situation more imminent hazard
he read long and attentively various tedious
and embarrassed letters in which the writers
placing before him the glory god and the
freedom and liberties england as their supreme
ends could not by all the ambulatory expressions
they made use prevent the shrewd
eye markham everard from seeing that selfinterest
and views ambition were the principal
moving springs at the bottom their plots
woodstock
chapter 
sleep steals on us even like his brother death
we know not when it comes we know it must come
we may affect to scorn and to contemn it
for tis the highest pride human misery
to say it knows not an opiate 
yet the reft parent the despairing lover
even the poor wretch who waits for execution
feels this oblivion against which he thought
his woes had armed his senses steal upon him
and through the fenceless citadel the body
surprise that haughty garrison the mind
herbert
colonel everard experienced the truth contained
in the verses the quaint old bard whom
we have quoted above amid private grief and
anxiety for a country long a prey to civil war
and not likely to fall soon under any fixed or wellestablished
form government everard and his
father had like many others turned their eyes to
general cromwell as the person whose valour
had made him the darling the army whose
strong sagacity had hitherto predominated over
the high talents by which he had been assailed
woodstock 
in parliament as well as over his enemies in the
field and who was alone in the situation to settle
the station as the phrase then went or in other
words to dictate the mode government the
father and son were both reputed to stand high
in the general's favour but markham everard
was conscious some particulars which induced
him to doubt whether cromwell actually
and at heart bore either to his father or to himself
that goodwill which was generally believed
he knew him for a profound politician who
could veil for any length time his real sentiments
 men and things until they could be displayed
without prejudice to his interest and he
moreover knew that the general was not likely
to forget the opposition which the presbyterian
party had offered to what oliver called the great
matter the trial namely and execution the
king in this opposition his father and he had
anxiously concurred nor had the arguments nor
even the halfexpressed threats cromwell induced
them to flinch from that course far less
to permit their names to be introduced into the
commission nominated to sit in judgment on that
memorable occasion
 woodstock
this hesitation had occasioned some temporary
coldness between the general and the everard
father and son but as the latter remained
in the army and bore arms under cromwell both
in scotland and finally at worcester his services
very frequently called forth the approbation
 his commander after the fight worcester
in particular he was among the number those
officers on whom oliver rather considering the
actual and practical extent his own power than
the name under which he exercised it was with
difficulty withheld from imposing the dignity 
knights bannerets at his own will and pleasure
it therefore seemed that all recollection former
disagreement was obliterated and that the
everardss had regained their former stronghold
in the general's affections there were indeed
several who doubted this and who endeavoured
to bring over this distinguished young officer to
some other the parties which divided the infant
commonwealth but to these proposals he
turned a deaf ear enough blood he said had
been spilled it was time that the nation should
have repose under a firmlyestablished govern
woodstock 
ment strength sufficient to protect property
and lenity enough to encourage the return 
tranquillity this he thought could only be
accomplished by means cromwell and the
greater part england was the same opinion
it was ti'ue that in thus submitting to the domination
 a successful soldier those who did so
forgot the principles upon which they had drawn
the sword against the late king but in revolutions
stern and high principles are often obliged to
give way to the current existing circumstances 
and in many a case where wars have been waged
for points metaphysical right they have been
at last gladly terminated upon the mere hope 
obtaining general tranquillity as after many a
long siege a garrison is often glad to submit on
mere security for life and limb
colonel everard therefore felt that the support
which he afforded cromwell was only under
the idea that amid a choice evils the least
was likely to ensue from a man the general's
wisdom and valour being placed at the head 
the state and he was sensible that oliver himself
was likely to consider his attachment as luke's
woodstock
warm and imperfect and measure his gratitude
for it upon the same limited scale
in the meanwhile however circumstances
compelled him to make trial the generals
friendship the sequestration woodstock and
the warrant to the commissioners to dispose it
as national property had been long granted but
the interest the elder everard had for weeks
and months deferred its execution the hour
was now approaching when the blow could be no
longer parried especially as sir henry lee on
his side resisted every proposal submitting
himself to the existing government and was
therefore now that his hour grace was passed
enrolled in the list stubborn and irreclaimable
malignant with whom the council state was
determined no longer to keep terms the only
mode protecting the old knight and his daughter
was to interest if possible the general himself
in the matter and revolving all the circumstances
connected with their intercourse colonel everard
felt that a request which would so immediately
interfere with the interests desborough the
brotherinlaw cromwell and one the prewoodstock

sent commissioners was putting to a very severe
trial the friendship the latter yet no alternative
remained
with this view and agreeably to a request
from cromwell who at parting had been very
urgent to have his written opinion upon public
affairs colonel everard passed the earlier part
 the night in arranging his ideas upon the state
 the commonwealth in a plan which he thought
likely to be acceptable to cromwell as it exhorted
him under the aid providence to become the
saviour the state by convoking a free parliament
and by their aid placing himself at the head
 some form liberal and established government
which might supersede the estate anarchy
in which the nation was otherwise likely to be
merged taking a general view the totally broken
condition the royalists and the various
factions which now convulsed the state he showed
how this might be done without bloodshed or
violence from this topic he descended to the
propriety keeping up the becoming state the
executive government in whose hands soever it
should be lodged and thus showed cromwell as
the future stadtholder or consul or lieutenants
woodstock
general great britain and ireland a prospect
 demesne and residencies becoming his dignity
then he naturally passed to the dispersing and
destroying the royal residences england
made a woful picture the demolition which impended
over woodstock and interceded for the
preservation that beautiful seat as a matter 
personal favour in which he found himself deeply
interested
colonel everard when he had finished his letter
did not find himself greatly risen in his own
opinion in the course his political conduct
he had till this hour avoided mixing up personal
motives with his public grounds action and
yet he now felt himself making such a composition
but he comforted himself or at least silenced
this unpleasing recollection with the consideration
that the weal britain studied under the
aspect the times absolutely required that
cromwell should be at the head the government
 and that the interest sir henry lee or
rather his safety and his existence no less emphatically
demanded the preservation woodstock
and his residence there was it a fault his that
woods to c 
the same road should lead to both these ends oi
that his private interest and that the country
should happen to mix in the same letter he
hardened himself therefore to the act made up
and addressed his packet to the lord general and
then sealed it with his seal arms this done he
lay back in his chair and in spite his expectations
to the contrary fell asleep in the course
 his reflections anxious and harassing as they
were and did not awaken until the cold grey light
 dawn was peeping through the eastern oriel
he started at first rousing himself with the
sensation one who awakes in a place unknown
to him but the localities instantly forced themselves
on his recollection the lamp burning
dimly in the socket the woodfire almost extinguished
in its own white embers the gloomy
picture over the chimneypiece the sealed packet
on the table all reminded him the events 
yesterday and his deliberations the succeeding
night
there is no help for it he said it must be
cromwell or anarchy and probably the sense
that his title as head the executive governvol
i l
j woodstock
mentis derived merely from popular consent may
check the too natural proneness power to render
itself arbitrary if he govern by parliaments
and with regard to the privileges the subject
wherefore not oliver as well as charles but i
must take measures for having this conveyed
safely to the hands this future sovereign prince
it will be well to take the first word influence
with him since there must be many who will not
hesitate to recommend counsels more violent and
precipitate
he determined to intrust the important packet
to the charge wildrake whose rashness was
never so distinguished as when by any chance he
was left idle and unemployed besides even if
his faith had not been otherwise unimpeachable
the obligations which he owed to his friend everard
must have rendered it such
these conclusions passed through colonel everard's
mind as collecting the remains wood in
the chimney he gathered them into a hearty blaze
to remove the uncomfortable feeling chillness
which pervaded his limbs and by the time he
was a little more warm again sunk into a slumber
woodstock 
which was only dispelled by the beams morning
peeping into his apartment
he arose roused himself walked up and down
the room and looked from the large oriel windows
on the nearest objects which were the untrimmed
hedges and neglected walks a certain
wilderness as it is called in ancient treatises on
gardening which kept yore well ordered and
in all the pride the topiary art presented a
succession yew trees cut into fantastic forms
 close alleys and open walks filling about
two or three acres ground on that side the
lodge and forming a boundary between its immediate
precincts and the open park its enclosure
was now broken down in many places and
the hinds with their fawns fed free and startled
up to the very windows the sylvan palace
this had been a favourite scene markham's
sports when a boy he could still distinguish
though now grown out shape the verdant
battlements a gothic castle all created by the
gardener's shears at which he was accustomed to
shoot his arrows or stalking before it like the
knighterrant whom he read was wont 
 woodstock
blow his horn and bid defiance to the supposed
giant or paynim knight by whom it was garrisoned
he remembered how he used to train his
cousin though several years younger than himself
to bear a part in these revels his boyish
fancy and to play the character an elfin page
or a fairy or an enchanted princess he remembered
too many particulars their later
acquaintance from which he had been almost
necessarily led to the conclusion that from an
early period their parents had entertained some
idea that there might be a wellfitted match betwixt
his fair cousin and himself a thousand
visions formed in so bright a prospect had vanished
along with it but now returned like shadows
to remind him all he had lost and for what 
 for the sake england his proud consciousness
replied england in danger 
becoming the prey at once bigotry and tyranny
and he strengthened himself with the recollection
 if i have sacrificed my private happiness
it is that my country may enjoy liberty
 conscience and personal freedom which under
woodstock 
 weak prince and usurping statesmen she was
but too likely to have lost
but the busy fiend in his breast would not be
repulsed by the bold answer has thy resistance
it demanded availed thy country markham
everard lies not england after so much
bloodshed and so much misery as low beneath
the sword a fortunate soldier as formerly under
the sceptre an encroaching prince are
parliament or what remains them fitted to
contend with a leader master his soldiers
hearts as bold and subtle as he is impenetrable
in his designs this general who holds the
army and by that the fate the nation in his
hand will he lay down his power because philosophy
would pronounce it his duty to become a
subject 
he dared not answer that his knowledge 
cromwell authorized him to expect any such
act selfdenial yet still he considered that
in times such infinite difficulty that must bethe
best government however little desirous in
itself which should most speedily restore peace
to the land and stop the wounds which the 
woodstock
tending parties were daily inflicting on each other
he imagined that cromwell was the only authority
under which a steady government could be
formed and therefore had attached himself to his
fortune though not without considerable and recurring
doubts how far serving the views this
impenetrable and mysterious general was consistent
with the principles under which he had
assumed arms
while these things passed in his mind everard
looked upon the packet which lay on the table
addressed to the lord general and which he had
made up before sleep he hesitated several times
when he remembered its purport and in what
degree he must stand committed with that personage
and bound to support his plans aggrandizement
when once that communication was in
oliver croraweirs possession
yet it must be so he said at last with a
deep sigh among the contending parties he
is the strongest the wisest and most moderate
and ambitious though he be perhaps not the
most dangerous some one must be trusted with
power to preserve and enforce general order and
woodstock 
who can possess or wield such power like him
that is head the victorious armies england 
come what will in future peace and the restoration
 law ought to be our first and most pressing
object this remnant a parliament cannot
keep their ground against the army by mere appeal
to the sanction opinion if they design to
reduce the soldiery it must be by actual warfare
and the land has been too long steeped in blood
but cromwell may and i trust will make a moderate
accommodation with them on grounds by
which peace may be preserved and it is to this
which we must look and trust for a settlement 
the kingdom alas f and for the chance protecting
my obstinate kinsman from the consequences
 his honest though absurd pertinacity
silencing some internal feelings doubt and
reluctance by such reasoning as this markham
everard continued in his resolution to unite himself
with cromwell in the struggle which was
evidently approaching betwixt the civil and military
authorities not as the course which if at
perfect liberty he would have preferred adopting
but as the best choice between two dangerous
 woodstock
extremities to which the times had reduced him
he could not help trembling however when he
recollected that his father though hitherto the
admirer cromwell as the implement by whom
so many marvels had been wrought in england
might not be disposed to unite with his interest
against that the long parliament which
he had been till partly laid aside by continued
indisposition an active and leading member
this doubt also he was obliged to swallow or
strangle as he might but consoling himself with
the ready argument that it was impossible his
father could see matters in another light than
that in which they occurred to himself
woodstock 
chapter vii
determined at length to dispatch his packet
to the general without delay colonel everard
approached the door the apartment in which
as was evident from the dead breathing within the
prisoner wildrake enjoyed a deep slumber under
the influence liquor at once and fatigue in
turning the key the bolt which was rather rusty
made a resistance so noisy as partly to attract
the sleepers attention though not to awake him
everard stood by his bedside as he heard him
mutter is it morning already jailor why
you dog an you had but a cast humanity in
you you would qualify your vile news with a cup
 sack hanging is sorry work my masters 
and sorrow's dry
up wildrake up thou illomened dreamers
said his friend shaking him by the collar

 woodstock
hands off answered the sleeper i can
climb a ladder without help i trow he then
sate up in the bed and opening his eyes stared
around him and exclaimed zounds mark is
it only thou i thought it was all over with me
fetters were struck from my legs rope drawn
round my gullet irons knocked off my hands
hempen cravat tucked on all ready for a dance
in the open element upon slight footing
truce with thy folly wildrake sure the
devil drink to whom thou hast i think sold
thyself 
for a hogshead sack interrupted wildrake
 the bargain was made in a cellar in the
wintry
i am as mad as thou art to trust anything
to thee said markham i scarce believe thou
hast thy senses yet
what should ail me said wildrake i
trust i have not tasted liquor in my sleep saving
that i dreamed drinking smallbeer with old
noll his own brewing but do not look so
glum manpi am the same roger wildrake
that i ever was as wild as a mallard but as true
woodstock 
as a gamecock i am thine own chum manbound
to thee by thy kind deedsvinctus he
nefido there is latin for it and where is the
thing thou wilt charge me with that i will not
or dare not execute were it to pick the devil's
teeth with my rapier after he had breakfasted
upon roundheads 
 you will drive me mad said everard 
when i am about to intrust all i have most
valuable on earth to your management your conduct
and language are those a mere bedlamite
last night i made allowance for thy drunken
fury but who can endure thy morning madness 
sit is unsafe for thyself and me wildrake sit
is unkind i might say ungrateful
nay do not say that my friend said the
cavalier with some show feeling and do not
judge me with a severity that cannot apply to
such as i am we who have lost our all in these
sad jars who are compelled to shift for our living
not from day to day but from meal to meal we
whose only hidingplace is the jail whose prospect
 final repose is the gallows what can'st
thou expect from us but to bear such a lot with
 woodstock
a light heart since we should break down under
it with a heavy one 
this was spoken in a tone feeling which
found a responding string in everard's bosom
he took his friend's hand and pressed it kindly
nay if i seemed harsh to thee wild rake
i profess it was for thine own sake more than
mine i know thou hast at the bottom thy
levity as deep a principle honour and feeling
as ever governed a human heart but thou art
thoughtless thou art rash and i protest to
thee that wert thou to betray thyself in this matter
in which i trust thee the evil consequences
to myself would not afflict me more than the
thought putting thee into such danger
nay if you take it on that tone mark
said the cavalier making an effort to laugh evidently
that he might conceal a tendency to a different
emotion thou wilt make children us
both babes and sucklings by the hilt this
bilbo come trust me i can be cautious when
time requires it no man ever saw me drink
when an alert was expected and not one poor
pint wine will i taste until i have managed
woodstock s
this matter for thee well i am thy secretary 
clerk i had forgot and carry thy dispatches to
cromwell taking good heed not to be surprised
or choused out my lump loyalty striking
his finger on the packet and i am to deliver it
to the most loyal hands to which it is most humbly
addressed zooks mark think it a
moment longersurely thou wilt not carry thy
perverseness so far as to strike in with this
bloodyminded rebel bid me give him three
inches my dudgeondagger and i will do if
much more willingly than present him with thy
packets
go to replied everard this is beyond
our bargain if you will help me it is well if not
let me lose no time in debating with thee since
i think every moment an age till the packet is in
the generals possession it is the only way left
me to obtain some protection and a place refuge
for my uncle and his daughter
 that being the case said the cavalier i
will not spare the spur my nag up yonder at
the town will be ready for the road in a trice
and thou mayst reckon on my being with old
t woodstock
noll thy general i mean in as short time as
man and horse may consume betwixt woodstock
and windsor where i think i shall for the present
find thy friend keeping possession where he
has slain
 hush not a word that since we parted
last night i have shaped thee a path which will
suit thee better than to assume the decency 
language and outward manner which thou
hast so little i have acquainted the general that
thou hast been by bad example and bad education

which is to be interpreted by contraries
i hope said wildrake for sure i have been
as well born and bred up as any lad leicestershire
might desire
now i prithee hush thou hast i say by
bad example become at one time a malignant
and mixed in the party the late king but
seeing what things were wrought in the nation by
the general thou hast come to a clearness touching
his calling to be a great implement in the
settlement these distracted kingdoms this
account thee will not only lead him to pass
woodstock 
over some thy eccentricities should they
break out in spite thee but will also give thee
an interest with him as being more especially attached
to his own person 
doubtless said wildrake as every fisher
loves best the trouts that are his own tickling

 it is likely i think he will send thee hither
with letters to me said the colonel enabling
me to put a stop to the proceedings these sequestrators
and to give poor old sir henry lee
permission to linger out his days among the oaks
he loves to look upon i have made it my request
to him and i think my father's friendship
and my own may stretch so far on his regard
without risk cracking especially standing matters
as they now do thou dost understand 
entirely well said the cavalier stretch
quotha i would rather stretch a rope than hold
commerce with the old kingkilling ruffian but
i have said i will be guided by thee markham
and rat me but i will
be cautious then said everard mark
well what he does and says more especially what
p woopstoclc
he does for oliver is one those whose mind
is better known by his actions than by his words
and stay i warrant thee thou wert setting off
without a cross in thy purse 
too true mark said wildrake the last
noble melted last night amongst yonder blackguard
troopers yours
 weil roger replied the colonel that is
easily mended so saying he slipped his purse
into his friend's hand but art thou not an inconsequential
weatherbrained fellow to set forth
as thou wert about to do without anything to bear
thy charges what could'st thou have done
faith i never thought that i must have
cried standi i suppose to the first pursy townsman
or greasy grazier that i met o the heath it
is many a good fellow's shift in these bad times
go to said everard be cautious use
none your loose acquaintance rule your
tongue beware the winepot for there is
little danger if thou could'st only but keep thyself
sober be moderate in speech and forbear
oaths or vaunting
 in short metamorphose myself into such a
u
woodstock 
prig as thou art mark well said wildrake
 so far as outside will go i think i can make
a hopeonhigh bomhy as well as thou canst
ah those were merry days when we saw mills
present bombay at the fortune playhouse mark
ere i had lost my laced cloak and the jewel in my
ear or thou hadst gotten the wrinkle on thy brow
and the puritanic twist thy mustachio 
they were like most worldly pleasures wildrake
replied everard sweet in the mouth and
bitter in digestion but away with thee and
when thou bring'st back my answer thou wilt
find me either here or at saint george's inn at
the little borough good luck to thee be but
cautious how thou dearest thyself
the colonel remained in deep meditation 
 i think he said i have not pledged myself
too far to the general a breach between him
and the parliament seems inevitable and would
throw england back into civil war which all
men are wearied he may dislike my messenger
 a puritanic character in one beaumont and fletchers
plays
vol i k
 woodstock
yet that i do not greatly fear he knows i
would choose such as i can myself depend on
and hath dealt enough with the stricter sort to
be aware that there are among them as well as
elsewhere men who can hide two faces under
one hood
woodstock 
chapter viii
for there in lofty air was seen to stand
the stern protector the conquered land 
drawn in that look with which he wept and swore
turn'd out the members and made fast the door
ridding the house every knave and drone
forced though it grieve his soul to rule alone
the frank courtship crabbe
leaving colonel everard to his meditations
we follow the jolly cavalier his companion who
before mounting at the george did not fail to
treat himself to his morningdraught eggs and
muscadine to enable him to face the harvest
wind
although he had suffered himself to be sunk
in the extravagant license which was practised
by the cavaliers as if to oppose their conduct in
every point to the preciseness their enemies
 woodstock
yet wildrake wellborn and welleducated and
endowed with good natural parts and a heart
which even debauchery and the wild life a
roaring cavalier had not been able entirely to
corrupt moved on his present embassy with a
strange mixture feelings such as perhaps he
had never in his life before experienced
his feelings as a royalist led him to detest cromwell
whom in other circumstances he would scarce
have wished to see except in a field battle
where he could have had the pleasure to exchange
pistolshots with him but with this hatred there
was mixed a certain degree fear always victorious
wherever he fought the remarkable person
whom wildrake was now approaching had
acquired that influence over the minds his enemies
which constant success is so apt to inspire
they dreaded while they hated him and joined
to these feelings was a restless meddling curiosity
which made a particular feature in wildrakes
character who having long had little business
 his own and caring nothing about that
which he had was easily attracted by the desire
woodstock 
 seeing whatever was curious or interesting
around him
i should like to see the old rascal after all
he said were it but to say that i had seen him
he reached windsor in the afternoonand
felt on his arrival the strongest inclination to
take up his residence at some his old haunts
when he had occasionally frequented that fair
town in gayer days but resisting all temptations
 this kind he went courageously to the principal
inn from which its ancient emblem the
garter had long disappeared the master too
whom wildrake experienced in his knowledge
 landlords and hostelries had remembered a
dashing mine host queen bess's school had
now sobered down to the temper the times
shook his head when he spoke the parliament
wielded his spigot with the gravity a priest
conducting a sacrifice wished england a happy
issue out all her afflictions and greatly lauded
his excellency the lord general wildrake
also remarked that his wine was better than it
was wont to be the puritans having an excellent
gift at detecting every fallacy in that matter
 woodstock
and that his measures were less and his charges
larger circumstances which he was induced to
attend to by mine host talking a good deal about
his conscience
he was told by this important personage that
the lord general received frankly all sorts 
persons and that he might obtain access to him
next morning at eight o'clock for the trouble 
presenting himself at the castlegate and announcing
himself as the bearer dispatches to his
excellency
to the castle the disguised cavalier repaired
at the hour appointed admittance was freely
permitted to him by the redcoated soldier who
with austere looks and his musket on his shoulder
mounted guard at the external gate that
noble building wildrake passed through the
under ward or court gazing as he passed upon
the beautiful chapel which had but lately received
in darkness and silence the unhonoured
remains the slaughtered king england
rough as wildrake was the recollection 
this circumstance affected him so strongly that
lie had nearly turned back in a sort horror
woodstock 
rather than face the dark and daring man to
whom amongst all the actors in that melancholyaffair
its tragic conclusion was chiefly to be imputed
but he felt the necessity subduing all
sentiments this nature and compelled himself
to proceed in a negotiation intrusted to his conduct
by one to whom he was so much obliged as colonel
everard at the ascent which passed by the
round tower he looked to the ensignstaff from
which the banner england was wont to float
it was gone with all its rich emblazonry its gorgeous
quarterings and splendid embroidery and
in its room waved that the commonwealth
the cross saint george in its colours blue
and red not yet intersected by the diagonal cross
 scotland which was soon after assumed in
evidence england's conquest over her ancient
enemy this change ensigns increased the train
 his gloomy reflections in which although contrary
to his wont he became so deeply wrapped
that the first thing which recalled him to himself
was the challenge from the sentinel accompanied
with a stroke the butt his musket on the
 woodstock
pavement with an emphasis which made wildrake
start
whither away and who are you
the bearer a packet answered wildrake
to the worshipful the lord general 
stand till i call the officer the guard
the corporal made his appearance distinguished
above those his command by a double
quantity band round his neck a double
height steeplecrowned hat a larger allowance
 cloak and a treble proportion sour gravity
 aspect it might be read on his countenance
that he was one those tremendous enthusiasts
to whom oliver owed his conquests whose religious
zeal made them even more than a match for
the highspirited and highborn cavaliers who
exhausted their valour in vain in defence their
sovereign's person and crown he looked with
grave solemnity at wildrake as if he was making
in his own mind an inventory his features and
dress and having fully perused them he required
 to know his business
my business said wildrake as firmly as he
could for the close investigation this man had
woodstock 
given him some unpleasant nervous sensations
 ray business is with your general
with his excellency the lord general thou
would'st say replied the corporal thy
speech my friend savours too little the reverence
due to his excellency
 d n his excellency was at the lips the
cavalier but prudence kept guard and permitted
not the offensive words to escape the barrier he
only bowed and was silent
 follow me said the starched figure whom
he addressed and wildrake followed him accordingly
into the guardhouse which exhibited an
interior characteristic the times and very different
from what such military stations present
at the present day
by the fire sat two or three musketeers listening
to one who was expounding some religious mystery
to them he began half beneath his breath
but in tones great volubility which tones as he
approached the conclusion became sharp and eager
as challenging either instant answer or silent
acquiescence the audience seemed to listen to
the speaker with immovable features only answering
him with clouds tobaccosmoke which
 woodstock
they rolled from under their thick mustachios on
a bench lay a soldier on his face whether asleep
or in a hit contemplation k was impossible to
decide in the midst the floor stood an officer
as he seemed by his embroidered shoulderbelt and
scarf round his waist otherwise very plainly attired
who was engaged in drilling a stout bumpkin
lately enlisted to the manual as it was then
used the motions and words command were
twenty at the very least and until they were
regularly brought to an the corporal did not
permit wildrake either to sit down or move forward
beyond the threshold the guardhouse
so he had to listen in succession to poize your
musket rest your musket cock your musket
handle your primers and many other forgotten
words discipline until at length the words
 order your musket ended the drill for the
time
thy name friend said the officer to the
recruit when the lesson was over
ephraim answered the fellow with an affect
ed twang through the nose
 and what besides ephraim 

woodstock 
 ephraim cobb from the godly city glocester
where i have dwelt for seven years serving
apprentice to a praise worthy cordwainer
it is a goodly craft answered the officer 
 but casting in thy lot with ours doubt not that
thou shalt be set beyond thine awl and thy last
to boot
a grim smile the speaker accompanied this
poor attempt at a pun and then turning round
to the corporal who stood two paces off with the
face one who seemed desirous speaking
said how now corporal what tidings 
 here is one with a packet and please your
excellency said the corporal surely my
spirit does not rejoice in him seeing i esteem him
as a wolf in sheep's clothing
by these words wildrake learned that he was
in the actual presence the remarkable person
to whom he was commissioned and he paused
to consider in what manner he ought to address
him
the figure oliver cromwell was as is generally
known in no way prepossessing he
was middle stature strong and coarsely made
with harsh and severe features indicative how
 woodstock
ever much natural sagacity and depth 
thought his eyes were grey and piercing his
nose too large in proportion to his other features
his manner speaking when he had the purpose
to make himself distinctly understood was
energetic and forcible though neither graceful
nor eloquent no man could on such occasion
put his meaning into fewer and more decisive
words but when as it often happened he had
a mind to play the orator for the benefit peoples
ears without enlightening their understanding
cromwell was wont to invest his meaning or
that which seemed to be his meaning in such a
mist words surrounding it with so many exclusions
and exceptions and fortifying it with such a
labyrinth parentheses that though one the
most shrewd men in england he was perhaps
tho most unintelligible speaker that ever perplexed
an audience it has been long since said by
the historian that a collection the protector's
speeches would make with a few exceptions the
most nonsensical in the world but he ought
to have added that nothing could be more nervous
concise and intelligible than what he really
intended should be understood
woodstock 
it was also remarked cromwell that though
born a good family both by father and mother
and although he had the usual opportunities 
education and breeding connected with such an
advantage the fanatic democratic ruler could
never acquire or else disdained to practise the
courtesies usually exercised among the higher
classes in their intercourse with each other his
demeanour was so blunt as sometimes might be
termed clownish yet there was in his language
and manner a force and energy corresponding to
his character which impressed awe if it did not
impose respect and there were even times when
that dark and subtle spirit expanded itself so as
almost to conciliate affection the turn for humour
which displayed itself by fits was broad
and a low and sometimes practical character
something there was in his disposition congenial
to that his countrymen a contempt folly a
hatred affectation and a dislike ceremony
which joined to the strong intrinsic qualities 
sense and courage made him in many respects
not an unfit representative the democracy 
england
his religion must always be a subject much
 woodstock
doubt and probably doubt which he himself
could hardly have cleared up unquestionably
there was a time in his life when he was sincerely
enthusiastic and when his natural temper slightly
subject to hypochondria was strongly agitated
by the same fanaticism which influenced so
many persons the time on the other hand
there were periods during his political career
when we certainly do him no injustice in charging
him with hypocritical affectation we shall
probably judge him and others the same age
most truly if we suppose that their religious
professions were partly influential in their own
breast partly assumed in compliance with their
own interest and so ingenious is the human
heart in deceiving itself as well as others that it
is probable neither cromwell himself nor those
making similar pretensions to distinguished piety
could exactly have fixed the point at which their
enthusiasm terminated and their hypocrisy commenced
 or rather it was a point not fixed in itself
but fluctuating with the state health 
good or bad fortune high or low spirits affecting
the individual at the period
such was the celebrated person who turning
woodstock 
round on wildrake and scanning his countenance
closely seemed so little satisfied with what
he beheld that he instinctively hitched forward
his belt so as to bring the handle his tucksword
within his reach but yet folding his arms
in his cloak as if upon second thoughts laying
aside suspicion or thinking precaution beneath
him he asked the cavalier what he was and whence
he came 
a poor gentleman sir that is my lord
answered wildrake last from woodstock
and what may your tidings be sir gentleman
 said cromwell with an emphasis truly
i have seen those most willing to take upon
them that title bear themselves somewhat short
 wise men and good men and true men withall
their gentility yet gentleman was a good
title in old england when men remembered what
it was construed to mean
you say truly sir replied wildrake suppressing
with difficulty some his usual wild
expletives v formerly gentlemen were found in
gentlemen's places but now the world is so changed
that you shall find the broidered belt has
changed place with the under spur leather

woodstock
say'st thou me said the general i profess
thou art a bold companion that can bandy
words so wantonly thou king's somewhat too
loud to be good metal methinks and once
again what are thy tidings with me 
this packet said wildrake commended
to your hands by colonel markham everard
alas i must have mistaken thee answered
cromwell mollified at the mention a man's
name whom he had great desire to make his
own forgive us good friend for such we
doubt not thou art sit thee down and commune
with thyself as thou mayst until we have
examined the contents thy packet let him
be looked to and have what he lacks so saying
the general left the guardhouse where
wildrake took his seat in the corner and awaited
with patience the issue his mission
the soldiers now thought themselves obliged to
treat him with more consideration and offered him
a pipe trinidad and a black jack filled with
october but the look cromwell and the dangerous
situation in which he might be placed by
the least chance detection induced wildrake to
woodstock 
decline these hospitable offers and stretching
back in his chair and affecting slumber he escaped
notice or conversation until a sort aiddecamp
or military officer in attendance came
to summon him to cromwelps presence
by this person he was guided to a posterngate
through which he entered the body the
castle and penetrating through many private
passages and staircases he at length was introduced
into a small cabinet or parlour in which
was much rich furniture some bearing the royal
cypher displayed but all confused and disarranged
together with several paintings in massive
frames having their faces turned towards the wall
as if they had been taken down for the purpose
 being removed
in this scene disorder the victorious general
 the commonwealth was seated in a large
easy chair covered with damask and deeply
embroidered the splendour which made a
strong contrast with the plain and even homely
character his apparel although in look and
action he seemed like one who felt that the seat
which might have in former days held a prince
vol i n
 woodstock
was not too much distinguished for his own fortunes
and ambition wildrake stood before him
nor did he ask him to sit down
 pearson said cromwell addressing himself
to the officer in attendance wait in the gallery
but be within call pearson bowed and was
retiring w ho are in the gallery besides 
worthy mr gordon the chaplain was holding
forth but now to colonel overtop and four
captains your excellency's regiment
we would have it so said the general 
we would not there were any corner in our
dwelling where the hungry soul might not meet
with manna was the good man carried onward
in his discourse 
mightily borne through said pearson
 and he was touching the rightful claims which
the army and especially your excellency hath
acquired by becoming the instruments in the
great work not instruments to be broken asunder
and cast away when the day their service
is over but to be preserved and held precious
and prized for their honourable and faithful labours
for which they have fought and marched
woodstock 
and fasted and prayed and suffered cold and
sorrow while others who would now gladly see
them disbanded and broken and cashiered eat
 the fat and drink the strong
ah good man said cromwell and did
he touch upon this so feelingly i could say
something but not now begone pearson to
the gallery let not our friends lay aside their
swords but watch as well as pray
pearson retired and the general holding the
letter everard in his hand looked again fora
long while fixedly at wildrake as if considering
in what strain he should address him
when he did speak it was at first in one 
those ambiguous discourses which behave already
described and by which it was very difficult for
any one to understand his meaning if indeed
he knew it himself we shall be as concise in
our statement as our desire to give the very
words a man so extraordinary will permit
this letter he said you have brought
us from your master or patron markham everard
 truly an excellent and honourable gentleman
as ever bore a sword upon his thigh and
 woodstock
one who hath ever distinguished himself in the
great work delivering these three poor and
unhappy nations answer me not i know what
thou would'st say and this letter he hath sent
to me by thee his clerk or secretary in whom
he hath confidence and in whom he prays me to
have trust that there may be a careful messenger
between us and lastly he hath sent thee
to me do not answer i know what thou
would'st say to me who albeit i am that
small consideration that it would be too much
honour for me even to bear a albert in this
great and victorious army england am nevertheless
exalted to the rank holding the guidance
and the leadingstaff thereof nay do not
answer my friend i know what thou would'st
say now when communing thus together our
discourse taketh in respect to what i have said
a threefold argument or division first as it
concerned thy master secondly as it concerned
us and our office thirdly and lastly as it
touched thyself now as concerning this good
and worthy gentleman colonel markham everard
truly he hath played the man from the bewoodstock

ginning these unhappy buffetings not turning
to the right or to the left but holding ever in
his eye the mark at which he aimed ay truly
a faithful honourable gentleman and one who
may well call me friend and truly i am pleased
to think that he doth so nevertheless in this
vale tears we must be governed less by our
private respects and partialities than by those
higher principles and points duty whereupon
the good colonel markham everard hath ever
framed his purposes as truly i have endeavoured
to form mine that we may all act as becometh
good englishmen and worthy patriots
then as for woodstock it is a great thing which
the good colonel asks that it should be taken
from the spoil the godly and left in keeping
 the men moab and especially the malignant
henry lee whose hand hath been ever
against us when he might find room to raise it 
i say he hath asked a great thing both in respect
 himself and me for we this poor but
godly army england are holden by these
 the parliament as men who should render in
spoil for them but be no sharer it ourselves 
even as the buck which the hounds pull to earth
 woodstock
furmsheth no part their own food but they are
lashed off from the carcase with whips like those
which require punishment for their forwardness
not reward for their services yet i speak not
this so much in respect this grant woodstock
in regard that perhaps their lordships
 the council and also the committeemen 
this parliament may graciously think they have
given me a portion in the matter in relation that
my kinsman desborough hath an interest allowed
him therein which interest as he hath well deserved
it for his true and faithful service to these
unhappy and devoted countries so it would ill
become me to diminish the same to his prejudice
unless it were upon great and public respects
thus thou seest how it stands with me my honest
friend and in what mind i stand touching
this thy master's request to me which yet i do
not say that i can altogether or unconditionally
grant or refuse but only tell my simple thoughts
with regard thereto thou understands me i
doubt not
now roger wildrake with all the attention
he had been able to pay to the lord general's
speech had got so much confused among the
woodstock 
various clauses the harangue that his brainwas
bewildered like that a country clown
when he chances to get himself involved among
a crowd carriages and cannot stir a step to
get out the way one's them without being
in danger being ridden over by the others
the general saw his look perplexity and
began a new oration to the same purpose as before
 spoke his love for his kind friend the
colonel his regard for his pious and godly
kinsman master desborough the great importance
 the palace and park woodstock the
determination the parliament that it should
be confiscated and the produce brought into the
coffers the state his own deep veneration for
the authority parliament and his no less deep
sense the injustice done to the army how it
was his wish and will that all matters should be
settled in an amicable and friendly manner without
selfseeking debate or strife betwixt those
who had been the hands acting and such as
had been the heads governing in that great national
cause how he was willing truly willing
to contribute to this work by laying down not
his commission only but his life also if it were
 woodstock
requested him or could be granted with safety
to the poor soldiers to whom silly poor men he
was bound to be as a father seeing that they
had followed him with the duty and affection 
children
and here he arrived at another dead pause
leaving wildrake as uncertain as before whether
it was or was not his purpose to grant
colonel everard the powers he had asked for
the protection woodstock against the parliamentary
commissioners internally he began
to entertain hopes that the justice heaven or
the effects remorse had confounded the regicide's
understanding but no he could see
nothing but sagacity in that steady stern eye
which while the tongue poured forth its periphrastic
language in such profusion seemed to
watch with severe accuracy the effect which his
oratory produced on the listener
egad thought the cavalier to himself
becoming a little familiar with the situation in
which he was placed and rather impatient a
conversation which led to no visible conclusion
or termination if noll were the devil himself
woodstock 
as he is the devil's darling i will not be thus
noseled by him i'll e'en brusque it a little if
he goes on at this rate and try if i can bring
him to a more intelligible mode speaking
entertaining this bold purpose but half afraid
to execute it wildrake lay by for an opportunity
 making the attempt while cromwell was
apparently unable to express his own meaning
he was already beginning a third panegyric upon
colonel everard with sundry varied expressions
 his own wish to oblige him when wildrake
took the opportunity a pause to strike in on
the general's making one his oratorical pauses
so please you he said bluntly your word
ship has already spoken on two topics your
discourse your own worthiness and that my
master colonel everard but to enable me todo
mine errand it would be necessary to bestow
a few words on the third head
the third said cromwell
ay said wildrake which in your honour's
subdivision your discourse touched on
my unworthy self what am i to do what portion
am i to have in this matter 
 woodstock
oliver started at once from the tone voice he
had hitherto used and which somewhat resembled
the purring a domestic cat into the growl
 the tiger when about to spring thy portion
jailbird he exclaimed the gallows 
thou shalt hang as high as human if thou betray
counsel but he added softening his voice
keep it like a true man and my favour will bethe
making thee come hither thou art bold
i see though somewhat saucy thou hast been a
malignant so writes my worthy friend colonel
everard but thou hast now given up that falling
cause i tell thee friend not all that the parliament
or the army could do would have pulled
down the stuart out their high places saving
that heaven had a controversy with them well
it is a sweet and comely thing to buckle on one's
armour in behalf heaven's cause otherwise
truly for mine own part these men might have
remained upon the throne even unto this day
neither do i blame any for aiding them until
these successive great judgments have overwhelmed
them and their house i am not a
bloody man having in me the feeling human
woodstock 
frailty but friend whosoever putteth his hand
to the plough in the great actings which are now
on foot in these nations had best beware that
they do not look back for rely upon my simple
word that if you fail me i will not spare on you
one foot's length the gallows human let
me therefore know at a word if the leaven thy
malignancy is altogether drubbed out thee 
your honourable lordship said the cavalier
shrugging up his shoulders has done that
for most us so far as cudgelling to some tune
can perform it
say'st thou said the general with a grim
smile on his lip which seemed to intimate that
he was not quite inaccessible to flattery yea
truly thou dost not lie in that we have been an
instrument neither are we as i have already
hinted so severely bent against those who have
striven against us as malignant as others may be
the parliamentmen best know their own interest
and their own pleasure but to my poor
thinking it is full time to close these jars and to
allow men all kinds the means doing service
to their country and we think it will be thy fault
sod
woodstock
if thou art not employed to good purpose for the
state and thyself on condition thou protest away
the old man entirely from thee and gives thy
earnest attention to what i have to tell thee
your lordship need not doubt my attentions
said the cavalier
and the republican general after another
pause as one who gave his confidence not without
hesitation proceeded to explain his views
with a distinctness which he seldom used yet
not without his being a little biassed now and
then by'his long habits circumlocution which
indeed he seldom laid entirely aside save in the
field battle
thou seest he said my friend how
things stand with me the parliament i care
not who knows it love me not still less do the
council state by whom they manage the executive
government the kingdom i cannot
tell why they nourish suspicion against me unless
it is because i will not deliver this poor innocent
army which has followed me in so many
military actions to be now pulled asunder broken
piecemeal and reduced so that they who
woodstock 
have protected the state at the expense their
blood will not have perchance the means 
feeding themselves by their labour which methinks
were hard measure since it is taking
from esau his birthright even without giving
him a poor mess pottage
esau is likely to help himself i think replied
wildrake
truly thou say'st wisely replied the general
 it is ill starving an armed man if there
is food to be had for taking nevertheless far be
it from me to encourage rebellion or want due
subordination to these our rulers i would only
petition in a due and becoming a sweet and harmonious
manner that they would listen to our
conditions and consider our necessities but sir
looking on me and esteeming m so little as they
do you must think that it would be a provocation
in me towards the council state as well
as the parliament if simply to gratify your worthy
master i were to act contrary to their purposes
or deny currency to the commission under
their authority which is as yet the highest
in the state and long may it be so for me to
carry on the sequestration which they intend
soc woodstock
and would it not also be said that i was lending
myself to the malignant interest affording this
den the bloodthirsty and lascivious tyrants 
yore to be in this our day a place refuge to
that old and inveterate amalekite sir henry lee
to keep possession the place in which he hath
so long glorified himself truly it would be a
perilous matter
 am i then to reports said wild rake an
if it please you that you cannot stead colonel
everard in this matter 
 unconditionally aybut taken conditionally
the answer may be otherwise answered
cromwell i see thou art not able to fathom
my purpose and therefore i will partly unfold
it to thee but take notice that should thy
tongue betray my council save in so far as carrying
it to thy master by all the blood which has
been shed in these wild times thou shalt die a
thousand deaths in one 
do not fear me sir said wildrake whose
natural boldness and carelessness character was
for the present time borne down and quelled like
that falcons in the presence the eagle
hear me then said cromwell and let
woodstock son
no syllable escape thee knowest thou not the
young lee whom they call albert a malignant
like his father and one who went up with the
young man to that last ruffle which we had with
him at worcester may we be grateful for the
victory 
i know there is such a young gentleman as
albert lee said wildrake
and knowest thou not i speak not by way
 prying into the good coroners secrets but only
as it behoves me to know something the matter
that i may best judge how i am to serve him 
knowest thou not that thy master markham
everard is a suitor after the sister this same
malignant a daughter the old keeper called
sir henry lee 
all this i have heard said wildrake nor
can i deny that i believe in it
well then go to when the young man
charles stuart fled from the field worcester
and was by sharp chase and pursuit compelled to
separate himself from his followers i know by
sure intelligence that this albert lee was one 
the last who remained with him if not indeed the
very last
 woodstock
it was devilish like him said the cavalier
without sufficiently weighing his expressions considering
in what presence they were to be uttered
 and i'll uphold him with my rapier to bea
true chip the old block
ha dearest thou said the general is
this thy reformation 
i never swear so please you replied wildrake
recollecting himself except there is some
mention malignant and cavaliers in my hearing
 and then the old habit returns and i swear
like one goring's troopers
out upon thee said the general what
can it avail thee to practise a profanity so horrible
to the ears others and which brings no
emolument to him who uses it 
there are doubtless more profitable sins in the
world than the vice swearing was the answer
which rose to the lips the cavalier but that was
exchanged for a profession regret for having
given offence the truth was the discourse began
to take a turn which rendered it more interesting
than ever to wildrake who therefore determined
not to lose the opportunity for obtaining posseswoodstock

sion the secret that seemed to be suspended
on cromwelps lips and that could only be
through means keeping guard upon his own
what sort a house is woodstock said
the general abruptly
an old mansion said wildrake in reply 
and so far as i could judge by a single night's
lodgings having abundance backstairs also
subterranean passages and all the communications
under ground which are common in old
ravennests the sort
and places for concealing priests unquestionably
said cromwell it is seldom that such
ancient houses lack secret stalls wherein to mew
up these calves bethel
your honour's excellency said wildrake
 may swear to that
 i swear not at all replied the general drily
 but what think'st thou good fellow i will
ask thee a blunt question where will those two
worcester fugitives that thou hottest be mcm'e
likely to take shelter and that they must be
sheltered somewhere i well know than in this
same old palace with all the corners and concealvol
i o
sio woodstock
ments whereof young albert hath been acquainted
ever since his earliest infancy 
truly said wildrake making an effort to
answer the question with seeming indifference
while the possibility such an event and its consequences
flashed fearfully upon his mind 
truly i should be your honour's opinion
but that i think the company who by the
commission parliament have occupied woodstock
are likely to fright them thence as a cat
scares doves from a pigeonhouse the neighbourhood
with reverence generals lesbos
and harrison will suit ill with fugitives
from worcesterfield
i thought as much and so indeed would i
have it answered the general long may it be
ere our names shall be aught but a terror to our
enemies but in this matter if thou art an active
plotter for thy master's interest thou might st i
should think work out something favourable to
his present object
my brain is too poor to reach the depth 
your honourable purpose said wildrake
 listen then and let it be to profit answered
cromwell assuredly the conquest at wore

chester was a great and crowning'mercy yet might
we seem to be but small in our thankfulness for
the same did we not do what in us lies towards
the ultimate improvement and final conclusion 
the great work which has been thus prosperous in
our hands professing in pure humility and singleness
 heart that we do not in any way desire
our instrumentality to be remembered nay
would rather pray and entreat that our name and
fortunes were forgotten than that the great work
were in itself incomplete nevertheless truly
placed as we now are it concerns us more nearly
than others that is if so poor creatures should
at all speak themselves as concerned whether
more or less with these changes which have been
wrought around not i say by ourselves or our
own power but by the destiny to which we were
called fulfilling the same with all meekness and
humility i say it concerns us nearly that all
things should be done in conformity with the
great work which hath been wrought and is yet
working in these lands such is my plain and
simple meaning nevertheless it is much to be
desired that this young man this king scots
 woodstock
as he called himself this charles stuart should
not escape forth from the nation where his arrival
has wrought so much disturbance and bloodshed

i have no doubt said the cavalier looking
down that your lordship's wisdom hath directed
all things as they may best lead towards such
a consummation and i pray your pains may be
paid as they deserve
 i thank thee friend said cromwell with
much humility doubtless we shall meet our
reward being in the hands a good paymaster
who never passeth saturday night but understand
me friend i desire no more than my own
share in the good work i would heartily do
what poor kindness i can to your worthy master
and even to you in your degree for such as i do
not converse with ordinary men that our presence
may be forgotten like an everyday's occurrence
we speak to men like thee for their reward or
their punishment and i trust it will be the former
which thou in thine office wilt merit at my
hand
woodstock 
your honour said wildrake speaks like
one accustomed to command
true men's minds are likened to those 
my degree by fear and reverence said the general
 but enough that desiring as i do no
other dependency on my special person than is
alike to us all upon that which is above us but
i would desire to cast this golden ball into your
master's cap he hath served against this charles
stuart and his father but he is a kinsman near
to the old knight lee and stands well affected
towards his daughter thou also wilt keep a
watch my friend that ruffling look thine will
procure thee the confidence every malignant
and the prey cannot approach this cover as
though to shelter like a coney in the rocks but
thou wilt be sensible his presence
i make a shift to comprehend your excellency
said the cavalier and i thank you
heartily for the good opinion you have put upon
me and which i pray i may have some handsome
opportunity deserving that i may show
my gratitude by the event but still with reverence
your excellency's scheme seems unlikely
while woodstock remains in possession the
 woodstock
sequestrated both the old knight and his son
and far more such a fugitive as your honour hinted
at will take special care not to approach it till
they are removed
it is for that i have been dealing with thee
thus long said the general i told thee that
i was something unwilling upon slight occasion
to dispossess the sequestrated by my own proper
warrant although having perhaps sufficient authority
in the state both to do so and to despise
the murmurs those who blame me in brief
i would be loath to tamper with my privileges
and make experiments between their strength
and the powers the commission granted by
others without need or at least great prospect 
advantage so if thy colonel will undertake for
his love the republic to find the means 
preventing its worst and nearest danger which
must needs occur from the escape this young
man and will do his endeavour to stay him incase
his flight should lead him to woodstock
which i hold very likely i will give thee an order
to these sequestrated to evacuate the palace
instantly and to the text troop my regiment
which lies at oxford to turn them out by the
woodstock 
shoulders if they make any scruples ay even
for example's sake if they drag desborough out
foremost though he be wedded to my sister
so please you sir said wildrake and
with your most powerful warrant i trust i might
expel the commissioners even without the aid
 your most warlike and devout troopers
that is what i am least anxious about replied
the general i should like to see the best
 them sit after i had nodded to them to begone
 always excepting the worshipful house
in whose name our commissions run but who as
some think will be done with politics ere it be
time to renew them therefore what chiefly
concerns me to know is whether thy master
will embrace a traffic which hath such a fair
promise profit with it i am well convinced
that with a scout like thee who hast been in the
cavaliers quarters and canst i should guess
resume thy drinking ruffianly healthquaffing
manners whenever thou hast a mind he must
discover where this stuart hath ensconced himself
either the young lee will visit the old
one in person or he will write to him or hold
 woodstock
communication with him by letter at all events
markham everard and thou must have an eye
in every hair your head while he spoke a
flush passed over his brow he rose from his chair
and paced the apartment in agitation woe
to you if you suffer the young adventurer to
escape me you had better be in the deepest
dungeon in europe than breathe the air england
should you but dream playing me false
i have spoken freely to thee fellow more freely
than is my wont the time required it but to
share my confidence is ike keeping a watch over
a powdermagazine the least and most insignificant
spark blows thee to ashes tell your master
what i said but not how i said it fie
that i should have been betrayed into the distemperature
 passion begone sirrah pearson
shall bring thee sealed orders yet stay
thou hast something to ask
i would know sid wildrake to whom
the visible anxiety the general gave some
confidence what is the figure this young
gallant in case i should find him 
a tall rawboned swarthy lad they say
woodstock 
he has shot up into here is his picture by a
good hand some time since he turned round
one the portraits which stood with its face
against the wall but it proved not to be that 
charles the second but his unhappy father
the first motion cromwell indicated a purpose
 hastily replacing the picture and it seemed
as if an effort was necessary to repress his disinclination
to look upon it but he did repress
it and placing the picture against the wall withdrew
slowly and sternly as if in defiance his
own feeling he was determined to gain a place
from which to see it to advantage it was well for
wildrake that his dangerous companion had not
turned an eye on him for his blood also kindled
when he saw the portrait his master in the
hands the chief author his death being a
fierce and desperate man he commanded his passion
with great difficulty and if on its first violence
he had been provided with a suitable weapon
it is possible cromwell would never have
ascended higher in his bold ascent towards supreme
power
but this natural and sudden flash indignant
woodstock
lion which rushed through the veins an ordinary
man like wildrake was presently subdued
when confronted with the strong yet stifled emotion
displayed by so powerful a character as
cromwell as the cavalier looked on his dark
and bold countenance agitated by inward and
indescribable feelings he found his own violence
 spirit die away and lose itself in fear and
wonder so true it is that as greater lights
swallow up and extinguish the display those
which are less so men great capacious and
overruling minds bear aside and subdue in
their climax passion the more feeble wills
and passions others as when a river joins a
brook the fiercer torrent shoulders aside the
smaller stream
wildrake stood a silent inactive and almost
a terrified spectator while cromwell assuming
a firm sternness eye and manner as one who
compels himself to look on what some strong internal
feeling renders painful and disgustful to
him proceeded in brief and interrupted expressions
but yet with a firm voice to comment on
the portrait the late king his words seemed
woodstock 
less addressed to wildrake than to be the spontaneous
unburthening his own bosom swelling
under recollection the past and anticipation
 the future
that flemish painter he said that antonio
vandyke what a power he has steel
may mutilate warriors may waste and destroy 
still the king stands uninjured by time and our
grandchildren while they read his history may
look on his image and compare the melancholy
features with the woful tale it was a stern necessity
 it was an awful deed the calm pride
 that eye might have ruled worlds crouching
frenchmen or supple italians or formal spaniards
but its glances only roused the native
courage the stern englishman slay not on
poor sinful man whose breath is in his nostrils
the blame that he falls when heaven never gave
him strength nerves to stand the weak rider
is thrown by his unruly horse and trampled to
death the strongest man the best cavalier
springs to the empty saddle and uses bit and
spur till the fiery horse knows its master who
blames him who mounted aloft rides triumphs
 woodstock
aptly amongst the people for having succeeded
where the unskilful and feeble fell and died
verily he hath his reward then what is that
piece painted canvass to me more than others 
no let him show to others the reproaches 
that cold calm face that proud yet complaining
eye those who have acted on higher respects
have no cause to start at painted shadows not
wealth nor power brought me from my obscurity
the oppressed consciences the injured
liberties england were the banner that i followed

he raised his voice so high as if pleading in
his own defence before some tribunal that pearson
the officer in attendance looked into the
apartment and observing his master with his
eyes kindling his arm extended his foot advanced
and his voice raised like a general in
the act commanding the advance his army
he instantly withdrew
it was other than selfish regards that drew
me forth to action continued cromwell and
i dare the world ay living or dead i challenge
to assert that i armed for a private cause or
woodstock 
as a means enlarging my fortunes neither
was there a trooper in the regiment who came
there with less evil will to yonder unhappy
 
at this moment the apartment opened and a
gentlewoman entered who from her resemblance
to the general although her features were soft
and feminine might be immediately recognised
as his daughter she walked up to cromwell
gently but firmly passed her arm through his
and said to him in a persuasive tone father
this is not well you have promised me this
should not happen
the general hung down his head like one
who was either ashamed the passion to which
he had given way or the influence which was
exercised over him he yielded however to
the affectionate impulse and left the apartment
without again turning his head towards the portrait
which had so much affected him
 woodstock
chapter 
doctorego to go to you have known what you should not
macbeth
wildrake was left in the cabinet astonished
and alone it was often noised about that cromwell
the deep and sagacious statesman the
calm and intrepid commander he who had overcome
such difficulties and ascended to such
heights that he seemed already to bestride the
land which he had conquered had like many
other men great genius a constitutional taint
 melancholy which sometimes displayed itself
both in words and actions and had been first
observed in that sudden and striking change
when abandoning entirely the dissolute freaks
 his youth he embraced a very strict course 
woodstock 
religious observances which upon some occasions
he seemed to consider as bringing him into
more near and close contact with the spiritual
world this extraordinary man is said sometimes
during that period his life to have
given way to spiritual delusions or as he himself
conceived them prophetic inspirations 
approaching grandeur and strange deep and
mysterious agencies in which he was in future to
be engaged in the same manner as his younger
years had been marked by fits exuberant and
excessive frolic and debaucheries something 
this kind seemed to explain the ebullitions 
passion which he had now manifested
with wonder at what he had witnessed wildrake
felt some anxiety on his own account though
not the most reflecting mortals he had sense
enough to know that it is dangerous to be a witness
 the infirmities men high in power and
he was left so long by himself as induced him to
entertain some secret doubts whether the general
might not be tempted to take means confining
or removing a witness who had seen him lowered
as it seemed by the suggestions his own
 woodstock
conscience beneath that lofty flight which in
general he affected to sustain above the rest 
the sublunary world
in this however he wronged cromwell who
was free either from an extreme degree jealous
suspicion or from anything which approached
towards bloodhastiness pearson appeared
after lapse about an hour and intimating to
wildrake that he was to follow conducted him
into a distant apartment in which he found the
general seated on a low couch his daughter
was in the apartment but remained at some distance
seemed busied with some female work and
scarce turned her head as pearson and wildrake
entered
at a sign from the lord general wildrake
approached him as before friend he said
your old friends the cavaliers look on me as
their enemy and conduct themselves towards meas
if they desired to make me such i profess
they are labouring to their own prejudice for i
regard and have ever regarded them as honest
and honourable fools who were silly enough to
run their necks into nooses and their heads
woodstock 
against stonewalls that a man called stuart and
no other should be king over them fools 
are there no words made letters that would
sound as well as charles stuart with that magic
title beside them why the word king is like
a lighted lamp that throws the same bright gilding
upon any combination the alphabet and
yet you must shed your blood for a name but
thou for thy part shalt have no wrong from me
here is an order well warranted to clear the
lodge at woodstock and abandon it to thy master's
keeping or those whom he shall appoint
he will have his uncle and pretty cousin with
him doubtless fare thee well think on what
i told thee they say beauty is a loadstone
to yonder long lad thou dost wot but i
reckon he has other stars at present to direct his
course than bright eyes and fair hair be it as
it may thou knowest my purpose peer out
peer out keep a constant and careful lookout
on every ragged patch that wanders by hedgerow
or lane these are days when a beggar's
cloak may cover a king's ransom there are
some broad portugal pieces for thee something

 woodstock
strange to thy pouch i ween once more think
on what thou hast heard and he added in a
lower and more impressive tone voice forget
what thou hast seen my service to thy master
 and yet once again rememberaxid jbr
get wildrake made his obeisance and returning
to his inn left windsor with all possible
speed
it was afternoon in the same day when the
cavalier rejoined his roundhead friend who was
anxiously expecting him at the inn in woodstock
appointed for their rendezvous
where hast thou been what hast thou
seen what strange uncertainty is in thy looks 
and why dost thou not answer me 
 because said wildrake laying aside his
riding cloak and rapier you ask so many
questions at once a man has but one tongue
to answer with and mine is well nigh glued to
the roof my mouth
will drink unloosen it said the colonel 
though i dare say thou hast tried that spell at
every alehouse on the road call for what thou
would'st have man only be quick
woodstock iati
 colonel everard answered wildrake i
have not tasted so much as a cup cold water
this day
then thou art out humour for that reason
said the colonel salve thy sore with
brandy if thou wilt but leave being so fantastic
and unlike to thyself as thou slowest in this
silent mood
colonel everard replied the cavalier very
gravely i am an altered man
i think thou dost alter every day in the
year and every hour the day come good
now tell me hast thou seen the general and got
his warrant for clearing out the sequestrated
from woodstock
i have seen the devil said wildrake and
hast as thou sayst got a warrant from him
give it me hastily said everard catching
at the packet
forgive me mark said wildrake if
thou knowest the purpose with which this deed
is granted if thou knowest what is not my
purpose to tell thee what manner hopes are
founded on thy accepting it i have that opinion
 woodstock
 thee mark everard that thou would'st as soon
take a redhot horse shoe from the anvil with thy
bare hand as receive into it this slip paper
come comes said everard this comes 
some your exalted ideas loyalty which
excellent within certain bounds drive us mad
when encouraged up to some heights do not
think since i must needs speak plainly with thee
that i see without sorrow the downfall our
ancient monarchy and the substitution another
form government in its stead but
ought my regret for the past to prevent my acquiescing
and aiding in such measures as are
likely to settle the future the royal cause is
ruined hadst thou and every cavalier in england
sworn the contrary ruined not to rise again
for many a day at least the parliament so
often draughted and drained those who were
courageous enough to maintain their own freedom
 opinion is now reduced to a handful 
statesmen who have lost the respect the people
from the length time during which they
have held the supreme management affairs
they cannot stand long unless they were to
woodstock j
reduce the army and the army late servants
are now masters and will refuse to be reduced
they know their strength and that they maybe
an army subsisting on pay and free quarters
throughout england as long as they will i tell
thee wildrake unless we look to the only man
who can rule and manage them we may expect
military law throughout the land and i for
mine own part look for any preservation our
privileges that may be vouchsafed to us only
through the wisdom and forbearance cromwell
now you have my secret you are aware
that i am not doing the best i would but the
best i can i wish not so ardently as thou
perhaps yet i do wish that the king could have
been restored on good terms composition safe
for us and for himself and now good wildrake
rebel as thou thickest me make me no
worse a rebel than an unwilling one god knows
i never laid aside love and reverence to the king
even in drawing my sword against his ill advisers

ah plague on you said wildrake that
is the very cant itthat's what yoh all say
 woodstock
all you fought against the king in pure love
and loyalty and not otherwise however i see
your drift and i own that i like it better than
i expected the army is your bear now and
old noll is your bear ward and you are like a
country constable who makes interest with the
bernard that he may prevent him from letting
bruin loose well there may come a day when
the sun will shine on our side the fence and
thereon shall you and all the good fairweather
folks who love the stronger party come and
make common cause with us
without much attending to what his friend
said colonel everard carefully studied the warrant
 cromwell it is bolder and more peremptory
than i expected he said the general
must feel himself strong when he opposes
his own authority so directly to that the council
 state and the parliament
 you will not hesitate to act upon it said
wildrake
 that i certainly will not answered everard
 but i must wait till i have the assistance
 the mayor who i think will gladly see these
woodstock si
fellows ejected from the lodge i must not go
altogether upon military authority if possible
then stepping to the door the apartment he
dispatched a servant the house in quest the
chief magistrate desiring he should be made
acquainted that colonel everard desired to see
bim with as little loss time as possible
you are sure he will come like a dog at a
whistle said wildrake the word captain
or colonel makes the fat citizen trot in these
days when one sword is worth fifty corporation
charters but there are dragoons yonder as
well as the grimfaced knave whom i frightened
the other evening when i showed my face in at
the window think'st thou the knaves will show
no rough play 
 the general's warrant will weigh more with
them than a dozen acts parliament said everard
 but it is time thou latest if thou hast
in truth ridden from windsor hither without
baiting
i care not about it said wildrake i
hell thee your general gave me a breakfast
svhich i think will serve me one while if i ever
 woodstock
am able to digest it by the mass it lay so heavy
on my conscience that i carried it to church to
see if i could digest it there with my other sins
but not a avait
to church to the door the church
thou meanest said everard i know thy way
thou art ever wont to pull thy hat off reverently
at the threshold but for crossing it that
day seldom comes
well replied wildrake and if i do pull
off my castor and kneel is it not seemly to show
the same respects in a church which we offer
in a palace it is a dainty matter is it not
to see your anabaptists and brownish and the
rest you gather to a sermon with as little
ceremony as hogs to a trough but here comes
food and now for a grace if i can remember
one
everard was too much interested about the
fate his uncle and his fair cousin and the prospect
 restoring them to their quiet home under
the protection that formidable truncheon which
was already regarded as the leadingstaff england
to remark that certainly a great alteration
woodstock 
had taken place in the manners and outward
behaviour at least his companion his demeanour
frequently evinced a sort struggle
betwixt old habits indulgence and some newly
formed resolutions abstinence and it was
almost ludicrous to see how often the hand 
the neophyte directed itself naturally to a large
black leathern jack which contained two double
flagons strong ale and how often diverted
from its purpose by the better reflections the
reformed toper it seized instead upon a lai'gc
ewer salubrious and pure water 
it was easy to see that the task sobriety
was not yet become easy and that if it had the
recommendation the intellectual portion 
the party who had resolved upon it the outward
man yielded a reluctant and restive compliance
but honest wildrake had been dreadfully frightened
at the course proposed to him by cromwell
and with a feeling not peculiar to the catholic
religion had formed a solemn resolution
within his own mind that if he came off safe and
with honour from this dangerous interview he
would show his sense heavens favour by
s woodstock
renouncing some the sins which most easily
beset him and especially that intemperance
to which like many his wild compeers he was
too much addicted
this resolution or vow was partly prudential
as well as religious for it occurred to him as
very possible that some matters a difficult and
delicate nature might be thrown into his hands
at the present emergency during the conduct
 which it would be fitting for him to act by
some better oracle than that the bottle celebrated
by rabelais in full compliance with this
prudent determination he touched neither the
ale nor the brandy which was placed before him
and declined peremptorily the sack with which
his friend would have garnished the board nevertheless
just as the boy removed the trenchers
and napkins together with the large black jack
which we have already mentioned and was one
or two steps on his way to the door the sinewy
arm the cavalier which seemed to elongate
itself on purpose as it extended far beyond the
folds the threadbare jacket arrested the progress
 the retiring ganymede and seizing on
woodstock 
the black jack conveyed it to the lips which were
gently breathing forth the aspiration d n
i mean heaven forgive me ewe are poor
creatures clay one modest sip must be permitted
to our frailty
so murmuring he glued the huge flagon to
his lips and as the head was slowly and gradually
inclined backwards in proportion as the
right hand elevated the bottom the pitcher
everard had great doubts whether the drinker
and the cup were likely to part until the whole
contents the latter had been transferred to the
person the former roger wildrake stinted
however when by a moderate computation he
had swallowed at one draught about a quart and
a half
he then replaced it on the salver fetched a
long breath to refresh his lungs bade the boy
get him gone with the rest the liquors in a
tone which inferred some dread his constancy
and then turning to his friend everard he expatiated
in praise moderation observing that
the mouthful which he had just taken had been
 more service to him than if he had remained
sc woodstock
quaffing healths at table for four hours together

his friend made no reply but could not help
being privately opinion that wildrakes temperance
had done as much execution on the tankard
in his single draught as some more moderate
topers might have effected if they had sat
sipping for an evening but the subject was
changed by the entrance the landlord who
came to announce to his honour colonel everard
that the worshipful mayor woodstock
with the rev master holdenough were come
to wait upon him
woodstock s
chapter x
 here have we one head
upon two bodies your twoheaded bullock
is but an ass to such a prodigy
these two have but one meaning thought and counsel 
and when the single noddle has spoke out
the four legs scrape assent to it
old play
in the goodly form the honest mayor there
was a bustling mixture importance and embarrassment
like the deportment a man who was
conscious that he had an important part to act
if he could but exactly discover what that part
was but both were mingled with much pleasure
at seeing everard and he frequently repeated
his welcomes and allhails before he could be
brought to attend to what that gentleman said in
reply
good worthy colonel you are indeed a desirable
sight to woodstock at all times being as
i may say almost our townsman as you have
 woodstock
tlwelt so much and so long at the palace truly
the matter begins almost to pass my wit though
i have transacted the affairs this borough for
many a long day and you are come to my assistance
like like
tanquam deus ex machina as the ethnic
poet hath it said master holdenough although
i do not often quote from such books
master markham everard or worthy
colonel as i ought rather to say you are simply
the most welcome man who has come to
woodstock since the days old king harry
 i had some business with you my good
friend said the colonel addressing the mayor
i shall be glad if it should so happen at the
same time that i may find occasion to pleasure
you or your worthy pastor
 no question you can do so good sir interposed
master holdenough you have the heart
sir and you have the hand and we are much in
want good counsel and that from a man action
i am aware worthy colonel that you and
your worthy father have ever borne yourselves
in these turmoils like men a truly christian
and moderate spirit striving to pour oil into the
woodstock 
wounds the land which some would rub with
vitriol and pepper and we know you are faithful
children the church we have reformed
from its papistical and prelatical tenets
 my good and reverend friend said everard
 i respect the piety and learning many
 your teachers but i am also for liberty 
conscience to all men i neither side with sectaries
nor do i desire to see them the object 
suppression by violence
 sir sir said the presbyterian hastily all
this hath a fair sound but i would you should
think what a fine country and church we are like
to have it amidst the errors blasphemies and
schisms which are daily introduced into the
church and kingdom england so that worthy
master edwards in his gangrene declared that
our native country is about to become the very
sink and cesspool all schisms heresies blasphemies
and confusions as the army hannibal
was said to be the refuse au naiionscouuvies
omnium gentium believe me worthy colonel
that they the honourable house view all this
over lightly and with the winking connivance 
 woodstock
old eli these instructors the schismatics shoulder
the orthodox ministers out their pulpits
thrust themselves into families and break up the
peace thereof stealing away men's hearts from
the established faith
 my good master holdenough replied the
colonel interrupting the zealous preacher there
is ground sorrow for all these unhappy discords
 and i hold with you that the fiery spirits
 the present time have raised men's minds at
once above soberminded and sincere religion
and above decorum and common sense but
there is no help save patience enthusiasm is a
stream that may foam off in its own time whereas
it is sure to bear down every barrier which is
directly opposed to it but what are these schismatical
proceedings to our present purpose 
why partly this sir said holdenough
although perhaps you may make less it than
i should have thought before we met i was
myself i nehemiah holdenough he added
consequentially was forcibly expelled from my
own pulpit even as a man should have been
thrust out his own house by an alien and
 
woodstock 
an intruder a wolf who was not at the trouble
even to put on sheep's clothing but came in
his native wolfish attire buff and bandalier
and held forth in my stead to the people who
are to me as a flock to the lawful shepherd it
is too true sir master mayor saw it and strove
to take such order to prevent it as man might
though turning to the mayor i think still you
might have striven a little more
good now good master holdenough do not
let us go back on that question said the mayor
guy warwick or bevis hampton might
do something with this generation but truly
they are too many and too strong for the mayor
 woodstock
i think master mayor speaks very good
sense said the colonel if the independents
are not allowed to preach i fear me they will not
fight and then if you were to have another rising
 cavaliers 
there are worse folks may rise than cavaliers
said holdenough
how sir replied colonel everard let
vol i q
 woodstock
me remind you master holdenough that is no
safe language in the present state the nation
i say said the presbyterian there are
worse folks may rise than cavaliers and i will
prove what i say the devil is worse than the
worst cavalier that ever drunk a health or swore
an oath and the devil has arisen at woodstock
lodge 
ay truly hath he said the mayor bodily
and visibly in figure and form an awful
time we live in 
 gentlemen i really know not how i am to
understand you said everard
why it was even about the devil we came
to speak with you said the mayor but the
worthy minister is always so hot upon the sectaries

which are the devil's brats and nearly akin
to him said master holdenough but true it
is that the growth these sects has brought up
the evil one even upon the face the earth to
look after his own interest where he finds it most
thriving
master holdenough said the colonel if
woodstock 
you speak figuratively i have already told you
that i have neither the means nor the skill sufficient
to temper these religious heats but if you
design to say that there has been an actual apparition
 the devil i presume to think that you
with your doctrine and your learning would bea
fitter match for him than a soldier like me
true sir and i have that confidence in the
commission which i hold that i would take the
field against the foul fiend without a moment's
delay said holdenough but the place in
which he hath late appeared being woodstock
is filled with those dangerous and impious
persons whom i have been but now complaining
 and though i dare venture in disputation
with their great master himself yet without your
protection most worthy colonel i see not that
i may with prudence trust myself with the tossing
and goring ox desborough or the bloody
and devouring bear harrison or the cold and
poisonous snake bletson all whom are now
at the lodge doing license and taking spoil as
they think meet and as all men say the devil
has come to make a fourth with them
s woodstock
in good truth worthy and noble sir said
the mayor it is even as master holdenough
says our privileges are declared void our cattle
seized in the very pastures they talk cutting
down and dispersing the fair chase which has
been so long the pleasure so many kings and
making woodstock as little note as any paltry
village i assure you we heard your arrival
with joy and wondered at your keeping yourself
o close in your lodgings we know no one save
your father or you that are like to stand the
poor burgesses friend in this extremity since almost
all the gentry around are malignant and
under sequestration we trust therefore you
will make strong intercession in our behalf
 certainly master mayor said the colonel
who saw himself with pleasure anticipated it
was my very purpose to have interfered in this
matter and i did but keep myself alone until
i should be furnished with some authority from
the lord general
 powers from the lord general said the
mayor thrusting the clergyman with his elbow
 dost thou hear that what cock will fight
woodstock 
that cock we shall carry it now over their
neekfi and woodstock shall be brave woodstock
still 
 keep thine elbow from my side friends
said holdenough annoyed by the action which
the mayor had suited to his words and may
the lord send that cromwell prove not as sharp
to the people england as thy bones against
my person yet i approve that we should use
his authority to stop the course these men's
proceedings
let us set out then said colonel everard 
 and i trust we shall find the gentlemen reasonable
and obedient
the functionaries laic and clerical assented
with much joy and the colonel required and
received wildrake's assistance in putting on his
cloak and rapier as if he had been the dependant
whose part he acted the cavalier contrived
however while doing him these menial offices to
give his friend a shrewd pinch in order to maintain
the footing secret equality betwixt them
the colonel was saluted as they passed through
the streets by many the anxious inhabitants
j woodstock
who seemed to consider his intervention as affording
the only chance saving their fine park and
the rights the corporation as well as individuals
from ruin and confiscation
as they entered the park the colonel asked
his companions what is this you say apparitions
being seen amongst them 
 why colonel said the clergyman you
know yourself that woodstock was always haunted

i have lived therein many a day said the
colonel and i know that i never saw the
least sign it although idle people spoke the
house as they do all old mansions and gave
the apartments ghosts and spectres to fill up the
places the deceased great who had ever dwelt
there
nay but good colonel said the clergyman
i trust you have not reached the prevailing sin
 the times and become indifferent to the testimony
in favour apparitions which appears so
conclusive to all but atheists and advocates for
witches 
 i would not absolutely disbelieve what is so
woodstock 
generally affirmed said the colonel but my
temper leads me to doubt most the stories
which i have heard this sort and my own experience
never went to confirm any them
ay but trust me said holdenough there
was always a demon one or the other species
about this woodstock not a man or woman in
the town but has heard stories apparitions in
the forest or about the old castle sometimes it
is a pack hounds that sweep along and the
whoops and hollow the huntsman and the
winding horns and the galloping horse
which is heard as if first more distant and then
close around you and then anon it is a solitary
huntsman who asks if you can tell him which
way the stag has gone he is always dressed in
green but the fashion his clothes is some five
hundred years old this is what we call demon
meridian the noonday spectre
my worthy and reverend sir said the colonel
 i have lived at woodstock many seasons
and have traversed the chase at all hours trust
me what you hear from the villagers is the growth
 their idle folly and superstition
colonel replied holdenough a negative
 woodstock
proves nothing what signifies craving your
pardon that you have not seen anything be it
earthly or be it the other world to detract from
the evidence a score people who have 
and besides there is the demon nocturnal 
the being that walketh by night he has been
among these independents and schismatics last
night ay colonel you may stare but it is
even so they may try whether he will mend
their gifts as they profanely call them exposition
and prayer no sir i trow to master the
foul fiend there goeth some competent knowledge
 theology and an acquaintance with the humane
letters ay and a regular clerical education
and clerical calling
i do not in the least doubt said the colonel
 the efficacy your qualifications to lay the
devil but still i think some odd mistake has occasioned
this confusion amongst them if there
has any such in reality existed desborough is a
blockhead to be sure and harrison is fanatic
enough to believe anything but there is bletson
on the other hand who believes nothing 
what do you know this matter good master
mayor r
woodstock 
 in sooth and it was master bletson who gave
the first alarm replied the magistrate or at
least the first distinct one you see sir i was
in bed with my wife and no one else and i was
as fast asleep as a man can desire to be at two
hours after midnight when behold you they came
knocking at my bedroom door to tell me there
was an alarm in woodstock and that the bell 
the lodge was ringing at that dead hour the
night as hard as ever it rung when it called the
court to dinner
 well but the cause this alarm said the
colonel
 you shall hear worthy colonel you shall
hear answered the mayor waving his hand
with dignity for he was one those persons
who will not be hurried out their own pace
so mrs mayor would have persuaded me in
her love and affection poor wretch that to rise
at such an hour out my warm bed was like
to bring on my old complaint the lumbago and
that i should send the people to alderman button
 alderman devil mrs mayor said i 
i beg your reverence's pardon for using such a
 woodstock
phrase do you think i am going to lie abed
when the town is on fire and the cavaliers up
and the devil to pay i beg pardon again parson
but here we are before the gate the
palace will it not please you to enter 
i would first hear the your story
said the colonel that is master mayor if it
happens to have an 
 everything hath an said the mayor
 and that which we call a pudding hath two
your worship will forgive me for being facetious
where was i o i jumped out bed and
put on my red plush breeches with the blue nether
stocks for i always make a point being
dressed suitably to my dignity night and day
summer or winter colonel everard and i took
the constable along with me in case the alarm
should be raised by nightwalkers or thieves and
called up worthy master holdenough out his
bed in case it should turn out to be the devil
and so i thought i was provided for the worst
and so away we came and by and by the soldiers
who came to the town with master tompkins
who had been called to arms came marching
woodstock 
down to woodstock as fast as their feet would
carry them so i gave our people the sign to let
them pass us and outmarch us as it were and
this for a twofold reason
i will be satisfied interrupted the colonel
with one good reason you desired the redcoats
should have ther the fray
true sir very true and also that they
should have the last it in respect that fighting
is their especial business however we came on
at a slow pace as men who are determined to do
their duty without fear or favour when suddenly
we saw something white haste away up the
avenue towards the town when six our constables
and assistants fled at once as conceiving
it to be an apparition called the white woman
 woodstock
look you there colonel said master holdenough
 i told you there were demons more
kinds than one which haunt the ancient scenes 
royal debauchery and cruelty
 i hope you stood your own ground master
mayor said the colonel
i yes most assuredly that is i did not

sss woodstock
strictly speaking keep my ground but the townclerk
and i retreated retreated colonel and
without confusion or dishonour and took post behind
worthy master holdenough who with the
spirit a lion threw himself in the way the
supposed spectre and attacked it with such a
literary latin as might have scared the devil
himself and thereby plainly discovered that it
was no devil at all nor white woman neither
woman any colour but worshipful master breton
a member the house commons and
one the commissioners sent hither upon this
unhappy sequestration the wood chase and
lodge woodstock
and this was all you saw the demon 
said the colonel
truly yes answered the mayor and i
had no wish to see more however we conveyed
master bletson as in duty bound back to the
lodge and he was ever maundering by the way
how that he met a party scarlet devils incarnate
marching down to the lodge but to my poor
thinking it must have been the independent dragoons
who had just passed us
woodstock 
and more incarnate devils i would never
wish to see said wildrake who cour remain
silent no longer his voice so suddenly heard
showed how much the mayor's nerves were still
alarmed for he started and jumped aside with an
alacrity which no one would at first sight suppose
a man his portly dignity to have been
capable everard imposed silence on his intrusive
attendant and desirous to hear the conclusion
 this strange story requested the mayor
to tell him how the matter ended and whether
they stopped the supposed spectre
 truly worthy sir said the mayor master
holdenough was quite venturous upon confronting
as it were the devil and compelling
him to appear under the real form master
joshua bletson member parliament for the
borough littlefaith
in sooth master mayor said the divine i
were strangely ignorant my own commission
and its immunities if i were to value opposing
myself to satan or any independent in his likeness
all whom in the name him i serve
i do defy spit at and trample under my feet 
 woodstock
and because master mayor is something tedious
i will briefly inform your honour that we saw
little the enemy that night save what master
bletson said in the first feeling his terrors and
save what we might collect from the disordered
appearance the honourable colonel desborough
and majorgeneral harrison
and what plight were they in i pray you 
demanded the colonel 
why worthy sir every one might see with
half an eye that they had been engaged in a fight
wherein they had not been honoured with victory
seeing that general harrison was stalking
up and down the parlour with his drawn sword
in his hand talking to himself his doublet unbuttoned
his points untrussed his garters loose
and like to throw him down as he now and then
trod on them and gaping and grinning like a
mad player and yonder sate desborough with
a dry pottle sack before him which he had just
emptied and which though the element in which
he trusted had not restored him sense enough to
speak or courage enough to look over his shoulder
he had a bible in his hand forsooth as if it
woodstock 
would make battle against the evil one but i
peered over his shoulder and alas the good
gentleman held the bottom the page uppermost
it was as if one your musketeers noble
and valued sir were to present the butt 
his piece at the enemy instead the muzzle
ha ha ha it was a sight to judge schismatics
by both in point head and in point hearty
in point skill and in point courage oh 
colonel then was the time to see the true character
 an authorized pastor souls over those
unhappy men who leap into the fold without due
and legal authority and will forsooth preach
teach and exhort and blasphemously term the
doctrine the church saltless porridge and dry
chips
i have no doubt you were ready to meet the
danger reverend sir but i would fain know 
what nature it was and from whence it was to be
apprehended 
was it for me to make such inquiry said
the clergyman triumphantly is it for a brave
soldier to number his enemies or inquire from
what quarter they are to come no sir i was
u
i woodstock
there with match lighted bullet in my mouth
and my marquess shouldered to encounter as
many devils as hell could pour in were they
countless as motes in the sunbeam and came
from all points the compass the papists talk
 the temptation st anthony pshaw let
them double all the myriads which the brain a
crazy dutch painter hath invented and you will
find a poor presbyterian divine i will answer
for one at least who not in his own strength
but his masters will receive the assault in such
sort that far from returning against him as against
yonder poor hound day after day and night after
night he will at once pack them off as with
a vengeance to the uttermost parts assyria
still said the colonel i pray to know
whether you saw anything upon which to exercise
your pious learning 
saw answered the divine no truly i
saw nothing nor did i look for anything thieves
will not attack wellarmed travellers nor will devils
or evil spirits come against one who bears in
his bosom the word truth in the very language
in which it was first dictated no sir they shun
woodstock
a divine who can understand the holy text as a
crow is said to keep wide a gun loaded with
hailshot
they had walked a little way back upon their
road to give time for this conversation and the
colonel perceiving it was about to lead to no satisfactory
explanation the real cause alarm
on the preceding night turned round and observing
it was time they should go to the lodge
began to move in that direction with his three
companions
it was now becoming dark and the towers 
woodstock arose high above the umbrageous
shroud which the forest spread around the ancient
and venerable mansion from one the
highest turrets which could still be distinguished
as it rose against the clear blue sky there gleamed
a light like that a candle within the building
the mayor stopt short and catching fast
hold the divine and then colonel everard
exclaimed in a trembling and hasty but suppressed
tone do you see yonder light 
ray marry do i said colonel everard
sand what does that matter a light in a garvol
i r
sf woodstock
retroom such an old mansion as woodstock
is no subject for wonder i trow
but a light from rosamond's tower is surely
so said the mayor
true said the colonel something surprised
when after a careful examination he satisfied
himself that the worthy magistrate's conjecture
was real that is indeed rosamond's
tower and as the drawbridge by which it was
accessible has been destroyed for centuries it is
hard to say what chance could have lighted a
lamp in such an inaccessible place
that light burns with no earthly fuel said
the mayor neither from whale nor olive nor
beeswax nor muttonsuet either i dealt in
these commodities colonel before i went into
my present line and i can assure you i could
distinguish the sort light they give one from
another at a greater distance than yonder turret
look you that is no earthly flame see you
not something blue and reddish upon the edges 
that bodes full well where it comes from 
colonel in my opinion we had better go back to
sup at the town and leave the devil and the
woodstock 
redcoats to settle their matters together for tonight
and then when we come back the next
morning we will have a pull with the party that
chances to keep afield
you will do as you please master mayor
said everard but my duty requires me that i
should see the commissioners to night
and mine requires me to see the foul fiend
said master holdenough if he dare make himself
visible to me i wonder not that knowing
is approaching he betakes himself to the very
citadel the inner and the last defences this
ancient and haunted mansion he is dainty i
warrant you and must dwell where is a relish 
luxury and murder about the walls his chamber
in yonder turret sinned rosamond and
in yonder turret she suffered and there she sits
or more likely the enemy in her shape as i
have heard true men woodstock tell i wait
on you good colonel master mayor will do ashe
pleases the strong man hath fortified himself
in his dwellinghouse but lo there comes
another stronger than he
for me said the mayor who am as unwoodstock

learned as i am un warlike i will not engage either
with the powers the earth or the prince 
the powers the air and i will go back to
woodstock and hark ye good fellow slapping
wildrake on the shoulder i will bestow
on thee a shilling wet and a shilling dry if thou
wilt go with me
gadzojkers master mayor said wildrake
neither flattered by the magistrate's familiarity
 address nor captivated by his munificence
 i wonder who the devil made you
and nee fellows and besides do you think i
would go back to woodstock with your worshipful
codeshead when by good management i
may get a peep fair rosamond and see whether
she was that choice and incomparable piece 
ware which the world has been told by rhymers
and balladmakers 
speak less lightly and wantonly friend
said the divine we are to resist the devil that
he may flee from us and not to tamper with
him or enter into his counsels or traffic with the
merchandize his great vanity fair
mind what the good man says wildrake

woodstock 
said the colonel and take heed another time
how thou dost suffer thy wk to outrun discretion

i am beholden to the reverend gentleman
for his advice answered wildrake upon whose
tongue it was difficult to impose any curb whatever
even when his own safety rendered it most
desirable but gadzookers let him have had
what experience he will in fighting with the devil
he never saw one so black as i had a tussle
with not a hundred years ago
how friend said the clergyman who understood
everything literally when apparitions
were mentioned have you had so late a visitation
 satan believe me then that i wonder
why thou dearest to entertain his name so
often and so lightly as i see thou dost use it in
thy ordinary discourse but when and where
didst thou see the evil one 
everard hastily interposed lest by something
yet more strongly alluding to cromwell his imprudent
squire should in mere wantonness betray
his interview with the general the
young man raves he said a dream which
 woodstock
he had the other night when he and i slept together
in victor lee's chamber belonging to the
ranger's apartments at the lodges
thanks for help at a pinch good patron
said wildrake whispering into everard's ear
who in vain endeavoured to shake him off a
fib never failed a fanatic
you also spoke something too lightly 
these matters considering the work which we
have in hand worthy colonel said the presbyterian
divine believe me the young man
thy servant was more like to see visions than to
dream merely idle dreams in that apartment 
for i have always heard that next to rosamond's
tower in which as i said she played
the wanton and was after ward's poisoned by
queen eleanor victor lee's chamber was the
place in the lodge woodstock more peculiarly
the haunt evil spirits i pray you young
man tell me this dream or vision yours
with all my heart sir said wildrake
then addressing his patron who began to interferes
he said tush sir you have had the discourse
for an hour send why should not i hold
woodstock 
forth in my turn by this darkness if you keep
me silent any longer i will turn independent
preacher and stand up in your despite for the
freedom private judgment and so reverend
sir i was dreaming a carnal advertisement called
a bullbaiting and methought there were
venturing dogs at head as merrily as e'er i saw
them at tutburybullrunning and methought
i heard some one say there was the devil come to
have a sight the bullring well i thought that
gad swoons i would have a peep at his infernal
majesty so i looked and there was a butcher in
greasy woollen with his steel by his side but he
was none the devil and there was a drunken
cavalier with his mouth full oaths and his
stomach full emptiness and a goldlaced waistcoat
in a very dilapidated condition and a ragged
hat with a piece a feather in it and he
was none the devil neither and here was a
miller his hands dusty with meal and every
atom it stolen and there was a vintner his
green apron stained with wine and every drop
 it sophisticated but neither was the old gentleman
i looked for to be detected among those
 woodstock
artizans iniquity at length sir i saw r
grave person with cropped hair a pair longish
and projecting ears a band as broad as a slobbering
bib under his chin a brown coat surmounted
by a geneva cloak and i had old
nicholas at once in his genuine paraphernalia
by 
 shame shame said colonel everard
what behave thus to an old gentleman and a
divine 
nay let him proceed said the minister with
perfect equanimity if thy friend or secretary
is gibing i must have less patience than becomes
my profession if i could not bear an idle
jest and forgive him who makes it or if on
the other hand the enemy has really presented
himself to the young man in such a guise ashe
intimates wherefore should we be surprised

reverend sir i crave you a thousand pardons
said wildrake penetrated by the quietness and
patience the presbyter's rebuke by st
george if quiet patience will do it thou art fit
to play a game at foils with the devil himself
and i would be contented to hold stakes
as he concluded an apology which was certainly
not uncalled for and seemed to be received
in perfectly good part they approached so
close to the exterior door the lodge that they
were challenged with the emphatic stand by a
sentinel who mounted guard there colonel
everard replied a friend and the sentinel repeating
his command stand friend proceeded
to call the corporal the guard the corporal
came forth and at the same time turned
out his guard colonel everard gave his name
and designation as well as those his companions
on which the corporal said he doubted
not there would be orders for his instant admission
but in the first place mr tomkins

must be consulted that he might learn their

 how sir said the colonel do you
knowing who i am presume to keep me on the

not if your honour pleases to enter said
the corporal and undertakes to be my warranty
 but such are the orders my post
nay then do your duty said the colonel 
but are the cavaliers up or what is the matter
that you keep so close and strict a watch 
the fellow gave no distinct answer but muttered
between his moustaches something about
the enemy and the roaring lion who goeth
about seeking what he may devour presently
afterwards tomkins appeared followed by two
servants bearing lights in great standing brass
candlesticks they marched before colonel everard
and his party keeping as close to each other
as two cloves the same orange and starting
from time to time and shouldering as they passed
through sundry intricate passages they led
up a large and ample wooden staircase the banisters
rail and lining which were executed

in black oak and finally into a long saloon or
parlour where there was a prodigious fire and
about twelve candles the largest size distributed
in sconces against the wall there were seated
the commissioners who now held in their power

the bloody bear an independent beast
unlocked to forms in groans he had express'd
next him the bassoon ape as atheists use
mimick'd all sects and had his own to choose
hind and panther
the strong light in the parlour which we have
described served to enable everard easily to recognise
his acquaintances desborough harrison
and bletson who had assembled themselves round
an oak table large dimensions placed near the
blazing chimney on which were arranged wine
and ale and materials for smoking then the general
indulgence the time there was a species
 movable cupboard set betwixt the table and
the door calculated originally for a display 
plate upon grand occasions but at present only
used as a screen which purpose it served so effect
actually
that ere he had coasted around it everard
heard the following fragment what desborough
was saying in his coarse strong voice 
sent him to share with us fse warrant ye it
was always his excellency my brotherinlaw's
way if he made a treat for five friends he would
invite more than the table could hold i have
known him ask three men to eat two eggs
hush hush said bletson and the servants
making their appearance from behind the tall cupboard
announced colonel everard it may not
be unpleasing to the reader to have a description
 the party into which he now entered
desborough was a stout bullnecked man 
middle size with heavy vulgar features grizzled
bushy eyebrows and walleyes the flourish
 his powerful relative's fortunes had burst
forth in the finery his dress which was much
more ornamented than was usual among the roundheads
there was embroidery on his cloak and
lace upon his band his hat displayed a feather
with a golden clasp and all his habiliments were
those a cavalier or follower the court rather
than the plain dress a parliamentarian officer
s woodstock
but heaven knows there was little courtlike
grace or dignity in the person or demeanour 
the individual who became his fine suit as the
hog on the signpost does his gilded armour it
was not that he was positively deformed or misshaped
for taken in detail the figure was well
enough but his limbs seemed to act upon different
and contradictory principles they were
not as the play says in a concatenation accordingly
 the right hand moved as if it were upon
bad terms with the left and the legs showed an inclination
to foot it in different and opposite directions
in short to use an extravagant comparison
the members colonel desborough seemed
rather to resemble the disputatious representatives
 a federative congress than the wellordered
union the orders the state in a firm and
wellcompacted monarchy where each holds his
own place and all obey the dictates a common
head
general harrison the second the commissioners
was a tall thin middleaged man who
had risen into his high situation in the army
and his intimacy with cromwell by his dauntless
woodstock 
courage in the field and the popularity he had
acquired by his exalted enthusiasm amongst the
military saints sectaries and independents who
composed the strength the existing army harrison
was mean extraction and bred up to his
father's employment a butcher nevertheless
his appearance though coarse was not vulgar like
that desborough who had so much the advantage
 him in birth and education he had
as we have said a masculine height and strength
 figure was well made and in his manner announced
a rough military character which might
be feared but could not be the object contempt
or ridicule his aquiline nose and dark black
eyes set off to some advantage a countenance
otherwise irregular and the wild enthusiasm that
sometimes sparkled in them as he dilated on his
opinions to others and often seemed to slumber
under his long dark eyelashes as he mused upon
them himself gave something strikingly wild and
even noble to his aspect he was one the chief
leaders those who were called fifthmonarchy
men who going even beyond the usual fanaticism
 the age presumptuously interpreted the
s woodstock
 the revelations after their own fancies
considered that the second advent the messiah
and the millennium or reign the saints
upon earth was close at hand and that they
themselves illuminated as they believed with the
power foreseeing these approaching events were
the choice instruments for the establishment the
new reign or fifth monarchy as it was called
and were fated also to win its honours whether
celestial or terrestrial
when this spirit enthusiasm which operated
like a partial insanity was not immediately
affecting harrison's mind he was a shrewd worldly
man and a good soldier one who missed no
opportunity mending his fortune and who in
expecting the exaltation the fifth monarchy
was in the meanwhile a ready instrument for the
establishment the lord generals supremacy
whether it was owing to his early occupation
and habits indifference to pain or bloodshed
to natural disposition and want feeling or
finally to the awakened character his enthusiasm
which made him look upon those who opposed
him as opposing the divine will and therefore
woodstock 
meriting no favour or mercy is not easy to say
but all agreed that after a victory or the successful
storm a town harrison was one the
most cruel and pitiless men in cromwelps army 
always urging some misapplied text to authorize
the continued execution the fugitives and sometimes
even putting to death those who had surrendered
themselves prisoners it was said that at
times the recollection some those cruelties
troubled his conscience and disturbed the dreams
 beatification in which his imagination indulged
when everard entered the apartment this
true representative the fanatical soldiers the
day who filled those ranks and regiments which
cromwell had politically kept on foot while he
procured the reduction those in which the presbyterian
interest predominated was seated a little
apart from the others his legs crossed and stretched
out at length towards the fire his head resting
on his elbow and turned upwards as if studying
with the most profound gravity the halfseen
carving the gothic roof
bletson remains to be mentioned who in person
and figure was diametrically different from
vol i i
 woodstock
the other two there was neither foppery nor
slovenliness in his exterior nor had he any
marks military service or rank about his person
a small walking rapier seemed merely worn
as a badge his rank as a gentleman without
his hand having the least purpose becoming
acquainted with the hilt or his eye with the blade
his countenance was thin and acute marked with
lines which thought rather than age had traced
upon it and a habitual sneer on his countenance
even when he least wished to express contempt on
his features seemed to assure the person addressed
that in bletson he conversed with a person 
intellect far superior to his own this was a triumph
 intellect only for on all occasions difference
respecting speculative opinions and indeed
on all controversies whatsoever bletson
avoided the ultimate ratio blows and knocks
yet this peaceful gentleman had found himself
obliged to serve personally in the parliamentary
army at the commencement the civil war till
happening unluckily to come in contact with the
fiery prince rupert his retreat was judged so
precipitate that it required all the shelter his
woodstock befriends
could afford to keep him free an impeachment
or a courtmartial but as bletson spoke welland
with great effect in the house commons
which was his natural sphere and was on that account
high in the estimation his party his behaviour
at edgehill was passed over and he continued
to take an active share in all the political
events that bustling period though he faced
not again the actual front war
bletsons theoretical principles politics had
long inclined him to espouse the opinions 
harrison and others who adopted the visionary
idea establishing a pure democratical republic
in so extensive a country as britain this was a
rash theory where there is such an infinite difference
betwixt ranks habits education and morals
where there is such an immense disproportion
betwixt the wealth individuals and where a
large proportion the inhabitants consists the
inferior classes the large towns and manufacturing
districts men unfitted to bear that share
in the direction a state which must be exercised
by the members a republic in the proper
sense the word accordingly so soon as
woodstock
the experiment was made it became obvious that
no such form government could be adopted
with the smallest chance stability and the
question came only to be whether the remnant
or as it was vulgarly called the rump the
long parliament now reduced by the seclusion
 so many the members to a few scores 
persons should continue in spite their unpopularity
to rule the affairs britain whether
they should cast all loose by dissolving themselves
and issuing writs to convoke a new parliament
the composition which no one could answer for
any more than for the measures they might take
when assembled or lastly whether cromwell
as actually happened was not to throw the sword
into the balance and boldly possess himself 
that power which the remnant the parliament
were unable to hold and yet afraid to resign 
such being the state parties the council 
state in distributing the good things in their
gift endeavoured to soothe and gratify the army
as a beggar flings crusts to a growling mastiff
in this view desborough had been created
a commissioner in the woodstock matter to gras

tiny cromwell harrison to soothe the fierce fifthmonarchy
men and bletson as a sincere republican
and one their own leaven
but if they supposed bletson had the least intention
 becoming a martyr to his republicanism
or submitting to any serious loss on account it
they much mistook the man he entertained their
principles sincerely and not the less that they were
found impracticable for the miscarriage his
experiment no more converts the political speculator
than the explosion a retort undeceives an
alchemist but bletson was quite prepared to submit
to cromwell or any one else who might be possessed
 the actual authority he was a ready
subject in practice to the powers existing and made
little difference betwixt various kinds government
holding in theory all to be nearly equal in
imperfection so soon as they diverged from the
model harrington's oceana cromwell had already
been tampering with him like wax between
his finger and thumb and which he was ready
shortly to seal with smiling at the same time to
himself when he beheld the council state giving
rewards to bletson as their faithful adherent while
 woodstock
he himself was secure his allegiance how soon
soever the expected change government should
take place
but bletson was still more attached to his metaphysical
than his political creed and carried his
doctrines the perfectibility mankind as far ashe
did those respecting the conceivable perfection 
a model government and as in the one case he
declared against all power which did not emanate
from the people themselves so in his moral speculations
he was unwilling to refer any the phenomena
 nature to a final cause when pushed
indeed very hard bletson was compelled to mutter
some inarticulate and unintelligible doctrines
concerning an animus mundi or creative power
in the works nature by which she originally
called into existence and still continues to preserve
her works to this power he said some the purest
metaphysicians rendered a certain degree 
homage nor was he himself inclined absolutely to
censure those who by institution holidays choral
dances songs and harmless feasts and libations
might be disposed to celebrate the great goddess
nature at least dancing singing feasting and
woodstock 
sporting being comfortable things to both young
and old they might as well sport dance and feast
in honour such appointed holidays as under any
other pretext but then this moderate show religion
was to be practised under such exceptions
as are admitted by the highgate oath and no one
was to be compelled to dance drink sing or feast
whose taste did not happen to incline them to
such advertisements nor was any one to be compelled
to worship the creative power whether under
the name the animus mundi or any other
whatsoever the interference the deity in the
affairs mankind he entirely disowned having
proved to his own satisfaction that the idea originated
entirely in priestcraft in short with the
shadowy metaphysical exception aforesaid mr
joshua bletson darlington member for littlecreed
came as near the predicament an atheist
as it is perhaps possible for a man to do but
we say this with the necessary salvo for we have
known many like bletson whose curtains have
been shrewdly shaken by superstition though their
fears were unsanctioned by any religious faith
the devils we are assured believe and tremble 
 woodstock
but on earth there are many who in worse plight
than even the natural children perdition tremble
without believing and fear even while they blaspheme

it follows course that nothing could be
treated with more scorn by mr bletson than the
debates about prelacy and presbytery about presbytery
and independency about quakers and anabaptists
muggletonians and brownish and all the
various sects by which the civil war had commenced
and by which its dissensions were still continued
 it was he said as if beasts burthen
should quarrel amongst themselves about the
fashion their halters and packsaddles instead
 embracing a favourable opportunity throwing
them aside other witty and pithy remarks he
used to make when time and place suited for instance
at the club called the rota frequented by
saint john and established by harrington for the
free discussion political and religious subjects
but when bletson was out this academy or
stronghold af philosophy he was very cautious how
he carried his contempt the general prejudice in
favour religion and christianity further than
woodstock 
an implied objection or a sneer if he hm an opportunity
 talking in private with an ingenuous
and intelligent youth he sometimes attempted to
make a proselyte and showed much address in
bribing the vanity inexperience by suggesting
that a mind like his ought to spurn the prejudices
impressed upon it in childhood and when assuming
the latus clavus reason assuring him
that such as he laying aside the bulla juvenile
incapacity as bletson called it should proceed to
examine and decide for himself it frequently happened
that the youth was induced to adopt the
doctrines in whole or in part the sage who had
seen his natural genius and who had urged him
to exert it in examining detecting and declaring
for himself and thus flattery gave proselytes to
infidelity which could not have been gained by
all the powerful eloquence or artful sophistry 
the infidel
these attempts to extend the influence what
was called freethinking and philosophy were carried
on as we have hinted with a caution dictated
by the timidity the philosopher's disposition
he was conscious his doctrines were
 woodstock
suspected and his proceedings watched by the
two principal sects relations and presbyterians
who however inimical to each other were still more
hostile to one who was an opponent not only to a
church establishment any kind but to every
denomination christianity he found it more
easy to shroud himself among the independents
whose demands were for a general liberty conscience
or an unlimited toleration and whose faith
differing in all respects and particulars was by
some pushed into such wild errors as to get totally
beyond the bounds every species christianity
and approach very near to infidelity itself as extremes
 each kind are said to approach each
other bletson mixed a good deal among those
sectaries and such was his confidence in his own
logic and address that he is supposed to have entertained
hopes bringing to his opinions in time
the enthusiastic vane as well as the no less enthusiastic
hanson providing he could but get
them to resign their visions a fifth monarchy
and induce them to be contented with a reign 
philosophers in england for the natural period
 their lives instead the reign the saints
kiing the millennium
woodstock 
such was the singular group into which everard
was now introduced showing in their various
opinions upon how many devious coasts human
nature may make shipwreck when she has one e
let go her hold on the anchor which religion has
given her to lean upon the acute selfconceit and
worldly learning bletson the rash and ignorant
conclusions the fierce and underbred harrison
leading them into the opposite extremes enthusiasm
and infidelity while desborough constitutionally
stupid thought nothing about religion at
all and while the others were active in making
sail on different but equally erroneous courses
he might be said to perish like a vessel which
springs a leak and founders in the roadstead it
was wonderful to behold what a strange variety
 mistakes and errors on the part the king and
his ministers on the part the parliament and
their leaders on the part the allied kingdoms 
scotland and england towards each other had
combined to rear up men such dangerous opinions
and interested characters among the arbiters
 the destiny britain
those who argue for party's sake will sec all the
 vood stock
faults on the olio side without deigning to look at
those on the other those who study history for
instruction will perceive that nothing but the want
 concession on either side and the deadly height
to which the animosity the king's and parliaments
parties had arisen could have so totally
overthrown the wellpoised balance the english
constitution but we hasten to quit political reflections
the rather that ours we believe will
please neither whig nor tory

mb bletson arose and paid his respects to
colonel everard with the ease and courtesy a
gentleman the time though on every account
grieved at his intrusion as a religious man who
held his free thinking principles in detestation and
would effectually prevent his conversion harrison
and even desborough if anything could be
moulded out such a clod to the worship the
animus mundi moreover bletson knew everard
to be a man steady probity and by no
means disposed to close with a scheme on which
he had successfully sounded the other two and
which was calculated to assure the commissioners
 woodstock
 some little private indemnification for the trouble
they were to give themselves in the public business
the philosopher was yet less pleased when
he saw the magistrate and the pastor who had met
him in his flight the preceding evening when
he had been seen parma non bene 'elicta with
cloak and doublet left behind him
the presence colonel everard was as unpleasing
to desborough as to bletson but the
former having no philosophy in him nor an idea
that it was possible for any man to resist helping
himself out untold money was chiefly embarrassed
by the thought that the plunder which they
might be able to achieve out their trust might
by this unwelcome addition to their number be
divided into four parts instead three and this
reflection added to the natural awkwardness with
which he grumbled forth a sort welcome addressed
to everard
as for harrison he remained like one on
higher thoughts intent his posture unmoved his
eyes fixed on the ceiling as before and no part 
him indicated the least consciousness that the company
had been more than doubled around him
 woodstock 
meantime everard took his place at the table
as a man who assumed his own right and
pointed to his companions to sit down nearer the
foot the board wildrake so far misunderstood
his signals as to sit down above the mayor 
but rallying his recollection at a look from his
patron he rose and took his place lower whistling
however as he went a sound at which the
company stared as at a freedom highly unbecoming
to complete his indecorum he seized
upon a pipe and filling it from a large tobaccobox
was soon immersed in a cloud his own
raising from which a hand shortly after emerged
seized on the blackjack ale withdrew it within
the vapoury sanctuary and after a potential
draught replaced it upon the table its owner beginning
to renew the cloud which his intermitted
exercise the tube had almost allowed to subside

nobody made any observation on his conduct
out respect probably to colonel everard who
bit his lip but continued silent aware that censure
might extract something more unequivocally chains
woodstock 
racteristic a cavalier from his refractory companion
as silence seemed too awkward and the
others made no advances to break it beyond the
ordinary salutation colonel everard at length
said i presume gentlemen that you are somewhat
surprised at my arrival here and thus intruding
myself into your meeting
why the dickens should we be surprised
colonel said desborough we know his excellency
my brotherinlaw noll's i mean my
lord cromwell's way overquartering his menin
the towns he marches through thou hast
obtained a share in our commission 
and in that's said bletson smiling and bowing
 the lordgeneral has given us the most
acceptable colleague that could have been added
to our number no doubt your authority for joining
with us must be under warrant the council
 state 
 that gentlemen said the colonel i
will presently advise you he took omit his
warrant accordingly and was about to communicate
the contents but observing that there were
three or four halfempty flasks upon the table
 woodstock sj
that defiborough looked more stupid than usual
and that the philosopher's eyes were reeling in
his head notwithstanding the temperance 
bletson's usual habits he concluded that they
had been fortifying themselves against the horrors
 the haunted mansion by laying in a store
 what is called dutch courage and therefore
prudently'resolved to postpone his more important
business with them till the cooler hour morning
he therefore instead presenting the general's
warrant superseding their commission contented
himself with replying my business
has course some reference to your proceedings
here but here is excuse my curiosity 
a reverend gentleman pointing to holdenough
who has told me that you are so strangely embarrassed
here as to require both the civil and
spiritual authority to enable you to keep possession
 woodstock
before we go into that matter said bletson
blushing up to the eyes at the recollection his
own fears so manifestly displayed yet so inconsistent
with his principles i should like to know
who this other stranger is who has come with the
vol i t
 woodstock 
worthy magistrate and the no less worthy presbyterians

meaning me said wildrake laying his
pipe aside gadzooks the time hath been that
i could have answered the question with a better
title but at present i am only his honour's peer
clerk or secretary whichever is the current
phrase
fore george my lively blade thou art a frank
fellow thy tattle said desborough there is
my secretary tomkins whom men sillily enough
call gibbet and the honourable lieutenant general
harrison's secretary bibbet who are now at
supper below stairs that durst not for their ears
speak a phrase above their breath in the presence
 their betters unless to answer a question
yes colonel everard said the philosopher
with his quiet smile glad apparently to divert
the conversation from the topic last night's
alarm and recollections which humbled his selflove
and selfsatisfaction yes and when master
bibbet and master bibbet do speak their affirmations
are as much in a common mould mutual
attestation as their names would accord m the
j
i
woodstock 
verses a poet if master gibbet happens to tell
a fiction master bibbet swears it as truth if
master bibbet chances to have gotten drunk in
the fear the lord master gibbet swears he is
sober i have called my own secretary gibbet
though his name chances to be only gibeon a
worthy israelite at your service but as pure a
youth as ever picked a lambbone at paschal but
i call him gibbet merely to make up the holy
trefoil with another rhyme this squire thine
colonel everard looks as if he might be worthy
to be coupled with the rest the fraternity
not i truly said the cavalier i'll be
coupled with no jew that was ever whelped and
no jewess neither
 scorn not for that young man said the philosopher
 the jews are in point religion
the elder brethren you know
the jews older than the christians said
desborough fore george they will have thee
before the general assembly bletson if thou
ventures to say so
wildrake laughed without ceremony at the
gross ignorance desborough and was joined by
 woodstock
a smuggling response from behind the cupboard
which when inquired into proved to be produced
by the servingmen these worthies timorous as
their betters when they had set down the lights
and were supposed to have left the room had only
absconded behind their present place concealment

how now ye rogues said bletson angrily 
do you not know your duty better 
we beg your worthy honour's pardon said
one the men but we had set the candlesticks
down on the table and truly we dared not go
down stairs till we should get a light
a light ye cowardly poltroons said the
philosopher what to show which you looks
palest when a rat squeaks but take a candlestick
and begone you cowardly villains the devils
you are so much afraid must be but paltry
kites if they hawk at such bats as you are
the servants without replying took up one 
the candlesticks and prepared to retreat trusty
tomkins at the head the troop when suddenly
as they arrived at the door the parlour which
had been left half open it was shut violently
woodstock 
the three terrified domestics tumbled back into
the middle the room as if a shot had been discharged
in their face and all who were at the table
started to their feet
colonel everard was incapable a moment's
fear even if anything frightful had been seen 
but he remained stationary to see what his companions
would do and to get at the bottom if possible
 the cause their alarm upon an occasion
so trifling the philosopher seemed to think that
he was the person chiefly concerned to show manhood
on the occasion
he walked to the door accordingly murmuring
at the cowardice the servants but at such a
snails pace that it seemed he would most willingly
have been anticipated by any one whom his
reproaches had roused to exertion cowardly
blockheads he said at last seizing hold the
handle the door but without turning it effectually
round dare you not open a door 
still fumbling with the lock dare you not go
down a staircase without a light here bring
me the candle you cowardly villains by heaven
something sighs on the outside 
 woodstock
as he spoke he let go the handle the parlour
door and stepped back a pace or two into the
apartment with cheeks as pale as the band he
wore
deus adductor mens r said the presbyterian
clergyman rising from his seat give place
sir addressing bletson it would seem i know
more this matter than thou and i bless heaven
i am armed for the conflict
bold as a grenadier about to mount a breach
yet with the same belief in the existence a great
danger to be encountered as well as the same reliance
in the goodness his cause the worthy man
stepped before the philosophical bletson and taking
a light from a sconce in one hand quietly
opened the door with the other and standing in
the threshold said here is nothing i
and who expected to see anything said
bletson excepting those terrified oafs who take
fright at every puff wind that whistles through
the passages this old dungeon 
mark you master tomkins said one the
waitingmen in a whisper to the steward see
how boldly the minister pressed forward before
woodstock 
all them ah master tomkins our parson is
the real commissioned officer the church your
laypreachers are no better than a parcel clubmen
and volunteers
follow me those who list said master holdenough
or go before me those who choose i
will walk through the habitable places this house
before i leave it and satisfy myself whether satan
hath really mingled himself among these dreary
dens ancient wickedness or whether like the
wicked whom holy david speaketh we are
afraid and flee when no one pursued
harrison who had heard these words sprung
from his seat and drawing his sword exclaimed
were there as many fiends in the house as there
are hairs on my head upon this cause i will charge
them up to their very trenches 
so saying he brandished his weapon and pressed
to the head the column where he moved side
by side with the minister the mayor woodstock
next joined the body thinking himself safer
perhaps in the company his pastor and the
whole train moved forward in close order accompanied
by the servants bearing lights to search
woodstock
the lodge for some cause that panic with which
they seemed to be suddenly seized
nay take me with you my friends said
colonel everard who had looked on in surprise
and was now about to follow the party when bletson
laid hold on his cloak and begged him to remain

you see my good colonels he said affecting
a courage which his shaking voice belied
here are only you and i and honest lesbos
left behind in garrison while all the others
are absent on a sally we must not hazard the
whole troops in one sortie that were unmilitary
ha ha ha i
in the name heaven what means all this 
said everard i heard a foolish tale about apparitions
as i came this way and now i find you
all half mad with fear and cannot get a word 
sense among so many you fie colonel desborough
 fie master bletson try to compose
yourselves and let me know in heaven's name
the cause all this disturbance one would be
apt to think your brains were turned
 and so mine well may said desborough
woodstock 
 ay and overturned too since my bed last night
was turned upside down and i was placed for ten
minutes heels uppermost and head downcast like
a bullock going to be shod
what means this nonsense master bletson 
desborough must have had the nightmare
 no faith colonel the goblins or whatever
else they were had been favourable to honest desborough
for they reposed the whole his person
on that part his body which hark did you
not hear something sis the central point gravity
namely his head
did you see anything to alarm you said
the colonel
nothing said bletson but we heard hellish
noises as all our people did and i believing
little ghosts and apparitions concluded the cavaliers
were taking us at advantage so remembering
gainsborough's fate i e'en jumped the
window and ran to woodstock to call the soldiers
to the rescue harrison and desborough
and did you not first go to see what the danger
was 
 ah my good friend you forget that i laid
woodstock
down my commission at the time the selfdenying
ordinance it would have been quite inconsistent
with my duty as a parliamentman to be
brawling amidst a set ruffians with any military
authority no when the parliament commanded
me to sheathe my sword colonel i have too
much veneration for their authority to be found
again with it drawn in my hand
but the parliament said desborough hastily
 did not command you to use your heels
when your hands could have saved a man from
choking gods dickens you might have stopped
when you saw my bed canted heels uppermost
and me half stifled in the bedclothes you might
i say have stopped and lent a hand to put it to
rights instead jumping out window like a
new shorn sheep so soon as you had run across
my room
nay worshipful master desborough said
bletson winking on everard to show that he was
playing on his thickskulled colleague how could
i tell your particular mode reposing there
are many tastes i have known men who slept by
choice on a slope or angle fortyfives
woodstock 
yes but did ever a man sleep standing on
his head except by miracle said desborough
 now as to miracles said the philosopher
confident in the presence everard besides that
an opportunity scoffing at religion really in some
degree diverted his fear i leave these out 
the question seeing that the evidence on such
subjects seems as little qualified to carry conviction
as a horsehair to land a leviathan
a loud clap thunder or a noise as formidable
rang through the lodge as the scoffer had
ended which struck him pale and motionless and
made desborough throw himself on his knees and
repeat exclamations and prayers in much admired
confusion
there must be contrivance here exclaimed
everard and snatching one the candles from
a sconce he rushed out the apartment little
heeding the entreaties the philosopher who in
the extremity his distress conjured him by the
animus mundi to remain to the assistance a
distressed philosopher endangered by witches
and a parliamentman assaulted by ruffians as
for desborough he only gaped like a clown in a
 woodstock
pantomime and doubtful whether to follow or
stop his natural indolence prevailed and he sat
still
when on the landingplace the stairs everard
paused a moment to consider which was the
best course to take he heard the voices men
talking fast and loud like people who wish to drown
their fears in the lower story and aware that nothing
could be discovered by those whose inquiries
were conducted in a manner so noisy he resolved
to proceed in a different direction and examine
the second floor which he had now gained
he had known every corner both the inhabited
and uninhabited part the mansion
and availed himself the candle to traverse two
or three intricate passages which he was afraid
he might not remember with sufficient accuracy
this movement conveyed him to a sort oeuil
debeiif an octagon vestibule or small hall from
which various rooms opened amongst these
doors everard selected that which led to a very
long narrow and dilapidated gallery built in the
time henry viii and running along the whole
southwest side the building communicating at
woodstock 
different points with the rest the mansion this
he thought was likely to be the post occupied by
those who proposed to act the sprites upon the occasion
 especially as its length and shape gave him
some idea that it was a spot where the bold thunder
might in many ways be imitated
determined to ascertain the truth if possible he
placed his light on a table in the vestibule and
applied himself to open the door into the gallery
at this point he found himself strongly opposed
either by a bolt drawn or as he rather conceived
by somebody from within resisting his attempt
he was induced to believe the latter because the
resistance slackened and was renewed like that 
human strength instead presenting the permanent
opposition an inanimate obstacle though
everard was a strong and active young man he
exhausted his strength in the vain attempt to open
the door and having paused to take breath was
about to renew his efforts with foot and shoulder
and to call at the same time for assistance when
to his surprise on again attempting the door more
gently in order to ascertain if possible where the
strength the opposing obstacle was situated he
i
 woodstock
found it give way to a very slight impulse some
impediment fell broken to the ground and the
door flew wide open the gust wind occasioned
by the sudden opening the door blew out
the candle and everard was left in darkness
save where the moonshine which the long siderow
 latticed windows dimmed could imperfectly
force its way into the gallery which lay in
ghostly length before him
the melancholy and doubtful twilight was increased
by a quantity creeping plants on the
outside which since all had been neglected in
these ancient halls now completely overgrown had
in some instances greatly diminished and in others
almost quite choked up the space the lattices
extending between the heavy stone shaftwork
which divided the windows both lengthways and
across on the other side there were no windows
at all and the gallery had been once completely
hung with paintings chiefly portraits by which
that side the apartment had been adorned
most the pictures had been removed yet the
empty frames some and the tattered remnants
 others were still visible along the extent 
woodstock sos
the waste gallery the look which was so desolate
and so well adapted besides for mischief
supposing there were enemies near him that everard
could not help pausing at the entrance and
recommending himself to god ere drawing his
sword he advanced into the apartment treading
as lightly as possible and keeping in the shadow
as much as he could
markham everard was by no means superstitious
but he had the usual credulity his times 
and though he did not yield easily to tales supernatural
visitations yet he could not help thinking
he was in the very situation where if such
things were ever permitted they might be expected
to take place while his own stealthy and
ill assured pace his drawn weapon and extended
arms being the very attitude and action doubt
and suspicion tended to increase in his mind the
gloomy feelings which they are the usual indications
and with which they are constantly associated
under such unpleasant impressions and
conscious the neighbourhood something unfriendly
colonel everard had already advanced
about half along the gallery when he heard some
y
 woodstock
one sigh very near him and a low soft voice pronounce
his name
here i am he replied while his heart beat
thick and short who calls on markham everard
t
another sigh was the only answer
 speak said the colonel whoever or whatsoever
you are and tell with what intent and purpose
you are lurking in these apartments 
with a better intent than yours returned
the soft voice
than mine answered everard in great
surprise who are you that dare judge my
intents 
what or who are you markham everard
who wander by moonlight through these deserted
halls royalty where none should be but those
who mourn their downfall or are sworn to avenge
it 
it is and yet it cannot be said everard 
yet it is and must be alice lee the devil or
you speaks answer me i conjure you speak
openly on what dangerous scheme are you engaged
 where is your father why are you here
woodstock 
wherefore do you run so deadly a venture 
speak i conjure you alice lee 
she whom you call on is at the distance 
miles from this spot what if her genius speaks
when she is absent what if the soul an ancestress
 hers and yours were now addressing
you what if 
nay answered everard but what if the
dearest human beings has caught a touch 
her father's enthusiasm what if she is exposing
her person to danger her reputation to
scandal by traversing in disguise and in darkness
a house filled with armed men speak tome
my fair cousin in your own person i am
furnished with powers to protect my uncle sir
henry to protect you too dearest alice even
against the consequences this visionary and
wild attempt speak i see where you are and
with all my respect i cannot submit to be thus
practised upon trust me trust your cousin
markham with your hand and believe that he
will die or place you in honourable safety
as he spoke he exercised his eyes as keenly as
possible to detect where the speaker stood and
vol i u
 woodstock
it seemed to him that about three ytirds from him
there was a shadowy form which he could not
discern even the outline placed as it was within the
deep and prolonged shadow thrown by a space 
wall intervening betwixt two windows upon that
side the room from which the light was admitted
he endeavoured to calculate as well as he
could the distance betwixt himself and the object
which he watched under the impression that if
by even using a slight degree compulsion he
could detach his beloved alice from the confederacy
into which he supposed her father's zeal for
the cause royalty had engaged her he would
be rendering them both the most essential favour
he could not indeed but conclude that however
successfully the plot which he conceived to be in
agitation had proceeded against the timid bletson
the stupid desborough and the crazy harrison
there was little doubt that at length their artifices
must necessarily bring shame and danger on those
engaged in it
it must also be remembered that everard's affection
to his cousin although the most respectful
and devoted character partook less the diswoodstock

want veneration which a lover those days entertained
for the lady whom he worshipped with
humble diffidence than the fond and familiar
feelings which a brother entertains towards a
younger sister whom he thinks himself entitled
to guide advise and even in some degree to control
so idndly and intimate had been their intercourse
that he had little more hesitation in endeavouring
to arrest her progress in the dangerous
course in which she seemed to be engaged even
at the risk giving her momentary offence than
he would have had in snatching her from a torrent
or conflagration at the chance hurting her by
the violence his grasp all this passed through
his mind in the course a single minute and he
resolved at all events to detain her on the spot
and compel if possible an explanation from her
with this purpose everard again conjured his
cousin in the name heaven to give up this idle
and dangerous mummery and lending an accurate
ear to her answer endeavoured from the sound
to calculate as nearly as possible the distance between
them
i am not she for whom you take me said
 woodstock
the voice and dearer regards than aught connected
with her life or death bid me warn you to
keep aloof and leave this place
not till i have convinced you your childish
folly said the colonel springing forward and
endeavouring to catch hold her who spoke to
him but no female form was within his grasp
on the contrary he was met by a shock which
could come from no woman's arm and which was
rude enough to stretch him on his back on the
floor at the same time he felt the point a
sword at his throat and his hands so completely
mastered that not the slightest defence remained
to him
 a cry for assistance said a voice near him
but not that which he had hitherto heard will be
stifled in your blood no harm is meant you 
be wise and be silent
the fear death which everard had often
braved in the field battle became more horrible
as he felt himself in the hands unknown assassins
and totally devoid all means defence
the sharp point the sword pricked his bare
throat and the foot him who held it was upon
woodstock 
his breast he felt it was to be a single thrust
and an there would be life and all the feverish
joys and sorrows which agitate us so strangely
and from which we are yet so reluctant to part
large drops perspiration stood upon his forehead
 this heart throbbed as if it would burst from
its confinement in the bosom she experienced the
agony which fear imposes on the brave man acute
in proportion to that which pain inflicts when it
subdues the robust and healthy
cousin alice he attempted to speak and
the sword's point pressed his throat yet more
closely cousin let me not be murdered in a
manner so fearful 
i tell you replied the voice that you
speak to one who is not here but your life is
not aimed at providing you swear on your faith
as a christian and your honour as a gentleman
that you will conceal what has happened whether
from the people below or from any other person
on this condition you may rise and if you seek
her you will find alice lee at joceline's cottage
in the forest
since i may not help myself otherwise said
 woodstock
everard i swear as i have a sense religion
and honour i will say nothing this violence
nor make any search after those who are concerned
in it
for that we care nothing said the voice
thou hast an example how well thou may'st
catch mischief on thy own part but we are incase
to defy thee bise and begone 
the foot the sword'spoint were withdrawn
and everard was about to start up hastily when
the voice in the same softness tone which distinguished
it at first said no haste cold and
bare steel is yet around thee now now snow
the words dying away as at a distance thou
art free be secret and be safe
markham everard arose and in rising embarrassed
his feet with his own sword which he
had dropped when springing forward as he supposed
to lay hold his fair cousin he snatched
it up in haste and as his hand clasped the hilt
his courage which had given way under the apprehension
 instant death began to return he
considered with almost his usual composure
what was to be done next deeply affronted at the
woodstock 
disgrace which he had sustained he questioned
for an instant whether he ought to keep his extorted
promise or should not rather summon assistance
and make haste to discover and seize
those who had been recently engaged in such violence
on his person but these persons be they
who they would had had his life in their power 
he had pledged his word in ransom it and
what was more he could not divest himself the
idea that his beloved alice was a confidante at
least if not an actor in the confederacy which
had thus baffled him this prepossession determined
his conduct for though angry at supposing
she must have been accessary to his personal
illtreatment he could not in any event think 
an instant search through the mansion which might
have committed her safety or that his uncle
but i will to the hut he said i will instantly
to the hut ascertain her share in this wild
and dangerous confederacy and snatch her from
ruin if it be possible
as under the influence the resolution which
he had formed everard groped his way through
the gallery and regained the vestibule he heard
 woodstock
his name called by the wellknown voice wild 
rake what ho houo colonel everard
mark everard it is dark as the devil's mouth
speak where are you the witches are keeping
their hellish sabbath here as i think where
are you 
here here answered everard cease
your bawling turn to the left and you will meet
me
guided by his voice wildrake soon appeared
with a light in one hand and his drawn sword in
the other where have you been i he said 
what has detained you here are bletson and
the brute desborough terrified out their lives
and harrison raving mad because the devil will
not be civil enough to rise to fight him
saw or heard you nothing as you came
along said everard
nothing said his friend excepting that
when i first entered this cursed ruinous labyrinth
the light was struck out my hand as if by a
switch which obliged me to return for another
i must come by a horse instantly wildrake
and another for thyself if it be possible
woodstock is
we can take two those belonging to the
troopers answered wildrake but for what
purpose should we run away like rats at this time
in the evening is the house falling 
i cannot answer you said the colonel pushing
forward into a room where there were some remains
 furniture
here the cavalier took a more strict view his
person and exclaimed in wonder what the
devil have you been fighting with markham that
has bedizened you after this sorry fashion 
fighting exclaimed everard
 yes replied his trusty attendant i say
fighting look at yourself in the mirror
he did and saw he was covered with dust and
blood the latter proceeded from a scratch which
he had received in the throat as he struggled to
extricate himself with unaffected alarm wildrake
undid his friend's collar and with eager
haste proceeded to examine the wound his hands
trembling and his eyes glistening with apprehension
for his benefactor's life when in spite 
everard's opposition he had examined the hurt
vol i x
 woodstock
and found it so trifling he resumed the natural
wildness his character perhaps the more readily
that he had felt shame in departing from it into
one which expressed more feeling than he would
be thought to possess
if that be the devils work mark said he
the foul fiend's claws are not nigh so formidable
as they are represented but no one shall say that
your blood has been shed unrevenged while roger
wildrake was by your side where left you
this same imp i will back to the field fight
confront him with my rapier and were his nails
tenpenny nails and his teeth as long as those 
a harrow he shall render me reason for the injury
he has done you
madness madness exclaimed everard 
i had this trifling hurt by a fall a basin and
towel will wipe it away meanwhile if you will ever
do me kindness get the troophorses command
them for the service the public in the name 
his excellency the general i will but wash and
join you in an instant before the gate
well i will serve you everard as a mute
serves the grand signior without knowing why
woodstock 
or wherefore but will you go without seeing
these people below 
without seeing any one said everard
lose no time for god's sake
he found out the noncommissioned officer
and demanded the horses in a tone authority to
which the corporal yielded undisputed obedience
as one well aware colonel everard's military
rank and consequence so all was in a minute or
two ready for the expedition 


 you also expected to visit there
yourself and so keep watch over pretty mistress
lee eh 
i never entertained so selfish a thought
said everard and if this nocturnal disturbance
at the mansion were explained and ended
i would instantly take my departure
 your friend noll would expect something
more from you said avildrake he would
expect in case the knight's reputation for loyalty
should draw any our poor exiles and wanderers
about the lodge that you should be on
the watch and ready to snap them in a word
as far as i can understand his longwinded
speechesshe would have woodstock a trap
your uncle and his pretty daughter the bait 
toasted cheesescraving your chloe's pardon for
the comparison you the springfall which should
bar their escape his lordship himself being the
great grimalkin to whom they arc to be given
over to be devoured
dared cromwell mention this to thee in express
terms said everard pulling up historic
and stopping in the midst the road
 woodstock
nay not in express terms which i do not
believe he ever used in his life you might as
well expect a drunken man to go straight forward
but he insinuated as much to me and
indicated that you might deserve well him 
gatzo the damnable proposal sticks in my
throat by betraying our noble and rightful
king here he pulled oflp his hat whom god
grant in health and wealth long to reign as the
worthy clergyman says though i fear just now
his majesty is both sick and sorry and never a
penny in his pouch to boot
this tallies with what alice hinted said
everard but how could she know it didst
thou give her any hint such a thing 
i replied the cavalier i who never saw
mistress alice in my life till tonight and then
only for an instant zooks man how is that possible

true replied everard and seemed lost in
thought at length he spoke i should call
cromwell to account for his bad opinion me 
for even though not seriously expressed but as
i am convinced it was with the sole view prowoodstock

wing you and perhaps myself it was nevertheless
a misconstruction to be resented
i'll carry a cartel for you with all my heart
and soul said wildrake and turn out with
his godliness second with as good will as i ever
drank a glass sack
pshaw replied everard those in his high
place fight no singular combats but tell me
roger wildrake didst thou thyself think me capable
 the falsehood and treachery implied in
such a message 
i exclaimed wildrake markham everard
you have been my early friend my constant
benefactor when colchester was reduced you
saved me from the gallows and since that thou
hast twenty times saved me from starving but
by heaven if i thought you capable such villainy
as your general recommended by yonder
blue sky and all the works creation which it
bends over i would stab you with my own
hand 
death replied everard i should indeed
deserve but not from you perhaps but fortunately
i cannot if i would be guilty the
 woodstock
treachery you would punish know that i had
this day secret notice and from cromwell himself
that the young man has escaped by sea from
bristol
now god almighty be blessed who protected
him through so many dangers exclaimed
wildrake huzza up hearts cavaliers 
hey for cavaliers god bless king charles 
moon and stars catch my hat and he threw
it up as high as he could into the air the celestial
bodies which he invoked did not receive
the present dispatched to them but as in the
case sir henry lee's scabbard an old gnarled
oak became a second time the receptacle a
waif and stray loyal enthusiasm wildrake
looked rather foolish at the circumstance and
his friend took the opportunity admonishing
him
art thou not ashamed to bear thee so like a
schoolboy 
why said wildrake i have but sent a
puritan's hat upon a loyal errand i laugh to
think how many the schoolboys thou talk'st 
will be cheated into climbing the pollard next
woodstock si
year expecting to find the nest some unknown
bird in yonder unmeasured margin felt
hush now for god's sake and let us speak
calmly said everard charles has escaped
and i am glad it i would willingly have seen
him on his father's throne by composition but
not by the force the scottish army and the
incensed and vengeful royalists 
master markham everard began the cavalier
interrupting him
nay hush dear wildrake said everard 
let us not dispute a point on which we cannot
agree and give me leave to go on i say since
the young man has escaped cromwell offensive
and injurious stipulation falls to the ground and
i see not why my uncle and his family should
not again enter their own house under the same
terms connivance as many other royalists
what may be incumbent on me is different nor
can i determine my course until i have an interview
with the general which as i think will
 in his confessing that he threw in this offensive
proposal to sound us both it is much in his
u
it
 woodstock
manner for he is blunt and never sees or feels
the punctilious honour which the gallants the
day stretch to such delicacy
 acquit him for having any punctilio
about him said wildrake either touching
honour or honesty now to come back to where
we started supposing you were not to reside in
person at the lodge and to forbear even visiting
there unless on invitation when such a thing
can be brought about i tell you frankly i think
your uncle and his daughter might be induced
to come back to the lodge and reside there as
usual at least the clergyman that worthy old
cock gave me to hope as much
he had been hasty in bestowing his confine
hence said everard
true replied wildrake he confided in
in me at once for he instantly saw my regard
for the church i thank heaven i never passed
a clergyman in his canonicals without pulling my
hat off and thou knowest the most desperate
duel lever fought was with young gray less the
inner temple for taking the wall the reverend
dr dunce ah i can gain a chaplain's ear inwoodstock

scanty gadzooks they know whom they have
to trust to in such a one as i
dost thou think then said colonel everard
 or rather does this clergyman think that
if they were secure intrusion from me the family
would return to the lodge supposing the
intruding commissioners gone and this nocturnal
disturbance explained and ended 
the old knight answered wildrake maybe
wrought upon by the doctor to return if he
is secure against intrusion as for disturbances
the stout old boy so far as i can learn in two
minutes conversation laughs at all this turmoil
as the work mere imagination the consequence
 the remorse their own evil consciences 
and says that goblin or devil was never heard 
at woodstock until it became the residence 
such men as they who have now usurped the possessions

there is more than imagination in it said
everard i have personal reason to know there
is some conspiracy carrying on to render the
house untenantable by the commissioners i acquit
my uncle accession to such a silly trick 
vol c
 woodstock
but i must see it ended ere i can agree to his
and my cousin's residing where such a confederacy
exists for they are likely to be considered
as the contrivers such pranks be the actual
agent who he may
with reverence to your better acquaintance
with the gentleman everard i should rather
suspect the old father puritans i beg your
pardon again has something to do with the business
 and if so lucifer will never look near
the true old knight's beard nor abide a glance
 yonder maiden's innocent blue eyes i will
uphold them as safe as pure gold in a miser's
chest
safest thou aught thyself which makes thee
think thus 
not a quill the devil's pinion saw i replied
wildrake he supposes himself too secure
 an old cavalier who must steal hang or drown
in the long run so he gives himself no trouble to
look after the assured booty but i heard the
servingfellows prate what they had seen and
heard and though their tales were confused
enough yet if there was any truth among them
woodstock
at all i should say the devil must have been in
the dance but hollo here comes some one
upon us stand friend who art thou 
a poor daylabourer in the great work 
england joseph tomkins by name secretary
to a godly and wellendowed leader in this poor
christian army england called general harrison

 what news master tomkins said everard
 and why are you on the road at this late
hours
i speak to the worthy colonel everard as
i judge said tomkins and truly i am glad
 meeting your honour heaven knows i need
such assistance as yours oh worthy master
everard here has been a sounding trumpets
and a breaking vials and a pouring
forth and 
prithee tell me in brief what is the matter
where is thy master and in a word what has
happened 
my master is close by parading it in the
little meadow beside the hugeous oak which is
called by the name the late man ride but two
steps forward and you may see him walking
wooijstocif
swiftly to and fro advancing all the while the
naked weapon
upon proceeding as directed but with as little
noise as possible they descried a man whom
 course they concluded must be harrison
walking to and fro beneath the king's oak as a
sentinel under arms but with more wildness 
demeanour the tramp the horses did not
escape his ear and they heard him call out as
if at the head the brigade lower pikes
against cavalry here comes prince rupertstand
fast and you shall turn them aside as a
bull would toss a curdog lower your pikes
still my hearts the secured against your foot
down on your right knee front rank spare
not for the spoiling your blue aprons ha 
zerobabel ay that is the word
in the name heaven about whom or
what is he talking said everard wherefore
does he go about with his weapon drawn 
truly sir when aught disturbs my master
general harrison he is something rapt in the
spirit and conceives that he is commanding a reserve
 pikes at the great battle armageddon
and for his weapon alack worthy sir wherefore
woodstock s
should he keep sheffield steel in calves leather
when there are fiends to be combated incarnate
fiends on earth and raging infernal fiends under
the earth 
 this is intolerable said everard listen
to me tomkins thou art not now in the
pulpit and i desire none thy preaching language
i know thou canst speak intelligibly
when thou art so minded remember i may
serve or harm thee and as you hope or fear anything
on my part answer straightforward 
what has happened to drive out thy master to
the wild wood at this time night
 forsooth worthy and honoured sir i will
speak with the precision i may true it is and
 verity that the breath man which is in his
nostrils goeth forth and returned 
hark you sir said colonel everard take
care where you ramble in your correspondence
with me you have heard how at the great battle
 dunbar in scotland the general himself
held a pistol to the head lieutenant hewcreed
threatening to shoot him through the brain
if he did not give up holding forth and put his
squadron in line to the front take care sir
 v i vj o
 woodstock
verily the lieutenant then charged with an
even and unbroken order said tomkins and
bore a thousand plaids and bonnets over the
beach before him into the sea neither shall i
pretermit or postpone your honour's commands
but speedily obey them and that without delay
 go to fellow thou knowest what i would
have said everard speak at once i know
thou canst if thou wilt trusty tomkins is better
known than he thinks for
worthy sir said tomkins in a much less
periphrastic style i will obey your worship as
far as the spirit will permit truly it was not an
hour since when my worshipful master being at
table with master bibbet and myself not to
mention the worshipful master bletson and colonel
desborough and behold there was a violent
knocking at the gate as one in haste now 
a certainty so much had our household been
harassed with witches and spirits and other objects
 sound and sight that the sentinels could
not be brought to abide upon their posts without
doors and it was only by provision beef and
strong liquors that we were able to maintain
a guard three men in the hall who neverthe
woodstock 
less ventured not to open the door lest they
should be surprised with some the goblins
wherewith their imaginations were overwhelmed
and they heard the knocking which increased
until it seemed that the door was well nigh about
to be beaten down worthy master bibbet was a
little overcome with liquor as is his fashion goodman
about this time the evening not that he
is in the least given to ebriety but simply that
since the scottish campaign he hath had a perpetual
ague which obliges him so to nourish his
frame against the damps the night wherefore
as it is well known to your honour that i
discharge the office a faithful servant as well
to majorgeneral harrison and the other commissioners
as to my just and lawful master colonel
desborough 
i know all that and now that thou art
trusted by both i pray to heaven thou may'st
merit the trust said colonel everard
and devoutly do i pray said tomkins
that your worshipful prayers may be answered
with favour for certainly to be and to be called
and entitled honest joe and trusty tomkins
is to me more than ever would be an ears title
 woodstockwere
such things to be granted anew in this regenerated
government
well go on go on or if thou tallest much
longer i will make bold to dispute the article 
your honesty i like short tales sir and doubt
what is told with a long unnecessary train 
words
well good sir be not hasty as i said before
thedoors rattled till you would have thought
the knocking was reiterated in every room 
the palace the bell rung out for company
though we could not find that any one tolled the
clapper and the guards let off their firelock merely
because they knew not what better to do so
master bibbet being as i said unsusceptible 
his duty i went down with my poor rapier to the
door and demanded who was there and i was
answered in a voice which i must say was
much like another voice that it was one wanting
majorgeneral harrison so as it was then late
i answered mildly that general harrison was
betaking himself to his rest and that any who
wished to speak to him must return on the morrow
morning for that after nightfall the door 
the palace being in the room a garrison would
woodstock 
be opened to no one so the voice replied and
bid me open directly without which he would
blow the folding leaves the door into the middle
 the hall and therewithal the noise recommenced
that we thought the house would
have fallen and i was in some measure constrained
to open the door even like a besieged garrison
which can hold out no longer
by my honour and it was stoutly done you
i must say said wildrake who had been listening
with much interest i am a bold daredevil
enough yet when i had two inches oak plank
between the actual fiend and me hang him that
would demolish the barrier between us say i
i would as soon when aboard bore a hole in the
ship and let in the waves for you know we always
compare the devil to the deep seas
pr'ythee peace wildrake said everard
and let him on with his history well and
what saw'st thou when the door was opened 
the great devil with his horns and claws thou
wilt say no doubt
 no sir i will say nothing but what is true 
when i undid the door one man stood there
and he to seeming a man no extraordinary
 woodstock
appearance he was wrapped in a taffeta cloak
 a scarlet colour and with a red lining he
seemed as if he might have been in his time a
very handsome man but there was something 
paleness and sorrow in his face a long lovelock
and long hair he wore even after the abomination
 the cavaliers and the unloveliness as
learned master prynne well termed it lovelocks
 a jewel in his ear a blue scarf over his
shoulder like a military commander for the king
and a hat with a white plume bearing a peculiar
hatband
some unhappy officer cavaliers whom
so many are in hiding and seeking shelter through
the country briefly replied everard
true worthy sir right as a judicious exposition
but there was something about this
man if he was a man whom i for one could
not look upon without trembling nor the musketeers
who were in the hall without betraying
much alarm and swallowing as they themselves
swill aver the very bullets which they had in
their mouths for loading their carabines and muskets
nay the wolf and deerdogs that are
woodstock 
the fiercest their kind fled from this visitor
and crept into holes and corners moaning and
wailing in a low and broken tone he came
into the middle the hall and still he seemed
no more than an ordinary man only somewhat
fantastically dressed in a doublet black velvet
pinked upon scarlet satin under his cloak a jewel
in his ear with large roses in his shoes and a
kerchief in his hand which he sometimes pressed
against his left side
gracious heaven said wildrake coming
close up to everard and whispering in his ear
with accents which terror rendered tremulous a
mood mind most unusual to the daring man
who seemed now overcome by it it must have
been poor dick robinson the player in the very
dress in which i have seen him play pilaster 
ay and drank a jolly bottle with him after it at
the mermaid i remember how many frolicks
we had together and all his little fantastic fashions
he served for his old master charles
in mohun's troop and was murdered by this
butcher's dog as i have heard after surrender
at the battle nasebyfield
 woodstock
hush i have heard the deed said everard
 for god's sake hear the man to an 
did this visitor speak to thee my friend 
yes sir in a pleasing tone voice but
somewhat fanciful in the articulation and like
one who is speaking to an audience as from a
bar or a pulpit more than in the voice ordinary
men on ordinary matters he desired to
see majorgeneral harrison
he did and you said everard infected
by the spirit the time which as is well known
leaned to credulity upon all matters supernatural
agency what did you do 
i went up to the parlour and related that
such a person inquired for him he started when
i told him and eagerly desired to know the
man's dress but no sooner did i mention his
dress and the jewel in his ear than he said
begone tell him i will not admit him to speech
 me say that i defy him and will make my
defiance good at the great battle in the valley 
armageddon when the voice the angel shall
call all fowls which fly under the face heaven
to feed on the flesh the captain and the soils

woodstock
tier the warhorse and his rider say to the
evil one i have power to appeal our conflict
even till that day and that in the front that
fearful day he will again meet with harrison
i went back with this answer to the stranger
and his face was writhed into such a deadly
frown as a mere human brow hath seldom worn
return to him he said and say it is my
hour and that if he come not instantly down to
speak with me i will mount the stairs to him
say that i command him to descend by the token
that on the field naseby he did not the
work negligently 
 i have heard whispered wildrake who
felt more and more strongly the contagion superstition
 that these words were blasphemously
used by harrison when he shot my poor
friend dick
what happened next said everard see
that thou speaks the truth
as gospel expounded by a steepleman
said the independent yet truly it is but little
i have to say i saw my master come down
with a blank yet resolved air and when he entered
the hall and saw the stranger he made a
 woodstock
pause the other waved on him as if to follow
and walked out at the portal my worthy patron
seemed as if he were about to follow yet
again paused when this visitant be he man or
fiend reentered and said obey thy doom
by pathless march by greenwood tree
it is thy weird to follow me 
to follow me through the ghastly moonlight 
to follow me through the shadows night 
to follow me comrade still art thou bound 
i conjure thee by the untouched wound
i conjure thee by the last words i spoke
when the body slept and the spirit awoke
in the very last pangs the deadly stroke
so saying he stalked out and my master followed
him into the wood i followed also at a
distance but when i came up my master was
alone and bearing himself as you now behold
him
thou hast had a wonderful memory friend
said the colonel coldly to remember these
rhymes in a single recitation there seems something
 practice in all this
a single recitation my honoured sir exclaimed
the independent alack the rhyme is
seldom out my poor master's mouth when as
sometimes laps he is less triumphant in his
woodstock 
wrestles with satan but it was the first time 
ever heard it uttered by another and to say
truth he ever seems to repeat it unwillingly as a
child after his pedagogue and as it was not indited
by his own head as the psalmist saith
it is strange said everard i have heard
and read that the spirits the slaughtered have
strange power over the slayer but i am astonished
to believe there may be truth in such tales
roger wildrake what art thou afraid 
man why dost thou shift thy place thus 
fear it is not fear it is hate deadly hate
i see the murderer poor dick before me
and see he throws himself into a posture fence
sa sa say'st thou brood a butcher's mastiffs
thou shalt not want an antagonist
ere any one could stop him wildrake threw
aside his cloak drew his sword and almost with
a single bound cleared the distance betwixt him
and harrison and crossed swords with the latter
as he stood brandishing his weapon as if in
immediate expectation an assailant accordingly
the republican general was not for an
instant taken at unawares but the moment the
swords clashed he shouted ha i feel thee
 woodstock
now thou hast come in body at last welcome 
welcome the sword the lord and gideon

 part them part them cried everard as he
and tom king at first astonished at the suddenness
 the affray hastened to interfere everard
seizing on the cavalier drew him forcibly backwards
while tomkins contrived with risk and
difficulty to master harrison's sword while the
general exclaimed ha two to one two to
one thus fight demons wildrakeon his side
swore a dreadful oath and added markham
you have cancelled every obligation i owed you 
they are all out sight gone d n me
 you have indeed acquitted these obligations
rarely said everard who knows how this
affair shall be explained and answered 
i will answer it with my ife said wildrake

good now be silent said tomkins and
let me manage it shall be so ordered that the
good general shall never know that he hath encountered
with a mortal man only let that man
 moab put his sword into the scabbard's rest
and be still
woodstock 
wildrake let me entreat thee to sheathe thy
sword said everard else on my life thou
must turn it against me
no fore george not so mad as that neither
but i'll have another day with him
 thou another day exclaimed harrison
whose eye had still remained fixed on the spot
where he found such palpable resistance yes
i know thee well day by day week by week
thou makes the same idle request for thou
knowest that my heart quivers at thy voice 
but my hand trembles not when opposed to thine
the spirit is willing to the combat if the flesh
be weak when opposed to that which is not 
the flesh
now peace all for heaven's sake said
the steward tomkins then added addressing
his master there is no one here if it please
your excellence but tomkins and the worthy
colonel everard
general harrison as sometimes happens in
cases partial insanity that is supposing his
to have been a case mental delusion though
vol d
 woodstock
firmly and entirely persuaded the truth his
own visions yet was not willing to speak on the
subject to those who he knew would regard them
as imaginary upon this occasion he assumed
the appearance perfect ease and composure
after the violent agitation he had just manifested
in a manner which showed how anxious he was to
disguise his real feelings from everard whom he
considered as unlikely to participate them
he saluted the colonel with profound ceremony
and talked the fineness the evening
which had summoned him forth the lodge to
take a turn in the park and enjoy the favourable
weather he then took everard by the arm and
walked back with him towards the lodge wildrake
and tomkins following close behind and
leading the horses everard desirous to gain
some light on these mysterious incidents endeavoured
to come on the subject more than once by
a mode interrogation which harrison for madmen
are very often unwilling to enter on the subject
 their mental delusion parried with some
skill or addressed himself for aid to his steward
tomkins who was in the habit seeing voucher
woodstock 
for his master upon all occasions which led to
desirous's ingenious nickname gibbet
and wherefore had you your sword drawn
my worthy general said everard when you
were only on an evening walk pleasure 
truly excellent colonel these are times
when men must watch with their loins girded
and their lights burning and their weapons
drawn the day draweth nigh believe me or not
as you will that men must watch lest they be
found naked and unarmed when the seven trumpets
shall sound boot and saddle and the pipes
 jeer shall strike up horse and away
 true good general but methought i saw
you making passes even now as if you were fighting
said everard
i am a strange fantasy friend everard
answered harrison and when i walk alone
and happen as but now to have my weapon
drawn i sometimes for exercise sake will practise
a thrust against such a tree as that it is a
silly pride men have in the use weapons i
have been accounted a master fence and have
fought prizes when i was unregenerate and
 woodstock
before i was called to do my part in the great
work entering as a trooper into our victorious
general's first regiment horse
but methought said everard i heard a
weapon clash with yours 
how a weapon clash with my sword 
how could that be tomkins 
truly sir said tomkins it must have
been a bough the tree they have them all
kinds here and your honour may have pushed
against one them which the brazilians call
ironwood a block which being struck with a
hammer saith purchas in his pilgrimage ringeth
like an anvil
 truly it may be so said harrison for
these rulers who are gone assembled in this their
abode pleasure many strange trees and plants
though they gathered not the fruit that
tree which beareth twelve manner fruits or
 those leaves which are the healing the nations

everard pursued his investigation for he was
struck with the manner in which harrison evaded
his questions and the dexterity with which
woodstock 
lie threw his transcendental and fanatical notions
like a sort veil over the darker visions excited
by remorse and conscious guilt
but said he if i may trust my eyes and
ears i cannot but still think that you had a real
antagonist nay i am sure i saw a fellow in a
darkcoloured jerkin retreat through the wood
did you said harrison with a tone 
surprise while his voice faltered in spite him
who could he be tomkins did you see the
fellow colonel everard talks with the napkin
in his hand the bloody napkin which he always
pressed to his side 
this last expression in which harrison gave
a mark different from that which everard had
assigned but corresponding to tomkins's original
description the supposed spectre had more
effect on everard in confirming the steward's
story than anything he had witnessed or heard
the voucher answered the draft upon him as
promptly as usual that he had seen such a fellow
glide past them into the thicket that he daresay
he was some deerstealer for he had heard they
were become very audacious
 woodstock
look ye there now master everard said
harrison hurrying from the subject is it not
time now that we should lay aside our controversies
and join hand in hand to repairing the
breaches our zion happy and contented
were i my excellent friend to be a reader 
mortar or a bearer a hod upon this occasion
under our great leader with whom providence
has gone forth in this great national controversy 
and truly so devoutly do i hold by our excellent
and victorious general oliver whom heaven
long preserve that were he to command me i
should not scruple to pluck forth his high
place the man whom they call speaker even as
i lent a poor hand to pluck down the man whom
they called king wherefore as i know your
judgment holdeth with mine on this matter let
rae urge unto you lovingly that we may act as brethren
and build up the breaches and reestablish
the bulwarks our english zion whereby we
shall be doubtless chosen as pillars and buttresses
under our excellent lord general for supporting
and sustaining the same and endowed with
proper revenues and incomes both spiritual and
moodstotx 
temporal to serve as a pedestal on which we
may stand seeing that otherwise our foundation
will be on the loose sand nevertheless continued
he his mind again diverging from his
views temporal ambition into his visions 
the fifth monarchy these things are but vanity
in respect the opening the which
is sealed for all things approach speedily towards
lightning and thundering and unloosing the
great dragon from the bottomless pit wherein he
is chained
with this mingled strain earthly politics
and fanatical prediction harrison so overpowered
colonel everard as to leave him no time to urge
lira further on the particular circumstances 
his nocturnal skirmish concerning which it is
plain he had no desire to be interrogated they
now reached the lodge woodstock
 woodstock
chapter iii
now the wasted brands do glow
while the screechowl sounding loud
puts the wretch that lies in woe
in remembrance a shroud
now it is the time night
that the graves all gaping wide
livery one lets out its sprite
in the churchway paths to glide
midsummer night's dream
before the gate the palace the guards were
now doubled everard demanded the reason 
this from the corporal whom he found in the hall
with his soldiers sitting or sleeping around a great
fire maintained at the expense the carved
chairs and benches with fragments which it
was furnished
why verily answered the man the corps
de garde as your worship says will be harassed
to pieces by such dujy nevertheless fear hath
woodstock 
gone abroad among us and no one man will
mount guard alone we have drawn in however
one or two our outposts from banbury
and elsewhere and we are to have a relief from
oxford tomorrow
everard continued minute inquiries concerning
the sentinels that were posted within as
well as without the castle and found that as
they had been stationed under the eye harrison
himself the rules prudent discipline had
been exactly observed in the distribution the
posts there remained nothing therefore for colonel
everard to do excepting that remembering
his own adventure the evening to recommend
that an additional sentinel should be placed with
a companion if judged indispensable in that vestibule
or antiroom from which the long gallery
where he had met with the rencounter and other
suites apartments diverged the corporal respectfully
promised all obedience to his orders
the servingmen being called appeared also in
double force everard demanded to know whether
the commissioners had gone to bed or whether
he could get speech with them 
f they are in their bedroom forsooth replied
 woodstock
one the fellows but i think be not yet undressed

what said everard are colonel desborough
and master bletson both in the same
sleeping apartment 
their honours have so chosen it said the
man and their honours secretaries remain
upon guard all night
it is the fashion to double guards all over
the house said wildrake had i a glimpse 
a goodlooking housemaid now i should know
how to fall into the fashion
peace fool said everard and where
are the mayor and master holdenough 
the mayor is returned to the borough on
horseback behind the trooper who goes to oxford
for the reinforcement and the man the
steeplehouse hath quartered himself in the chamber
which colonel desborough had last night
being that in which he is most likely to meet the
your honour understands the lord pity
us we are a harassed family 
and where be general harrison's knaves
said tomkins that they do not marshal him
to his apartment 
woodstock 
here here here master tompkins said
three fellows pressing forward with the same consternation
on their faces which seemed to pervade
the whole inhabitants woodstock
away with you then said tomkins 
speak not to his worship you see he is not in
the humour
indeed observed colonel everard he
looks singularly wan his features seem writhen
as by a palsy stroke and though he was talking
so fast while we came along he hath not opened
this mouth since we came to the light
it is his manner after such visitations said
tomkins give his honour your arms zedekiah
and jonathan to lead him off i will follow
instantly you nicodemus tarry to wait upon
me it is not well walking alone in this mansion
master tomkins said everard i have
heard you often as a sharp intelligent man 
tell me fairly are you in earnest afraid anything
supernatural haunting this house 
i would be loath to run the chance sir said
tomkins very gravely by looking on my worshipful
master you may form a guess how the
living look after llicy have spoken with the dead
 woodstock
he bowed low and took his leave everard
proceeded to the chamber which the two remaining
commissioners had for comfort's sake chosen
to inhabit in company they were preparing
for bed as he went into their apartment both
started as the door opened both rejoiced when
they saw it was only everard who entered
hark ye hither said bletson pulling him
aside safest thou ever ass equal to lesbos
 the fellow is as big as an ox and as
timorous as a sheep he has insisted on my
sleeping here to protect him shall we have a
merry night on't ha we will if thou wilt take
the third bed which was prepared for harrison 
but he is gone out like a mooncalf to look for
the valley armageddon in the park woodstock

general harrison has returned with me but
now said everard
nay but as i shall live he comes not into
our apartment said desborough overhearing
his answer no man that has been supping
for aught i know with the devil has a right to
sleep among christian folks
woodstock t
 he does not propose so said everard 
he sleeps as i understand apart and alone
not quite alone i dare say said lesbos
 for harrison hath a sort attraction
for goblins they fly round him like moths about
a candle but i prithee good everard do thou
stay with us i know not how it is but although
thou hast not thy religion always in thy mouth
nor speaks many hard words about it like harrison
 nor makes long preachments like a certain
most honourable relation mine who shall
be nameless yet somehow i feel myself safer in
thy company than with any them as for
this bletson he is such a mere blasphemer that
i fear the devil will carry him away ere morning

did you ever hear such a paltry coward 
said bletson apart to everard do tarry
however mine honoured colonel i know your
zeal to assist the distressed and you see desborough
is in that predicament that he will
require near him more than one good example to
prevent him thinking ghosts and fiends
 i am sorry i cannot oblige you gentleman's
said everard but i have settled my mind w
gti woodstock
sleep in victor lee's apartment so i wish you
good night and if you would repose without
disturbance i would advise that you commend
yourselves during the watches the night to
him unto whom night is even as midday i
had intended to have spoke with you this evening
on the subject my being here but i will
defer the conference till tomorrow when i
think i will be able to show you excellent reasons
for leaving woodstock
we have seen plenty such already said
desborough for one i came here to serve the
estate with some moderate advantage doubtless
to myself for my trouble but if i am set upon
my head again tonight as i was the night before
i would not stay longer to gain a king's crown
for i am sure my neck would be unfitted to bear
the weight it
good night exclaimed everard and was
about to go when bletson again pressed close
and whispered to him hark thee colonel you
know my friendship for thee i do implore thee
to leave the door thy apartment open that if
thou meekest with any disturbance i may hear
thee call and be with thee upon the very instant
woodstock 
do this dear everard my fears for thee will
keep me awake else for i know that notwithstanding
your excellent sense you entertain some
 those superstitious ideas which we suck in
with our mother's milk and which constitute the
ground our fears in situations like the present 
therefore leave thy door open if you love me that
you may have ready assistance from me in case
 need
my masters said wildrake trusts first
in his bible sir and then in his good sword
he has no idea that the devil can be baffled by
the charm two men lying in one room still
less that the foul fiend can be argued out existence
by the nuuifidians the rota
everard seized his imprudent friend by the
collar and dragged him off as he was speaking
keeping fast hold him till they were both in
the chamber victor lee where they had slept
on a former occasion even then he continued
to hold wildrake until the servant had arranged
the lights and was dismissed from the room 
then letting him go addressed him with the upbraiding
question art thou not a prudent and
 woodstock
sagacious person who in times like these seek
every opportunity to argue yourself into a broil
or embroil yourself in an argument out on
you 
ay out on me indeed said the cavalier 
out on me for a poor tamespirited creature j
that submits to be bandied about in this manners
by a man who is neither better born nor better
bred than myself i tell thee mark you
make an unfair use your advantages over me
why will you not let me go from you and live
and die after my own fashion 
because before we had been a week separate
i should hear your dying after the fashion
 a dog come my good friend what
madness was it in thee to fall foul on harrison
and then to enter into useless argument with
bletson 
why we are in the devil's house i think
and i would willingly give the landlord his due
wherever i travel to have sent him harrison
or bletson now just as a lunch to stop his appetite
till from 
hush stone walls have ears said everard
woodstock 
looking around him here stands thy nightdrink
look to thy arms for we must be as careful
as if the avenger blood were behind us
yonder is thy bed and i as thou seest have
one prepared in the parlour the door only
divides us
which i will leave open in case thou should'st
hollo for assistance as yonder nuuifidian hath
it but how hast thou got all this so well put in
order good patron f
i gave the steward tomkins notice ray
purpose to sleep here
a strange fellow that said wildrake and
as i judge has taken measure every one's
foot all seems to pass through his hands
 he is i have understood replied everard
one the men formed by the times has a
ready gift preaching and expounding which
keeps him in high terms with the independents 
and recommends himself to the more moderate
people by his intelligence and activity
has his sincerity ever been doubted said
wildrake
never that i heard said io colonel 
vol k
 woodstock
on the contrary he has been familiarly called
honest joe and trusty tomkins for my part
i believe his sincerity has always kept pace with
his interest but come finish thy cup and to
bed what all emptied at one draught 
 adszookers yes my vow forbids me to
make two on't but never fear the nightcap
will only warm my brain not clog it so manor
devil give me notice if you are disturbed and
rely on me in a twinkling so saying the cavalier
retreated into his separate apartment and
colonel everard taking off the most cumbrous
part his dress lay down in his hose and doublet
and composed himself to rest
he was awakened from sleep by a slow and
solemn strain music which died away as at a
distance he started up and felt for his arms
which he found close beside him his temporary
bed being without curtains he could look
around him without difficulty but as there remained
in the chimney only a few red embers 
the fire which he had arranged before he went to
sleep it was impossible he could discern anything
he felt therefore in spite his natural
courage that undefined and thrilling species 
woodstock 
tremor which attends a sense that danger is near
and an uncertainty concerning its cause and character
reluctant as hews to yield belief to supernatural
occurrences we have already said he was
not absolutely incredulous as perhaps even in
this more sceptical age there are many fewer
complete and absolute infidels on this particular
than give themselves out for such uncertain
whether he had not dreamed these sounds
which seemed yet in his ears he was unwilling
to risk the raillery his friend by summoning
him to his assistance he sat up therefore in
his bed not without experiencing that nervous
agitation to which brave men as well as cowards are
subject with this difference that the one sinks
under it like the vine under the hailstorm and
the other collects his energies to shake it off as
the cedar lebanon is said to elevate its boughs
to disperse the snow which accumulates upon
them
the story harrison in his own absolute
despite and notwithstanding a secret suspicion
which he had trick or connivance returned on
his mind at this dead and solitary hour harrison
he remembered had described the vision
g woonstoik
iy a circumstance its appearance different from
that which his own remark had been calculated
to suggest to the mind the visionary that
bloody napkin always pressed to the side was
then a circumstance present either to his bodily
eye or to that his agitated imagination did
then the murdered revisit the living haunts
 those who had forced them from the stage
with all their sins unaccounted for and if they
did might not the same permission authorize
other visitations a similar nature to warn to
instruct to punish rash are they was his conclusion
and credulous who receive as truth every
tale the kind but no less rash may it be to
limit the power the creator over the works
which he has made and to suppose that by the
permission the author nature the laws 
nature may not in peculiar cases and for high
purposes be temporarily suspended
while these thoughts passed through everard's
mind feelings unknown to him even when
he stood first on the rough and perilous edge 
battle gained ground upon him he feared he
knew not what and where an open and discernible
peril would have drawn out his courage the
woods k 
absolute uncertainty his situation increased
his sense the danger he felt an almost irresistible
desire to spring from his bed and heap
fuel on the dying embers expecting by the blaze
to see some strange sight in his chamber he
was also strongly templed to awaken wildrake 
but shame stronger than fear itself checked
these impulses what should it be thought
that markham everard held one the best soldiers
who had drawn a sword in this sad war 
markham everard who had obtained such distinguished
rank in the army the parliament
though so young in years was afraid remaining
by himself in a twilightroom at midnight
it never should be said
this was however no charm for his unpleasant
current thought there rushed on his
mind the various traditions victor lee's chamber
which though he had often despised them
as vague unauthenticated and inconsistent rumours
engendered by ancient superstition and
transmitted from generation to generation by
loquacious rrcduhty had yet something in them
which did not tend to allay the present imo
woodstock
pleasant state his nerves then when he
recollected the events that very afternoon
the weapon pressed against his throat and the
strong arm which threw him backward on the
floor if the remembrance served to contradict
the idea flitting phantoms and unreal daggers
it certainly induced him to believe that
there was in some part this extensive mansion
a party cavaliers or malignant harboured
who might arise in the night overpower the
guards and execute upon them all but on harrison
in particular as one the regicide judges
that vengeance which was so eagerly thirsted forby
the attached followers the slaughtered monarch

he endeavoured to console himself on this
subject by the number and position the
guards yet still was dissatisfied with himself for
not having taken yet more exact precautions and
for keeping an extorted promise silence which
might consign so many his party to the danger
 assassination these thoughts connected
with his military duties awakened another train
 reflections he bethought himself that all he
woodstock 
could now do was to visit the sentries and ascertain
that they were awake alert on the watch
and so situated that in time need they might
be ready to support each other this better
befits me he thought than to be here like a
child frightening myself with the old woman's
legend which i have laughed at when a boy
what if old victor lee was a sacrilegious man
as common report goes and brewed ale in the
font which he brought from the ancient palace 
holyrood while church and building were inflames
 and what if his eldest son was when a
child scalded to death in the same vessel how
many churches have been demolished since his
time how many fonts desecrated so many
indeed that were the vengeance heaven to
visit such aggressions in a supernatural manner
no corner in england no not the most petty
parish church but would have its apparition 
tush these are idle fancies unworthy especially
to be entertained by those educated to believe
that sanctity resides in the intention and the act
not in the buildings or fonts or the form worship

 woodstock
as thus he called together the articles his
calvinistic creed the bell the great clock a
token seldom silent in such narratives tolled three
and was immediately followed by the hoarse call
 the sentinels through vault and gallery upstairs
and beneath challenging and answering
each other with the usual watchword all's well
their voices mingled with the deep boom the
bell yet ceased before that was silent and when
they had died away the tingling echo the prolonged
knell was scarcely audible ere yet that
last distant tingling had finally subsided into silence
it seemed as if it again was awakened and
everard could hardly judge at first whether a new
echo had taken up the falling cadence or whether
some other and separate sound was disturbing
anew the silence to which the deep knell had as
its voice ceased consigned the ancient mansion
and the woods around it
but the doubt was soon cleared up the musical
tones which had mingled with the dying
echoes the knell seemed at first to prolong
and afterwards to survive them a wild strain
 melody beginning at a distance and growwoodstock

ing louder as it advanced seemed to pass from
room to room from cabinet to gallery from
hall to bower through the deserted and dishonoured
ruins the ancient residence so many
sovereigns and as it approached no soldier gave
alarm nor did any the numerous guests various
degrees who spent an unpleasant and terrified
night in that ancient mansion seem to dare to
announce to each other the inexplicable cause 
apprehension
everard's excited state mind did not permit
him to be so passive the sounds approached so
nigh that it seemed they were performing in the
very next apartment a solemn service for the dead
when he gave the alarm by calling loudly to his
trusty attendant and friend wildrake who slumbered
in tht next chamber with only a door betwixt
them and even that ajar
wildrake wildrake up up dost thou
not hear the alarm 
there was no answer from wildrake though
the musical sounds which now rung through the
apartment as if the performers had actually been
within its precincts would have been sufficient to
 woodstock
awaken a sleeping person even without the shout
 his comrade and patron
alarm roger wildrake arm again
called everard getting out bed and graspinghis
weapons get a light and cry alarm
there was no answer his voice died away as
the sound the music seemed also to die and
the same soft sweet voice which still to his thinking
resembled that alice lee was heard in his
apartment and as he thought at no distance from
him
your comrade will not answer said the low
soft voice those only hear the alarm whose
consciences feel the call
again this mummery said edward i
am better armed than i was late and but for
the sound that voice the speaker had bought
his trifling dear
it was singular we may observe in passing that
the instant the distinct sounds the human voice
were heard by everard all idea supernatural
interference was at an and the charm by
which he had been formerly fettered appeared to
be broken so much is the influence imaginary
woodblock 
or superstitious terror dependant so far as respects
strong judgments at least upon what is
vague or ambiguous and so readily do distinct
tones and express ideas bring such judgments
back to the current ordinary life the voice returned
answer as addressing his thoughts as well
as his words
 we laugh at the weapons thou thickest
should terrify us over the guardians woodstock
they have no power fire if thou wilt
and try the effect thy weapons but know
it is not our purpose to harm thee thou art a
falcon breed and noble in thy disposition though
unreclaimed and ill nurtured thou haunted with
kites and carrion crows wing thy flight from
hence on the morrow for if thou tarriest with
the bats owls vultures and ravens which have
thought to nestle here thou wilt inevitably share
their fate away then that these halls may be
swept and garnished for reception those who
have a better right to inhabit them
everard answered in a raised voice once
more i warn you think not to defy me in vain i
am no child to be frightened by goblins tales and
 woodstock
no coward armed as i am to be alarmed at the
threats banditti if i give you a moment's indulgence
it is for the sake dear and misguided
friends who may be concerned with this dangerous
gambol know i can bring a troop soldiers
round the castle who will search its most inward
recesses for the author this audacious frolic 
and if that search should fail it will cost but a
few barrels gunpowder to make the mansion a
heap ruins and bury under them the authors 
such an illjudged pastime
you speak proudly sir colonel said another
voice similar to that harsher and stronger
tone by which he had been addressed in the gallery
 try your courage in this direction
you should not dare me twice said colonel
everard had i a glimpse light to take aim
by
as he spoke a sudden gleam light was
thrown with a brilliancy which almost dazzled
the speaker showing distinctly a form somewhat
resembling that victor lee as represented
in his picture holding in the one hand a
lady completely veiled and in the other his leadwoodstock

kingstaff or truncheon both figures were animated
and as it appeared standing within six
feet him
were it not for the woman said everard
i would not be thus mortally dared
spare not for the female form but do your
worst replied the same voice i defy you
repeat your defiance when i have counted
thrice said everard and take the punishment
 your insolence once i have cocked my pistol
 twice i never missed my aim by all that
is sacred i fire if you do not withdraw when
i pronounce the next number i will shoot you
dead where you stand i am yet unwilling to shed
blood i give you another chance flight once
twice thrice
everard aimed at the bosom and discharged his
pistol the figure waved its arm in an attitude 
scorn and a loud laugh arose during which the
light as gradually growing weaker danced and
glimmered upon the apparition the aged knight
and then disappeared everard's lifeblood ran
cold to his heart had he been human mould
 woodstock
ie thought the bullet must have pierce him
and i have neither will nor power to fight with
supernaturalal beings
the feeling oppression was now so strong as
to be actually sickening he groped his way
however to the fireside and flung on the embers
which were yet gleaming a handful dry fuel
it presently blazed and afforded him light to seethe
room in every direction he looked cautiously
almost timidly around and half expected
some horrible phantom to become visible but he
saw nothing save the old furniture the 
and other articles which had been left
in the same state as when sir henry lee departed
he felt an uncontrollable desire mingled
with much repugnance to look at the portrait 
the ancient knight which the form he had seen
so strongly resembled he hesitated betwixt the
opposing feelings but at length snatched with desperate
resolution the taper which he had extinguished
and relighted it ere the blaze the fuel
had again died away he held it up to the ancient
portrait victor lee and gazed on it
with eager curiosity not unmingled with fear
woodstock 
almost the childish terrors his earlier days returned
and he thought the severe pale eye the
ancient warrior followed his and menaced him
with its displeasure and although he quickly
argued himself out such an absurd belief yet
the mixed feelings his mind were expressed in
words that seemed half addressed to the ancient
portrait
soul my mother's ancestor he said be
it for weal or for woe by designing men or by
supernatural beings that these ancient halls are
disturbed i am resolved to leave them on the
morrow
i rejoice to hear it with all my soul said a
voice behind him
he turned saw a tall figure in white with a
sort turban upon its head and dropping the
candle in the exertion instantly grappled with it
thou at least art palpable he said
palpable answered he whom he grasped so
strongly sdeath methinks you might know
that without the risk choking me and if you
loose me not i'll show you that two can play at
the game wrestling
 woodstock
roger wiklrakc said everard letting the
cavalier loose and stepping back
 roger wildrake ay truly did you take
me for roger bacon come to help you to raise
the devil for the place smells sulphur consumedly

it is the pistol i fired did you not hear
it
why yes it was the first thing waked me 
for that night cap which i pulled on made me
sleep like a dormouse pshaw i feel my brains
giddy with it yet
and wherefore came you not on the instant 
i never needed help more
i came as fast as i could answered wildrake
 but it was some time ere i got my senses
collected for i was dreaming that cursed field
at naseby and then the door my room was
shut and hard to open till i played the locksmith
with my foote
how it was open when i went to bed said
everard
 it was locked when i came out bed though
is
woodstock 
said wildrake and i marvel you heard me not
when i forced it opens
my mind was occupied otherwise said everard

well said wildrake but what has happened
 here am i bolt upright and ready to
fight if this yawning fit will give me leave mother
redcap's mightiest is weaker than i drank
last night by a bushel to a barleycorn i have
quaffed the very elixir malt ha yaw
and some opiate besides i should think
said everard
very like very like less than the pistolshot
would not waken me even me who with but
an ordinary gracecup sleep as lightly as a maiden
on the first may when she watches for the
earliest beam to go to gather dew but what are
you about to do next 
nothing answered everard
nothing said wildrake in surprise
i speak it said colonel everard less for
your information than for that others who may
hear me that i will leave the lodge this mornvol
 f
 woodstock
ing and if it is possible remove the commissioners

 hark said wildrake do you not hear
some noise hke the distant sound the applause
 a theatre the goblins the place rejoice in
your departure
i shall leave woodstock said everard to
the occupation my uncle sir henry lee and
his family if they choose to resume it not that
i am frightened into this as a concession to the
series artifices which have been played off on
this occasion but solely because such was my intention
from the beginning but let me warn he
added raising his voices let me warn the parties
concerned in this combination that though it
may pass off successfully on a fool like lesbos
a visionary like harrison a coward like
bletson 
here a voice distinctly spoke as standing near
them or a wise moderate and resolute person
like colonel everard
by heaven the voice came from the picture
said wildrake drawing his sword i will pink
his plaited armour for him
woodstock s
ojfter no violence said everard startled at
the interruption but resuming with firmness what
he was saying let those engaged be aware that
however this string artifices may be immediately
successful it must when closely looked into be
attended with the punishment all concerned 
the total demolition woodstock and the irremediable
downfall the family lee let all
concerned think this and desist in time
he paused and almost expected a reply but
none came
it is a very odd thing said wildrakc but
yawha my brain cannot compass it just now 
it whirls round like a toast in a bowl muscadine
 i must sit down hewyaw and discuss it
at leisure gramercy good elbowchair
so saying he threw himself or rather sank
gradually down on a large easy chair which had
been often pressed by the weight stout sir
henry lee and in an instant was sound asleep
everard was far from feeling the same inclination
for slumber yet his mind was relieved the apprehension
 any farther visitation that night 
for he considered his treaty to evacuate woods
woodstock
stock as made known to and accepted in all probability
by those whom the intrusion the commissioners
had induced to take such singular measures
for expelling them his opinion which had
for a time bent towards a belief in something supernatural
in the disturbances had now returned
to the more rational mode accounting for them
by dexterous combination for which such a mansion
as woodstock afforded so many facilities
he heaped the hearth with fuel lighted the
candle and examining poor wildrake's situation
adjusted him as easily in the chair as he could the
cavalier stirring his limbs no more than an infant
his situation went far in his patron's opinion to
infer trick and confederacy for ghosts have no occasion
to drug men's possets he threw himself on
the bed and while he thought these strange circumstances
over a sweet and low strain music stole
through the chamber the words good night 
good night good night thrice repeated each
time in a softer and more distant tone seeming to
assure him that the goblins and he were at truce
if not at peace and that he had no more disturbance
to expect that night he had scarcely the courage
woodstock 
to call out a good night for after all his conviction
 the existence a trick it was so well performed
as to bring with it a feeling fear just like
what an audience feel during the performance 
a tragic scene which they know to be unreal and
which yet affects their passions by its near approach
to nature sleep overtook him at last and
left him not till broad daylight on the ensuing
morning
 woodstock
chapter 
ami yonder shines aurora's harbinger
at whose approach ghosts wandering here and there
troop home to churchyard
midsummer's nights drcatn
with the fresh air and the rising morning
every feeling the preceding night had passed
away from colonel everard's mind excepting wonder
how the effects which he had witnessed could be
produced he examined the whole room sounding
bolt floor and wainscot with his knuckles
and cane but was unable to discern any secret
passages while the door secured by a strong cross
bolt and the lock besides remained as firm as when
he had fastened it on the preceding evening the
apparition resembling victor lee next called his
attention ridiculous stories had been often cir
woodstock 
related this figure or one exactly resembling
it having been met with by night among the
waste apartments and corridors the old palace 
and markham everard had often heard such in
his childhood he was angry to recollect his own
deficiency courage and the thrill which he felt
on the preceding night when by confederacy
doubtless such an object was placed before his
eyes
surely he said this fit childish folly
could not make me miss my aim more likely
that the bullet had been withdrawn clandestinely
from my pistol
he examined that which was undischarged he
found the bullet in it he investigated the apartment
opposite to the point at which he had fired
and at five feet from the door in a direct line between
the bedside and the place where the appearances
had been seen a pistolball had recently
buried itself in the wainscot he had little doubt
therefore that he had fired in a just direction 
and indeed to have arrived at the place where it
was lodged the bullet must have passed through
 woodstock
the appearance at which he aimed and proceeded
point blank to the wall beyond this was mysterious
and induced him to doubt whether the art 
witchcraft or conjuration had not been called in to
assist the machinations those daring conspirators
who being themselves mortal might nevertheless
according to the universal creed the
times have invoked and obtained assistance from
the inhabitants another world
his next investigation respected the picture 
victor lee itself he examined it minutely as he
stood on the floor before it and compared its pale
shadowy faintlytraced outlines its faded colours
the stern repose the eye and deathlike pallidness
 the countenance with its different aspect on
the preceding night when illuminated by the artificial
light which fell full upon it while it left
every other part the room in comparative darkness
the features seemed then to have an unnatural
glow while the rising and falling the flame in
the chimney gave the head and limbs something
which resembled the appearance actual motion
now seen by day it was a mere picture the
woodstock 
hard and ancient school holbein formerly it
seemed for the moment something more determined
to get to the bottom this contrivance if
possible everard by the assistance a table and
chair examined the portrait still more closely and
endeavoured to ascertain the existence any private
spring by which it might be slipt aside a
contrivance not unfrequent in ancient buildings
which usually abounded with means access and
escape communicated to none but the lords the
castle or their immediate confidents but the
panel on which victor lee was painted was
firmly fixed in the wainscoting the apartment
 which it made a part and the colonel satisfied
himself that it could not hav been used for the
purpose which he had suspected
he next aroused his faithful squire wildrake
who notwithstanding his deep share the blessedness
 sleep had scarce even yet got rid 
the effects the gracecup the preceding evening
 it was the reward according to his own
view the matter his temperance one
single draught having made him sleep more late
and more sound than a matter halfadozen or
 woodstock
from thence to a dozen pulls would have done
when he was guilty the enormity reresup
pers and drinking deep after them
had your temperate draught said everard
 been but a thought more strongly seasoned
wildrake thou hadst slept so sound that the last
trump only could have waked thee
and then answered wildrake i should
have waked with a headache mark for i see my
modest sip has not exempted me from that epilogue
 but let us go forth and see how the night
which we have passed so strangely has been spent
by the rest them i suspect they are all right
willing to evacuate woodstock unless they have
cither rested better than we or at least been more
lucky in lodgings
in that case i will dispatch thee down to
joceline's hut to negotiate the reentrance sh
weresuppers quasi arrive belonged to a species luxury
introduced in the jolly days king james's extravagance and
continued through the subsequent reign the supper took place
at an early hour six or seven o'clock at latest the weresupper
was a preliminary banquet a hors d'auvrc which made its appearance
at ten or eleven and served as an apology for prolonging
the entertainment till midnight
woodstock 
henry lee and his family into their old apartments
where my interest with the general being
joined with the indifferent repute the place
itself i think they have little chance being disturbed
either by the present or by any new commissioners

but how are they to defend themselves
against the fiends my gallant colonel said
wildrake methinks had i an interest in
yonder pretty girl such as thou dost boast i
should be loath to expose her to the terrors a
residence at woodstock where these devils i
beg their pardon for i suppose they hear every
word we sly these merry goblins make such
gay work from twilight till morning
my dear wildrake said the colonel i
as well as you believe it possible that our speech
may be overheard but i care not and will speak
my mind plainly i trust sir henry and alice
are not engaged in this silly plot i cannot reconcile
it with the pride the one the modesty
 the other or the good sense both that any
motive could engage them in so strange a conjunction
but the fiends arc all your own political
 woodstock
persuasion wildrake all trueblue cavaliers and
i am convinced that sir henry and alice lee
though they be unconnected with them have not
the slightest cause to be apprehensive their
goblin machinations besides sir henry and jofeline
must know every corner about the place it
will be far more difficult to play off any ghostly
machinery upon him than upon strangers but
let us to our toilette and when water and brush
hath done its work we will inquire what is next
to be done
nay that wretched puritan's garb mine is
hardly worth brushing said wildrake and
but for this hundred weight rusty iron with
which thou hast bedizened me i look more like
a bankrupt quaker than anything else but i'll
make you as spruce as ever was a canting rogue
 your party
so saying and humming at the same time the
cavalier tune 
though for a time we see whitehall
with cobwebs hung around the wall
yet heaven shall make amends for all
when the king shall enjoy his own again
woodstock s
thou forgotten who are without said colonel
everard
e full tide remorseful
passion had for the time abated it was however
fierce and agitating the more so perhaps that
indulgence in strong mental feeling any kind
was foreign to the severe and ascetic character 
the man and was therefore the more overpowering
when it had at once surmounted all restraints
large tears flowed down the trembling features
 his thin and usually stern or at least austere
countenance he eagerly returned the compression
 everard's hand as if thankful for the sympathy
which the caress implied
presently after master holdenough wiped his
eyes withdrew his hand gently from that everard
shaking it kindly as they parted and prowoodstock

needed with more composure forgive me this
burst passionate feeling worthy colonel i
am conscious it little becomes a man my cloth
who should be the bearer consolation to others
to give way in mine own person to an extremity
 grief weak at least if indeed it is not sinful 
for what are we that we should weep and murmur
touching that which is permitted but albany
was to me as a brother the happiest days
 my ife ere my call to mingle myself in the
strife the land had awakened me to my duties
were spent in his company i but i will make
the rest my story short here he drew
his chair close to that everard and spoke ina
solemn and mysterious tone voice almost
lowered to a whisper i saw him last night
saw mm saw whom said everard can
you mean the person whom 
whom i saw so ruthlessly slaughtered
said the clergyman my ancient collegefriend
joseph albany
 master holdenough your cloth and your
character alike must prevent your jesting on such
a subject as this
vol 
 woodstock
jesting answered holdenough i would
as soon jest on my deathbed as soon jest upon
the bible
 but you must have been deceived answered
everard hastily this tragical story necessarily
often returns to your mind and in moments when
the imagination overcomes the evidence the
outward senses your fancy must have presented
to you an unreal appearance nothing more likely
when the mind is on the stretch after something
supernatural than that the imagination should
supply the place with a chimera while the overexcited
feelings render it difficult to dispel the
delusion
colonel everard replied holdenough with
austerity in discharge my duty i must not
fear the face man and therefore i tell you
plainly as i have done before with more observance
that when you bring your carnal learning
and judgment as it is but too much your nature
to do to investigate the hidden things another
world you might as well measure with the palm
 your hand the waters the isis indeed good
sir you err in this and give men too much pretence
to confound your honourable name with witchwoodstock

advocates freethinkers and atheists even with
such as this man bletson who if the discipline
 the church had its hands strengthened as it
was in the beginning the great conflict would
have been long ere now cast out the pale and
delivered over to the punishment the flesh
that his spirit might if possible be yet saved
you mistake master holdenough said colonel
everard i do not deny the existence 
such preternatural visitations because i cannot
and dare not raise the voice my own opinion
against the testimony ages supported by such
learned men as yourself nevertheless though i
grant the possibility such things i have scarce
yet heard an instance in ray days so well fortified
by evidence that i could at once and distinctly
say this must have happened by supernatural
agency and not otherwise
hear then what i have to tell said the divine
 on the faith a man a christian and
what is more a servant our holy church 
and therefore though unworthy an elder and a
teacher among christians i had taken my post
yester evening in the halffurnished apartment
 woodstock
wherein hangs a huge mirror which might have
served goliath gath to have admired himself
in when clothed from head to foot in his brazen
armour i the rather chose this place because
they informed me it was the nearest habitable
room to the gallery in which they say you had
been yourself assailed that evening by the evil
one was it so i pray you 
 by some one with no good intentions i was
assailed in that apartment so far said colonel
everard you were correctly informed
well i chose my post as well as i might
even as a resolved general approaches his camp
and casts up his mound as nearly as he can to
the besieged city and a truth colonel everard
if i felt some sensation bodily fear for
even elias and the prophets who commanded the
elements had a portion in our frail nature much
more such a poor sinful being as myself yet was
my hope and my courage high and i thought
 the texts which i might use not in the wicked
sense perhaps or spells as the blinded papists
employ them together with the sign the cross
and other fruitless forms but as nourishing and
woodstock itkj
supporting that true trust and confidence in the
blessed promises being the true shield faith
wherewith the fiery darts satan may be withstood
and quenched and thus armed and prepared
i sate me down to read at the same time
to write that i might compel my mind to attend
to those subjects which became the situation in
which i was placed as preventing any unlicensed
excursions the fancy and leaving no room for
my imagination to brood over idle fears so i
methodized and wrote down what i thought
meet for the time and peradventure some hungry
souls may yet profit by the food which i then
prepared
it was wisely and worthily done good and
reverend sir replied colonel everard i pray
you to proceed
while i was thus employed sir and had been
upon the matter for about three hours not yielding
to weariness a strange thrilling came over my
senses and the large and oldfashioned apartment
seemed to wax larger more gloomy and
more cavernous while the air the night grew
more cold and chill i know not if it was that
 woodstock
the fire began to decay or whether there cometh
before such things as were then about to happen
a breath and atmosphere as it were terror
as job saith in a wellknown passage fear
came upon me and trembling which made my
bones to shake and there was a tingling noise
in my ears and a dizziness in my brain so that
i felt like those who call for aid when there is no
danger and was even prompted to flee when i
saw no one to pursue it was then that something
seemed to pass behind me casting a reflection
on the great mirror before which i had placed
my writingtable and which i saw by assistance
 the great standing light which was then
in front the glass and i looked up and i saw
in the glass distinctly the appearance a man's
sure as these words issue from my mouth it
was no other than the same joseph albany the
companion my youth he whom iliad seen precipitated
down the battlements clidesthrough
castle into the deep lake below
what did you do 
it suddenly rushed on my mind said the
divine that the stoical philosopher athenodorus
woodstock 
had eluded the horrors such a vision by patiently
pursuing his studies and it shot at the same
time across my mind that i a christian divine
and a steward the mysteries had less reason
to fear evil and better matter on which to employ
my thoughts than was possessed by a heathen
who was blinded even by his own wisdom
so instead betraying any alarm or even turning
my head around i pursued my writing but
with a beating heart i admit and with a throbbing
hand
if you could write at all said the colonel
with such an impression on your mind you
may take the head the english array for
dauntless resolution
our courage is not our own colonel said
the divine and not as ours should it be vaunted
 and again when you speak this strange
vision as an impression on my fancy and not a
reality obvious to my senses let me tell you once
more your worldly wisdom is but foolishness
touching the things that are not worldly
did you not look again upon the mirror
said the colonel
 woodstock
 i did when i had copied out the comfortable
text thou shalt tread down satan under
thy feet 
and what did you then see 
the reflection the same joseph albany
said holdenough passing slowly as from behind
my chair the same in member and lineament
that i had known him in his youth excepting
that his cheek had the marks the more advanced
age at which he died and was very pale
what did you then 
i turned from the glass and plainly saw the
figure which had made the reflection in the mirror
retreating towards the door not fast nor
slow but with a gliding steady pace it turned
again when near the door and again showed me
its pale ghastly countenance before it disappeared
but how it left the room whether by the
door or otherwise my spirits were too much
hurried to remark exactly nor have i been able
by any effort recollection distinctly to remember

this is a strange and as coming from you
a most excellently wellattested apparition anwoodstock
s
jweredeverard and yet master holdenough
if the other world has been actually displayed
as you apprehend and i will not dispute the possibility
assure yourself there are also wicked
men concerned in these machinations i myself
have undergone some rencontres with visitants
who possessed bodily strength and wore i am
sure earthly weapons
oh doubtless doubtless replied master
holdenough beelzebub loves to charge with
horse and foot mingled as was the fashion the
old scotch general davie leslie he has his
devils in the body as well as his devils disembodied
and uses the one to support and back the
other
it may be as you say reverend sir answered
the colonel but what do you advise in
this case 
for that i must consult with my brethren
said the divine and if there be but left in our
borders five ministers the true kirk we will
charge satan in full body and you shall see whether
we have not power over him to resist till he
 woodstock
shall flee from us but failing that ghostly armament
against these strange and unearthly enemies
truly i would recommend that as a house
 witchcraft and abomination this polluted den
 ancient tyranny and prostitution should be totally
consumed by fire lest satan establishing
his headquarters so much to his mind should
find a garrison and a fastness from which he might
sally forth to infest the whole neighbourhood
certain it is that i would recommend to no christian
soul to inhabit the mansion and if deserted
it would become a place for wizards to play
their pranks and witches to establish their sabbath
and those who like dumas go about after
the wealth this world seeking for gold and
silver to practise spells and charms to the prejudice
 the souls the covetous trust me therefore
it were better that it were spoiled and broken
down not leaving one stone ripon another
 i say nay to that my good friend said the
colonel for the lordgeneral hath permitted
by his licence my mother's brother sir henry
lee and his family to return into the house 
his fathers being indeed the only roof under
woodstock 
which he hath any chance obtaining shelter
for his grey hairs
and was this done by your advice markham
everard said the divine austerely
 certainly it was returned the colonel
 and wherefore should i not exert mine influence
to obtain a place refuge for the brother
 my mother
 now as sure as thy soul liveth answered
the presbyter i had believed this from no
tongue but thine own tell me was it not this
very sir henry lee who by the force his
bufifcoats and his greenjerkins enforced the papist
laic's order to remove the altar to the eastern
 the church at woodstock and did not
he swear by his beard that he would hang in the
very street woodstock whoever should deny to
drink the king's health and is not his hand
red with the blood the saints and hath there
been a suffer in the field for prelacy and high
prerogative more unmitigated or fiercer 
all this may have been as you say good
master holdenough answered the colonel 
 but my uncle is now old and feeble and hath
 woodstock
scarce a single follower remaining and his daughter
is a being whom to look upon would make
the sternest weep for pity a being who
 who is dearer toeverardsaidholdenough
than his good name his faith to his friends
his duty to his religion this is no time to speak
with sugared lips the paths in which you tread
are dangerous you are striving to raise the
papistical candlestick which heaven in its justice
removed out its place to bring back to
this hall sorceries those very sinners who are
bewitched with them i will not permit the land
to be abused by their witchcraft they shall
not come hither
he spoke this with vehemence and striking
his stick against the ground and the colonel
very much dissatisfied began to express himself
haughtily in return you had better consider
your power to accomplish your threats master
holdenough he said before you urge them
so peremptorily
 and have i not the power to bind and to
loose f said the clergyman
it is a power little available save over those
woodstock 
 your own church said everard with a tone
something contemptuous
take heed take heed said the divine who
though an excellent was as we have elsewhere
seen an irritable man do not insult me but
think honourably the messenger for the sake
 him whose commission he carries do not
i say defy me i am bound to discharge my
duty were it to the displeasing my twin brother

 i can see nought your office has to do in the
matter said colonel everard and i on my
side give you warning not to attempt to meddle
beyond your commission
right you hold me already to be as submissive
as one your grenadiers replied the
clergyman his acute features trembling with a
sense indignity so as even to agitate his grey
hair but beware sir i am not so powerless as
you suppose i will invoke every true christian
in woodstock to gird up his loins and resist the
restoration prelacy oppression and malignancy
within our borders i will stir up the wrath 
the righteous against the oppressor the 
woodstock
ite the edomite and against his race and
against those who support him and encourage
him to rear up his horn i will call aloud and
spare not and arouse the many whose love hath
waxed cold and the multitude who care for
none these things there shall be a remnant
to listen to me and i will take the stick joseph
which was in the hand ephraim and
go down to cleanse this place witches and sorcerers
and enchantments and will cry and exhort
saying will you plead for baal will
you serve him nay take the prophets baal
let not a man escape
master holdcnough master holdenough
said colonel everardwith much impatience by
the tale yourself told me you have exhorted upon
that text once too often already
the old man struck his palm forcibly against
his forehead and fell back into a chair as these
words were uttered as suddenly and as much
without power resistance as if the colonel
had fired a pistol through his head instantly
regretting the reproach which he had suffered
to escape him in his impatience everard hastenwoodstock

ed to apologize and to offer every conciliatory
excuse however inconsistent which occurred to
him on the moment but the old man was too
deeply affected he rejected his hand lent no
ear to what he said and finally started up saying
sternly you have abused my confidence
sir abused it vilely to turn it into my own reproach
 had i been a man the sword you dared
not but enjoy your triumph sir over an
old man and your father's friend strike at the
wound his imprudent confidence showed you
nay my worthy and excellent friend said
the colonel
 friend answered the old man starting up
 we are foes sir foes now and for ever 
so saying and starting from the seat into which
he had rather fallen than thrown himself he ran
out the room with a precipitation step which
he was apt to use upon occasions irritable
feeling and which was certainly more eager than
dignified especially as he muttered while he ran
and seemed as if he were keeping up his own
passion by recounting over and over the offence
which he had received
soh said colonel everard and there
 woodstock
was not strife enough between mine uncle and the
people woodstock already but i must needs
increase it by chafing this irritable and quicktempered
old man eager as i knew him to be in
his ideas church government and stiff in his
prejudices respecting all who dissent from him 
the mob woodstock will rise for though
he would not get a score them to stand by him
in any honest or intelligible purpose yet let him
cry havoc and destruction and i will warrant he
has followers enow and my uncle is equally wild
and unpersuadable for the value all the estate
he ever had he would not allow a score troopers
to be quartered in the house for defence and
if he be alone or has but joceline to stand by
him he will be as sure to fire upon those who
come to attack the lodge as if he had a hundred
men in garrison and then what can chance but
danger and bloodshed 
this progress melancholy anticipation was
interrupted by the return master holdenough
who hurrying into the room with the same precipitate
pace at which he had left it ran straight
up to the colonel and said take my hand
woodstock 
markham take my hand hastily for the old
adam is whispering at my heart that it is a disgrace
to hold it extended so long
 most heartily do i receive your hand my
venerable friend said everard and i trust in
sign renewed amity
 surely surely said the divine shaking
his hand kindly thou hast it is true spoken
bitterly but thou hast spoken truth in good time
and i think though your words were severe
with a good and kindly purpose verily and 
a truth it were sinful in me again to be hasty
in provoking violence remembering that which
you have upbraided me with 
forgive me good master holdenough said
colonel everard it was a hasty word i meant
not in serious earnest to upbraid
peace i pray you peace said the divine 
i say the allusion to that which you have nost
justly upbraided me with though the charge
aroused the gall the old man within me thei
inward tempter being ever on the watch to bring
us to his lure ought instead being resented
to have been acknowledged by me as a favour for
vol n k
 woodstock
so are the wounds a friend termed faithful
and surely i who have by one unhappy exhortation
to battle and strife sent the living to the
dead and i fear brought back even the dead
amono the living should now study peace and
good will and reconciliation difference leaving
punishment to the great being whose laws
are broken and vengeance to him who hath
said i will repay it
the old man's mortified features lighted trp
with a humble confidence as he made this acknowledgment
and colonel everard who knew
the constitutional infirmities and the early prejudices
 professional consequence and exclusive
party opinion which he must have subdued ere
arriving at such a tone candour hastened to
express his admiration his christian charity
mingled with reproaches on himself for having
so deeply injured his feelings
 think not it think not it excellent
young man said holdenough we have both
erred i in suffering my zeal to outrun my charity
you perhaps in pressing hard on an ow
and peevish man who had so lately poured out
woodstock 
his sufferings into your friendly bosom be it
all forgotten let your friends if they are not
deterred by what has happened at this manor 
woodstock resume their habitation as soon as
they will if they can protect themselves against
the powers the air believe me that if i can
prevent it by aught in my power they shall have
no annoyance from earthly neighbours and
assure yourself good sir that my voice is still
worth something with the worthy mayor and
the good aldermen and the better sort housekeepers
up yonder in the town although the
lower classes are blown about with every wind
 doctrine and yet farther be assured colonel
that should your mother's brother or any 
his family learn that they have taken up a rash
bargain in returning to this unhappy and unhallowed
house or should they find any qualms in
their own hearts and consciences which require
a ghostly comforter nehemiah holdenough will
be as much at their command by night or day as
if they had been bred up within the holy pale 
the church in which he is an unworthy minister 
and neither the awe what is fearful to be seen
woodstock
within these walls nor his knowledge their
blinded and carnal state as bred up under a prelatic
dispensation shall prevent him doing what
lies in his poor abilities for their protection and
edification
 i feel all the force your kindness reverend
sir said colonel everard but i do not
think it likely that my uncle will give you trouble
on either score he is a man much accustomed
to be his own protector in temporal danger
and in spiritual doubts to trust to his own prayers
and those his church
i trust i have not been superfluous in offering
mine assistance said the old man something
jealous that his proffered spiritual aid had
been held rather intrusive i ask pardon if that
is the case i humbly ask pardon i would not
willingly be superfluous
the colonel hastened to appease this new
alarm the watchful jealousy his consequence
which joined with a natural heat temper
which he could not always subdue were the
good man's only faults
they had regained their former friendly footwoodstock

ing when roger wildrakc returned from the
hut joceline and whispered his master that
his embassy had been successful the colonel
then addressed the divine and informed him
that as the commissioners had already given up
woodstock and as his uncle sir henry lee
proposed to return to the lodge about noon he
would if his reverence pleased attend him upto
the borough
will you not tarry said the reverend man
with something like inquisitive apprehension in
his voice to welcome your relatives upon their
return to this their house 
no my good friend said colonel everard 
the part which i have taken in these unhappy
broils perhaps also the mode worship in
which i have been educated have so prejudiced
me in mine uncle's opinion that i must be for
some time a stranger to his house and family
indeed i rejoice to hear it with all my
heart and soul said the divine excuse my
frankness i do indeed rejoice i had thought
no matter what i had thought i would not
again give offence but truly though the maiden
 woodstock
hath a pleasant feature and he as all men say is
in human things unexceptionable yet but i
give you pain in sooth i will say no more unless
you ask my sincere and unprejudiced advice
which you shall command but which i will not
press on you superfluously wend we to the
borough together the pleasant solitude the
forest may dispose us to open our hearts to each
other
they did walk up to the little town in company
and somewhat to master holdenough's
surprise the colonel though they talked on various
subjects did not request him any ghostly
advice on the subject his love to his fair cousin
while greatly beyond the expectation the
soldier the clergyman kept his word and in his
own phrase was not so superfluous as to ofler
upon so delicate a point his unasked counsel

the embassy wildrake had been successful
chiefly through the mediation the episcopal
divine whom we formerly found acting in the
character chaplain to the family and whose
voice had great influence on many accounts with
its master
a little before high noon sir henry lee with
his small household was again in unchallenged
possession their old apartments at the lodge 
woodstock and the combined exertions joce
line jolliffe phoebe and old joan were
employed in putting to rights what the late intruders
had left in great disorder
sir henry lee had like all persons 
woodstock
city that period a love order amounting to
precision and felt like a fine lady whose dress
has been disordered in a crowd insulted and
humiliated by the rude confusion into which his
household goods had been thrown and impatient
till his mansion had been purified from all marks
 intrusion in his anger he uttered more orders
than the limited number his domestics were
likely to find time or hands to execute the
villains have left such sulphureous steams behind
them too said the old knight as if old davie
leslie and the whole scotch army had quartered
among them
it may be near as bad said joceline for
men say for certain it was the devil came down
bodily among them and made them troop off
then said the knight is the prince 
darkness a gentleman as old will shakspeare
says he never interferes with those his own
coat for the lees have been here father and
son these five hundred years without disquiet
and no sooner came these misbegotten churls
than he plays his own part among them
well one thing he and they have left us
woodstock 
said jouiffe which we may thank ihcm for 
and that is such a wellfilled larder and buttery
as has been seldom seen in woodstock lodge
this many a day carcases mutton large
rounds beef barrels confectioners ware
pipes and runlets sack muscadine ale and
what not we shall have a royal time on't through
half the winter and joan must get to salting and
pickling presently
out villain said the knight are we to
feed on the fragment such scum the earth
as these cast them forth instantly nay
checking himself that were a sin but give
them to the poor or see them sent to the owners
 and hark ye i will none their strong
liquors i would rather drink like a hermit all
my life than seem to pledge such scoundrels as
these in their leavings like a miserable drawer
who drains off the ends the bottles after the
guests have paid their reckoning and gone off
and hark ye i will taste no water from the
cistern out which these slaves have been serving
themselves fetch me down a pitcher from
rosamond's spring
 woottstock
jr
alice heard this in i unction and well iruessin
there was enough for the other members the
family to do she quietly took a small pitcher
and flinging a cloak around her walked out fiji
person to procure sir henry the water which he
desired meantime joceline said with some
hesitation that there was a man still remained
belonging to the party these strangers who
was directing about the removal some trunks
and mails which belonged to the commissioners
and who could receive his honour's commands
about the provisions
let him come hither the dialogue was
held in the hall why do you hesitate and
crumble in that manner 
only sir said joceline only perhaps
your honour might not wish to see him being the
same who on the night before last 
he paused
sent my rapier a hawking through the firmament
thou would'st say why when did i
take spleen at a man for standing his ground
against me roundhead as he is man i like
him the better that not the worse i hunger
woodstock 
and thirst to have another turn with him i have
thought on this passed ever since and i believe
videre it to try again i know a feat would control
it fetch him directly
trusty tomkins was presently ushered in
bearing himself with an iron gravity which neither
the terrors the preceding night nor the
dignified demeanour the highborn personage
before whom he stood were able for an instant
to overcome
 how now good fellow said sir henry 
i would fain see something more thy fence
which baffled me the other evening but truly
i think the light was somewhat too faint for my
old eyes take a foil man i walk here in the
hall as hamlet says and tis the breathingtime
 day with me take a foil then in thy hand
since it is your worship's desire said the
steward letting fall his long cloak and taking
the foil in his hand
 now said the knight if your fitness
speaks mine is ready methinks the very stepping
on this same old pavement hath charmed
away the gout which threatened mc sa ba
i tread as firm as a gamecock
j woodstock
they began the play with great spirit and
whether the old knight really fought more coolly
with the blunt than with the sharp weapon or
whether the steward gave him some grains 
advantage in this merely sportive encounter it is
certain sir henry had the better in the assault
his success put him into excellent humour
there said he i found your trick
nay you cheat me not twice the same waythere
was a very palpable hit why had i had
but light enough the other night but it skillsnot
speaking it here we leave off i must not
fight as we unwise cavaliers did with you roundhead
rascals beating you so often that we taught
you to beat us at last and good now tell me
why you are leaving your larder so full here 
do you think i or my family can use broken
victuals what have you no better employment
for your rounds sequestrated beef than
to leave them behind you when you shift your
quarters 
so please your honour said tomkins it
may be that you desire not the flesh beeves
 rams or goats nevertheless when you
woodstock 
know that the provisions were provided and paid
for out your own rents and stock at ditches
sequestrated to the use the state more than a
year since it may be you will have less scruple
to use them for your own behoof
rest assured that i shall said sir henry 
and glad you have helped me to a share 
mine own certainly i was an ass to suspect
your masters subsisting save at honest men's
expense
 and as for the rumps beeves continued
tomkins with the same solemnity there is a
rump at westminster which will stand us the
army much hacking and hewing yet ere it is discussed
to our mind
sir henry paused as if to consider what was
the meaning this inuendo for he was not a
person very quick apprehension but having
at length caught the meaning it he burst into
an explosion louder laughter than joccline had
seen him indulge in for a good while
right knave he said i taste thy jest 
it is the very moral the puppetshow faustus
woodstock
thus raised the devil as the parliament raised the
army and then as the devil flies away with
faustus so will the army fly away with the parliament
 or the rump as thou call'st it or sitting
part the socalled parliament and then
look you friend the very devil all hath my
willing consent to fly away with the army in its
turn from the highest general down to the lowest
drumboy nay never look fierce for the matter
remember there is daylight enough now fora
game at sharps
trusty tomkins appeared to think it best to
suppress his displeasure and observing that the
pains were ready to transport the commissioners
property to the borough took a grave leave
 sir henry lee
meantime the old man continued to pace his
recovered hall rubbing his hands and evincing
greater signs glee than he had shown since the
fatal th january
here we are again in the old frank joliffe
well victualled too how the knave solved
ray point conscience the dullest them is
a special casuist where the question concerns prowoodstock

fit look out if there are not some our own
ragged regiment lurking about to whom a bellyfull
would be a godsend joceline then his
fence joceline though the fellow foins well 
very sufficient well but thou saw'st how i dealt
with him when i had fitting light joceline
 ay and so your honour did said joceline
you taught him to know the duke norfolk
from saunders gardner i'll warrant him he
will not wish to come under your honour's thumb
again
 why i am waxing old said sir henry 
 but skill will not rust through age though
sinews must stiffen but my age is like a lusty
winter as old will says frosty but kindly 
and what if old as we are we live to see better
days yet i promise thee joceline i love this
jarring betwixt the rogues the board and the
rogues the sword when thieves quarrel true
men have a chance coming by their own
thus triumphed the old cavalier in the treble
glory having recovered his dwelling regained
as he thought his character as a man fence
and finally discovered some prospect a change
 woodstock
 times in which he was not without hopes that
something might turn up for the royal interest
meanwhile ace with a prouder and a glitter
heart than had danced in her bosom for several
days went forth with a gaiety to which she late
had been a stranger to contribute her assistance
to the regulation and supply the household
by bringing the fresh water wanted from fair rosamond's
well
perhaps she remembered that when she was
but a girl her cousin markham used among
others to make her perform that duty as presenting
the character some captive trojan princess
condemned by her situation to draw the
waters from some grecian spring for the use 
the proud victor at any rate she certainly
toyed to see her father reinstated in his ancient
habitation and the joy was not the less sincere
that she knew their return to woodstock had been
procured by means her cousin and that even
in her father's prejudiced eyes everard had been
in some degree exculpated the accusations the
old knight had brought against him and that
if a reconciliation had not yet taken place the
woodstock fil
preliminaries had been established on which such
a desirable conclusion might easily be founded
it was like the commencement a bridge when
the foundation is securely laid and the piers raised
above the influence the torrent the throwing
 the arches may be accomplished in a subsequent
season
the doubtful fate her only brother might
have clouded even this momentary gleam sunshine
 but alice had been bred up during the
close and frequent contests civil war and had
acquired the habit hoping in behalf those
dear to her until hope was lost in the present
case all reports seemed to assure her her brother's
safety
besides these causes for gaiety alice lee had
the pleasing feeling that she was restored to the
habitation and the haunts her childhood from
which she had not departed without much pain
the more felt perhaps because suppressed in
order to avoid irritating her father's sense his
misfortune finally she enjoyed for the instant
the gleam selfsatisfaction by which we see the
young and welldisposed so often animated when
vol i
lj woodstock
they can be in common phrase helpful to those
whom they love and perform at the moment 
need some those httle domestic tasks which
age receives with so much pleasure from the
dutiful hands youth so that altogether as
she hasted through the remains and vestiges 
a wilderness already mentioned and from thence
about a bowshot into the park to bring a pitcher
 water from rosamond's spring alice
lee her features enlivened and her complexion
a little raised by the exercise had for the moment
regained the gay and brilliant vivacity 
expression which had been the characteristic 
her beauty in her earlier and happier days
this fountain old memory had been once
adorned wide architectural ornaments in the style
 the sixteenth century chiefly relating to ancient
mythology all these were now wasted and
overthrown and existed only as mosscovered
ruins while the living spring continued to furnish
its daily treasures unrivalled in purity
though the quantity was small gushing out amid
disjointed stones and bubbling through fragments
 ancient sculpture
woodstock g
with a light step and a laughing brow the
young lady lee was approaching the fountain
usually so solitary when she paused on beholding
some one seated beside it she proceeded
however with confidence though with a step
something less gay when she observed that the
person was a female some menial perhaps from
the town whom a fanciful mistress occasionally
dispatched for the water a spring supposed to
be peculiarly pure or some aged woman who
made a little trade by carrying it to the better
sort families and selling it for a trifle there
was no cause therefore for apprehension
yet the terrors the times were so great that
alice did not even see a stranger her own sex
without some apprehension denaturalized woe
usual followed the camps both armies
during the civil war who on the one side with
open profligacy and profanity on the other with
the fraudful tone fanaticism or hypocrisy exercised
nearly in like degree their talents for murder
or plunder but it was broad daylight the
distance from the lodge was but trifling and
though a little alarmed at seeing a stranger where
she expected deep solitude the daughter the
 woodstock
haughty old knight had too much the hon
about her to fear without some determined and
decided cause
alice walked therefore gravely on toward the
fount and composed her looks as she took a hasty 
glance the female who was seated there and
addressed herself to her task filling her pitcher

the woman whose presence had surprised and
somewhat startled alice lee was a person 
the lower rank whose red cloak russet kirtle
handkerchief trimmed with coventry blue and a
coarse steeple hat could not indicate at best anything
higher than the wife a small farmer or
perhaps the helpmate a bailiff or hind it was
well if she proved nothing worse her clothes
indeed were good materials but what the female
eye discerns with half a glance they were
indifferently adjusted and put on this looked as
if they did not belong to the person by whom
they were worn but were articles which she had
become the mistress by some accident if not by
some successful robbery her size too as did
not escape alice even in the short perusal she
afforded the stranger was unusual her features
woodstock 
swarthy and singularly harsh and her manner
altogether unpropitious the young lady almost
wished as she stooped to fill her pitcher that
she had rather turned back and sent joceline
on the errand but repentance was too late now
and she had only to disguise as well as she could
her unpleasant feelings
the blessings this bright day to one as
bright as it is said the stranger with no unfriendly
though a harsh voice
i thank you said alice in reply and continued
to fill her pitcher busily by assistance 
an iron bowl which remained still chained to one
 the stones beside the fountain
perhaps my pretty maiden if you would
accept my help your work would be sooner done
said the stranger
i thank you said alice but had i needed
assistance i could have brought those with
me who had rendered it
i do not doubt that my pretty maiden
answered the female there are too many lads
in woodstock with eyes in their heads no doubt
you could have brought with you any one 
them who looked on you if you had listed
 woodstock
alice replied not a syllabic lor she did not like
the freedom used by the speaker and was desirous
to break off the conversation
are you offended my pretty mistress said
the stranger that was far from my purpose
i will put my question otherwise are the
good dames woodstock so careless their
pretty daughters as to let the flower them all
wander about the wild chase without a mother
or a somebody to prevent the fox from running
away with the lamb that carelessness methinks
shows small kindness
content yourself good woman i am not far
from protection and assistance said alice who
liked less and less the effrontery her new acquaintance

alas my pretty maiden said the stranger
patting with her large and hard hand the head
which alice had kept bended down towards the
water which she was laving it would be difficult
to hear such a pipe as yours at the town 
woodstock scream as loud as you would
alice shook the woman's hand angrily off took
up her pitcher though not above half full and
as she saw the stranger rise at the same time
woojjotock c
said not without fear doubtless but with a natural
feeling resentment and dignity i have
no reason to make my cries heard as far as woodstock
were there occasion for my crying for
help at all it is nearer at hand if i need it
she spoke not without a warrant for at the
moment broke through the bushes and stood by
her side the noble hound bevis fixing on the
stranger his eyes that glanced fire raising every
hair on his gallant mane as upright as the bristles
 a wild boar when hard pressed grinning till a
case teeth which would have matched those 
any wolf in russia were displayed in full array
and without either barking or springing seeming
by his low determined growl to await but the signal
for dashing at the female whom he plainly
considered as a suspicious person
but the stranger was undaunted my pretty
maiden she said you have indeed a formidable
guardian there where cockneys or bumpkins
are concerned but we who have been at the wars
know spells for taming such furious dragons 
and therefore let not your fourfooted protector
go loose on me for he is a noble animal and 
woodstock
thing but selfdefence would induce me to do him
injury so saying she drew a pistol from her
bosom and cocked it pointing it towards the
dog as if apprehensive that he would spring
upon her
hold woman hold said alice lee the
dog will not do you harm down bevis couch
down and ere you attempt to hurt him know
he is the favourite hound sir henry lee 
ditchley the keeper woodstock park who
would severely revenge any injury offered to him
and you pretty one are the old knight's
housekeeper doubtless i have often heard the
lees have good taste
i am his daughter good woman
his daughter i was blind but yet h is
true nothing less perfect could answer the description
which all the world has given mistress
alice lee i trust that my folly has given my
young mistress no offence and that she will allow
me in token reconciliation to fill her pitcher
and carry it as far as she will permit
as you will good mother but i am about
to return instantly to the lodge to which in
woodstock 
these times i cannot admit strangers you can
follow me no farther than the verge the wilderness
and i am already too long from home 
i will send some one to meet and relieve you 
the pitcher so saying she turned her back
with a feeling terror which she could hardly
account for and began to walk quickly towards
the lodge thinking thus to get rid her troublesome
acquaintance
but she reckoned without her host for in a
moment her new companion was by her side
not running indeed but walking with prodigious
long unwomanly strides which soon brought her
up with the hurried and timid steps the frightened
maiden but her manner was more respectful
than formerly though her voice sounded remarkably
harsh and disagreeable and her whole
appearance suggested an undefined yet irresistible
feeling apprehension
pardon a stranger lovely mistress alice
said her persecutor that was not capable 
distinguishing between a lady your high quality
and a peasant wench and who spoke to you
with a degree freedom illbefitting your rank
 woodstock
certainly and condition and which i fear has
given you offence
no offence whatever replied alice but
good woman i am near home and can excuse
your farther company you are unknown tome

but it follows not said the stranger that
your fortunes may not be known to me fair mistress
alice look on my swarthy brow england
breeds none such and in the lands from
which i come the sun which blackens our complexion
pours to make amends rays knowledge
into our brains which are denied to those
 your lukewarm climate let me look upon
your pretty hand attempting to possess herself
 it and i promise you you shallhear
what will please you
i hear what does not please me said alice
with dignity you must carry your tricks 
fortunetelling and palmistry to the women 
the village we the gentry hold them to be
either imposture or unlawful knowledge
yet you would fain hear a certain colonel
i warrant you whom certain unhappy cir
woodstock 
substances have separated from his family you
would give better than silver if i could assure
you that you would see him in a day or 
perhaps sooner
i know nothing what you speak good
woman if you want alms there is a piece silver
 it is all i have in my purse
it were pity that i should take it said the
female and yet give it me for the princess
in the fairy tale must ever deserve by her generosity
the bounty the benevolent fairy before
she is rewarded by her protection
take it take it give me my pitcher
said alice and begone yonder comes one 
my father's servants what ho joceline 
joceline 
the old fortuneteller hastily dropped something
into the pitcher as she restored it to alice
lee and plying her long limbs disappeared
speedily under cover the wood
bevis turned and backed and showed some
inclination to harass the retreat this suspicious
person yet as if uncertain ran towards jolift'e
and fawned on him to demand his advice and
 woodstock
encouragement joceline pacified the animal
and coming up to his young lady asked her
with surprise what was the matter and whether
she had been frightened alice made light 
her alarm for which indeed she could not have
assigned any very competent reason for the manners
 the woman though bold and intrusive
were not menacing she only said she had meta
fortuneteller by rosamond's well and had
had some difficulty in shaking her off
ah the gipsy thief said joceline how
well she scented there was food in the pantry 
they have noses like ravens these strollers look
you mistress alice you shall not see a raven ora
carrioncrow in all the blue sky for a mile round
you but let a sheep drop suddenly down on the
greensward and before the poor creature's dead
you shall see a dozen such guests croaking
as if inviting each other to the banquet just soit
is with these sturdy beggars you will see few
enough them when there's nothing to give
but when hough's in the pot they will have share
on't
 you are so proud your fresh supply 
woodstock iii
provender said alice that you suspect all 
a design oii't i do not think this woman will
venture near your kitchen joceline
it will be best for her health said joceline
 lest i give her a ducking for digestion but
give me the pitcher mistress alice meeter i
bear it than you how now what jingles at
the bottom have you lifted the pebbles as well
as the water 
i think the woman dropped something into
the pitcher said alice
nay we must look to that for it is like to
be a charm and we have enough the devil's
ware about woodstock already we will not
spare for the water i can run back and fill the
pitcher he poured out the water upon the
grass and at the bottom the pitcher was
found a gold ring in which was set a ruby apparently
 some value
nay if this be not enchantment i know
not what is said joceline truly mistress
alice i think you had better throw away this
gimcrack such gifts from such hands are a kind
 pressmoney which the devil uses for enlisting
 woodstock
his regiment witches and if they take but so
much as a bean from him they become his bond
slaves for ife ay you look at the gewgaw but
tomorrow you will find a lead ring and a common
pebble in its stead
nay joceline i think it will be better to
find out that darkcomplexioned woman and return
to her what seems some value so cause
inquiry to be made and be sure you return herring
it seems too valuable to be destroyed
humph that is always the way with women
murmured joceline you will never get the
best them but she is willing to save a bit 
finery well mistress alice i trust that you
are too young and too pretty to be enlisted in a
regiment witches
i shall not be afraid it till you turn conjurers
said alice so hasten to the well where
you are like still to find the woman and let her
know that alice lee desires none her gifts
any more than she did her society
so saying the young lady pursued her way
to the lodge while joceline went down to rosamond's
well to execute lier commission but
woodstock 
the fortuneteller or whoever she might be was
nowhere to be found neither finding that to bethe
case did joceline give himself much trouble
in tracking her farther
if this ring which i dare say the jade stole
somewhere said the underkeeper to himself
be worth a few nobles it is better in honest
hands than in that vagabonds my master hasa
right to all waifs and strays and certainly such
a ring in possession a gipsy must be a waif
so i shall confiscate it without scruple and apply
the produce to the support sir henry s
household which is like to be poor enough thank
heaven my military experience has taught me
how to carry hooks at my fingerends that is
trooper's law yet hang it after all i had best
take it to mark everard and ask his advice i
hold him now to be your learned counsellor in law
where mistress alice's affairs are concerned and
my learned doctor who shall be nameless for
such as concern church and state and sir henry
lee and i'll give them leave to give mine tumbles
to the kites and ravens if they find me conferring
my confidence where it is not safe

being skilless in these parts which to a stranger
unguided and unfriended often prove
rough and inhospitable
twelfth night
there was a little attempt at preparation now
that the dinner hour was arrived which showed
that in the opinion his few but faithful domestics
the good knight had returned hi triumph
to his home
the great tankard exhibiting in basrelief the
figure michael subduing the archenemy was
placed on the table and joceline and phoebe
dutifully attended the one behind the chair 
sir henry the other to wait upon her young
mistress and both to make out by formal and
regular observance the want a more numerous
train
 a health to king charles said the old
knight handing the massive tankard to his
woodstock 
daughter drink it ray love though it be rebel
ale which they have left us i will pledge
thee for the toast will excuse the liquor had
noll himself brewed it
the young lady touched the goblet with her
lip and returned it to her father who took a
copious draught
i will not say blessing on their hearts said
he though i must own they drank good ale
no wonder sir they come lightly by the
malt and need not spare it said joceline
 say'st thou said the knight thou shalt
finish the tankard thyself for that very jest's sake
nor was his follower slow in doing reason to the
royal pledge he bowed and replaced the tankard
saying after a triumphant glance at the
sculpture i had a jibe with that same redcoat
about the saint michael just now
redcoat ha what redcoat said the
hasty old man do any these knaves still
lurk about woodstock quoit him down stairs
instantly joceline know we not galloway
nags 
so please you he is in some charge here
vol m
 woodstock
and will speedily begone it is he he who had
a rencontre with your honour in the wood
ay but i paid him oft for it in the hall as
you yourself saw i was never in better fence in
my life joceline that same steward fellow is
not so utterly blackhearted a rogue as the most
 them joceline he fences well excellent
well i will have thee try a bout in the hall with
him lomorrow though i think he will be too
hard for thee i know thy strength to an inch
he might say this with some truth for it was
joceline's fashion when called on as sometimes
happened to fence with his patron just to put
forth as much his strength and skill as obliged
the knight to contend hard for the victory which
in the long run he always contrived to yield upto
him like a discreet servingman
and what said this roundheaded steward
 our great saint michael's standing cup 
marry he scoffed at our good saint and
said he was little better than one the golden
calves bethel but i told him he should not
talk so until one their own roundheaded saints
iliad given the devil as complete a crossbuttock
woodstock 
as saint michael had given him as tis carved
upon the cup there i trow that made him silent
enough and then he would know whether
your honour and mistress alice not to mention
old joan and myself since it is your honour's
pleasure i should take my bed here were not
afraid to sleep in a house that had been so much
disturbed but i told him we feared no fiends
or goblins having the prayers the church read
every evening
joceline said alice interrupting him
wert thou mad you know at what risk to
ourselves and the good doctor the performance
 that duty takes place
oh mistress alice said joceline a little
abashed you may be sure i spoke not a word
 the doctor no no i did not let him into
the secret that we had such a reverend chaplain
i think i know the length this man's foot
we have had a jollification or so together he
is hand and glove with me for as great a fanatic
as he is
trust him not too far said the knight
 woodstock
 nay i fear thou hast been imprudent already
and that it will be unsafe for the good man to
come here after nightfall as is proposed these
independents have noses hke bloodhounds and
can smell out a loyalist under any disguise
if your honour thinks so said joceline
i'll watch for the doctor with good will and
bring him into the lodge by the old condemned
postern and so up to this apartment and sure
this man tomkins would never presume to come
hither and the doctor may have a bed in woodstock
lodge and he never the wiser or if your
honour does not think that safe i can cut his
throat for you and i would not mind it a pin
god forbid said the knight he is under
our roof and a guest though not an invited
one go joceline it shall be thy penance for
having given thy tongue too much license to
watch for the good doctor and to take care 
his safety while he continues with us an october
night or two in the forest would finish the
good man
he's more like to finish our october than
woodstock 
our october is to finish him said the keeper 
and withdrew under the encouraging smile his
patron
he whistled bevis along with him to share in
his watch and having received exact information
where the clergyman was most likely to be
found assured his master that he would give the
most pointed attention to his safety when the
attendants had withdrawn having previously removed
the remains the meal the old knight
leaning back in his chair encouraged pleasant
visions than had late passed through his imagination
until by degrees he was surprised by
actual slumber while his daughter not venturing
to move but on tiptoe took some needlework
and bringing it close by the old mates side
employed her fingers on this task bending her eyes
from time to time on her parent with the affectionate
zeal if not the effective power a guardian
angel at length as the light faded away and
night came on she wa about to cause candles to
be brought but remembering how indifferent 
couch jocelines cottage had afforded she could
iot think interrupting the first sound and re
 woodstock
pressing sleep which her father had enjoyed in
all probability for the last two nights and days
she herself had no other amusement as she
sat facing one the great oriel windows the
same by which wildrake had on a former occasion
looked in upon tomkins and joceline while
at their computations than watching the clouds
which a lazy wind sometimes chased from the
broad disk the harvestmoon sometimes permitted
to accumulate and exclude her brightness
there is i know not why something peculiarly
pleasing to the imagination in contemplating
the queen night when she is wading
as the expression is among the vapours which she
has not power to dispel and which on their side
are unable entirely to quench her lustre it is the
striking image patient virtue calmly pursuing
her path through good report and bad report
having that excellence in herself which ought to
command all admiration but bedimmed in the
eyes the world by suffering by misfortune by
calumny
as some such reflections perhaps were passing
through alice's imagination she became senwoodstock

bible to her surprise and alarm that some one
had clambered up upon the window and was
looking into the room the idea supernatural
fear did not in the slightest degree agitate alice
she was too much accustomed to the place and
situation for folks do not see spectres in the
scenes with which they have been familiar from infancy
but danger from marauders in a disturbed
country was a more formidable subject apprehension
and the thought armed alice who was
naturally highspirited with such desperate courage
that she snatched a pistol from the wallon
which some firearms hung and while she
screamed to her father to awake had the presence
 mind to present it at the intruder she did
so the more readily because she imagined she
recognized in the visage which she partially saw
the features the woman whom she had met
with at rosamond's well and which had appeared
to her peculiarly harsh and suspicious her
father at the same time seized his sword and came
forward while the person at the window alarmed
at these demonstrations and endeavouring to
descend missed footing as had cavahero wilts
woodstock
drake before her and went down to the earth
with no small noise nor was the reception on
the bosom our common mother either soft or
safe for by a most terrific bark and growl they
heard that bevis had come up and seized on the
party ere he or she could gain their feet
hold fast but worry not said the old
knight alice thou art the queen wenches 
stand fast here till i run down and secure the
rascal
for god's sake no my dearest father 
alice exclaimed joceline will be up immediately
 hark i hear him
there was indeed a bustle below and more
than one light danced to and fro in confusion
while those who bore them called to each other
yet suppressing their voices as they spoke as
men who would only be heard by those they addressed
the individual who had fallen under
the power bevis was most impatient in his situation
and called with least precaution here
lee forester take the dog off else i must
shoot him
 if thou dost said sir henry from the win
woodstock 
dow i blow thy brains out on the spot thieves
jocehne thieves come up and secure this ruffian
 bevis hold on 
back bevis down sir cried joceline 
i am coming i am coming sir henry saint
michael i shall go distracted 
a terrible thought suddenly occurred to alice
could joceline have become unfaithful that
he was calling bevis off the villain instead encouraging
the trusty dog to secure him her
father meantime moved perhaps by some suspicion
 the same kind hastily stepped aside out
 the moonlight and pulled alice close to him
so as to be invisible from without yet so placed
as to hear what should pass the scuffle between
bevis and his prisoner seemed to be ended by
jocelines interference and there was close whispering
for an instant as people in consultation
 all is quiet now said one voice i will
up and prepare the way for you and immediately
a form presented itself on the outside
 the window pushed open the lattice and
sprung into the parlour but almost ere his step
was upon the floor certainly before he had pb
 woodstock
gained any secure footing the old knight who
stood ready with his rapier drawn made a desperate
pass which bore the intruder to the ground
eocene who clambered up next with a dark
lantern in his hand uttered a dreadful exclamation
when he saw what had happened crying
out lord in heaven he has slain his own son 
no no i tell you no said the fallen young
man who was indeed young albert lee the only
son the old knight i am not hurt no
noise on your lives get lights instantly at
the same time he started from the floor as quickly
as he could under the embarrassment a cloak
and doublet skewered as it were together by the
rapier the old knight whose pass most fortunately
had been diverted from the body 
albert by the interruption his cloak the blade
passing right across his back piercing the clothes
while the hilt coming against his side with the
whole force the lounge had borne him to the
ground
joceline all the while enjoined silence to everyone
under the strictest conjurations silence
as you would live long on earth silence as you
woodstock 
would have a place in heaven be but silent fora
few minutes all our lives depend on it
meantime he procured lights with inexpressible
dispatch and they then beheld that sir henry
on hearing the fatal words had sunk back on
one the large chairs without either motion
colour or sign life
oh brother how could you come in this
manlier said alice
ask no questions good god for what am
i reserved he gazed on his father as he spoke
who with claycold features rigidly fixed and
his arms extended in the most absolute helplessness
looked rather the image death upon a
monument than a being in whom existence was
only suspended was my life spared said
albert raising his hands with a wild gesture to
heaven only to witness such a sight as this 
we suffer what heaven permits young man
we endure our lives while heaven continues
them let me approach the same clergyman
who had read the prayers at joceline's hut now
came forward get water he said instantly
and the helpful hand and light foot 
 woodstock
alice with the readywitted tenderness which
never stagnates in vain lamentations while there
is any room for hope provided with incredible
celerity all that the clergyman called for
it is but a swoon he said on feeling sir
henry's palm a swoon produced from the
instant and unexpected shock rouse thee up
albert i promise thee it will be nothing save a
syncope a cup my dearest alice and a ribbon
or a bandage i must take some blood 
some aromatics too if they can be had my good
alice
but while alice procured the cup and bandage
stripped her father's sleeve and seemed by
intuition even to anticipate every direction 
the reverend doctor her brother hearing no
word and seeing no sign comfort stood with
both hands clasped and elevated into the air a
monument speechless despair every feature
in his face seemed to express the thought here
lies my father's corpse and it is i whose rashness
has slain him 
but when a few drops blood began to follow
the lancet at first falling singly and then
woodstock 
trickling in a freer stream when in consequence
 the application cold water to the temples
and aromatics to the nostrils the old man sighed
feebly and made an effort to move his limbs
albert lee changed his posture at once to throw
himself at the feet the clergyman and kiss if
he would have permitted him his shoes and the
hem his raiment
rise foolish youth said the good man
with a reproving tone must it be always thus
with you kneel to heaven not to the feeblest
 its agents you have been saved once again
from great danger would you deserve heaven's
bounty remember you have been preserved for
other purposes than you now think on begone
you and joceline you have a duty to discharge 
and be assured it will go better with your father's
recovery that he see you not for a few minutes
down down to the wilderness and bring in
your attendant
thanks thanks a thousand thanks answered
albert lee and springing through the
lattice he disappeared as unexpectedly as be

 woodstock
had entered at the same time joceline followed
him and by the same road
alice whose fears for her father were now
something abated upon this new movement
among the persons the scene could not resist
appealing to her venerable assistant good
doctor answer me but one question was my
brother albert here just now or have i dreamed
all that has happened for these ten minutes past
methinks but for your presence i could suppose
the whole had passed in my sleep that
horrible thrust that deathlike corpselike old
man that soldier in mute despair i must indeed
have dreamed
 if you have dreamed my sweet alice said
the doctor i wish every sick nurse had your
property since you have been attending to our
patient better during your sleep than most 
these old dormice can do when they are most
awake but your dream came through the gate
 horn my pretty darling which you must remind
me to explain to you at leisure albert has
really been here and will be here again
woodstock 
albert repeated sir henry who names
my son 
it is i my kind patron said the doctor 
permit me to bind up your arm
my wound with all my heart doctor
said sir henry raising himself and gathering his
recollection by degrees i knew old thou
wert bodycurer as well as soulcurer and served
my regiment for surgeon as well as chaplain
but where is the rascal i killed i never made
a fairer stramaon in my life the shell my
rapier struck against his ribs so dead he must
be or my right hand has forgot its cunning
 nobody was slain said the doctor we
must thank god for that since there were none
but friends to slay here is a good cloak and doublet
though wounded in a fashion which will require
some skill in tailorcraft to cure but i was
your last antagonist and took a little blood from
you merely to prepare you for the pleasure and
surprise seeing your son who though hunted
pretty close as you may believe hath made his
way from worcester hither wherewith jocehne's
assistance we will care well enough for his safe
 woodstock
ty it was even for this reason that i pressed
you to accept your nephew's proposal to return
to the old lodge where a hundred men
might be concealed though a thousand were
making search to discover them never such a
place for hideandseek as i shall make good
when i can find means to publish my wonders
 woodstock
but my son my dear son said the knight
shall i not then instantly see him and wherefore
did you not forewarn me this joyful
event 
because i was uncertain his motions
said the doctor and rather thought he was
bound for the seaside and that it would be best
to tell you his fate when he was safe on board
and in full sail for france we had appointed
to let you know all when i came hither tonight
to join you but there is a redcoat in the house
whom we care not to trust farther than we could
not help we dared not therefore venture in by
the hall and so prowling round the building
albert informed us that an old prank his
when a boy consisted entering by this wui
woodstock 
dow a lad who was with us would needs make
the experiment as there seemed to be no light in
the chamber and the moonlight without made us
liable to be detected his foot slipped and our
friend bevis came upon us
in good truth you acted simply said sir
henry to attack a garrison without a summons
but all this is nothing to my son albert where
is he let me see him
but sir henry wait said the doctor till
your restored strength 
a plague my restored strength man 
answered the knight as his old spirit began to
awaken within him dost not remember that
i lay on edgehillfield all night bleeding like a
bullock from five several wounds and wore my
armour within six weeks and you talk to me 
the few drops blood that follow such a scratch
as a cat's claw might have made 
nay if you feel so courageous said the
doctor i will fetch your son he is not far distant

so saying he left the apartment making a sign
to alice to remain in case any symptoms her
father's weakness should return
vol n
 woodstock
it was fortunate perhaps that sir henry never
seemed to recollect the precise nature the
alarm which had at once and effectually as the
shock the thunderbolt for the moment suspended
his faculties something he said more
than once being certain he had done mischief
with that stramafon as he called it but his mind
did not recur to that danger as having been incurred
by his son alice glad to see that her
father appeared to have forgotten a circumstance
so fearful as men often forget the blow or other
sudden cause which has thrown them into a
swoon readily excused herself from giving much
light on the matter by pleading the general confusion
and in a few minutes albert cut off all
farther inquiry by entering the room followed
by the doctor and throwing himself alternately
into the arms his father and his sister
woodstock 
chapter viii
the boy is hark ye sirrah what's your name 
oh jacob ay i recollect the same
crabbe
the affectionate relatives were united as those
who meeting under great adversity feel still the
happiness sharing it in common they embraced
again and again and gave way to those expansions
 the heart which at once express and
relieve the pressure mental agitation at length
the tide emotion began to subside and sir
henry still holding his recovered son by the hand
resumed the command his feelings which he
usually practised
so you have seen the last our battles
albert he said and the king's colours have
fallen for ever before the rebels 
it is but even so said the young man 
the last cast the die was thrown and alas 
 woodstock
lost at worcester and cromweirs fortune carried
it there as it has wherever he has shown himself
 well it can but be for a time it can but
be for a time answered his father the devil
is potent they say in raising and gratifying favourites
but he can grant but short leases and
the king the king albert the king in my
ear close close 
our last news were confident that he had
escaped from bristol
thank god for that thank god for that 
said the knight where didst thou leave him p
our jan were almost all cut to pieces at the
bridge albert replied but i followed his majesty
with about five hundred other officers and
gentlemen who were resolved to die around him
until as our numbers and appearance drew the
whole pursuit after us it pleased his majesty to
dismiss us with many thanks and words comfort
to us in general and some kind expressions
to most us in especial he sent his royal greeting
to you sir in particular and said more than
becomes me to repeat
nay i will hear it every word boy said
woodstock 
sir henry is not the certainty that thou hast
discharged thy duty and that king charles owns
it enough to console me for all we have lost and
suffered and wouwst thou stint me it from a
false shamefacedness i will have it out thee
were it drawn from thee with cords 
it shall need no such compulsion said the
young man it was his majesty's pleasure to
bid me tell sir henry lee in his name that
if his son could not go before his father in the
race loyalty he was at least following him
closely and would soon move side by side
said he so answered the knight old
victor lee will look down with pride on thee
albert but i forget you must be weary and
hungry
even so sir said albert but these are
things which late i have been in the habit 
enduring for safety's sake
joceline what ho joccline 
the underkeeper entered and received orders
to get supper prepared directly
my son and dr rochccliffe are half starving
said the knight
and there is a lad too below said joce
 woodstock
line a page he says colonel albert's whose
belly rings cupboard too and that to no common
tune for i think he could eat a horse as the
yorksmireman says behind the saddle he had
better eat at the sideboard for he has devoured
a whole loaf bread and butter as fast as
phoebe could cut it and it has not staid his stomach
for a minute and truly i think you had
better keep him under your own eyes for the
steward beneath might ask him troublesome questions
if he went below and then he is impatient
as all your gentlemen pages are and is saucy
among the women 
whom is it he talks what page hast
thou got albert that bears himself so ill said
sir henry
the son a dear friend a noble lord 
scotland who followed the great montrose's banner
 afterwards joined the king in scotland and
came with him as far as worcester he was
wounded the day before the battle and conjured
me to take this youth under my charge which i
did something unwillingly but i could not refuse
a father perhaps on his deathbed pleading
for the safety an only son
woodstock 
thou hadst deserved an halter hadst thou
hesitated said sir henry the smallest tree
can always give some shelter and it pleases me
to think the old stock lee is not so totally prostrate
but it may yet be a refuge for the distressed
fetch the youth in he is noble blood
and these are no times ceremony he shall sit
with us at the same table page though he be 
and if you have not schooled him handsomely in
his manners he may not be the worse some lessons
fi'om me
you will excuse his national drawling accent
sir said albert though i know you like it not
i have small cause albert answered the
knight small cause who stirred up these
disunion the scots who strengthened the
hands parliament when their cause was well
nigh ruined the scots again who delivered
up the king their countryman who had flung
himself upon their protection the scots again
but this lad's father you say has fought on the
part the noble montrose and such a man as
the great marquis may make amends for the degeneracy
 a whole nation
 woodstock
i
nay father said albert and i must add
that though this lad is uncouth and wayward
and as you will see something wilful yet the
king has not a more zealous friend in england 
and when occasion offered he fought stoutly too
in his defence i marvel he comes not
he hath taken the bath said joceline and
nothing less would serve than that he should have
it immediately the supper he said might be got
ready in the meantime and he commands all
about him as if he were in his father's old castle
where he might have called long enough i warrant
without any one to hear him
indeed said sir henry this must be a
forward chick the game to crow so early 
what is his name 
his name it escapes me every hour it is
so hard a one said albert kerneguy is his
name louis kerneguy his father was lord
killstewers kincardineshire
kerneguy and killstewers and kin what
d'ye call it truly said the knight these
northern men's names and titles smack their
origin they sordid like a northwest wind rumbling
and roaring among heather and rocks
woodstock 
it is but the asperities the celtic and
saxon dialects said dr rochecliffe which
according to verstegan still linger in those northern
parts the island but peace here comes
supper and master louis kerneguy
supper entered accordingly borne in by joce
line and phoebe and after it leaning on a huge
knotty stick and having his nose in the air like
a questing hound for his attention was apparently
more fixed on the good provisions that
went before him than anything else came master
kerneguy and seated himself without much
ceremony at the lower the table
he was a tall rawboned lad with a shock
head hair fiery red like many his country
while the harshness his national features was
increased by the contrast his complexion turned
almost black by the exposure to all sorts 
weather which in that skulking and rambling
mode life the fugitive royalists had been obliged
to encounter his address was by no means prepossessing
being a mixture awkwardness and
forwardness and showing in a remarkable degree
how a want easy address may be consistent with
an admirable stock assurance his face inti
wi woodstock
mated having received some recent scratches
and the care dr rochecliffe had decorated it
with a number patches which even enhanced
its natural plainness yet the eyes were brilliant
and expressive and amid his ugliness for it
amounted to that degree irregularity the face
vas not deficient in some lines which expressed
both sagacity and resolution
the dress albert himself was far beneath his
quality as the son sir henry lee and commander
 a regiment in the royal service but
that his page was still more dilapidated a
disastrous green jerkin which had been changed
to a hundred hues by sun and rain so that the
original could scarce be discovered huge clouterly
shoes leathern breeches such as were worn by
hedgers coarse grey worsted stockings were the
attire the honourable youth whose limping gait
while it added to the ungainliness his manner
showed at the same time the extent his sufferings
his appearance bordered so much upon
what is vulgarly called the queer that even with
alice it would have excited some sense ridiculehad
not compassion been predominant
the grace was said and the young squire 
ditchley as well as dr rochecliffe made an excellent
figure at a meal the like which in quality
and abundance did not seem to have lately
fallen to their share but their feats were child'splay
to those the scotch youth far from betraying
any symptoms the bread and butter with
which he had attempted to close the orifice his
stomach his appetite appeared to have been sharpened
by a nine days fast and the knight was
disposed to think that the very genius famine
himself come forth from his native regions the
north was in the act honouring him with a
visit while as if afraid losing a moment's exertion
master kerneguy never looked either to right
or left or spoke a single word to any at table
i am glad to see that you have brought a
good appetite for our country fare young gentleman
said sir henry
bread gude sir said the page an
ye'll find flesh i've find appetite conforming ony
day o the year but the truth is sir that the
appcteesement has been coming on for three days
or four and the meat in this southland your
 woodstock
has been scarce and hard to come by so sir
i'm making up for lost time as the piper sago
said when he eat a hail side o mutton
you have been countrybred young man
said the knight who like others his time held
the reins discipline rather tight over the rising
generation at least to judge from the youths
 scotland whom i have seen at his late majesty's
court in former days they had less appetite
and more more as he sought the qualifying
phrase which might supply the place good
manners his guest closed the sentence in his
own way and more meat it may be the
better luck theirs
sir henry stared and was silent his son seemed
to think it time to interpose my dear father
he said think how many years have run
since the thirtyeight when the scottish troubles
first began and i am sure that you will not
wonder that while the barons scotland have
been for one cause or other perpetually in the
field the education their children at home must
have been much neglected and that young men
 my friend's age know better about using a
woodstock soc
broadsword or tossing a pike than about the decent
ceremonials society
the reason is a sufficient one said the
knight and since thou mayest thy follower
vertigo can fight well not let him lack victuals
a god's name see he looks angrily still at
yonder cold loin mutton for god's sake put
it all on his plate 
i can bide the bit and the buffet said the
honourable master kerneguy a hungry tyke
ne'er minds a blaud with a rough bane
now god ha mercy albert but if this bethe
son a scots peer said sir henry to his
son in a low tone voice i would not bethe
english ploughman who would change manners
with him for his ancient blood and his nobility
and his estate to boot an he has one he
has eaten as i am a christian near four pounds
 solid butcher's meat and with the grace a
wolf tugging at the carcase a dead horse oh
he is about to drink at last soh he wipes his
mouth though and dips his fingers in the ewer
and dries them i profess with the napkin 
there is some grace in him after all
dog woodstock
 here is passing all your vara gude healths 
said the youth quality and took a draught in
proportion to the sods which he had sent before
 he then flung his knife and fork awkwardly
on the trencher which he pushed back towards
the centre the table extended his feet beneath
it till they rested on their heels folded his arms on
his wellreplenished stomach and lolling back in
his chair looked much as if he was about to whistle
himself asleep
 soh said the knight the honourable
master vertigo hath laid down his arms withdraw
these things and give us our glasses fill
them around jocehne and if the devil or the
whole parliament were within hearing let them
hear henry lee ditchley drink a health to
kmg charles and confusion to his enemies 
 amen said a voice from behind the door
all the company looked at each other in astonishment
at a response so little expected it was
followed by a solemn and peculiar tap such as a
kind freemasonry had introduced among royalists
and by which they were accustomed to make
woodstock 
themselves and their principles known to each other
when they met by accident
there is no danger said albert knowing
the sign it is a friend yet i wish he had been
at a greater distance just now
and why my son should you wish the absence
 one true man who may perhaps wish
to share our abundance on one those rare occasions
when we have superfluity at our disposal
 go joceline see who knocks and if a
safe man admit him
 and if otherwise said joceline methinks
i shall be able to prevent his troubling the good
company
no violence joceline on your life said
albert lee and alice echoed for god's sake
no violence 
no unnecessary violence at least said the
good knight for if the time demands it i will
have it seen that i am master my own house
joceline jolift'e nodded assent to all parties and
went on tiptoe to exchange one or two other mysterious
symbols and knocks ere he opened the
door it may be here remarked that this species
sos woodstock
 secret association with its signals union existed
among the more dissolute and desperate class
 cavaliers men habituated to the dissipated life
which they had been accustomed to in an illdisciplined
army where everything like order and
regularity was too apt to be accounted a badge 
puritanism these were the roaring boys who
met in hedge alehouses and when they had by
any chance obtained a little money or a little
credit determined to create a counterrevolution
by declaring their sittings permanent and proclaimed
in the words one their choicest ditties

we'll drink till we bring
in triumph back the king
the leaders and gentry a higher description
and more regular morals did not indeed partake
such excesses but they still kept their eye upon
a class persons who from courage and desperation
were capable serving on an advantageous
occasion the fallen cause royalty and recorded
the lodges and blindtaverns at which
they met as wholesale merchants know the houses
 call the mechanics whom they may have
occasion to employ and can tell where they may
woodstock j
i
lind them when need requires it is scarce necessary
to add that among the lower class and
sometimes even among the higher there were men
found capable betraying the projects and conspiracies
 their associates whether well or indifferently
combined to the governors the state
cromwell in particular had gained some correspondents
 this kind the highest rank and
 the most undoubted character among the royalists
who if they made scruple impeaching
or betraying individuals who confided in them
had no hesitation in giving the government such
general information as served to enable him to disappoint
the purposes any plot or conspiracy
to return to our story in much shorter time
than we have spent in reminding the reader 
these historical particulars joliffe had made his
mystic communication and being duly answered
as by one the initiated he undid the door and
there entered our old friend roger wildrake
roundhead in dress as his safety and his dependence
on colonel everard compelled him to
be but that dress worn in a most cavalierlike
manner and forming a stronger contrast than
vol o
 woodstock
usual with the demeanour and language the
wearer to which it was never very congenial
his puritanic hat the emblem that ralph
in the prints to hudibras or as he called it
his feltumbrella was set most knowingly on one
side the head as if it had been a spanish hat
and feather his straight squarecaped sadcoloured
cloak was flung gaily upon one shoulder
as if it had been threepiled tafteta lined with
crimson silk and he paraded his huge calfskin
boots as if they had been silken hose and spanish
leather shoes with roses on the instep in short
the airs which he gave himself a most thoroughpaced
wild gallant and cavalier joined to a glistening
 selfsatisfaction in his eye and an inimitable
swagger in his gait which completely announced
his thoughtless conceited and reckless
character formed a most ridiculous contrast to his
gravity attire
it could not on the other hand be denied that
in spite the touch ridicule which attached to
his character and the loose morality which he
had learned in the dissipation town pleasures
and afterwards in the disorderly life a soldier
wildrake had points about him both to make him
woodstock 
feared and respected he was handsome even in
spite his air debauched effrontery a man
 the most decided courage though his vaunting
rendered it sometimes doubtful and entertained
a sincere sense his political principles such as
they were though he was often so imprudent in
asserting and boasting them as joined with
this dependence on colonel everard induced prudent
men to doubt his sincerity
such as he was however he entered the parlour
 victor lee where his presence was anything
but desirable to the parties present with
a jaunty step and a consciousness deserving
the best possible reception this assurance was
greatly aided by circumstances which rendered it
obvious that if the jocund cavalier had limited
himself to one draught liquor that evening in
terms his vow temperance it must have been
a very deep and long one
save ye gentlemen save ye save you good
sir henry lee though i have scarce the honour
to be known to you save you worthy doctor
and a speedy resurrection to the fallen church 
england's
you are welcome sir said sir henry time
 woodstock
whose feelings hospitality and the fraternal
reception due to a royalist sufferer induced him
to tolerate this intrusion more than he might have
done otherwise if you have fought or suffered
for the king sir it is an excuse for joining us
and commanding our services in anything in our
power although at present we are a family party
but i think i saw you in waiting upon master
markham everard who calls himself colonel
everard if your message is from him you may
wish to see me in private 
not at all sir henry not at all it is true
as my ill hap will have it that being on the stormy
side the hedge like all honest men you understand
me sir henry i am glad as it were to
gain something from my old friend and comrade's
countenance not by truckling or disowning my
principles sir i defy such practices but in
short by doing him any kindness in rrty power
when he is pleased to call on me so i came down
here with a message from him to the old roundheaded
son a i beg the young lady's pardon
from the crown her head down to the very
toes her slipper and so sir chancing as i
was stumbling out in the dark i heard you give
woodstock s
a toast sir which warmed my heart sir and ever
will sir till death chills it and so i made bold
to let you know there was an honest man within
hearing
such was the selfintroduction master drake
to which the knight replied by asking him to
sit down and take a glass sack to his majesty's
glorious restoration wildrake at this hint squeezed
in without ceremony beside the young scotchman
and not only pledged his landlord's toast
but seconded its import by volunteering a verse
or two his favourite loyal ditty the king
shall enjoy his own again the heartiness which
he threw into his song opened still farther the
heart the old knight though albert and alice
looked at each other with looks resentful the
intrusion and desirous to put an to it the
honourable master kerneguy either possessed that
happy indifference temper which does not deign
to notice such circumstances or he was able to
assume the appearance it to perfection as he
sat sipping sack and cracking walnuts without
testifying the least sense that an addition had been
made to the party wildrake who liked the liquor
and the company showed no unwillingness
il woodstock
to repay this landlord by being at the expense 
the conversation
you talk fighting and suffering sir henry
lee lord help us we have all had our share
all the world knows what sir henry lee has
done from edgefield downwards wherever a loyal
sword was drawn or a loyal flag fluttered ah
god help us i have done something too my
name is roger wildrake squattleseamere 
lincoln not that you are ever like to have heard
it before but i was captain in lunsford's lighthorse
and afterwards with goring i was a
childeater sir a babe bolter
i have heard your regiment's exploits sir 
and perhaps you may find i have seen some 
them if we should spend ten minutes together 
and i think i have heard your name too i
beg to drink your health captain wildrake 
squattleseamere lincolnshire 
sir henry i drink yours in this pint bumper
and upon my knee and i would do as much
for that young gentleman looking at albert 
and the squire the green cassock too holding
it for green as the colours are not to my eyes altogether
clear and distinguishable
woodstock 
it was a remarkable part what is culled by
theatrical folks the byplay this scene that
albert was conversing apart with doctor rochecliffs
in whispers even more than the divine seemed
desirous encouraging yet to whatever their
private conversation referred it did not deprive
the young colonel from the power listening to
what was going forward in the party at large and
interfering from time to time like a watchdog
who can distinguish the slightest alarm even when
employed in the engrossing process taking his
food
captain wildrake said albert we have
no objection i mean my friend and i to be
communicative on proper occasions but you sir
who are so old a sufferer must needs know that
at such casual meetings as this men do not mention
their names unless they are specially wanted
it is a point conscience sir to be able to say
if your principal captain everard or colonel
everard if he be a colonel should examine you
upon oath i did not know who the persons were
whom i heard drink such and such toasts
faith i have a better way it worthy sir
answered wildrake i never can for the life
 woodstock
 me remember that there were any such and
such toasts drunk at all its a strange swift forgetfulness
i have
well sh replied the younger lee but
we who have unhappily more tenacious memories
would willingly abide by the more general rule
oh sir answered wildrake with all my
heart intrude on no man's confidence d n me
and i only spoke for civility's sake having the
purpose drinking your health in a good fashion
then he broke forth into melody 
then let the health go round around around around
then let the health go round 
for though your stocking be ilk
your knee shall kiss the ground aground aground aground
your knee shall kiss the ground 
urge it no farther said sir henry addressing
his son master wildrake is one the old
school one the tantivy boys and we must
bear a little for if they drmk hard they fought
well i will never forget how a party came up
and rescued us clerks oxford as they called
the regiment i belonged to out a cursed embroglie
during the attack on brentford i tell you
we were enclosed with the cockneys pikes both
li'ont and rear and we should have come off but
woodstock 
ill had not lunsford's light horse the babceatcrs
as they called them charged up to the pike's
point and brought us off
i am glad you thought on that sir henry
said wildrake and do you remember what the
officer lunsford's said 
i think i do said sir henry smiling
well then did not he call out when the women
were coming down howling like syrens as
they were have none you a plump child that
you could give us to break our fast upon t 
truth itself said the knight and a great
fat woman stepped forward with a baby and offered
it to the supposed cannibal
all at the table master kerneguy excepted
who seemed to think that good food any kind
required no apology held up their hands in token
 amazement
ay said wildrake the ahem i
crave the lady's pardon again from tip topknot
to hem farthingale but the cursed creature
proved to be a parish nurse who had been paid
for the child half a year in advance gad i took
the baby out the bitchwolf's hand and i have
contrived though god knows i have lived in a
s
woodstock
sheltering sort way myself to breed up bold
breakfast as i call him ever since it was paying
dear for a jest though
sir i honour you for your humanity sir
i thank you for your courage sir i am glad to
see you here said the good knight his eyes watering
almost to overflowing so you were the
wild officer who cut us out the toils oh sir
had you but stopped when i called on you and allowed
us to clear the streets brentford with our
musketeers we would have been at london stone
that day but your good will was the same
ay truly was it said wildrake who now sat
triumphant and glorious in his easychair and
here is to all the brave hearts sir that fought and
fell in that same storm brentford we drove
all before us like chaff till the shops where they
sold strong waters and other temptations brought
us up gad sir we the babeeaters had too many
acquaintances in brentford and our stout prince
rupert was ever better at making way than drawing
off gad sir for my own poor share i did
but go into the house a poor widow lady who
maintained a charge daughters and whom i had
known old to get my horse fed a morsel 
woodstock 
meat and so forth when these cockneypikes 
the artillery ground as you very well call them
rallied and came in with their armed heads as
boldly as so many cotswold rams i sprang downstairs
 got to my horse but egad i fancy all my
troop had widows and orphan maidens to comfort
as well as i for only five us got together we
cut our way through successfully and gad gentlemen
i carried my little breakfast on the pommel
before me and there was such a hollowing
and screeching as if the whole town thought i
was to kill roast and eat the poor child so soon
as i got to quarters but devil a cockney charged
up to my bonny bay poor lass to rescue little
cakebread they only cried haro and out upon
me
alas alas said the knight we made
ourselves seem worse than we were and we were
too bad to deserve god's blessing even in a good
cause but it is needless to look back we did
not deserve victories when god gave them for
we never improved them like good soldiers or
like christian men and so we gave these canting
scoundrels the advantage us for they assumed
out mere hypocrisy the discipline and orderly
 woodstock
behaviour which we who drew our swords in a
better cause ought to have practised out true
principle but here is my hand captain i have
often wished to see the honest fellow who charged
up so smartly in our behalf and i reverence you
for the care you took the poor child i am glad
this dilapidated place has still some hospitality to
offer you although we cannot treat you to roasted
babes or stewed sucklings eh captain
troth sir henry the scandal was sore against
us on that score i remember lacy who was an
old playactor and a lieutenant in ours made
drollery on it in a play which was sometimes
acted at oxford when our hearts were something
up called i think the old troop
this curious old play may be consulted by the dramatic
antiquary a scene or two it turns on the strange impression
made on the country people that the cavaliers actually eat children
it was written by lacy a player who had served in this
same old troop which lay under such evil reputation miss
edgeworth has quoted a verse a popular poem referring to the
same prejudice 
the pest that came from coventry
riding in a red rochet
had news to tell how lunsford fell
a child's hand in his pocket
it was not a small cause the violent prejudices the citizen
woodstock 
so saying and feeling more familiar as his merits
were known he hitched his chair up against
that the scottish lad who was seated next him
and who in shifting his place was awkward
enough to disturb in his turn alice lee who
sate opposite and a little offended or at least
embarrassed drew her chair away from the table
 i crave pardon said the honourable master
kerneguy but sir to master wildrake yc
hae e'en garret me hurt the young lady's shank
i crave your pardon sir and much more
that the fair lady as is reasonable though rat
me sir if it was i set your chair atrundling in
that way zooks sir i have brought with mc
no plague nor pestilence nor other infectious
disorder that ye should have started away as if
i had been a leper and discomposed the lady
which i would have prevented with my life sir
sir if ye be northern born as your tongue bespeaks
egad it was i ran the risk in drawing near
you so there was small reason for you to bolt
master wildrake said albert interfering
 london against king charles that he had attempted to put
this same liunsford thought capable such ferocious proceedings
into the government the tower london
woodstock
this young gentleman is a stranger as well as
you under protection sir henry's hospitality
and it cannot be agreeable for my father to see disputes
arise among his guests you may mistake
the young gentleman's quality from his present
appearance this is the honourable master louis
kerneguy sir son my lord listeners kincardiganshire
one who has fought for the king
young as he is
no dispute shall rise through me sir none
through me said wildrake your exposition
suffice sir master louis girnigo son my
lord kilsteer in gringardenshire i am your
humble slave sir and drink your health in token
that i honour you and all true scots who draw
their andrew ferrara on the right side sir
ise beholden to you and thank you sir
said the young man with some haughtiness 
manner which hardly corresponded with his rusticity
 and i fuss your health in a ceevil way
most judicious persons would have here dropped
the conversation but it was one wildrake's
marked peculiarities that he could never let matters
stand when they were well he continued to
plague the shy proud and awkward lad with his
woodstock 
observations you speak sour national dialect
pretty strongly master girnigo said he but
i think not quite the language the gallants
that i have known among the scottish cavaliers
i knew for example some the gordon
and others good repute who always put an
for the wh asjaat for what jan for zahen and
the like
albert lee here interposed and said that the
provinces scotland like those england had
their different modes pronunciation
you are very right sir said wildrake
i reckon myself now a pretty good speaker 
their cursed jargon no offence young gentleman
 and yet when i took a turn with some 
montrose's folks in the south hieland as they
call their beastly wildernesses no offence again
i chanced to be by myself and to lose my way
when i said to a shepherdfellow making my
mouth as wide and my voice as broad as i could
shore am i ganging till confound me if the
fellow could answer me unless indeed he was
sulky as the bumpkins will be now and then to
the gentlemen the sword
this was familiarly spoken and though partly
s woods rocif
addressed to albert was stili more directed to his
immediate neighbour the young scotsman who
seemed from bashfulness or some other reason
rather shy his intimacy to one or two personal
touches from wildrake's elbow administered
during his last speech by way a practical
appeal to him in particular he only answered
misunderstandings were to be expected when
men converse in national dialects
wildrake now considerably drunker than he
ought to have been in civil company caught up
the phrase and repeated it misunderstanding
sir misunderstanding sir i do not know
how i came to construe that sir but to judge
from the information these scratches on your
honourable visnomy i should augur that you
had been late at misunderstanding with the
cat sir
you are mistaken then friend for it was
with the down answered the scotsman drily
and cast a look towards albert
we had some trouble with the watch dogs in
entering so late in the evening said albert in explanation
 and this youth had a fall among some
rubbish by which he came by these scratches 
woodstock 
and now dear sir henry said dr jlochecliffe
 allow us to remind you your gout and our
long journey i do it the rather that my good
friend your son has been during the whole time
 supper putting questions to me aside which
had much better be reserved till tomorrow may
we therefore ask permission to retire to our night's
rest 
 these private committees in a merry meeting
said wildrake are a solecism in breeding
they always put me in mind the cursed committees
at westminster but shall we to roost
before we rouse the nightowl with a catch 
 aha canst thou quote shakspeare said sir
henry pleased at discovering a new good quality
in his acquaintance whose military services were
otherwise but just able to counterbalance the
intrusive freedom his conversation in the
name merry will he continued whom i
never saw though i have seen many his comrades
as aueyn hemmings and so on we will
have a single catch and one rouse about and then
to beds
after the usual discussion about the choice 
vol i
 woodstock
the song and the parts which each was to bear
they united their voices in trolling a loyal glee
which was popular among the party at the time
and in fact believed to be composed by no less a
person than doctor rochecliffe himself
glee f or king charles
bring the bowl which you boast
fill it up to the brim 
tis to him we love most
and to all who love him
brave gallants stand up
and ay aunt ye base charles 
were there death in the cup
here's a health to king charles 
though he wanders through dangers
unaided unknown
dependent on strangers
estranged from his own 
though tis under our breath
amidst forfeits and perils
here's to honour and faith
and a health to king charles 
let such honours abound
as the time can afford
the knee on the ground
and the hand on the sword 
but the time shall come round
when mid lords dukes and earls
the loud trumpets shall sound
here's a health to king charles 
woodstock 
after this display loyalty and a final libation
the party took leave each other for the night
sir henry offered his old acquaintance wildrake
a bed for the evening who weighed the matter
somewhat in this fashion why to speak truth
my patron will expect me at the borough but then
he is used to my staying out doors a nights
then there's the devil that they say haunts woodstock
 but with the blessing this reverend doctor
i defy him and all his works i saw him not
when i slept here twice before and i am sure if
he was absent then he has not come back with sir
henry lee and his family so i accept your courtesy
sir henry and i thank you as a cavalier 
lunsford should thank one the fighting clerks
 oxon god bless the king i care not who
hears it and confusion to noll and his red nose 
off he went accordingly with a bottleswagger
guided by joceline to whom albert in the meantime
had whispered to be sure to quarter him
far enough from the rest the family
young lee then saluted his sister and with
the formality those times asked and received
lois father's blessing with an affectionate embrace
his page seemed desirous to imitate one part 
 woodstock
his example but was repelled by alice who only
replied to his offered salute with a curtsey he
next bowed his head in an awkward fashion to her
father who wished him a good night i am glad
to see young man he said that you have at
least learned the reverence due to age it should
always be paid sir because in doing so you render
that honour to others which you will expect yourself
to receive when you approach the close 
your life more will i speak with you at leisure
on your duties as a page which office in former days
used to be the very school chivalry whereas 
late by the disorderly times it has become little
better than a school wild and disordered license 
which made rare ben jonson exclaim 
 nay father said albert interposing you
must consider this day's fatigue and the poor lad
is almost asleep on his legs tomorrow he will
listen with more profit to your kind admonitions
and you louis remember at least one part 
your duty take the candles and light us here
joccline comes to show us the may once more
good night ijood doctor rochcclifie good night

richard 
albert and his page were ushered by joce
line to what was called the spanish chamber
a huge old scrambling bedroom rather in a dilapidated
condition but furnished with a large
standing bed for the master and a trucklebed
for the domestic as was common at a much later
period in old english houses where the gentleman
often required the assistance a groom 
the chambers to help him to bed if the hospitality
had been exuberant the walls were covered
with hangings cordovan leather stamped
with gold and representing fights between the
 woodstock
spaniards and moriscoes bullfeasts and other
sports peculiar to the peninsula from which it
took its name the spanish chamber these
hangings were in some places entirely torn down
in others defaced and hanging in tatters but
albert stopped not to make observations anxious
it seemed to get joceline out the room which
he achieved by hastily answering his offers fresh
fuel and more liquor in the negative and returning
with equal conciseness the underkeeper's
good wishes for the evening he at length retired
somewhat unwillingly and as if he thought
that his young master might have bestowed a few
more words upon a faithful old retainer after so
long absence
joliffe was no sooner gone than before a single
word was spoken between albert lee and his
page the former hastened to the door examined
lock latch and bolt and made them fast with the
most scrupulous attention he superadded to
these precautions that a long screwbolt which
he brought out his pocket and which he screwed
on to the staple in such a manner as to render
it impossible to withdraw it or open the door unwoodstock
sapless
by breaking it down the page held alight to
him during the operation which his master went
through with much exactness and dexterity but
when albert arose from his knee on which he had
rested during the accomplishment this task the
manner the companions was on the sudden entirely
changed towards each other the honourable
master kerneguy from a cubbish lout a
raw scotsman seemed to have acquired at once
all the grace and ease motion and manner
which could be given by an acquaintance the
earliest and most familiar kind with the best company
 the time
he gave the light he held to albert with the
easy indifference a superior who rather graces
than troubles his dependent by giving him some
slight service to perform albert with the greatest
appearance deference assumed in his turn
the character torchbearer and lighted his page
across the chamber without turning his back upon
him as he did so he then set the light on a table
by the bedside and approaching the young man
with deep reverence received from him the soiled
green jacket with the same profound respect as
 woodstock
if he had been a first lord the bedchamber
or other officer the household the highest
distinction disrobing his sovereign the mantle
 the garter the person to whom this ceremony
was addressed endured it for a minute or
two with profound gravity and then bursting out
alaughing exclaimed to albert what a devil
means all this formality thou compliments
with these miserable rags as if they were silks
and sables and with poor louis kerneguy as if
he were the king great britain 
and if your majesty's commands and the
circumstances the time have made me for a moment
seem to forget that you are my sovereign
surely i may be permitted to render my homage
as such while you are in your own royal palace 
woodstock
truly replied the disguised monarch the
sovereign and the palace are not ill matched 
these tattered hangings and my ragged jerkin suit
each other admirably this woodstock this
the bower where the royal norman revelled with
the fair rosamond clifford why it is a place
cf assignation for owls then suddenly recollectwoodstock

ing himself with his natural courtesy he added
as if fearing he might have hurt albert's feelings
but the more obscure and retired it is the
fitter for our purpose lee and if it does seem to
be a roost for owls as there is no denying why
we know it has nevertheless brought up eagles
he threw himself as he spoke upon a chair and
indolently but gracefully received the kind offices
 albert who undid the coarse buttoning his
leathern gashes which defended his legs and
spoke to him the whilst what a fine specimen
 the olden time is your father sir henry it is
strange i should not have seen him before but
i heard my father often speak him as being
among the flower our real old english gentry
by the mode in which he began to school me i
can guess you had a tight taskmaster him albert
 i warrant you never wore hat in his presence
eh 
i never cocked it at least in his presence
please your majesty as i have seen some youngsters
do answered albert indeed if i had it
must have been a stout beaver to have saved me
from a broken head
woodstock
oh i doubt it not replied the king a
fine old gentleman but with that methinks in his
countenance that assures you he would not hate
the child in sparing the rod hark ye albert 
suppose the same glorious restoration come
round which if drinking to its arrival can hasten
it should not be far distant for in that particular
our adherents never neglect their duty suppose
it come therefore and that thy father as
must be course becomes an earl and one 
the privy council odd's fish man i shall be as
much afraid him as ever was my grandfather
henri quatre old sully imagine there were
such a trinket now about the court as the fair
rosamond or la belle gabrielle what a work
there would be pages and grooms the cham
to get the pretty rogue clandestinely shuffled
out by the backstairs like a prohibited commodity
when the step the earl woodstock was
heard in the antechamber v
i am glad to see your majesty so merry after
your fatiguing journey
the fatigue was nothing man said charles
a kind welcome and a good meal made amends
woodstock 
for all that but they must have suspected thee 
bringing a wolf from the braes badcnoch along
with you instead a twolegged being with no
more than the usual allowance mortal stowage
for provisions i was really ashamed my appetite
 but thou knowest i had eat nothing for
twentyfour hours save the raw egg you stole forme
from the old woman's henroost i tell thee i
blushed to show myself so ravenous before that
high bred and respectable old gentleman your
father and the very pretty girl your sister or
cousin is she 
she is my sister said albert lee drily and
added in the same breath your majesty's appetite
suited well enough with the character a
raw northern lad would your majesty now
please to retire to rest 
not for a minute or two said the king retaining
his seat why man i have scarce had
my tongue unchained today and to talk with
that northern twang and besides the fatigue 
being obliged to speak every word in character 
gad it's like walking as the galley slaves do on
the continent with a twentyfourpound shot
g woodstock
chained to their legs they may drag it along
but they cannot move with comfort and by the
way thou art slack in paying me my welldeserved
tribute compliments on my counterfeiting
did i not play louis kerneguy as round as a
ring
 if your majesty asks my serious opinion perhaps
i may be forgiven if i say your dialect was
somewhat too coarse for a scottish youth high
birth and your behaviour perhaps a little too
churlish i thought too though i pretend not
to be skilful that some your scotch sounded
as if it were not genuinely
not genuine there is no pleasing thee albert
 why who should speak genuine scotch
but myself was i not their king for a matter
 ten months and if i did not get knowledge
 their language i wonder what else i got by
it did not east country and south country and
west country and highlands caw croak and
shriek about me as the deep guttural the broad
drawl and the high sharp yelp predominated by
turns odd's fish man have i not been speeches
woodstock j
at by their orators addressed by their senators rebuked
by their workmen have i not sate on the
cuttlestool mon again assuming the northern
dialect and thought it grace worthy mas john
gillespie that i was permitted to do penance in
mine own privy chamber instead the face the
congregation and wilt thou tell me after all that
i cannot speak scotch enough to bare an oxon
knight and his family 
may it please your majesty i began by
saying i was no judge the scottish language
pshaw it is mere envy just so you said at
norton's that i was too courteous and civil for a
young page now you think me too rude
 and there is a medium if one could find it
said albert defending his opinion in the same
tone in which the king attacked him so this
morning when you were in the woman's dress you
raised your petticoats rather unbecomingly high
as you waded through the first little stream and
when i told you it to mend the matter you
draggled through the next without raising them
at all
o the devil take the woman's dress said
 woodstock
charles i hope i shall never be driven to that
disguise again why my ugly face was enough
to put gowns caps and kirtles out fashion for
ever the very dogs fled from me had i passed
any hamlet that had but five huts in it i could
not have escaped the cuckingstool i was a libel
on womanhood these leathern conveniences are
none the gayest but they are propria que marius
 and right glad am i to be repossessed 
them i can tell you too my friend i shall resume
all my masculine privileges with my proper
habiliments and as you say i have been too
coarse tonight i will behave myself like a courtier
to mistress alice tomorrow i made a sort
 acquaintance with her already when i seemed
to be the same sex with herself and found out
there are other colonels in the wind besides you
colonel albert lee
may it please your majesty said albert 
and then stopped short from the difficulty 
finding words to express the unpleasant nature 
his feelings they could not escape charles but
he proceeded without scruple i pique myself
on seeing as far into the hearts young ladies
woodstock 
as most folks though god knows they are sometimes
too deep for the wisest us but i mentioned
to your sister in my character fortuneteller 
thinking poor simple man that a country girl must
have no one but her brother to dream about 
that she was anxious about a certain colonel i
had hit the theme but not the person for i alluded
to you albert and i presume the blush
was too deep ever to be given to a brother so up
she got and away she flew from me like a lapwing
i can excuse her for looking at myself in the well
i think if i had met such a creature as i seemed
i should have called fire and faggot against it 
now what think you albert who can this colonel
be that more than rivals you in your sister's
affection 
albert who well knew that the king's mode 
thinking where the fair sex was concerned was
far more gay than delicate endeavoured to put a
stop to the present topic by a grave answer
his sister he said had been in some measure
educated with the son her maternal uncle
markham everard but as his father and he himself
had adopted the cause the roundheads the
 woodstock
families had in consequence been at variance and
any projects which might have been formerly entertained
were course long since dismissed on
all sides
you are wrong albert you are wrong said
the king pitilessly pursuing his jest you colonels
whether you wear blue or orange sashes
are too pretty fellows to be dismissed so easily
when once you have acquired an interest but
mistress alice so pretty and who wishes the restoration
 the king with such a look and accent
as if she were an angel whose prayers must
needs bring it down must not be allowed to retain
any thoughts a canting roundhead what
say you will you give me leave to take her to
task about it after all i am the party most
concerned in maintaining true allegiance among
tiny subjects and if i gain the pretty maidens
good will that the sweethearts will soon follow
this was jolly king edward's way edward the
fourth you know the kingmaking earl warwick
 the cromwell his day dethroned him
more than once but he had the hearts the
hi
woodstock h
merry dames london and the purses and veins
 the cockneys bled freely till they brought him
home again how say you shall i shake off my
northern slough and speak with alice in my own
character showing what education and manners
have done for me to make the best amends they
can for an ugly face 
may it please your majesty said albert in
an altered and embarrassed tone i did not expect

here he stopped not able to find words adequate
at the same time to express his sentiments
and respectful enough to the king while in this
father's house and under his own protection
and what is it that master lee does not expect
 said charles with marked gravity on his
part
again albert attempted a reply but advanced
no farther than i would hope if it please your
majesty when he again stopped short his deep
and hereditary respect for his sovereign and his
sense the hospitality due to his misfortunes
preventing his giving utterance to this irritated
feelings
vol q
 woodstock
and what does colonel albert lee hope 
said charles in the same dry and cold manner in
which he had before spoken no answer 
now hope that colonel lee does not see in a
silly jest anything offensive to the honour his
family since methinks that were an indifferent
compliment to his sister his father and himself
not to mention charles stuart whom he calls his
king and expect that i shall not be so hardly
construed as to be supposed capable forgetting
that mistress auce lee is the daughter my
faithful subject and host and the sister my
guide and preserver come come albert he
added changing at once to his naturally frank and
unceremonious manner you forget how long i
have been abroad where men women and children
talk gallantry morning noon and night
with no more serious thought than just to pass
away the time and i forget too that you are 
the oldfashioned english school a son after sir
henry's own heart and don't understand raillery
upon such subjects but i ask your pardon
albert sincerely if i have really hurt you
so saying he extended his hand to colonel lee
woodstock sii
who feeling he had been really too hasty in construing
the king's jest in an unpleasant sense kissed
it with reverence and attempted an apology
not a word not a word said the goodnatured
prince raising his penitent adherent as he
attempted to kneel we understand each other
you are somewhat afraid the gay reputation
which i acquired in scotland but i assure you i
will be as stupid as you or your cousin colonel
could desire in presence mrs alice lee and
only bestow my gallantry should i have any to
throw away upon the pretty little waitingmaid
who attended at supper unless you should have
monopolized her ear for your own benefit colonel
albert
it is monopolized sure enough though not by
me if it please your majesty but by joceline 
underkeeper whom we must not disoblige
as we have trusted him so far already and may
have occasion to repose even entire confidence in
him i half think he suspects who louis kern
may in reality be
you are an engrossing set you wooers 
woodstock said the king laughing now
 woodstock
if i had a fancy as a frenchman would not fail
to have in such a case to make pretty speeches
to the deaf old woman i saw in the kitchen as a
pisaller i dare say i should be told that tier ear
was engrossed for dr rochecliffe's sole use 
i marvel at your majesty's good spirits
said albert that after a day danger fatigue
and accidents you should feel the power amusing
yourself thus
that is to say the groom the chambers
wishes his majesty would go to sleep well one
word or two on more serious business and i have
done i have been completely directed by you
and rochecliffe i have changed my disguise
from female to male upon the instant and altered
my destination from hampshire to take shelter
here do you still hold it the wiser course 
i have great confidence in dr rochecliffe
replied albert whose acquaintance with the
scattered royalists enables him to gain the most
accurate intelligence his pride in the extent 
his correspondence and the complication his
plots and schemes for your majesty's service is indeed
the very food he lives upon but his sagacity
woodstock 
is equal to this vanity i repose besides the utmost
faith in joiiffe my father and sister i
would say nothing yet i would not without reason
extend the knowledge your majesty's person
farther than it is indispensably necessary
is it handsome in me said charles pausing
to withhold my full confidence from sir henry
lee r
your majesty heard his almost deathswoon
 last night what would agitate him most
deeply must noi be hastily communicated
true but are we safe from a visit the
redcoats they have them in woodstock as well
as in oxford said charles
dr rochecliffe says not unwisely answered
lee that it is best sitting near the fire when the
chimney smokes and that woodstock so lately in
possession the sequestrated and in the vicinity
 the soldiers will be less suspected and more
carelessly searched than more distant corners
which might seem to promise more safety besides
he added rochecliffe is in possession 
curious and important news concerning the state
 matters at woodstock highly favourable to your
woodstock
majesty's being concealed in the palace for two or
three days till shipping is provided the parliament
or usurping council state had sent
down sequestrated whom their own evil consciences
assisted perhaps by the tricks some daring
cavaliers had frightened out the lodge without
much desire to come back again then the
more formidable usurper cromwell had granted
a warrant possession to colonel everard who
had only used it for the purpose repossessing
his uncle in the lodge and who kept watch in
person at the little borough to see that sir henry
was not disturbed
what mistress alice's colonel said the
king that sounds alarming for grant that
he keeps the other fellows at bay think you not
master albert he will not have an hundred errands
aday to bring him here in person p
dr rochecuffe says answered lee the
treaty between sir henry and his nephew binds
the latter not to approach the lodge unless invited
 indeed it was not without great difficulty
and strongly arguing the good consequences it
might produce to your majesty's cause that my
woodstock ji
father could be prevailed on to occupy woodstock
at all but be assured he will be in no hurry to
send an invitation to the colonel
and be you assured that the colonel will come
without waiting for one said charles folks
cannot judge rightly where sisters are concerned
they are too familiar with the magnet to judge
 its powers attraction everard will be here
as if drawn by cartropes fetters not to talk 
promises will not hold him and then methinks
we are in some danger
i hope not said albert in the first
place i know markham is a slave to his word besides
were any chance to bring him here i think
i could pass your majesty upon him without difficulty
as louis kerneguy then although my
cousin and i have not been at one for these some
years i believe him incapable betraying your
majesty and lastly if i saw the least danger 
it i would were he ten times my mother's nephew
run my sword through his body ere he
had time to execute his purpose
there is but another question said charles
and i will release you albert you seem to
 woodstock
think yourself secure from search it may be so 
but in any other country this tale goblins
which is flying about would bring down priests
and ministers justice to examine the reality 
the stormy and mobs idle people to satisfy their
curiosity
 respecting the first sir we hope and understand
that colonel everard's influence will prevent
any immediate inquiry for the sake preserving
undisturbed the peace his uncle's family
 and as for any one coming without some sort
 authority the whole neighbours have much
love and fear my father and are besides so
horribly alarmed about the goblins woodstock
that fear will silence curiosity
on the whole then said charles the
chances safety seem to be in favour the plan
we have adopted which is all i can hope for in a
condition where absolute safety is out the question
the bishop recommended dr rochechffe as
one the most ingenious boldest and most loyal
sons the church england you albert lee
have marked your fidelity by a hundred proofs
to you and your local knowledge i submit mywoodstock

self and now prepare our arms alive i will
not be taken yet i will not believe that a son
 the king england and heir her throne
could be destined to danger in his own palace
and under the guard the loyal lees
albert lee laid pistols and swords in readiness
by the king's bed and his own and charles
after some slight apology took his place in the
large and better bed with a sigh pleasure as
from one who had not lately enjoyed such an indulgence
he bid good night to his faithful attendant
who deposited himself in his truckle and
both monarch and subject were soon fast asleep
 woodto k
chapter x
give sir nicholas throlkeld praise 
hear it good man old in days
thou tree succour and rest
to this young bird that was distress'd 
beneath thy branches he did stay 
and he was free to sport and play
when falcons were abroad for prey
wordsworth
the fugitive prince slept in spite danger
with the profound repose which youth and fatigue
inspire but the young cavalier his guide and
guardsmen a more restless night starting from
time to time and listening anxious notwithstanding
doctor rochccliffes assurances to procure yet
more particular knowledge concerning the state
 things around them than he had been yet able
to collect
he arose early after daybreak but although
he moved with as little noise as was possible the
woodstock 
slumbers the haunted prince were easily disturbed
he started up in his bed and asked if
there was any alarm
none please your majesty replied lee 
only thinking on the questions your majesty
was asking last night and the various chances
there are your majesty's safety being endangered
from unforeseen accidents i thought 
going thus early both to communicate with doctor
rochecliffe and to keep such a lookout as
befits the place where are lodged for the time the
fortunes england i fear i must request 
your majesty for your own gracious security
that you have the goodness to condescend to secure
the door with your own hand after i go out
oh talk not to majesty for heaven's sake
dear albert answered the poor king endeavouring
in vain to put a part his clothes in order
to traverse the room when a king's doublet
and hose are so ragged that he can no more find
his way into them than he could have travelled
through the forest deane without a guide good
faith there should be an majesty until it
chances to be better accommodated besides there
 woodstock
is the chance these big words bolting out at
unawares when there are ears to hear them whom
we might think dangerous
your commands shall be obeyed said lee
who had now succeeded in opening the door from
which he took his departure leaving the king
who had hustled along the floor for that purpose
with his dress woefully ill arranged to make it fast
again behind him and begging his majesty in no
case to open to any one unless he or rochecliffe
were the party who summoned him
albert then set out in quest doctor s
apartment which was only known to himself
and the faithfuljoliffe and had at different times
accommodated that steady churchman with a place
 concealment when from his bold and busy temper
which led him into the most extensive and
hazardous machinations on the king's behalf he
had been strictly sought after by the opposite party
 late the inquest after him had died entirely
away as he had prudently withdrawn himself
from the scene his intrigues since the loss 
the battle worcester he had been afloat again
and more active than ever and had by friends
woodstock 
and correspondents and especially the bishop 
been the means directing the king's flight
towards woodstock although it was not until the
very day his arrival that he could promise him
a safe reception at that ancient mansion
albert lee though he revered both the undaunted
spirit and ready resources the bustling
and undertaking churchman felt he had not been
enabled by him to answer some the king's questions
yesternight in a way so distinct as one trusted
with the king's safety ought to have done and
it was now his object to make himself personally
acquainted if possible with the various bearings
 so weighty a matter as became a man on whom 
so much the responsibility wa likely to descend
even his local knowledge was scarce adequate
to find the doctor's secret apartment had he not
traced his way after a genial flavour roasted
game through divers blind passages and up and
down certain very useless stairs through cupboards
and hatchways and so forth to a species
 sanctum sanatorium where joceline joliffe
was ministering to the good doctor a solemn
breakfast wildfowl with a cup small beer
 woodstock
stirred with a sprig rosemary which doctor
rochecliffe preferred to all strong potations beside
him sat bevis on his tail slobbering and looking
amiable moved by the rare smell the breakfast
which had quite overcome his native dignity
 disposition
the chamber in which the doctor had established
himself was a little octangular room with walls
 great thickness within which were fabricated
various issues leading in different directions and
communicating with different parts the building
around him were packages with arms and near
him one small barrel as it seemed gunpowder
 many papers in different parcels and several
keys for correspondence in cypher two or three
scrolls covered with hieroglyphics were also beside
him which albert took for plans nativity and
various models machinery in which doctor
rochecliffe was an adept there were also tools
 various kinds masks cloaks and a dark lantern
and a number other indescribable trinkets
belonging to the trade a daring plotter
in dangerous times last there was a casket
with gold and silver coin different countries
woodstock 
which was left carelessly open as if it were the
least doctor rochecliffes concern although
his habits in general announced narrow circumstances
if not actual poverty close by the divine's
plate lay a bible and prayerbook with some
proof sheets as they are technically called seemingly
fresh from the press there was also within
the reach his hand a dirk or scottish poniard
a powderhorn and a musketoon or blunderbuss
with a pair handsome pocketpistols in the
midst this miscellaneous collection the doctor
sat eating his breakfast with great appetite as
little dismayed by the various implements danger
around him as a workman is when accustomed
to the perils a gunpowder manufactory
soh young gentleman he said getting up
and extending his hand are you come to breakfast
with me in good fellowship or to spoil my
meal this morning as you did my supper last
night by asking untimely questions 
i will pick a bone with you with all my
heart said albert and if you please doctor
i would ask some questions which seem not
quite untimely
 woodstock
so saying he sat down and assisted the doctor
in giving a very satisfactory account a brace
 wild ducks and a leash teal bevis who
maintained his place with great patience and insinuation
had his share a collop which was also
placed on the wellfurnished board for like most
highbred dogs he declined eating waterfowl
come hither then albert lee said the
doctor laying down his knife and fork and plucking
the towel from his throat so soon as joceline
was withdrawn thou art still the same lad thou
wert when i was thy tutor never satisfied with
having got a grammar rule but always persecuting
me with questions why the rule stood so and not
otherwise over curious after information which
thou could'st not comprehend as bevis hungered
and whined for the duckwing which he could not
eat
i hope you will find me more reasonable
doctor answered albert and at the same
time that you will recollect i am not now stibjh
rtda but am placed in circumstances where i am
not at liberty to act upon the ipse dixit any
wooitoic 
man unless my own judgment be convinced 
shall deserve richly to be hanged drawn and
quartered should any misfortune happen by my
misgovernment in this business
and it is therefore albert that i would
have thee trust the whole to me without interfering
thou mayest forsooth thou art not sub ferula
 but recollect that while you have been fighting
in the field i have been plotting in the study
that i know all the combinations the king's
friends ay and all the motions his enemies as
well as a spider knows every mesh his web
think my experience man not a cavalier in
the land but has heard rochecliite the plotter
i have been a main limb in everything that has
been attempted since fortytwo penned declarations
conducted correspondence communicated
with chiefs recruited followers commissioned
arms levied money appointed rendezvous i was
in the western rising and before that in the
city petition and in sir john owen's stir in
wales in short almost in every plot for the king
since tomkins and challenger's matter
but were not all these plots unsuccessful 
vol r
 woodstock
gait albert and were not tomkins and challenger
hanged doctor 
yes my young friend answered the doctor
gravely as many others have been with whom
i have acted but only because they did not follow
my advice implicitly you never heard that i
was hanged myself
the time may come doctor said albert 
the pitcher goes oft to the well the proverb
as my father would say is somewhat musty but
i too have some confidence in my own judgement
 and much as i honour the church i cannot
altogether subscribe to passive obedience i
will tell you in one word what points i must have
explanation on and it will remain with you to
give it or to return a message to the king that
you will not explain your plan in which case if
he acts by my advice he will leave woodstock
and resume his purpose getting to the coast
without delay
well then thou suspicious monster make
thy demands and if they be such as i can answer
without betraying confidence i will reply to
them
woodstock 
 in the first place then what is all this story
about ghosts and witchcraft and apparitions 
and do you consider it as safe for his majesty to
stay in a house subject to such visitations real or
pretended 
you must be satisfied with my answer in verba
sacerdotal the circumstances you allude to will
not give the least annoyance to woodstock during
the king's residence i cannot explain farther
 but for this i will be bound at the risk 
my neck
then said lee we must take the doctor
for bail that the devil will keep the peace towards
our sovereign lord the king good now there
lurked about this house the greater part yesterday
and perhaps slept here a fellow called tompkins
 a bitter independent and a secretary or
something qr other to the regicide dog desborough
the man is well known a wild ranter
in religious opinions but in private affairs farsighted
cunning and interested even as any
rogue them all
be assured we will avail ourselves his crazy
fanaticism to mislead his wicked cunning s
woodstock
child may lead a hog if it has wit to fasten a cord
to the ring in its nose replied the doctor
you may be deceived said albert the
age has many such as this fellow whose views 
the spiritual and temporal world are so different
that they resemble the eyes a squinting man 
one which oblique and distorted sees nothing
but the his nose while the other instead 
partaking the same defect views strongly sharply
and acutely whatever is subjected to its scrutiny
but we will put a patch on the better eye
said the doctor and he shall only be allowed to
speculate with the imperfect optic you must
know this fellow has always seen the greatest
number and the most hideous apparitions he
has not the courage a cat in such matters
though stout enough when he hath temporal antagonists
before him i have placed him under
the charge joceline joliffe who betwixt plying
him with sack and ghoststories would make
him incapable knowing what was done if you
were to proclaim the king in his presence
but why keep such a fellow here at all 
oh sir content you he lies leaguer as a
woodstock 
sort ambassador for his worthy masters and
we are secure from any intrusion so long as they
get all the news woodstock from trusty tompkins

i know joceline's honesty well said albert 
and if he can assure me that he will keep a
watch over this fellow i will so far trust in him
he does not know the depth the stake tis
true but that my life is concerned will be quite
enough to keep him vigilant well then i proceed
 what if markham everard comes down
til
on us r
we have his word to the contrary answered
rochecliife his word honour transmitted
by his friend do you think it likely he will
break it r
i hold him incapable doing so answered
albert andbesides i think markham would
make no bad use anything which might come
to his knowledge yet god forbid we should be
under the necessity trusting any who ever wore
the parliament's colours in a matter such dear
concernment 
amen said the doctor are your doubts
silenced now 
 woodstock
i still have an objection said albert to
yonder impudent rakehelly fellow styling himself
a cavalier who pushed himself on our company
last night and gained my father's heart by
a story the storm brentford which i daresay
the rogue never saw
you mistake him dear albert roger wildrake
although till late i only knew him byname
is a gentleman was bred at the inns 
court and spent his estate in the king's service
or rather in the devil's service said albert
it is such fellows as he who sunk from the license
 their military habits into idle debauched
ruffians infest the land with riots and robberies
brawl in hedge alehouses and cellars where strong
waters are sold at midnight and with their deep
oaths their hot loyalty and their drunken valour
make decent men abominate the very name
 cavalier
alas said the doctor it is but too true 
but what can you expect when the higher and
more qualified classes are broken down and mingled
undistinguishable with the lower orders they are
apt to lose the most valuable marks their quawoodstock

city in the general confusion morals and manners
 just as a handful silver medals will become
defaced and discoloured if jumbled about
among the vulgar copper coin even the prime
medal all which we royalists would so willingly
wear next our very hearts has not perhaps entirely
escaped some deterioration but let other
tongues than mine speak on that subject
albert lee paused deeply after having heard
these communications on the part rochecliffe
 doctor he said it is generally agreed
even by some who think you may occasionally
have been a little over busy in putting men upon
dangerous actions 
may god forgive them who entertain so
false an opinion me said the doctor
that nevertheless you have done and
suffered more in the king's behalf than any man
 your function
they do me but justice there said doctor
rochecliffe absolute justice
i am therefore disposed to abide by your
opinion if all things considered you think it
safe that we should remain at woodstock
 woodstock
that is not the question answered the
divine
and what is the question then replied the
young soldier
whether any safer course can be pointed
out i grieve to say that the question must be
comparative as to the point option absolute
safety is alas the while out the question on
all sides now i say woodstock is fenced and
guarded as at present by far the most preferable
place concealment
enough i give up to you the question as
to a person whose knowledge such important
affairs not to mention your age and experience is
more intimate and extensive than mine can be
you do well answered rochecliffe and
if others had acted with the like distrust their
own knowledge and confidence in competent persons
it had been better for the age this makes
understanding bar himself up within his fortalice
and wit betake himself to his high tower here
he looked around his cell with an air selfcomplacence
 the wise man foreteeth the tempest
and lieth himsclk
woodstock 
doctor said albert let our foresight serve
others far more precious than either us let
me ask you if you have well considered whether
our precious charge should remain in society with
the family or betake himself to some the more
hidden corners the house 
hum i think he will be safest as louis
kerneguy keeping himself close beside you 
i fear it will be necessary that i scout abroad
a little and show myself in some distant part 
the country lest coming here in quest me
they should find higher game
pray do not interrupt me keeping himself
close beside you or your father in or near to
victor lee's apartment from which you are aware
he can make a ready escape should danger approach
 this occurs to me as best for the present
 i hope to hear the vessel today tomorrow
at farthest
albert lee bid the active but opinionated man
good morrow admiring how this species intrigue
had become a sort element in which the
doctor seemed to enjoy himself notwithstanding
all that the poet has said concerning the horrors
fi woodstock
which intervene betwixt the conception and execution
 a conspiracy
in returning from doctor rochecliffe's sanctuary
he met with eocene who was anxiously seeking
him the young scotch gentleman he said
in a mysterious manner has arisen from bed
and hearing me pass he called me into his apartment

well replied albert i will see him presently

and he asked me for fresh linen and clothes
now sir he is like a man who is quite accustomed
to be obeyed so i gave him a suit which happened
to be in a wardrobe in the west tower and
some your linen to conform and when he was
dressed he commanded me to show him to the
presence sir henry lee and my young lady
i would have said something sir about waiting
till you came back but he pulled me goodnaturedly
by the hair as indeed he has a rare
humour his own and told me he was guest to
master albert lee and not his prisoner so
sir though i thought you might be displeased
withme for giving him the means stirring
woodstock 
abroad and perhaps being seen by those who
should not see him what could i say 
you are a sensible fellow joceline and
comprehend always what is recommended to you
this youth will not be controlled i fear
by either us but we must look the closer
after his safety you keep your watch over that
prying fellow the steward 
trust him to my care on that side have no
fear but ah sir i would we had the young
scot in his old clothes again for the ridingsuit
 yours which he now wears hath set him off in
otherguess fashion
from the manner in which the faithful dependent
expressed himself albert saw that he suspected
who the scottish page in reality was yet
he did not think it proper to acknowledge to
him a fact such importance secure as he was
equally his fidelity whether explicitly trusted
to the full extent or left to his own conjectures
full anxious thought he went to the apartment
 victor lee in which joliife told him he
would find the party assembled the sound 
laughter as he laid his hand on the lock the
 woodstock
door almost made him start so singularly did it
jar with the doubtful and melancholy reflections
which engaged his own mind he entered and
found his father in high good humour laughing
and conversing freely with his young charge whose
appearance was indeed so much changed to the
better in externals that it seemed scarce possible
a night's rest a toilette and a suit decent
clothes could have done so much in his favour in
so short a time it could not however be imputed
to the mere alteration dress although that no
doubt had its effect there was nothing splendid
in that which louis kerneguy we continue to call
him by his assumed name now wore it was
merely a ridingsuit grey cloth with seme silver
lace in the fashion a country gentleman 
the time but it happened to fit him very welland
to become his very dark complexion especially
as he now held up his head and used the
manners not only a wellbehaved but a 
gentleman when he moved
his clumsy and awkward limp was exchanged fora
sort shuffle which as it might be the consequence
 a wound in those perilous times had
woodstock 
rather an interesting than an ungainly effect at
least it was as genteel an expression that the party
had been overheard travelled as the most polite
pedestrian could propose to himself
the features the wanderer were harsh as
ever but his red shock peruke for such it proved
was laid aside his sable elflocks were trained
by a little joceline's assistance into curls and
his fine black eyes shone from among the shade
 these curls and corresponded with the animated
though not handsome character the whole
head in his conversation he had laid aside
all the coarseness dialect which he had so
strongly affected on the preceding evening and
although he continued to speak a little scotch
for the support his character as a young gentleman
 that nation yet it was not in a degree
which either rendered his speech uncouth
or unintelligible but merely afforded a certain
doric tinge essential to the personage he represented
no person on earth could better understand
the society in which he moved exile had
made him acquainted with life in all its shades
and varieties his spirits if not uniform were
 woodstock
elastic he had that species epicurean philosophy
which even in the most extreme difficulties
and dangers can in an interval ease avail
itself the enjoyments the moment he was
in short in youth and misfortune as afterwards
in his regal condition a goodhumoured but hardhearted
voluptuary wise save where his passions
intervened beneficent save when prodigality
had deprived him the means or prejudice 
the wish to confer benefits his faults such as
might often have drawn down hatred but that
they were mingled with so much urbanity that
the injured person felt it impossible to retain the
full sense his wrongs
albert lee found the party consisting his
father sister and the supposed page seated by
the breakfast table at which he also took his
place he was a pensive and anxious beholder
 what passed while the page who had already
completely gained the heart the good old cavalier
by mimicking the manner in which the
scotch divines preached in favour ma gude
lord marquis argyle and the solemn league
and covenant was now endeavouring to interest
woodstock j
the fair alice by such anecdotes partly warlike
and perilous adventure as possessed the same degree
 interest for the female ear which they have
had ever since desdemona's days but it was not
only dangers by land and sea that the disguised
page spoke but much more and much oftener on
foreign revels banquets balls where the pride 
france spain or the low countries was exhibited
in the eyes their most eminent beauties
alice being a very young girl who in consequence
 the civil war had been almost entirely educated
in the country and often in great seclusion
it was certainly no wonder that she should listen
with willing ears and a ready smile to what the
young gentleman their guest and her brother's protege
told with so much gaiety and mingled with
such a shade dangerous adventure and occasionally
 serious reflection as prevented the discourse
from being regarded as merely light and frivolous
in a word sir henry lee laughed alice
smiled from time to time and au were well satisfied
but albert who would himself however have
been scarce able to allege a sufficient reason for
his depression spirits
 woodstock
the materials breakfast were at last removed
under the active superintendence the neathanded
phoebe who looked over her shoulder
and lingered more than once to listen to the
fluent discourse their new guest whom on the
preceding evening she had while in attendance
at supper accounted one the most stupid inmates
to whom the gates woodstock had been
opened since the times fair rosamond
louis kerneguy then when they were left only
four in the chamber without the interruption 
domestics and the successive bustle occasioned by
the discussion and removal the morning meal
became apparently sensible that his friend and
ostensible patron albert ought not altogether to
be suffered to drop to leeward in the conversation
while he was himself successfully engaging
the attention those members his family to
whom he had become so recently known he went
behind his chair therefore and leaning on the
back said with a goodhumoured tone which
made his purpose entirely intelligible
either my good friend guide and patron has
heard worse news this morning than he cares to
woods rock 
tell us or he must liavo stumbled over my tattered
jerkin and leathern hose and acquired by
contact the whole mass stupidity which i threw
off last night with those most dolorous garments
cheer up my dear colonel albert if your affectionate
page may presume to say so you are in
company with those whose society dear to strangers
must be doubly so to you odd's fish man
cheer up i have seen you gay on a biscuit and
a mouthful watercresses don't let your heart
fail you on rhenish wine and venison
dear louis said albert rousing himself
into exertion and somewhat ashamed his own
silence i heave slept worse and been astir earlier
than you
be it so said his father yet i hold it no
good excuse for your sullen silence albert you
have met your sister and me so long separated
from you so anpious on your behalf almost like
mere strangers and yet you are returned safe tous
and you find us well
returned indeed but for safety my dear
father that word must be a stranger to us wore
it s
jilt woodstock
cestcr folks for some time however it is not my
own safety about which i am anxious
 abovit whose then should you be anxious
all accounts agree that the king is safe out 
the dogs jaws
not without some danger though muttered
louis thinking his encounter with bevis on
the preceding evening
no not without danger echoed the knight 
 but as old avill says 
there's such divinity doth hedje a king
that treason dares not peep at what it would
no no thank god that's cared for our hope
and fortune is escaped so all news affirm escaped
from bristol if i thought otherwise albert
i should be as sad as you are for the rest it
i have lurked a month in this house when discovery
would have been death and that is no longer
since than after lord holland and the duke 
buckingham's rising at kingston and hang me
if i thought once twisting my brow into such
ft tragic fold as yours but cocked my hat at misfortune

would be to assure colonel albert lee that i
verily believe the king would think his own hap
wherever he may be much the worse that his best
subjects were seized with dejection on his account
you answer boldly on the king's part young
man said sir henry
oh my father was meikle about the king's
hand answered louis recollecting his present
character
no wonder then said sir henry that
you have so soon recovered your good spirits and
good breeding when you heard his majesty's
escape why you are no more like the lad we
saw last night than the best hunter i ever had was
like a drayhorse
oh there is much in rest and food and
grooming answered louis you would hardly
know the tired jade you dismounted from last
night when she is brought out prancing and neighing
the next morning rested refreshed and ready
to start again especially if the brute hath some
good blood for such pick up unco fast
well then but since thy father was a courtier
and thou hast learned i think something rvf
 woodstock
the trade tell us a little master kerneguy about
him we love most to hear about the king we are
all safe and secret you need not be afraid he
was a hopeful youth i trust his flourishing blossom
now gives promise fruit 
as the knight spoke louis bent his eyes on
the ground and seemed at first uncertain what to
answer but admirable at extricating himself from
such dilemmas he replied that he really could
not presume to speak on such a subject in the
presence his patron colonel albert lee who
must be a much better judge the character 
king charles than he could pretend to be
albert was accordingly next assailed by the
knight seconded by alice for some account 
his majesty s character
i will speak but according to facts said
albert and then i must be acquitted partiality
if the king had not possessed enterprise
and military skill he never would have attempted
the expedition to worcester had he not had
personal courage he had not so long disputed the
battle that cromwell almost judged it lost that
he possesses prudence and patience must be arwoodstock

gucd from the circumstances attending his flight 
and that he has the love his subjects is evident
since necessarily known to many he has been betrayed
by none
for shame albert replied his sister is
that the way a good cavalier doles out the character
 his prince applying an instance at every
concession like a pedlar measuring linen with his
rod out upon you no wonder you were beaten
if you fought as coldly for your king as yoi
now talk for him
i did my best to trace a likeness from what i
have seen and known the original sister alice
replied her brother if you would have a fancy
portrait you must get an artist more imagination
than i have to draw it for you
i will be that artist myself said alice and
in my portrait our monarch shall show all that he
ought to be having such high pretensions all
that he must be being so loftily descended all
that i am sure he is and that every loyal heart
in the kingdom ought to believe him
 well said alice quoth the old knight
 woodstock
look thou upon this picture and on this 
here is our young friend shall judge i wager my
best nag that is i would wager him had i one
left that alice proves the better painter the
two my son's brain is still misty i think since
his defeat he has not got the smoke worcester
out it plague on thee a young man and
cast down for one beating had you been banged
twenty times like me it had been time to look
grave but come alice forward the colours are
mixed on your pallet forward with something
that shall show like one vandyke's living portraits
placed beside the dull dry presentation
there our ancestor victor lee
alice it must be observed had been educated
by her father in the notions high and even exaggerated
loyalty which characterized the cavaliers
and she was really an enthusiast in the royal
cause but besides she was in good spirits at her
brother's happy return and wished to prolong
the gay humour in which her father had late
scarcely ever indulged
well then she said though i am no apel
woodstock q
les i will try to paint an alexander such as i
hope and am determined to believe exists in the
person our exiled sovereign soon i trust to
be restored and i will not go farther than his
own family he shall have all the chivalrous
courage all the warlike skill henry france
his grandfather in order to place him on the
throne all his benevolence love his people
patience even unpleasing advice sacrifice 
his own wishes and pleasures to the commonweal
that seated there he may be blest while living
and so long remembered when dead that for ages
after it shall be thought sacrilege to breathe an
aspersion against the throne which he has occupied
 long after he is dead while there remains
an old man who has seen him were the condition
 that survivor no higher than a groom or a
menial his age shall be provided for at the public
charge and his gray hairs regarded with more
distinction than an ears coronet because he remembers
the second charles the monarch 
every heart in england 
while alice spoke she was hardly conscious
 the presence any one save her father and
 woodstock
brother for the page withdrew himself somewhat
from the circle and there was nothing to remind
her him she gave the reins therefore to her
enthusiasm and as the tears glittered in her eye
and her beautiful features became animated she
seemed like a descended cherub proclaiming the
virtues a patriot monarch the person chiefly
interested in her description held himself back as
we have said and concealed his own features yet
so as to preserve a full view the beautiful
speaker
albert lee conscious in whose presence this
eulogium was pronounced was much embarrassed
 but his father all whose feelings were flattered
by the panegyric was in rapture
so much for the king alice he said and
now for the mem
for the man replied alice in the same tone
need wish him more than the paternal virtues
 his unhappy father whom his worst enemies
have recorded that if moral virtues and religious
faith were to be selected as the qualities which
merited a crown no man could plead the possession
 them in a higher or more indisputable dcwoodstock

grec temperate wise and frugal yet munificent
in rewarding merit a friend to letters and
the muses but a severe discourager the misuse
 such gifts a worthy gentleman a kind master
 the best friend the best father the best
christian her voice began to falter and
her father's handkerchief was already at his eyes
he was girl he was exclaimed sir henry 
but no more on't i charge ye no more on't
enough let his son but possess his virtues with
better advisers and better fortunes and he will
be all that england in her warmest wishes could
desire
there was a pause after this for alice felt as
if she had spoken too frankly and too zealously
for her sex and youth sir henry was occupied
in melancholy recollections on the fate his late
sovereign while kerneguy and his supposed patron
felt embarrassed perhaps from a consciousness
that the real charles fell far short his ideal
character as designed in such glowing colours in
some cases exaggerated or inappropriate praise
becomes the most severe satire
 woodstock
but such reflections were not a nature to belong
willingly cherished by the person to whom
they might have been great advantage he assumed
a tone raillery which is perhaps the
readiest mode escaping from the feelings selfreproof
 every cavalier he said should
bend his knee to thank mistress alice lee for
having made such a flattering portrait the king
their master by laying under contribution for his
benefit the virtues all his ancestors only there
was one point he would not have expected a female
painter to have passed over in silence when she
made him in right his grandfather and father
a muster royal and individual excellencies why
could she not have endowed him at the same time
with his mother's personal charms why should
not the son henrietta maria the finest woman
 her day add the recommendations a
handsome face and figure to his internal e
vxl u
 woodstock
come very imminent he was glad therefore 
comparative repose and comparative safety
then it must be considered that charles had
been entirely reconciled to the society at woodstock
since he had become better acquainted with
it he had seen that to interest the beautiful
alice and procure a great deal her company
nothing more was necessary than to submit to the
humours and cultivate the intimacy the old
cavalier her father a few bouts at fencing in
which charles took care not to put out his more
perfect skill and full youthful strength and activity
 the endurance a few scenes from shakspeare
which the knight read with more zeal than
taste a little skill in music in which the old
man had been a proficient the deference paid to
a few oldfashioned opinions at which he laughed
in his sleeve were allsufficient to gain for the
disguised prince an interest in sir henry lee
and to conciliate in an equal degree the goodwill
 his lovely daughter
never were two young persons who could be
said to commence this species intimacy with
such unequal advantages charles was a liberwoodstock

tine who if he did not in cold blood resolve upon
prosecuting his passion for auce to a dishonourable
conclusion was at every moment liable
to be provoked to attempt the strength a virtue
in which he was no believer then auce on her
part hardly knew even what was implied by the
word libertine or seducer her mother had died
early in the commencement the civil war and
she had been bred up chiefly with her brother and
cousin so that she had an unfearing and unsuspicious
frankness manner upon which charles
was not unwilling or unlikely to put a construction
favourable to his own views even alice's
love for her cousin the first sensation which
awakens the most innocent and simple mind to
feelings shyness and restraint towards the male
sex in general had failed to awaken such an
alarm in her bosom they were nearly related 
and everard though young was several years
her elder and had from her infancy been an
object her respect as well as her affection
when this early and childish intimacy ripened
into youthful love confessed and returned still
it differed in some shades from the passion exists
woodstock
ing between lovers originally strangers to each
other until their affections have been united in the
ordinary course courtship their love was
fonder more familiar more perfectly confidential 
purer too perhaps and more free from starts 
passionate violence or apprehensive jealousy
the possibility that any one could have attempted
to rival everard in her affection was a
circumstance which never occurred to alice and
that this singular scottish lad whom she laughed
with on account his humour and laughed
at for his peculiarities should be an object 
danger or caution never once entered her
imagination the sort intimacy to which she
admitted kerneguy was the same to which she
would have received a companion her own sex
whose manners she did not always approve but
whose society she found amusing
it was natural that the freedom alice lee's
conduct which arose from the most perfect indifference
should pass for something approaching
to encouragement in the royal gallant's apprehension
and that any resolutions he had formed
against being tempted to violate the hospitality
woodstock 
 woodstock should begin to totter as opportunities
for doing so became more frequent
these opportunities were favoured by albert's
departure from woodstock the very day after his
arrival it had been agreed in full council with
charles and rochecliffe that lee should go to
visit his uncle everard in the county kent
and by showing himself there should obviate
any cause suspicion which might arise from
his residence at woodstock and remove any pretext
for disturbing his father's family on account
 their harbouring one who had been so lately
in arms he had also undertaken at his own
great personal risk to visit different points on the
seacoast and ascertain the security different
places for providing shipping for the king's leaving
england
these circumstances were alike calculated to
procure the king's safety and facilitate his escape
but alice was thereby deprived the presence
 her brother who would have been her most
watchful guardian but who had set down the
king's light talk upon a former occasion to the
gaiety his humour and would have thought
 woodstock
he had done his sovereign great injustice had
he seriously suspected him such a breach 
hospitality as a dishonourable pursuit alice
would have implied
there were however two the household at
woodstock who appeared not so entirely reconciled
with louis kerneguy or his purposes the
one was bevis who seemed from their first unfriendly
rencontre to have kept up a pique against
their new guest which no advances on the part 
charles were able to soften if the page was
by chance left alone with his young mistress bevis
chose always to be the party came close
by alice's chair and growled audibly when the
gallant drew near her it is a pity said the
disguised prince that your bevis is not a bulldog
that we might dub him a roundhead at
once he is too handsome too noble too aristocratic
to nourish those inhospitable prejudices
against a poor houseless cavalier i am convinced
the spirit pym or hampden has transmigrated
into the rogue and continues to demonstrate
his hatred against royalty and all its adherents

wojstock 
alice would then reply that bevis was loyal
in word and deed and only partook her father's
prejudices against the scots which she could not
but acknowledge were tolerably strong
nay then said the supposed louis i
must find some other reason for i cannot allow
sir bevis's resentment to rest upon national antipathy
so we will suppose that some gallant
cavalier who wended to the wars and never returned
has adopted this shape to look back upon
the haunts he left so unwillingly and is jealous
at seeing even poor louis kerneguy drawing near
to the lady his lost affections he approached
her chair as he spoke and bevis gave one 
his deep growls
 in that case you had best keep your distance
said alice laughing for the bite a
dog possessed by the ghost a jealous lover
cannot be very safe and the king carried on
the dialogue in the same strain which while it
led alice to apprehend nothing more serious
than the apish gallantry a fantastic boy certainly
induced the supposed louis kerneguy to
think that he had made one those conquests
 woodstock
which often and easily fall to the share sovereigns
notwithstanding the acuteness his apprehension
he was not sufficiently aware that
the royal road to female favour is only open to
monarch s when they travel in grand costume and
that when they woo incognito their path courtship
is liable to the same windings and obstacles
which obstruct the course private individuals
there was besides bevis another member 
the family who kept a lookout upon louis
kerneguy and with no friendly eye phoebe
mayflower though her experience extended not
beyond the sphere the village yet knew the
world much better than her mistress and besides
she was five years older more knowing
she was more suspicious she thought that oddlooking
scotch boy made more up to her young
mistress than was proper for his condition 
life and moreover that alice gave him a little
more encouragement than parthenon would have
afforded to any such jackadandy in the absence
 aratus for the volume treating the
loves these celebrated arcadian was then the
woodstock 
favourite study swains and damsels throughout
merry england entertaining such suspicions
phoebe was at a loss how to conduct herself
on the occasion and yet resolved she would
not see the slightest chance the course colonel
everard's true love being obstructed without
attempting a remedy she had a peculiar
favour for markham herself and moreover he
was according to her phrase as handsome and
personable a young man as was in oxfordshire 
and this scotch scarecrow was no more to be
compared to him than chalk was to cheese and
yet she allowed that master girnigy had a wonderfully
welloiled tongue and that such gallants
were not to be despised what was to be done 
she had no facts to offer only vague suspicion 
and was afraid to speak to her mistress whose
kindness great as it was did not nevertheless
encourage familiarity
she sounded joceline but he was she knew
not why so deeply interested about this unlucky
lad and held this importance so high that she
could make no impression on him to speak
to the old knight would have been to raic a gc
 woodstock
neral tempest the worthy chaplain who was at
woodstock grand referee on all disputed matters
would have been the damsels most natural resource
for he was peaceful as well as moral by
profession and politic by practice but it happened
he had given phoebe unintentional offence
by speaking her under the classical epithet 
rustica fidele the which epithet as she understood
it not she held herself bound to resent as
contumelious and declaring she was not fonder 
a fiddle than other folks had ever since shunned
all intercourse with doctor rochecliffe which she
could easily avoid
master tomkins was always coming and going
about the house under various pretexts but he
was a roundhead and she was too true to the cavaliers
to introduce any the enemy as parties
to their internal discords besides he had talked
to phoebe herself in a manner which induced her
to decline everything in the shape familiarity
with him lastly cavaliers wildrake might have
been consulted but phoebe had her own reasons
for saying as she did with some emphasis that
cavaliers wildrake was an impudent london
woodstock 
rake at length she resolved to communicate
her suspicions to the party having most interest
in verifying or confuting them
i'll let master markham everard know that
there is a wasp buzzing about his honeycombs
said phoebe and moreover that i know that
this young scotch scapegrace shifted himself out
 a woman's into a man's dress at goody green's
and gave goody green's dolly a goldpiece to say
nothing about it and no more she did to anyone
but me and she knows best herself whether
she gave change for the gold or not but master
louis is a saucy jackanapes and like enough
to ask it
three or four days elapsed while matters continued
in this condition the disguised prince
sometimes thinking on the intrigue which fortune
seemed to have thrown in his way for his
amusement and taking advantage such opportunities
as occurred to increase his intimacy with
alice lee but much oftener harassing doctor
rochecliffe with questions about the possibility
 escape which the good man finding himself unable
to answer secured his leisure against royal
 woodstock
importunity by retreating into the various unexplored
recesses the lodge known perhaps
only to himself who had been for nearly a score
 years employed in writing the wonders 
avoid stock
it chanced on the fourth day that some trifling
circumstance had called the knight abroad 
and he had left the young scotchman now familiar
in the family alone with alice in the parlour
 victor lee thus situated he thought the
time not unpropitious for entering upon a strain
 gallantry a kind which might be called experimental
such as is practised by the croats in
skirmishing when they keep bridle in hand ready
to attack the enemy or canter off without coming
to close quarters as circumstances may recommend
after using for nearly ten minutes a
sort metaphysical jargon which might according
to ahces pleasure have been interpreted
either into gallantry or the language serious
pretension and when he supposed her engaged
in fathoming his meaning he had the mortification
to find by a single and brief question that
he had been totally unattended to and that alice
woodstock 
was thinking on anything at the moment rather
than the sense what he had been saying she
asked him if he could tell what it was o'clock
and this with an air real curiosity concerning
the lapse time which put coquetry wholly out
 the question
i will go look at the sundial mistress
alice said the gallant rising and colouring
through a sense the contempt with which he
thought himself treated
you will do me a pleasure master kerneguy
said alice without the least consciousness
 the indignation she had excited
master louis kerneguy left the room accordingly
not however to procure the information
required but to vent his anger and mortification
and to swear with more serious purpose than he
had dared to do before that alice should rue
her insolence goodnatured as he was he was
still a prince unaccustomed to contradiction far
less to contempt and his self pride felt for the
moment wounded to the quick with a hasty
step he plunged into the chase only remembering
his own safety so far as to choose the deeper
 woodstock
and sequestered avenues where walking on with
the speedy and active step which his recovery
from fatigue now permitted him to exercise according
to his wont he solaced his angry purposes
by devising schemes revenge on the
insolent country coquette from which no consideration
 hospitality was in future to have
weight enough to save her
the irritated gallant passed
the dialstone aged and green
without deigning to ask it a single question nor
could it have satisfied his curiosity if he had for
no sun happened to shine at the moment he
then hastened forward muffling himself in his
cloak and assuming a stooping and slouching
gait which diminished his apparent height he
was soon involved in the deep and dim alleys 
the wood into which he had insensibly plunged
himself and was traversing it at a great rate
without having any distinct idea in what direction
he was going when suddenly his course was
arrested first by a loud hollo and then by a
summons to stand accompanied by what seemed
woodstock 
still more startling and extraordinary the touch
 a cane upon his shoulder imposed in a goodhumoured
but somewhat imperious manner
there were few symptoms recognition which
would have been welcome at this moment but
the appearance the person who had thus arrested
his course was least all that he could
have anticipated as timely or agreeable when he
turned on receiving the signal he beheld himself
close to a young man nearly six feet in height
well made in joint and limb but the gravity 
whose apparel although handsome and gentlemanlike
and a sort precision in his habit
from the cleanness and stiffness his band to
the unsullied purity his spanish leather shoes
bespoke a love order which was foreign to the
impoverished and vanquished cavaliers and proper
to the habits those the victorious party
who could afford to dress themselves handsomely 
and whose rule that is such as regarded the
higher and more respectable classes enjoined
decency and sobriety garb and deportment
there was yet another weight against the prince
in the scale and one still more characteristic 
 woodstock
the inequality in the comparison under which he
seemed to labour there was strength in the
muscular form the stranger who had brought
him to this involuntary parley authority and determination
in his brow a long rapier on the left
and a poniard or dagger on the right side his
belt and a pair pistols stuck into it which
would have been sufficient to give the unknown
the advantage louis kerneguy having no weapon
but his sword even had his personal strength
approached nearer than it did to that the person
by whom he was thus suddenly stopped
bitterly regretting the thoughtless fit passion
that brought him into his present situation
but especially the want the pistols he had left
behind and which do so much to place bodily
strength and weakness upon an equal footing
charles yet availed himself the courage and
presence mind in which few his unfortunate
family had for centuries been deficient he
stood firm and without motion his cloak still
wrapped round the lower part his face to
give time for explanation in case he was mistaken
for some other person
woodstock
this coolness produced its effect for the other
party said with doubt and surprise on his part
joceline johffe is it not if i know not jofeline
joliffe i should at least know my own
cloak
i am not joceline joliffe as you may see
sir said kerneguy calmly drawing himself
erect to show the difference size and dropping
the cloak from his face and person
indeed replied the stranger in surprise 
 then sir unknown i have to express my regret
at having used my cane in intimating that i
wished you to stop from that dress which i
certainly recognize for my own i concluded you
must be joceline in whose custody i had left my
habit at the lodge
if it had been joceline sir replied the
supposed kerneguy with perfect composure
methinks you should not have struck so hard
the other party was obviously confused by
the steady calmness with which he was encountered
the sense politeness dictated in the first
place an apology for a mistake when he thought
he had been tolerably certain the person masvol
 x
 woodstock
ter kerneguy was not in a situation to be punctilious
 he bowed gravely as indicating his acceptance
 the excuse offered then turned and
walked as he conceived towards the lodge
though he had traversed the woods which were
cut with various alleys in different directions too
hastily to be certain the real course which he
wished to pursue
he was much embarrassed to find that this
did not get him rid the companion whom he
had thus involuntarily acquired walked he
slow walked he fast his friend in the genteel
but puritanic habit strong in person and well
armed as we have described him seemed determined
to keep him company and without attempting
to join or enter into conversation never
suffered him to outstrip his surveillance for more
than two or three yards the wanderer mended
his pace but although he was then in his
youth as afterwards in his riper age one the
best walkers in britain the stranger without advancing
his pace to a run kept fully equal to
him and his persecution became so close and
constant and inevitable that the pride and fear
woodstock 
 charles were both alarmed and he began to
think that whatever the danger might be a
singlehanded rencontre he would nevertheless
have a better bargain this tall satellite if they
settled the debate betwixt them in the forest than
if they drew near any place habitation where
the man in authority was likely to find friends and
concurrence
betwixt anxiety therefore vexation and anger
charles faced suddenly round on his pursuer as
they reached a small narrow glade which led to
the little meadow over which presided the kmgs
oak the ragged and scathed branches and gigantic
trunk which formed a vista to the little
wild avenue
sir said he to his pursuer you have already
been guilty one piece impertinence
towards me you have apologised and knowing
no reason why you should distinguish me as an
object incivility i have accepted your excuse
without scruple is there anything remains to
be settled betwixt us which causes you to follow
me in this manner if so i shall be glad to make
it a subject explanation or satisfaction as the
 woodstock
case may admit i think you can owe me no
malice for i never saw you before to my knowledge
if you can give any good reason for asking
it i am willing to render you personal satisfaction
if your purpose is merely impertinent
curiosity i let you know that i will not suffer
myself to be dogged in my private walks by anyone

when i recognize my own cloak on another
man's shoulders replied the stranger drily
methinks i have a natural right to follow and
see what becomes it for know sir though i
have been mistaken as to the wearer yet i am
confident i had as good a right to stretch my cane
across the cloak you are muffled in as ever had
any one to brush his own garments if therefore
wg are to be friends i must ask for instance
how you came by that cloak and where you are
going with it i shall otherwise make bold to stop
you as one who has sufficient commission to do
so
oh unhappy cloak thought the wanderer
ay and thrice unhappy the idle fancy that sent
me here with it wrapped around my nose to pick
woodstock 
quarrels and attract observation when quiet and
secrecy were peculiarly essential to my safety 
if you will allow me to guess sir continued
the stranger who was no other than markham
everard i will convince you that you are better
known than you think for
now heaven forbid prayed the party addressed
in silence but with as much devotion as
ever he applied to a prayer in his life yet even
in this moment extreme urgency his courage
and composure did not fail and he recollected
it was the utmost importance not to seem startled
and to answer so as if possible to lead the
dangerous companion with whom he had met to
confess the extent his actual knowledge or suspicions
concerning him
if you know me sir he said and are a
gentleman as your appearance promises you
cannot be at a loss to what accident you must attribute
my wearing these clothes which you say
are yours
oh sir replied colonel everard his wrath
in no sort turned away by the mildness the
stranger's answer we have learned our ovid's
 woodstock
metamorphoses and we know for what purposes
young men quality travel in disguise we know
that even female attire is resorted to on certain
occasions we have heard vertumnus and
pomona
the monarch as he weighed these words
again uttered a devout prayer that this illlooking
affair might have no deeper root than the
jealousy some admirer alice lee promising
to himself that devotee as he was to the fair sex
he would make no scruple renouncing the
fairest eve's daughters in order to get out 
the present dilemma
sir he said you seem to be a gentleman
i have no objection to tell you as such that i also
am that class
or somewhat higher perhaps said everard

a gentleman is a term which comprehends
all ranks entitled to armorial bearings a duke
a lord a prince is no more than a gentleman 
and if in misfortune as i am he may be glad if
that general term courtesy is allowed him
sir replied everard i have no purpose
woodstock s
to entrap you to any acknowledgement fatal to
your own safety nor do i hold it my business
to be active in the arrest private individuals
whose perverted sense national duty may have
led them into errors rather to be pitied than
punished by candid men but if those who have
brought civil war and disturbance into their
native country proceed to carry dishonour and
disgrace into the bosom families if they attempt
to carry on their private debaucheries to
the injury the hospitable roofs which afford
them refuge from the consequences their public
crimes do you think ray lord that we shall
bear it with patience 
if it is your purpose to quarrel with me said
the prince speak it out at once like a gentleman
you have the advantage no doubt arras but
it is not that odds which will induce rae to fly
from a single man if on the other hand you
are disposed to hear reason i tell you in calm
words that i neither suspect the offence to which
you allude nor comprehend why you give me
the title ray lord
 woodstock
you deny then being the lord wilmot 
said everard
i may do so most safely said the prince
perhaps you rather style yourself earl 
rochester we heard that the issuing some
such patent by the king scots was a step which
your ambition proposed
neither lord nor earl am i as sure as i have
a christian soul to be saved my name is 
do not degrade yourself by unnecessary falsehood
my lord and that to a single man who 
promise you will not invoke public justice to assist
his own good sword should he see cause to
use it can you look at that ring and deny that
you are lord wilmot 
he handed to the disguised prince a ring which
he took from his purse and his opponent instantly
knew it for the same he had dropped into alice's
pitcher at the fountain obeying only though imprudently
the gallantry the moment in giving
a pretty gem to a handsome girl whom he had
accidentally frightened
i know the ring he said it has been in
my possession how it should prove me to be
woodstock 
lord wilmot i cannot conceive and beg to
say it bears false witness against me
you shall see the evidence answered everard
 and resuming the ring he pressed a spring
ingeniously contrived in the collet the setting
on which the stone flew back and showed within
it the cypher lord wilmot beautifully engraved
in miniature with a coronet what say
you now sir 
that probabilities are no proofs said the
prince there is nothing here save what can be
easily accounted for i am the son a scottish
nobleman who was mortally wounded and made
prisoner at worcester fight when he took leave
and bid me fly he gave me the few valuables he
possessed and that among others i have heard
him talk having changed rings with lord
wilmot on some occasion in scotland but 
never knew the trick the gem which you have
shown me
in this it may be necessary to say charles
spoke very truly nor would he have parted with
it in the way he did had he suspected it would be
easily recognised he proceeded after a minute's
vol y
 woodstock
pause once more sir i have told you
much that concerns my safety if you are generous
you will let me pass and i may do you on
some future day as good service if you mean
to arrest me ycu must do so here and at your
own peril for i will neither walk farther your
way nor permit you to dog me on mine if
you let me pass i will thank you if not take to
your weapon
young gentleman said colonel everard
whether you be actually the gay young nobleman
for whom i took you you have made
me uncertain but intimate as you say your
family has been with him i have little doubt
that you are proficient in the school debauchery
 which wilmot and villiers are professors
and their hopeful master a graduated student
your conduct at woodstock where you have
rewarded the hospitality the family by meditating
the most deadly wound to their honour
has proved you too apt a scholar in such an academy
i intended only to warn you on this subjects
will be your own fault if i add chastisement
to admonition
woodstock ss
warn me sir said the prince indignantly
and chastisement this is presuming more on
my patience than is consistent with yovu own
safety draw sir so saying he laid his hand
on his sword
my religion said everard forbids me to
be rash in shedding blood go home sir be
wise consult the dictates honour as well as
prudence respect the honour the house 
lee and know there is one nearly allied to it by
whom your motions will be called to severe accounts

aha said the prince with a bitter laugh
i see the whole matter now we have our
roundheaded colonel our puritan cousin before
us the man texts and morals whom alice
lee laughs at so heartily if your religion sir
prevents you from giving satisfaction it should
prevent you from offering insult to a person 
honour
the passions both were now fully up they
drew mutually and began to fight the colonel
relinquishing the advantage he could have obtained
by the use his firearms a thrust 
 woodstock
the arm or a slip the foot might at the
moment have changed the destinies britain
when the arrival a third party broke off the
combat

stay for the king has thrown his warder down
richard 
the combatants whom we left engaged at the
 the last volume made mutual passes at
each other with apparently equal skill and courage
charles had been too often in action and
too long a party as well as a victim to civil war
to find anything new or surprising in being obliged
to defend himself with his own hands and
everard had been distinguished as well for his
personal bravery as for the other properties 
c
 woodstock
a commander but the arrival a thud party
prevented the tragic conclusion a combat in
which the success either party must have given
him much cause for regretting his victory
it was the old knight himself who arrived
mounted upon a forest pony for the war and sequestration
had left him no steed a more dignified
description he thrust himself between the
combatants and commanded them on their lives to
hold so soon as a glance from one to the other
had ascertained to him whom he had to deal with
hedenanded whether the devils woodstock
whom folks talked about had got possession 
them both that they were tilting at each other
within the verge the royal liberties let me
tell both you he said that while old henry
fine is at woodstock the immunities the park
shall be maintained as much as if the king were
still on the throne none shall fight dwells here
excepting the stags in their seasons put up both
 you or i shall lug out as herdsman and prove
perhaps the worse devil the three as will
says
 ril so maul you and your toastingirons
that you sliull lliink illic devil has conic i'roui litll 
woodstock
the combatants desisted from their encounter
but stood looking at each other sullenly asmen
do in such a situation each unwilling to seem
to desire peace more than the other and averse
therefore to be the first to sheathe his sword
return your weapons gentlemen upon the
spot said the knight yet more peremptorily
one and both you or you will have something
to do with me i promise you you maybe
thankful times are changed i have known
them such that your insolence might have cost
each you your hand if not redeemed with a
round sum money nephew if you do not
mean to alienate me for ever i command you to
put up master kerneguy you are my guest
i request you not to do me the insult remaining
with your sword drawn where it is my
duty to see peace observed
 i obey you sir henry said the king
sheathing his rapier i hardly indeed know
wherefore i was assaulted by this gentleman
i assure you none respects the king's person or
privileges more than thyself though the devotion
is somewhat out fashion 
 woodstock
we may find a place to meet sir replied
everard where neither the royal person nor
privileges can be offended
faith very hardly sir said charles unable
to suppress the rising jest i mean the
king has so few followers that the loss the
least them might be some small damage to him
but risking all that i will meet you wherever
there is fair field for a poor cavalier to get off in
safety if he has the luck in fight
sir henry lee's first idea had been fixed upon
the insult offered to the royal demesne he now
began to turn them towards the safety his
kinsman and the young royalist as he deemed
him gentlemen he said i must insist on
this business being put to a final nephew
markham is this your return for my condescension
in coming back to woodstock on your warrant
that you should take an opportunity to cut
the throat my guest 
if you knew his purpose as well as i do 
said markham and then paused conscious that
he might only incense his uncle without convincing
him as anything he might say kerneguy's
woodstock 
addresses to alice was like to be imputed to his
own jealous suspicions he looked on the ground
therefore and was silent
and you master kerneguysaid sir henry
can you give me any reason why you seek to
take the use this young man in whom though
unhappily forgetful his loyalty and duty i
must yet take some interest as my nephew by
affinity 
 i was not aware the gentleman enjoyed that
honour which certainly would have protected
him from my sword answered kerneguy but
the quarrel is his nor can i tell any reason why
he fixed it upon me unless it were the difference
 our political opinions
you know the contrary said everard
you know that i told you you were safe from
me as a fugitive royalist and your last words
showed you were at no loss to guess my connexion
with sir henry that indeed is little
consequence i should debase myself did i use
the relationship as a means protection from
you or any one
as they thus disputed neither choosing to 
woodstock
proach the real cause quarrel sir henry looked
from the one to the other with a peacemaking
countenance exclaiming 
 why what an intricate impeach is this 
i think you both have drunk circe's cup
come my young masters allow an old man to
mediate between you i am not shortsighted in
such matters the mother mischief is no bigger
than a gnat's wing and i have known fifty
instances in my own day when as will says
gallants have been confronted hardily
in single opposition hand to hand
in which after the field was fought no one could
remember the cause quarrel tush a small
thing will do it the taking the wall or the
gentle rub the shoulder in passing each other
or a hasty word or a misconceived gesturecome
forget your cause quarrel be what it will
you have had your breathing and though you
put up your rapiers unbodied that was no default
 yours but by command your elder
and one who had right to use authority in malta
where the duello is punctiliously well understood
the persons engaged in a single combat
wooustock 
are bound to halt on the command a knight
or priest or lady and the quarrel so interrupted
is held as honourably terminated and may not
be revived nephew it is i think impossible
that you can nourish spleen against this young
gentleman for having fought for his king hear
my honest proposal markham you know i
bear no malice though i have some reason to be
offended with you give the young man your
hand in friendship and we will back to the
lodge all three together and drink a cup 
sack in token reconciliations
markham everard found himself unable to
resist this approach towards kindness on his uncle's
part he suspected indeed what was partly
the truth that it was not entirely from reviving
good will but also that his uncle thought
by such attention to secure his neutrality at least
if not his assistance for the safety the fugitive
royalist he was sensible that he was placed in
an awkward predicament and that he might incur
the suspicions his own party for holding
intercourse even with a near relation who harboured
such guests but on the other hand he
thought his services to the commonwealth had
 woodstock 
been sufficient importance to outweigh whatever
envy might urge on that topic indeed although
the civil war had divided families much
and in many various ways yet when it seemed
ended by the triumph the republicans the
rage political hatred began to relent and the
ancient ties kindred and friendship regained at
least a part their former influence many reunions
were formed and those who like everard
adhered to the conquering party often exerted
themselves for the protection then deserted
relatives
as these things rushed through his mind accompanied
with the prospect a renewed intercourse
with alice lee by means which he
might be at hand to protect her against every
chance either injury or insult he held out his
hand to the supposed scottish page saying at
the same time that for his part he was very
ready to forget the cause quarrel or rather to
consider it as arising out a misapprehension
and to offer master kerneguy such friendship as
might exist between honourable men who had
embraced different sides in politics
unable to overcome the feeling personal
woodstock 
dignity which prudence recommended to him
to forget louis kerneguy in return bowed low
but without accepting everard's proffered hand
 he had no occasion he said to make any
exertions to forget the cause quarrel for he
had never been able to comprehend it but ashe
had not shunned the gentleman's resentment
so he was now willing to embrace and return any
degree his favour with which he might be
pleased to honour him
everard withdrew his hand with a smile and
bowed in return to the salutation the page
whose stiff reception his advances he imputed
to the proud pettish disposition a scotch boy
trained up in ideas family consequence and
personal importance which his acquaintance with
the world had not yet been sufficient to dispel
sir henry lee delighted with the termination
 the quarrel which he supposed to be in
deep deference to his own authority and not displeased
with the opportunity renewing some
acquaintance with his nephew who had notwithstanding
his political demerits a warmer interest
in his affections than he was perhaps himself
aware said in a tone consolation never
woodstock
be mortified young gentlemen i protest it went
to my heart to part you when i saw you stretching
yourselves so handsomely and in fair love 
honour without any malicious or bloodthirsty
thoughts i promise you had it not been for
my duty as ranger here and sworn to the office
i would rather have been your umpire than
your hindrance but a finished quarrel is a
forgotten quarrel and your tilting should have
no further consequence excepting the appetite it
may have given you
so saying he mounted his pony and moved
forward in triumph towards the lodge by the
nearest alley his feet almost touching the ground
the ball his toe just resting in the stirrup 
the fore part the thigh brought round to the
saddle the heels turned outwards and sunk as
much as possible his body precisely erect the
reins properly and systematically divided in his
left hand his right holding a ridingrod diagonally
pointed towards the horse's left ear he
seemed a champion the menage fit to have
reined bucephalus himself his youthful companions
who attended on either hand like equerry
wooustock 
nes could scarce suppress a smile at the completely
adjusted and systematic posture the
rider contrasted with the wild and diminutive
appearance the pony with its shaggy coat and
long tail and mane and its keen eyes sparkling
like red coals from amongst the mass hair
which fell over its small countenance if the
reader has the duke newcastle's on horsemanship
splendid moles he may have some
idea the figure the good knight if he can
conceive such a figure as one the cavaliers there
represented seated in all the graces his art
on a welch or exmoor pony in its native savage
state without grooming or discipline any
kind the ridicule being greatly enhanced by the
disproportion size betwixt the animal and its
rider
perhaps the knight saw their wonder for the
first words he said after they left the ground
were pixie though small is mettlesome gentlemen
here he contrived that pixie should
himself corroborate the assertion by executing a
gambade he is diminutive but full spirit 
indeed save that i am somewhat too large for
hi
 woodstock
an elfin horseman the knight was upwards 
six feet high i should remind myself when i
mount him the fairy king as described by
mike drayton 
himself he on an earwig set
yet scarce upon his back could get
so oft and high he did curvet
ere he himself did settle
he made him stop and turn and bound
to gallop and to trot the round
he scarce could stand on any ground
he was so full mettle
my old friend pixie said everard stroking
the pony's neck i am glad that hellas
survived all these bustling days pixie must be
above twenty years old sir henry 
above twenty years certainly yes nephew
markham war is a whirlwind in a plantation
mhich only spares what is least worth leaving
old pixie and his old master have survived many
a tall fellow and many a great horse neither 
them good for much themselves yet as will
says an old man can do somewhat so pixie
and i still survive
so saying he again contrived that pixie should
show some remnants activity
woodstock 
 still survive said the young scot completing
the sentence which the good knight had left
unfinished ay still survive
to witch the world with noble horsemanship 
everard coloured for he felt the irony but
not so his uncle whose simple vanity never permitted
him to doubt the sincerity the compliment

are you advised that he said in king
james's time indeed i have appeared in the
tiltyard and there you might have said 
you saw young harry with his beaver up
as to seeing old harry why here the
knight paused and looked as a bashful man in
labour a pun as to old harry why you
might as well see the devil you take me master
kerneguy the devil you know is my namesake
ha ha ha cousin everard i hope your
precision is not startled by an innocent jest 
he was so delighted with the applause both
his companions that he recited the whole the
celebrated passage referred to and concluded
 woodstock
with defying the present age bundle all its wits
donne cowley waller and the rest them together
to produce a poet a tenth part the
genius old will
why we are said to have one his descendants
among us sir william d'avenant
said louis kerneguy and many think him as
clever a fellow
what exclaimed sir henry will
davenant whom i knew in the north an officer
under newcastle when the marquis lay before
hull why he was an honest cavalier and ivrote
good doggrel enough but how came he akin to
will shakspeare i trow 
why replied the young scot by the
surer side the house and after the old fashion
if davenant speaks truth it seems that his
mother was a goodlooking laughing buxom
mistress an inn between stratford and london
at which will shakspeare often quartered
as he went down to his native town and that out
 friendship and gossipred as we say in scotland
will shakspeare became godfather to will
d'avcnant and not contented with this spiritual
woodstock 
activity the younger will is for establishing some
claim to a natural one alleging that his mother
was a great admirer wit and there were no
bounds to her complaisance for men genius
out upon the hound said colonel everard
 would he purchase the reputation descending
from poet or from prince at the expense
 his mother's good fame this nose ought to
be slit
that would be difficult answered the disguised
prince recollecting the peculiarity the
bard's countenance
will d'avenant the son will shakspeare
 said the knight who had not yet recovered
his surprise at the enormity the pretension
 why it reminds me a verse in the 
 phaeton where the hero complains
to his mother 
besides by all the village boys i am shamed
you the sun's son you rascal you be d ed 
we observe this couplet in fielding's farce tumbledown
dick founded on the same classical story as it was current in
the time the commonwealth it must have reached the author
 tom jones by tradition for no one will suspect the present
author making the anachronism
vol iii b
 woodstock
i never heard such unblushing assurance in my
life swill d'avenant the son the brightest
and best poet that ever was is or will be but
i crave your pardon nephew you i believe
love no stageplays
nay i am not altogether so precise as you
would make me uncle i have loved them perhaps
too well in my time and now i condemn
them not altogether or in gross though i approve
not their excesses and extravagances i
cannot even in shakspeare but see many things
both scandalous to decency and prejudicial to
good manners many things which tend to ridicule
virtue or to recommend vice at least to
mitigate the hideousness its features i cannot
think these fine poems are an useful study
and especially for the youth either sex in
which bloodshed is pointed out as the chief occupation
 the men and intrigue as the sole employment
 the women
in making these observations everard was
simple enough to think that he was only giving
his uncle an opportunity defending a favourite
opinion without offending him by a contrawoodstock

diction which was so limited and mitigated but
here as on other occasions he forgot how obstinate
his uncle was in his views whether religion
policy or taste and that it would be as easy to
convert him to the presbyterian form government
or engage him to take the abjuration oath
as to shake his belief in shakspeare there was
another peculiarity in the good knight's mode 
arguing which everard being himself a plain
and downright character and one whose religious
tenets were in some degree unfavourable to the
suppressions and simulations often used in society
could never perfectly understand sir henry
sensible his natural heat temper was
wont scrupulously to guard against it and would
for some time when in fact much offended conduct
a debate with all the external appearance 
composure till the violence his feelings would
rise so high as to overcome and bear away the
artificial barriers opposed to it and rush down
upon the adversary with accumulating wrath it
thus frequently happened that like a wily old
general he retreated in the face his disputant
in good order and by degrees with so moderate
w woodstock
a degree resistance as to draw on his antagonist's
pursuit to the spot where at length making
a sudden and unexpected attack with horse
foot and artillery at once he seldom failed to
confound the enemy though he might not overthrow
him
it was on this principle therefore that hearing
everard's last observation he disguised his angry
feelings and answered with a tone where politeness
was called in to keep guard upon passion
that undoubtedly the presbyterian gentry had
given through the whole these unhappy times
such proofs an humble unaspiring and unambitious
desire the public good as entitled them
to general credit for the sincerity those very
strong scruples which they entertained against
works in which the noblest sentiments religion
and virtue sentiments which might convert
hardened sinners and be placed with propriety
in the mouths dying saints and martyrs
happened from the rudeness and coarse taste
 the times to be mixed with some broad jests
and similar matter which lay not mich in the
way excepting those who painfully sought it
woodstock sjl
out that they might use it in vilifying what was
in itself deserving the highest applause but
what he wished especially to know from his nephew
was whether any those gifted men
who had expelled the learned scholars and deep
divines the church england from the pulpit
and now flourished in their stead received
any inspiration from the muses if he might use
so profane a term without offence to colonel everard
or whether they were not as sottishly and
brutally averse from elegant letters as they were
from humanity and common sense 
colonel everard might have guessed by the
ironical tone in which this speech was delivered
what storm was mustering within his uncle's bosom
 nay he might have conjectured the state
 the old knight's feelings from his emphasis on
the word colonel by which epithet as that which
most connected his nephew with the party he
hated he never distinguished everard unless
when his wrath was rising while on the contrary
when disposed to be on good terms with
him he usually called him kinsman or nephew
markham indeed it was under a partial sense
n
woodstock
that this was the case and in the hope to see his
cousin alice that the colonel forbore making any
answer to the harangue his uncle which had
concluded just as the old knight had alighted at
the door the lodge and was entering the
hall followed by his two attendants
phoebe at the same time made her appearance
in the hall and received orders to bring some
beverage for the gentlemen the hebe 
woodstock failed not to recognize and welcome
everard by an almost imperceptible courtesy 
but she did not serve her interest as she designed
when she asked the knight as a question 
course whether he commanded the attendance 
mistress alice a stern no was the decided reply
and the illtimed interference seemed to increase
his previous irritation against everard for
his depreciation shakspeare i would insist
said sir henry resuming the obnoxious sub 
sect were it fit for a poor disbanded cavalier to
use such a phrase towards a commander the
conquering army upon knowing whether the
convulsion which has sent us saints and prophets
without has not also afforded us a poet with
woodstock s
enough both gifts and grace to outshine poor
old will the oracle and idol us blinded and
carnal cavaliers
surely sir replied colonel everard i
know verses written by a friend the commonwealth
and those too a dramatic character
which weighed in an impartial scale might equal
even the poetry shakspeare and which are free
from the fustian and indelicacy with which that
great bard was sometimes content to feed the
coarse appetites his barbarous audience
indeed said the knight keeping down his
wrath with difficulty i should like to be acquainted
with this masterpiece poetry may
we ask the name this distinguished person 
it must be vicars or withers at least
said the feigned page
no sir replied everard nor drummond
 hawthorne nor lord stirling neither 
and yet the verses will vindicate what i say if
you will make allowance for indifferent recitation
for i am better accustomed to speak to a
battalion than to those who love the muses the
speaker is a lady benighted who having lost her
 woodstock
way in a pathless forest at first expresses herself
agitated by the supernatural fears to which
her situation gave rise
a play too and written by a roundhead
author said sir henry in surprise
a dramatic production at least replied his
nephew and began to recite simply but with
feeling the lines now so well known but which
had then obtained no celebrity the fame the
author resting upon the basis rather his polemical
and political publications than on the poetry
doomed in after days to support the eternal
structure his immortality
these thoughts may startle but will not astound
the virtuous mind that ever walks attended
by a strongsiding champion conscience
my own opinion nephew markham my
own opinion better expressed but j must what i
said when the scoundrelly roundheads pretended
to see ghosts at woodstock go on i prithee

everard proceeded 
o welcome pureeyed faith whitehanded hope
thou hovering angel girt with golden wings
and thou unblemish'd form chastity 
woodstock 
 see ye visibly and now believe
that he the supreme good to whom all things ill
are but as slavish officers vengeance
would send a glittering guardian if need were
to keep my life and honour assailed
was i deceived or did a sable cloud
turn forth her silver lining on the night 
the rest has escaped me said the reciter 
and i marvel i have been able to remember so
much
sir henry lee who had expected some effusion
very different from those classical and beautiful
lines soon changed the scornful expression
 his countenance relaxed his contorted upper
lip and stroking down his beard with his left
hand rested the forefinger the right upon his
eyebrow in sign profound attention after
everard had ceased speaking the old man sighed
as at the a strain sweet music he then
spoke in a gentler manner than formerly
cousin markham he said these verses
flow sweetly and sound in my ears like the welltouched
warbling a lute but thou knowest
i am something slow apprehending the full
meaning that which i hear for the first time
repeat mc these verses again slowly and delibc
 woodstock
lately for i always love to hear poetry twice
the first time for sound and the latter time for
sense
thus encouraged everard recited again the
lines with more hardihood and better effect the
knight distinctly understanding and from his
looks and motions highly applauding them
yes he broke out when everard was
again silent yes i do call that poetry 
though it were even written by a presbyterian
or an anabaptist either ay there were good and
righteous people to be found even amongst the offending
towns which were destroyed by fire and
certainly i have heard though but with little
credence begging your pardon cousin everard
that there are men among you who have seen the
error their ways in rebelling against the best
and kindest masters and bringing it to that
pass that he was murdered by a gang yet fiercer
than themselves ay doubtless the gentleness
 spirit and the purity mind which dictated
those beautiful lines has long ago taught a man
so amiable to say i have sinned i have sinned
yes i doubt not so sweet a harp has been broken
woodstock 
even in remorse for the crimes he was witness
to and now he sits drooping for the shame and
sorrow england all his noble rhymes as
will says
like sweet bells jangled out tune and harsh
dost thou not think so master kerneguy 
not i sir henry answered the page
what dost not believe the author these
lines must needs be the better file and leaning
to our persuasion 
i think sir henry that the poetry qualifies
the author to write a play on the subject dame
potiphar and her recusant lover and as for his
calling that last metaphor the cloud in a black
coat or cloak with silver lining would have dubbed
him a tailor with me only that i happen to
know that he is a schoolmaster by profession
and by political opinions qualified to be poet
laureate to cromwell for what colonel everard
has repeated with such unction is the production
 no less celebrated a person than john
milton
 woodstock
 john milton exclaimed sir henry in astonishment
 what john milton the blasphemous
and bloodyminded author the defense
populi anglican the advocate the infernal
high court fiends the creature and parasite
 that grand impostor that loathsome hypocrite
that detestable monster that prodigy the universe
that disgrace mankind that landscape 
iniquity that sink sin and that compendium
 baseness oliver cromwell 
even the same john milton answered
charles schoolmaster to little boys and tailor
to the clouds which he furnishes with suits 
black lined with silver at no other expense than
that common sense
markham everard said the old knight
i will never forgive thee never never thou
hast made me speak words praise respecting
one whose offal should fatten the regionkites 
speak not to me sir but begone am i your
kinsman and benefactor a fit person to be juggled
out ray commendation and praise and
brought to bedaub such a whitened sepulchre as
the sophist mihon 
woodstock 
i profess said everard this is hard measure
sir henry you pressed rne you defied
me to produce poetry as good as shakspeare's
i only thought the verses not the politics
 milton
oh yes sir replied sir henry we well
know your power making distinctions you
could make war against the king's prerogative
without having the least design against his person
oh heaven forbid but heaven will hear
and judge you set down the beverage phoebe
this was added by way parenthesis to
phoebe who entered with refreshment colonel
everard is not thirsty you have wiped your
mouths and said you have done no evil but
though you have deceived man yet god you
cannot deceive
charged thus at once with the faults imputed
to his whole religious sect and political party
everard felt too late what imprudence he had
been guilty in giving the opening by disputing
his uncle's taste in dramatic poetry he endeavoured
to explainto apologize
 woodstock
i mistook your purpose honoured sir and
thought you really desired to know something 
our literature and in repeating what you thought
not unworthy your hearing i profess i thought
i was doing you pleasure instead stirring your
indignation
o ay returned the knight with unmitigated
rigour resentment profess profess 
ay that is the new phrase asseveration instead
 the profane adjuration courtiers and
cavaliers oh sir profess less and practise more
and so good day to you master kerneguy
you will find beverage in my apartment
while phoebe stood gaping in admiration at
the sudden quarrel which had arisen colonel
everard's vexation and resentment was not a
little increased by the nonchance the young
scotchman who with his hands thrust into his
pockets with a courtly affectation the time
had thrown himself into one the antique chairs
and though habitually too polite to laugh aloud
and possessing that art internal laughter by
which men the world learn to indulge their
mirth without incurring quarrels or giving direct
woodstock
offence was at no particular trouble to conceal
that he was exceedingly amused by the result 
the colonels visit to woodstock colonel everard's
patience however had reached bounds
which it was very likely to surpass for though
differing widely in politics there was a resemblance
betwixt the temper the uncle and nephew

damnation exclaimed the colonel in a
tone which became a puritan as little as did the
exclamation itself
amen said louis kerneguy but in a tone
so soft and gentle that the ejaculation seemed
rather to escape him than to be designedly uttered

sir said everard striding towards him in
that sort humour when a man full resentment
would not unwillingly find an object on
which to discharge it
plait il f said the page in the most equable
tone looking up in his face with the most unconscious
innocence
i wish to know sir the meaning that
which you said just now 
s woodstock
only a pouring out the spirit worthy
sir returned kerneguy a small skiff dispatched
to heaven on my own account to keep company
with your holy petition just now expressed
sir i have known a man's bones broke for
such a smile as you wear just now replied everard

there look you now answered the malicious
page who could not weigh even the
thoughts his safety against the enjoyment 
his jest if you had stuck to your professions
worthy sir you must have choked by this time 
but your round execration bolted like a cork from
a bottle cider and now allows your wrath to
come foaming out after it in the honest unbaptized
language common ruffians
for heaven's sake master gurney said
rhcebe forbear giving the colonel these bitter
words and doyougood colonel markham scorn
to take offence at his hands he is but a boy
if the colonel or you choose mistress phoebe
you shall find me a man i think the gentleman
can say something to the purpose already 
probably he may recommend to you the part 
woodstock 
the lady in comus and i only hope his own
admiration john milton will not induce him
to undertake the part sampson agonies and
blow up this old house with execrations or pull
it down in wrath about our ears
young man said the colonel still in towering
passion if you respect my principles for
nothing else be grateful to the protection which
but for them you would not easily attain
nay then said the attendant i must fetch
those who have more influence with you than i
have and away tripped phoebe while kerneguy
answered to everard in the same provoking
tone calm indifference
before you menace me with a thing so formidable
as your resentment you ought to be certain
whether i may not be compelled by circumstances
to deny you the opportunity you seem to
point at
at this moment a lice summoned no doubt by
her attendant entered the hall hastily
master kerneguy she said my father
requests to see you in victor lee's apartment
vol hi c
 woodstock
kerneguy arose and bowed but seemed determined
to remain till everard's departure so
as to prevent any explanation betwixt the cousins

markham said alice hurriedly cousin
everard i have but a moment to remain here
for god's sake do you instantly begone be
cautious and patient but do not tarry here my
father is fearfully incensed
i have had my uncle's word for that madam
replied everard as well as his injunction
to depart which i will obey without delay i
was not aware that you would have seconded
so harsh an order quite so willingly but i go
madam sensible i leave those behind whose company
is more agreeable
unjust ungenerous ungrateful said
alice but fearful her words might reach ears
for which they were not designed she spoke
them in a voice so feeble that her cousin for
whom they were intended lost the consolation
they were calculated to convey
he bowed coldly to alice as taking leave and
said with an air that constrained courtesy
woodstock 
which sometimes covers among men condition
the most deadly hatred i believe master kern
that i must make it convenient at present
to suppress my own peculiar opinions on the matter
which we have hinted at in our conversation
in which case i will send a gentleman who i hope
may be able to conquer yours
the supposed scotsman made him a stately
and at the same time a condescending bow said
he should expect the honour his commands
offered hi hand to mistress alice to conduct her
back to her father's apartment and took a triumphant
leave his rival
everard on the other hand stung beyond his
patience and from the grace and composed assurance
 the youth's carriage still conceiving
him to be either wilmot or some his compeers
in rank and profligacy returned to the
town woodstock determined not to be outbearded
even though he should seek redress by
means which his principles forbade him to consider
as justifiable

boundless intemperance
in nature is a tyranny it hath been
the untimely emptying many a throne
and fail many kings

while colonel everard retreated in high
indignation from the little refection which sir
henry lee had in his goodhumour offered and
withdrawn under the circumstances provocation
which we have detailed the good old knight
scarce recovered from his fit passion partook
 it with his daughter and guest and shortly
after recollecting some sylvan task for though
to little efficient purpose he still regularly attended
to his duties as ranger he called bevis and
went out leaving the two young people together
 now said the amorous prince to himself
that alice is left without her lion it remains to
woodstock
si
see whether she is herself a tigress breed so
sir bevis has left his charge he said aloud i
thought the knights old those stern guardians
 which he is so fit a representative were more
rigorous in maintaining a vigilant guard
 bevis said alice knows that his attendance
on me is totally needless and moreover
he has other duties to perform which every true
knight prefers to dangling the whole morning by
a lady's sleeve
you speak treason against all true affection
said the gallant a lady's lightest wish should
to a true knight be more binding than aught excepting
the summons his sovereign i wish
mistress alice you would but intimate your
slightest desire to me and you should see how
i have practised obedience
you never brought me word what o'clock it
was this morning replied the young lady and
there i sat questioning the wings time when
i should have remembered that gentlemen's gallantry
can be quite as fugitive as time himself
how do you know what your disobedience may
have cost me and others pudding and dumpling
 o
 
 woodstock
may have been burned to a cinder for sir i
practise the old domestic rule visiting the
kitchen or i may have missed prayers or i may
have been too late for an appointment simply by
the negligence master louis kerneguy failing
to let me know the hour the day
o replied kerneguy i am one those
lovers who cannot endure absence i must be
eternally at the feet my fair enemy such i
think is the title with which romances teach us
to grace the fair and cruel to whom we devote our
hearts and lives speak for me good lute he
added taking up the instrument and show whether
i know not my duty
he sung but with more taste than execution
the air a french rondeau to which some the
wits or sonnetteers in his gay and roving train
had adapted english verses
an hour with thee when earliest day
dapples with gold the eastern grey
oh what can frame my mind to bear
the toil and turmoil care and care
new griefs which coming hours unfold
and sftd remembrance the old 
one hour with thes
woodstock j
one hour with thee when burning june
waves his red flag at pitch noon 
what shall repay the faithful swain
his labour on the sultry plain 
and more than cave or sheltering bough
cool feverish blood and throbbing brow 
one hour with thee
one hour with thee i when sun is set
o what can teach me to forget
the thankless labours the day 
the hopes the wishes siang away 
the increasing wants and lessening gains
the master's pride who scorns my pains 
one hour with thee
 truly there is another verse said the songster
 but i sing it not to you mistress alice because
some the prudes the court liked it not
i thank you master louis answered the
young lady both for your discretion in singing
what has given me pleasure and in forbearing
what might offend me though a country girl i
pretend to be so far the court mode as to receive
nothing which does not pass current among
the better class there
i would answered louis that you were
so well confirmed in their creed as to let all pass
with you to which court ladies would give currency

 woodstock
and what would be the consequence said
auce with perfect composure
in that case said louis embarrassed like a
general who finds that his preparations for attack
do not seem to strike either fear or confusion into
the enemy in that case you would forgive me
fair alice if i spoke to you in a warmer language
than that mere gallantry if i told you how
much my heart was interested in what you consider
as idle jesting if i seriously owned it was in your
power to make me the happiest or the most miserable
 human beings
master kerneguy said alice with the same
unshaken nonchance let us understand each
other i am little acquainted with highbred manners
and i am unwilling i tell you plainly to be
accounted a silly country girl who either from
ignorance or conceit is startled at every word 
gallantry addressed to her by a young man who
for the present has nothing better to do than coin
and circulate such false compliments but i must
sot let this fear seeming rustic and awkwardly
timorous carry me too far and being ignorant 
the exact limits i will take care to stop within
them
woodstock 
i trust madam said kerneguy that however
severely you may be disposed to judge 
me your justice will not punish me too severely
for an offence which your charms are alone the
occasion 
hear me out sir if you please resumed
alice i have listened to you when you spoke
en herder nay my complaisance has been so
great as to answer you en herbert for i do not
think anything except ridicule can come dialogues
betwixt lindor and jeannaton and the
principal fault the style is its extreme and tiresome
silliness and affectation but when you begin
to kneel offer to take my hand and speak with
a more serious tone i must remind you our
real characters i am the daughter sir henry
lee sir and you are or profess to be master
louis kerneguy my brother's page and a fugitive
for shelter under my father's roof who incurs
danger by the harbour he affords you and whose
household therefore ought not to be disturbed by
your un pleasing importunities
i would to heaven fair alice said the king
 that your objections to the suit which i am
 woodstock
urging not in jest but most seriously as that on
which my happiness depends rested only on the low
and precarious station louis keraeguy alice
thou hast the soul thy family and must needs
love honour i am no more the needy scottish
page whom i have for my own purposes personated
than i am the awkward lout whose manners
i adopted on the first night our acquaintance
this hand poor as i seem can confer a coronet

keep it said alice for some more ambitious
damsel my lord for such i conclude is
your title if this romance be true i would not
accept your hand could you confer a duchy
in one sense lovely alice you have neither
overrated my power nor my affection it is your
king it is charles stuart who speaks to you 
he can confer duchies and if beauty can merit
them it is that auce lee nay nay arise 
do not kneel it is for your sovereign to kneel to
thee alice to whom he is a thousand times more
devoted than the wanderer louis dared venture
to profess himself my alice has i know been
trained up in those principles love and obey

dienceto her sovereign that she cannot in conscience
or in mercy inflict on him such a wound
as would be implied in the rejection his suit
in spite all charles's attempts to prevent
her alice had persevered in kneeling on one knee
until she had touched with her lip the hand with
which he attempted to raise her but this salutation
ended she stood upright with her arms
folded on her bosom her looks humble but composed
keen and watchful and so possessed herself
 little flattered by the communication which
the king had supposed would have been overpowering
that he scarce knew in what terms
next to urge his solicitation
thou art silent thou art silent he said
my pretty alice has the king no more influence
with thee than the poor scottish page 
in one sense every influence said alice 
for he commands my best thoughts my best
wishes my earnest prayers my devoted loyalty
which as the men the house lee have been
ever ready to testify with the sword so are the
women bound to seal if necessary with their
blood but beyond the duties a true and devoir
woodstock
ted subject the king is even less to alice lee
than poor louis kerneguy the page could have
tendered an honourable union the monarch can
but offer a contaminated coronet
you mistake alice you mistake said the
king eagerly sit down and let me speak to
you sit down what isn't you fear 
i fear nothing my lord answered alice
what can i fear from the king britain i
the daughter his loyal subject and under my
father's roof but i remember the distance betwixt
us and though i might trifle and jest with
mine equal to ray king i must only appear in the
dutiful posture a subject unless where his safety
may seem to require that i do not acknowledge
his dignity
charles though young being no novice in such
scenes was surprised to encounter resistance 
a kind which had not been opposed to him in
similar pursuits even in cases where he had been
unsuccessful there was neither anger nor injured
pride nor disorder nor disdain real or affected
in the manners and conduct alice she
tond as it seemed calmly prepared to argue on
woodstock 
the subject which is generally decided by passion
showed no inclination to escape from the apartment
but appeared determined to hear with patience
the suit the lover while her countenance
and manner intimated that she had this complaisance
only in deference to the commands the
king
she is ambitious thought charles it is
by dazzling her love glory not by mere passionate
entreaties that i must hope to be successful
i pray you be seated my fair alice he said
the lover entreats the king commands you
the king said alice may permit the
relaxation the ceremonies due to royalty but
he cannot abrogate the subject's duty even by
express command i stand here while it is your
majesty's pleasure to address me a patient listener
as in duty bound
know then simple girl said the king
that in accepting my proffered affection and
protection you break through no law either 
virtue or morality those who are born to royalty
are deprived many the comforts private
life chiefly that which is perhaps the dearest
 woodstock
and most precious the power choosing their
own mates for life their formal weddings are
guided upon principles political expedience
only and those to whom they are wedded are
frequently in temper person and disposition
the most unlikely to make them happy society
has commiseration therefore towards us and
binds our unwilling and often unhappy wedlock
with chains a lighter and more easy character
than those which fetter other men whose marriage
ties as more voluntarily assumed ought in proportion
to be more strictly binding and therefore
ever since the time that old henry built
these walls priests and prelates as well as nobles
and statesmen have been accustomed to see a fair
rosamond rule the heart an affectionate monarch
and console him for the few hours constraint
and state which he must bestow upon some
angry and jealous eleanor to such a connexion
the world attaches no blame they rush to the
festival to admire the beauty the lovely esther
while the imperious vashti is left to queen it in
solitude they throng the palace to ask her protection
whose influence is more in the state an
woodstock 
hundred times than that the proud consort 
her offspring rank with the nobles the land
and vindicate by their courage like the celebrated
longford earl salisbury their descent from
royalty and from love from such connexions
our richest ranks nobles are recruited and
the mother lives in the greatness her posterity
honoured and blessed as she died lamented and
wept in the arms love and friendship
did rosamond so die my lord said alice
our records say she was poisoned by the injured
queen poisoned without time allowed to call to
god for the pardon her many faults did her
memory so live i have heard that when the
bishop purified the church at godstowe her monument
was broken open by his orders and her
bones thrown out into unconsecrated ground
those were rude old days sweet alice answered
charles queens are not now so jealous
nor bishops so rigorous and know besides that
in the lauds to which i would lead the loveliest
 her sex other laws obtain which remove from
such ties even the slightest show scandal
there is a mode matrimony which fulfilling
 woodstock
all the rites the church leaves no stain on the
conscience yet investing the bride with none 
the privileges peculiar to her husband's condition
infringes not upon the duties which the king
owes to his subjects so that alice lee may
in all respects become the real and lawful wife 
charles stuart except that their private union
gives her no title to be queen england
my ambition said alice will be sufficiently
gratified to see charles king without aiming
to share either his dignity in public or his
wealth and regal luxury in private
i understand thee alice said the king
hurt but not displeased you ridicule me being
a fugitive for speaking like a king it is a
habit i admit which i have learned and 
which even misfortune cannot cure me but my
case is not so desperate as you may suppose my
friends are still many in these kingdoms my allies
abroad are bound by regard to their own interest
to espouse my cause i have hopes given me
from spain from france and from other nations 
arid i have confidence that my father's blood has
not been poured forth in vain nor is doomed to
woo us took 
dry up without due vengeance my trust is in
him from whom princes derive their title and
think what thou wilt my present condition i
have perfect confidence that i shall one day sit on
the throne england
may god grant it said alice and that
he may grant it noble prince deign to consider
whether you now pursue a conduct likely to conciliate
his favour think the course you recommend
to a motherless maiden who has no
better defence against your sophistry than what
the natural feeling female dignity inspires
whether the death her father which would bethe
consequence her imprudence whether the
despair her brother whose life has been so often
in peril to save that your majesty whether
the dishonour the roof which has sheltered
you will read well in your annals or are events
likely to propitiate god whose controversy with
your house has been but too visible or recover
the affections the people england in whose
eyes such actions are an abomination i leave to
your own royal mind to consider
ol iii d
 woodstock
diaries paused struck with a turn to the conversation
which placed his own interests more in
collision with the gratification his present passion
than he had supposed
if your majesty said alice curtseying
deeply has no farther commands for my attendance
may i be permitted to withdraw 
stay yet a little strange and impracticable
girl said the king and answer me but one
question is it the lowness my present fortunes
that makes my suit contemptible 
i have nothing to conceal my liege she
said and my answer shall be as plain and direct
as the question you have asked if i could
have been moved to an act ignominious insane
and ungrateful folly it could only arise from my
being blinded by that passion which i believe is
pleaded as an excuse for folly and for crime much
more often than it has a real existence i must
in short have been in love as it is called and
that might have been with my equal but surely
never with my sovereign whether such only intitle
or in possession his kingdom
 yet loyalty was ever the pride almost the
wnoijstork ol
ruling passion your family alice said the
king
and could i reconcile that loyalty said
alice with indulging my sovereign by permitting
him to prosecute a suit dishonourable to himself
as to me ought i as a faithful subject to
join him in a folly which might throw yet another
stumblingblock in the path to his restoration
and could only serve to diminish his security
even if he were seated upon his throne 
at this rate said charles discontentedly
 i had better have retained my character the
page than assumed that a sovereign which it
seems is still more irreconcilable with my wishes
my candour shall go still farther said alice
i could have felt as little for louis kerneguy
as for the heir britain for such love as i have
to bestow and it is not such as i read in romance
or hear poured forth in song has been
already conferred on another object this gives
your majesty pain i am sorry for it but the
wholesome medicines are often bitter
yes answered the king with some asperity
 and physicians arc reasonable enough to 
woodstock
pet their patients to swallow them as if they
were honeycomb it is true then that whispered
tale the cousin colonel and the daughter
 the loyal lee has set her heart upon a rebellious
fanatic 
 my love was given ere i knew what these
words fanatic and rebel meant i recalled it not
for i am satisfied that amidst the great distractions
which divide the kingdom the person to
whom you allude has chosen his part erroneously
perhaps but conscientiously he therefore has
still the highest place in my affection and esteem
more he cannot have and will not ask until some
happy turn shall reconcile these public differences
and my father be once more reconciled to him
devoutly do i pray that such an event may occur
by your majesty s speedy and unanimous restoration

 you have found out a reason said the
king pettishly to make me detest the thought
 such a change nor have you alice any sincere
interest to pray for it on the contrary do
you not see that your lover walking side by side
with cromwell may or rather must share lii
woodstock 
power nay if lambert does not anticipate him
he may trip up oliver's heels and reign in his
stead and think you not he will find means to
overcome the pride the loyal lees and achieve
an union for which things are better prepared than
that which cromwell is said to meditate betwixt
one his brat and the no less loyal heir fauconcern

your majesty said alice has found a
way at length to avenge yourself if what i have
said deserves vengeance
i could point out a yet shorter road to your
union said charles without minding her distress
or perhaps enjoying the pleasure retaliation
 suppose that you sent your colonel word
that there was one charles stuart here who had
come to disturb the saints in their peaceful government
which they had acquired by prayer
and preaching pike and gun and suppose he
had the art to bring down a halfscore troopers
quite enough as times go to decide the fate 
this heir royalty think you not the possession
 such a prize as this might obtain from the
bumpers or from cromwell such a reward as
 woodstock
might overcome your father's objections to a
roundhead's alliance and place the fair alice and
her cousin colonel in full possession their
wishes 
my lord said alice her cheeks glowing and
her eyes sparkling for she too had her share 
the hereditary temperament her family this
passes my patience i have heard without expressing
anger the most ignominious persuasions
addressed to myself and i have vindicated myself
for refusing to be the paramour a fugitive
prince as if i had been excusing myself from accepting
a share an actual crown but can you
think i can hear all who are dear to me slandered
without emotion or reply i will not sir and
were you seated with all the terrors your father's
starchamber around you you should hear
me defend the absent and the innocent my
father i will say nothing but that if he is now
without wealth without state almost without a
sheltering home and needful food it is because he
spent all in the service the king he needed
not to commit any act treachery or villainy to
obtain wealth he had an ample competence in
wooisiock 
his own possessions for markham everard he
knows no such thing as selfishness he would not
for broad england had she the treasures peru
in her bosom and a paradise on her surface do a
deed that would disgrace his own name or injure
the feelings another kings my lord may
take a lesson from him my lord for the present
i take my leave
alice alice stay exclaimed the king
 she is gone this must be virtue real disinterested
overawing virtue or there is no such
thing on earth yet wilmot and villiers will
not believe a word it but add the tale to the
other wonders woodstock tis a rare wench 
and i profess to use the colonel's obtestation
that i know not whether to forgive and be friends
with her or study a dire revenge if it were not
for that accursed cousin that puritan colonel
i could forgive everything else to so noble a
wench but a roundheaded rebel preferred to me
the preference avowed to my face and justified
with the assertion that a king might take a lesson
from him it is gall and wormwood if the old
man had not come up this morning as he did the
 woodstock
king should have taken or given a lesson and a
severe one it was a mad rencontre to venture
upon with my rank and responsibility and yet
this wench has made me so angry with her and
so envious him that if an opportunity offered
i should scarce be able to forbear him ha 
whom have we here 
the interjection at the conclusion this royal
soliloquy was occasioned by the unexpected entrance
 another personage the drama
woodstock 
chapter iii
benedict shall i speak a word in your ear 
claudia god bless me from a challenge
much ado about nothing
as charles was about to leave the apartment
he was prevented by the appearance wildrake
who entered with an unusual degree swagger
in his gait and fantastic importance on
his brow i crave your pardon fair sir he
said but as they say in my country when
doors are open dogs enter i have knocked and
called in the hall to no purpose so knowing the
way to this parlour sir for i am a light partizan
and the road i once travel i never forget
i ventured to present myself unannounced
 sir henry lee is abroad sir i believe in
the chase said charles coldly for the appearance
 this somewhat vulgar debauchee was not
agreeable to him at the moment and master
 woodstock
albert lee has left the lodge for two or three
days
i am aware it sir said wildrake but
i have no business at present with either
and with whom is your business said
charles that is if i may be permitted to ask
since i think it cannot in possibility be with
me
pardon me in turn sir answered the cavalier
 in no possibility can it be imparted to any
other but yourself if you be as i think you are
though in something better habit master louis
girnigo the scottish gentleman who waits upon
master albert lee
i am all you are like to find for him answered
charles
in truth said the cavalier i do perceive
a difference but rest and better clothing will do
much and i am glad it since i would be
sorry to have brought a message such as i am
charged with to a tatterdemalion
let us get to the business sir if you please
said the king you have a message for me
you say 
woodstock 
true sir replied wildrake i am the
friend colonel markham everard sir a tall
man and a worthy person in the field although
i could wish him a better cause a message i
have to you it is certain in a slight note which
i take the liberty presenting with the usual
formalities so saying he drew his sword put
the billet he mentioned upon the point and making
a profound bow presented it to charles
the disguised monarch accepted it with a
grave return the salute and said as he was
about to open the letter i am not i presume
to expect friendly contents in an epistle presented
in so hostile a manner 
a hem sir replied the ambassador clearing
his voice while he arranged a suitable answer
in which the mild strain diplomacy might
be properly maintained not utterly hostile i
suppose sir is the invitation though it be such as
must be construed in the commencement rather
bellicose and pugnacious i trust sir we shall
find that a few thrusts will make a handsome conclusion
 the business and so as my old master
used to say pax nascitur ex bello for my own
 woodstock
poor share i am truly glad to have been graced
by my friend markham everard in this matter 
the rather as i feared the puritan principles with
which he is embued i will confess the truth to
you worthy sir might have rendered him unwilling
from certain scruples to have taken the
gentlemanlike mode righting himself in such
a case as the present and as i render a friend's
duty to my friend so i humbly hope master
louis girnigo that i do no injustice to you in
preparing the way for the proposed meeting
where give me leave to say i trust that if no
fatal accident occur we shall be all better friends
when the skirmish is over than we were before it
began
i should suppose so sir in any case said
charles looking at the letter worse than mortal
enemies we can scarce be and it is that footing
upon which this billet places us
 you say true sir said wildrake it is
sir a cartel introducing to a single combat for
the pacific object restoring a perfect good understanding
betwixt the survivors in case that
fortunately that word can be used in the plural
after the event the meeting
woodstock 
in short wc only fight i suppose replied
the king that we may come to a perfectly
good and amicable understanding
you are right again sir and i thank you for
the clearness your apprehension said wildrake
 ah sir it is easy to do with a person 
honour and intellect in such a case as this and
i beseech you sir as a personal kindness to myself
that as the morning is like to be frosty and
myself am in some sort rheumatic as war will
leave its scars behind sir i say i will entreat
 you to bring with you some gentleman honour
who will not disdain to take a part what
is going forward a sort potluck sir with
a poor old soldier like myself that we may take
no harm by standing unoccupied during such
cold weather
i understand sir replied charles if this
matter goes forward be assured i will endeavour
to provide you with a suitable opponent
i will remain greatly indebted to you sir
said wildrake and i am by no means curious
about the quality my antagonist it is true
i write myself esquire and gentleman and should
woodstock
account myself especially honoured by crossing
my sword with that sir henry or master
albert lee but should that not be convenient
i will not refuse to present my poor person in
opposition to any gentleman who has served the
king which i always hold as a sort letters 
nobility in itself and therefore would on no account
decline the duello with such a person
the king is much obliged to you sir said
charles for the honour you do his faithful
subjects
o sir i am scrupulous on that point very
scrupulous when there is a roundhead in
question i consult the herald's books to see
that he is entitled to bear arms as is master
markham everard without which i promise
you i had borne none his cartel but a cavalier
is with me a gentleman course be his
birth ever so low his loyalty has ennobled his
condition
it is well sir said the king this paper
requests me to meet master everard at six
tomorrow morning at the tree called the king's
oak i object neither to place nor time he
proffers the sword at which he says we possess
woodstock 
some equality i do not decline the weapon 
for company two gentlemen i shall endeavour
to procure myself an associate and a suitable
partner for you sir if you incline to join in die
dance
i kiss your hand sir and rest yours under
a sense obligation answered the envoy
i thank you sir continued the king i
will therefore be ready at place and time and
suitably furnished and i will either give your
friend such satisfaction with my sword as he requires
or will render him such cause for not doing
so as he shall be contented with
you will excuse me sir said wildrake
if my mind is too dull under the circumstances
to conceive any alternative that can remain betwixt
two men honour in such a case excepting
sa sa he threw himself into a fencing
position and made a pass with his sheathed
rapier but not directed towards the person 
the king whom he addressed
excuse me sir said charles if i do not
trouble your intellects with consideration a
case which may not occur but for example
woodstock
i may plead urgent employment on the part 
the public this he spoke in a low and mysterious
tone voice which wildrake appeared
perfectly to comprehend for he laid his forefinger
on his nose with what he meant for a very
intelligent and apprehensive nod
sir said he if you be engaged in any
affair for the king ray friend shall have every
reasonable degree patience nay i will fight
him myself in your stead merely to stay his stomach
rather than you should be interrupted 
and sir if you can find room in your enterprise
for a poor gentleman that has followed langford
and goring you have but to name day time
and place rendezvous for truly sir i am
tired the scald hat cropped hair and undertakers's
cloak with which my friend has bedizened
me and would willingly ruffle it out once
more in the king's cause when whether i be
banged or hanged i care not
i shall remember what you say sir should
an opportunity occur said the king and i
wish his majesty had many such subjects i
presume our business is now settled 
woodstock 
when you shall have been pleased sir to
give me a trifling scrap writing to serve for my
credentials for such you know is the custom 
your written cartel hath its written answer
that sir will i presently do said charles
and in good time here are the materials
and sir continued the envoy ahi 
ahem if you have interest in the household
for a cup sack i am a man few words
and am somewhat hoarse with much speaking
moreover a serious business this kind always
makes one thirsty besides sir to part
with dry lips argues malice which god forbid
should exist in such an honourable conjuncture
i do not boast much influence in the house
sir said the king but if you would have the
condescension to accept this broad piece towards
quenching your thirst at the george 
sir said the cavalier for the times admitted
 this strange species courtesy nor was
wildrake a man such peculiar delicacy as
keenly to dispute the matter i am once again
beholden to you but i see not how it consists
vol in e
 woodstock
with my honour to accept such accommodation
unless you were to accompany and partake
pardon me sir replied charles my safety
recommends that i remain rather private at
present
enough said wildrake observed poor
cavaliers must not stand on ceremony i see sir
you understand cutter's law when one tall fellow
has coin another must not be thirsty i wish
you sir a continuance health and happiness
until tomorrow at the king's oak at six o'clock
farewell sir said the king and added as
wildrake went down the stair whistling hey
for cavaliers to which air his long rapier jarring
against the steps and bannisters bore no unsuitable
burthen farewell thou too just emblem
 the state to which war and defeat and despair
have reduced many a gallant gentleman
during the rest the day there occurred nothing
peculiarly deserving notice alice sedulously
avoided showing towards the disguised
prince any degree estrangement or shyness
which could be discovered by her father or by
any one else to all appearance the two young
woodstock 
persons continued on the same footing in every
respect yet she made the gallant himself sensible
that this apparent intimacy was assumed
merely to save appearances and in no way designed
as retracting from the severity with which
she had rejected his suit the sense that this
was the case joined to his injured selflove and
his enmity against a successful rival induced
charles early to withdraw himself to a solitary
walk in the wilderness where like hercules in
the emblem ceres divided betwixt the personifications
 virtue and pleasure he listened
alternately to the voice wisdom and passionate
folly
prudence urged to him the importance his
own life to the future prosecution the great object
in which he had for the present miscarried 
the restoration monarchy in england the rebuilding
 the throne the regaining the crown 
his father the avenging his death and restoring
to their fortunes and their country the numerous
exiles who were suffering poverty and banishment
on account their attachment to his cause pride
too or rather a just and natural sense dignity
woodstock
displayed the unworthiness a prince descending
to actual personal conflict with a subject any
degree and the ridicule which would be thrown
on his memory should he lose his life for an obscure
intrigue by the hand a private gentleman
what would his sage counsellors nicholas
and hyde what would his kind and wise governor
the marquis hertford say to such an act
 rashness and folly would it not be likely to
shake the allegiance the staid and prudent persons
 the royalist party since wherefore should
they expose their lives and estates to raise to the
government a kingdom a young man who could
not command his own temper to this was to
be added the consideration that even his success
would add double difficulties to his escape which
already seemed sufficiently precarious if stopping
short death he merely had the better 
his antagonist how did he know that he might
not seek revenge b delivering up to government
the malignant louis kerneguy whose real character
could not in that case fail to be discovered 
these considerations strongly recommended to
charles that he should clear himself the chap
woodstock 
ienge without fighting and the reservation under
which he had accepted it afforded him some
opportunity doing so
but passion also had her arguments which she
addressed to a temper rendered irritable by recent
distress and mortification in the first place
if he was a prince he was also a gentleman entitled
to resent as such and obliged to give or
claim the satisfaction expected on occasion 
differences among gentlemen with englishmen
she urged he could never lose interest by
showing himself ready instead sheltering himself
under his royal birth and pretensions to
come frankly forward and maintain what he
had done or said on his own responsibility ina
free nation it seemed as if he would rather
gain than lose in the public estimation by a conduct
which could not but seem gallant and generous
then a character for courage was far
more necessary to support his pretensions than
any other kind reputation and the lying under
a challenge viithout replying to it might
bring his spirit into question what would valleys
and wilmot say an intrigue in which he
 woodstock
had allowed himself to be shamefully baffled by
a country girl and had failed to revenge himself
on the rival the pasquinades which they would
compose the witty sarcasms which they would
circulate on the occasion would be harder to endure
than the grave rebukes hertford hyde
and nicholas this reflection added to the stings
 youthful and awakened courage at length
fixed his resolution and he returned to woodstock
determined to keep his appointment come
 it what might
perhaps there mingled with his resolution a
secret belief that such a rencontre would not
prove fatal he was in the flower his youth
active in all his exercises and no way inferior to
colonel everard as far as the morning's experiment
had gone in that selfdefence at least
such recollection might pass through his royal
mind as he hummed to himself a wellknown
ditty which he had picked up during his residence
in scotland
a man may drink and not be drunk
a man may fight and not be slain 
a man may kiss a bonnie lass
and yet be welcome back again
woodstock 
meanwhile the busy and alldirecting doctor
rochecliffe had contrived to intimate to alice
that she must give him a private audience and
she found him by appointment in what was called
the study once filled with ancient books which
long since converted into cartridges had made
more noise in the world at their final exit than
during the space which had intervened betwixt
that and their first publication the doctor
seated himself in a highbacked leathern easychair
and signed to alice to fetch a stool and sit
down beside him
alice said the old man taking her hand affectionately
 thou art a good girl a wise girl a virtuous
girl one those whose price is above rubies
not that rubies is the proper translationbut
remind me to tell you that another time alice
thou knowest who this louis kerneguy islay
hesitate not to me i know everything i am
well aware the whole matter thou knowest
this honoured house holds the fortunes england
alice was about to answer nay speak
not but listen to me alice how does he bear
himself towards you 
 woodstock
alice coloured with the deepest crimsoned i
am a countrybred girl she said and his manners
are too courtlike for me
enough said i know it all alice he is
exposed to a great danger tomorrow and you
must be the happy means to prevent him
 i prevent him how and in what manner 
said alice in surprise it is my duty as a
subject to do anything anything that may become
my father's daughters
here she stopped considerably embarrassed
yes continued the doctor tomorrow he
hath made an appointment an appointment with
markham everard the hour and place are setsix
in the morning by the kings oak if they
meet one will probably fall
now may god forefend they should meet
said alice turning as suddenly pale as she had
previously reddened but harm cannot come 
it everard will never lift his sword against the
king
for that said doctor rochechffe i
would not warrant but if that unhappy young
gentleman shall have still some reserve the
woodstock 
loyalty which his general conduct entirely disavows
it would not serve us here for he knows
not the king but considers him merely as a cavalier
from whom he has received injury
let him know the truth doctor rochecliffs
let him know it instantly said alice he
lift hand against the king a fugitive and defenceless
 he is incapable it my life on the
issue he becomes most active in his preservation

 that is the thought a maiden alice
answered the doctor and as i fear a maiden
whose wisdom is misled by her affections it
were worse than treason to admit a rebel officer
the friend the archtraitor cromwell into so
great a secret i dare not answer for such rashness
hammond was trusted by his father and
you know what came it
then let my father know he will meet markham
or send to him representing the indignity
done to him by attacking his guest
we dare not let your father into the secret
who louis kerneguy really is i did but hint
 woodstock
the possibility charles taking refuge at woodstock
and the rapture into which sir henry broke
out the preparations for accommodation and defence
which he began to talk plainly showed
that the mere enthusiasm his loyalty would
have led to a risk discovery it is you alice
who must save the hopes every true royalist
i answered alice it is impossible 
why cannot my father be induced to interfere
as in behalf his friend and guest though he
know him as no other than louis kerneguy 
you have forgot your father's character my
young friend said the doctor an excellent
man and the best christians till there is a
clashing swords and then he starts up the
complete martialist as deaf to every pacific reasoning
as if he were a gamecock
you forget doctor rochechffe said alice
that this very morning if i understand the
thing aright my father prevented them from
fighting
ay answered the doctor because he deemed
himself bound to keep the peace in the royal
park but it was done with such regret alice
woodstock 
that should he find them at it again i am clear
to foretell he will only so far postpone the combat
as to conduct them to some unprivileged
ground and there bid them tilt and welcome
while he regaled his eyes with a scene so pleasing
no alice it is you and you only who can
help us in this extremity
 i see no possibility said she again colouring
 how i can be the least use
you must send a note answered doctor
rochecliffe to the king a note such as all
women know how to write better than any man
can teach them to meet you at the precise hour
 the rendezvous he will not fail you for i
know his unhappy foible
doctor rochecliffe said alice gravely
you have known me from infancy what have
you seen in me to induce you to believe that i
should ever follow such unbecoming counsel 
 and if you have known me from infancy
retorted the doctor what have you seen me
that you should suspect me giving counsel to
my friend's daughter which it would be misbecoming
in her to follow you cannot be foot
 woodstock
enough i think to suppose that i mean you
should carry your complaisance farther than to
keep him in discourse for an hour or two till i
have all in readiness for his leaving this place
from which i can fright him by the terrors an
alleged search so c s mounts his horse and
rides off and mistress alice lee has the honour
 saving him
yes at the expense her own reputation
said auce and the risk an eternal stain on
my family you say you know all what can
the king think my appointing an assignation
with him after what has passed and how will it
be possible to disabuse him respecting the purpose
 my doing so 
i will disabuse him alice i will explain
the whole
doctor rochecliffe said alice you propose
what is impossible you can do much by
your ready wit and great wisdom but if newfallen
snow were once sullied not all your art
could wash it white again and it is altogether
the same with a maiden's reputation
alice my dearest child said the doctor
woodstock 
 bethink you that if i recommend this means 
saving the ife the king at least rescuing him
from instant peril it is because i see no other 
which to avail myself if i bid you assume even
for a moment the semblance what is wrong
it is but in the last extremity and under circumstances
which cannot return i will take the
surest means to prevent all evil report which can
arise from what i recommend
say not so doctor said alice better
undertake to turn back the isis than to stop the
course calumny the king will make boast
to his whole licentious court the ease with
which but for a sudden alarm he could have
brought off alice lee as a paramour the mouth
which confers honour on others will then be the
means to deprive me mine take a fitter
course one more becoming your own character
and profession do not lead him to fail in an
engagement honour by holding out the prospect
 another engagement equally dishonourable
whether false or true go to the king himself
speak to him as the servants god have a
right to speak even to earthly sovereigns point
 woodstock
out to him the folly and the wickedness the
course he is about to pursue urge upon him
that he fear the sword since wrath bringeth the
punishment the sword tell him that the
friends who died for him in the field at worcester
on the scaffolds and on the gibbets since
that bloody day that the remnant who are in
prison scattered fled and ruined on his account
deserve better him and his father's race than
that he should throw away his life in an idle
brawl tell him that it is dishonest to venture
that which is not his own dishonourable to betray
the trust which brave men have reposed in
his virtue and in his courage
doctor rochecliffe looked on her with a melancholy
smile his eyes glistening as he said
alas alice even i could not plead that just
cause to him so eloquently or so impressively as
thou dost but alack charles would listen to
neither it is not from priests or women he
would say that men should receive counsel in
affairs honour
then hear me doctor rochecliffe i will
appear at the place rendezvous and i will
woodstock 
prevent the combat do not fear that i can do
what i say at a sacrifice indeed but not that
 my reputation my heart may be broken
she endeavoured to stifle her sobs with difficulty
 for the consequence but not in the imagination
 a man and far less that man her sovereign
shall a thought alice lee be associated
with dishonour she hid her face in her handkerchief
and burst out into unrestrained tears
what means this hysterical passion said
doctor rochecliffe surprised and somewhat
alarmed by the vehemence her grief maiden
i must have no concealments i must know
 exert your ingenuity then and discover
it said alice for a moment displeased at the
doctor's pertinacious selfimportance guess
my purpose as you can guess at everything
else it is enough to have to go through my
task i will not endure the distress telling it
over and that to one who forgive me dear
doctor might not think ray agitation on this
occasion fully warranted
nay then my young mistress you must be
ruled said rochecliffe and if i cannot make

 woodstock
you explain yourself i must see whether your
father can gain so far on you so saying he
arose somewhat displeased and walked towards
the door
you forget what you yourself told me doctor
rochecliffe said alice the risk communicating
this great secret to my father
it is too true he said stopping short and
turning round and i think wench thou art
too smart for me and i have not met many such
but thou art a good girl and wilt tell me thy
device freewill it concerns my character and
influence with the king that i should be fully 
acquainted with whatever is actum atque tracts
done and treated in this matter
trust your character to me good doctor
said alice attempting to smile it is firmer
stuff than those women and will be safer in my
custody than mine could have been in yours
and thus much i condescend you shall see the
whole scene you shall go with me yourself and
much will i feel emboldened and heartened by
your company
woodstock 
that is something said the doctor though
not altogether satisfied with this limited confidence
 thou wert ever a clever wench and i
will trust thee indeed trust thee i find i must
whether voluntarily or no
meet me then said alice in the wilderness
tomorrow but first tell me are you well
assured time and place a mistake were fatal

assure yourself my information is entirely
accurate said the doctor resuming his air 
consequence which had been a little diminished
during the latter part their conference
may i ask said alice through what channel
you acquired such important information 
you may ask unquestionably he answered
now completely restored to his supremacy but
whether i will answer or not is a very different
question i conceive neither your reputation
nor my own are interested in your remaining in
ignorance on that subject so i have my secrets
as well as you mistress and some them i
fancy are a good deal more worth knowing
be it so said alice quietly if you will
vol ill f
 woodstock
meet me in the wilderness by the broken dial at
half past five exactly we will go together tomorrow
and watch them as they come to the rendezvous
i will on the way get the better my
present timidity and explain to you the means i
design to employ to prevent mischief you can
perhaps think making some effort which may
render my interference unbecoming and painful
as it must be altogether unnecessary
nay my child said the doctor if you
place yourself in my hands you will be the first
that ever had reason to complain my want 
conduct and you may well judge you are the
very last one excepted whom i would see suffer
for want counsel at half past five then at
the dial in the wilderness and god bless our undertaking

here their interview was interrupted by the
sonorous voice sir henry lee which shouted
their names daughter alice doctor rochecliffs
through passage and gallery
what do you here said he entering sitting
like two crows in a mist when we have such
rare sport below here is this wild crackbrained
woodstock 
boy louis kerneguy now making me laugh till
my sides are fit to split and now playing on his
guitar sweetly enough to win a lark from the
heavens come away with you come away it
is hard work to laugh alone
 wood stock
chapter 
this is the iiacc the centre the grove 
here stands the oak the monarch the wood
john home
the sun had risen on the broad boughs 
the forest but without the power penetrating
into its recesses which hung rich with heavy
dewdrops and were beginning on some the
trees to exhibit the varied tints autumn it
being the season when nature ike a prodigal
whose race is well nigh run seems desirous to
make up in profuse gaiety and variety colours
for the short space which her splendour has then
to endure the birds were silent and even
robinredbreast whose chirruping song was
woodstock 
heard among the bushes near the lodge emboldened
by the largesses with which the good old
knight always encouraged his familiarity did not
venture into the recesses the wood alarmed
by the neighbourhood the sparrowhawk and
other enemies a similar description preferring
the vicinity the dwellings man from whom
he almost solely among the feathered tribes
seems to experience disinterested protection
the scene was therefore at once lovely and silent
when the good doctor rochechife wrapped
in a scarlet roquelair which had seen service in
its day muffling his face more from habit than
necessity and supporting alice on his arm she
also defended by a cloak against the cold and
damp the autumn morning glided through
the tangled and long grass the darkest alleys
almost ancledeep in dew towards the place appointed
for the intended duel both so eagerly
maintained the consultation in which they were
engaged that they were alike insensible the
roughness and discomforts the road though
often obliged to force their way through brushwood
and coppice which poured down on thciii
 woodstock
all the liquid pearls with which they were loaded
till the mantles they were wrapped in hung
lank by their sides and clung to their shoulders
heavily charged with moisture they stopped
when they had attained a station under the
coppice and shrouded by it from which they
could see all that passed on the little esplanade
before the king's oak whose broad and scathed
form contorted and shattered limbs and frowning
brows made him appear like some ancient
warworn champion well selected to be the umpire
 a field single combat
the first person who appeared at the rendezvous
was the gay cavalier roger wildrake he
also was wrapped in his cloak but had discarded
his puritanic beaver and wore in its stead a spanish
hat with a feather and gilt hatband all 
which had encountered bad weather and hard
service but to make amends for the appearance
 poverty by the show pretension the castor
was accurately adjusted after what was rather
profanely called the d mme cut used among
the more desperate cavaliers he came very hastily
and exclaimed aloud first in the field
woodstock t
after all by jove though i bilked everard in
order to have my morning draught it has done
me much good he added smacking his lips
well i suppose i should search the ground
ere my principal comes up whose presbyterian
watch trudges as slow as his presbyterian step
he took his rapier from under his cloak and
seemed about to search the thickets around
i will prevent him whispered the doctor
to alice i will keep faith with you you
shall not come on the scene nisi dignus venice
nodus i'll explain that another time vindex
is feminine as well as masculine so the quotation
is defensible keep you close
so saying he stepped forward on the esplanade
and bowed to wiidrake
master louis kerneguy said wiidrake
pulling off his hat but instantly discovering his
error he added but no i beg your pardon
sir fatter shorter older mr kerneguy's
friend i suppose with whom i hope to have a
turn by and by and why not now sir before
our principals come up just a snack to stay the
orifice the stomach till the dinner is served
sir what say you r
 woodstock
to open the orifice the stomach more likely
or to give it a new one said the doctor
 true sir said roger who seemed now in
his element you say well that is as thereafter
may be but come sir you wear your face muffled
i grant you it is honest men's fashion at
this unhappy time the more is the pity but we
do all above board we have no traitors here
i'll get into my gears first to encourage you and
show you that you have to deal with a gentleman
who honours the king and is a match fit to fight
with any who follows him as doubtless you do
sir since you are the friend master louis kern

all this while wildrake was busied undoing
the clasps his squarecaped cloak
 oft off ye lending he said borrowings
i should more properly call you 
via the curtain which shadow'd borgia 
so saying he threw the cloak from him and
appeared in cuerpo in a most cavalierlike doublet
 greasy crimson satin pinked and slashed
with what had been once white tiffany breeches
 the same and nclherstocks or as we now call
woods rock 
iceni stockings darned in many places and which
like those point had been once peachcoloured
a pair pumps ill calculated for a walk
through the dew and a broad shoulderbelt 
tarnished embroidery completed his equipment
 come sir he exclaimed make haste off
with your slough here i stand tight and true
as loyal a lad as ever stuck rapier through a
roundhead come sir to your tools he continued
 we may have halfadozen thrusts before
they come yet and shame them for their tardiness 
pshaw he exclaimed in a most disappointed
tone when the doctor unfolding his cloak showed
his clerical dress tush it's burt the parson
after all 
wildrake's respect for the church however
and his desire to remove one who might possibly
interrupt a scene to which he looked forward
with peculiar satisfaction induced him presently
to assume another tone
i beg pardon he said my dear doctor
i kiss the hem your cassock i do by the
thundering jove i beg your pardon again 
jut i am happy i have met with you they
arc initio for your presence a the i
said the doctor i wait for master louis kern

the devil you do exclaimed wildrake
why i always knew the scots could do nothing
without their minister but d n it i never
thought they put them to this use neither
but i have known jolly customers in orders who
wooustock 
understood to handle the sword as well as their
prayerbook you know the purpose our
meeting doctor do you come only as a ghostly
comforter or as a surgeon perhapsor do you
ever take bilboa in hand sa sa 
here he made a fencing demonstration with
his sheathed rapier
i have done so sir on necessary occasion
said doctor rochecliffe
good sir let this stand for a necessary one
said wildrake you know my devotion for
the church if a divine your skill would dome
the honour to exchange but three passes with
me i should think myself happy for ever
sir said rochecliffe smiling were there
no other objection to what you propose i have
not the means i have no weapon
what you want the de quoi that is unlucky
indeed but you have a stout cane in your
hand what hinders our trying a pass my rapier
being sheathed course until our principals
come up my pumps are full this frostdew
 and i shall be a toe or two out pocket
if i am to stand still all the time they are stretches
voustock
ing themselves for i fancy doctor you will be
 my opinion that the matter will not be a fight
 cocksparrows
my business here is to make it if possible
be no fight at all said the divine
now rat me doctor but that is too spiteful
said wildrake and were it not for my
respect for the church i could turn presbyterian
to be revenged
stand back a little if you please sir said
the doctor do not press forward in that direction
 for wildrake in the agitation his
movements induced by his disappointment approached
the spot where alice remained still concealed

and wherefore not i pray you doctor
said the cavalier
but on advancing a step he suddenly stopped
short and muttered to himself with a round oath
 astonishment a petticoat in the coppice by
all that is reverend and at this hour in the morning
 wheiv ew ew he gave vent to his
surprise in a long low interjectional whistle then
turning to the doctor with his finger on the side
woodstock 

 his nose youve sly doctor d d sly but
why not give me a hint your your commodity
there your contraband goods gad sir i
am not a man to expose the eccentricities the
church
sir said doctor rochecliffe you are impertinent
 and if time served and it were worth
my while i would chastise you
and the doctor who had served long enough
in the wars to have added some the qualities
 a captain horse to those the divine actually
raised his cane to the infinite delight 
the rake whose respect for the church was by no
means able to subdue his love mischief
nay doctor said he if you wield your
weapon backswordfashion in that way and raise
it as high as your head i shall be through you
in a twinkling so saying he made a pass with
his sheathed rapier not precisely at the doctor's
person but in that direction when rochecliffe
changing the direction his cane from the broadsword
guard to that the rapier made the cavaliers
sword spring ten yards out his hand
with all the dexterity my friend francalanza
 woodstock
at this moment both the principal parties appeared
on the field
everard exclaimed angrily to wildrake is
this your friendship in heaven's name what
make you in that doors jacket and playing the
pranks a jackpudding while his worthy second
somewhat crestfallen held down his head
like a boy caught in roguery and went to pick up
his weapon stretching his head as he passed into
the coppice to obtain another glimpse if possible
 the concealed object his curiosity
charles in the meantime still more surprised
at what he beheld called out on his part
 what doctor rochecliffe become literally one
 the church militant and tilting with my friend
cavalier wildrake may i use the freedom to
ask him to withdraw as colonel everard and i
have some private business to settle
it was doctor rochecliffes cue on this important
occasion to have armed himself with the
authority his sacred office and used a tone 
interference which might have overawed even a
monarch and made him feel that his monitor
spoke by a warrant higher than his own but the
woodstock 
indiscreet latitude lie had just given to his own
passion and the levity in which he had been detected
were very unfavourable to his assuming
that superiority to which so uncontrollable a spirit
as that charles wilful as a prince and
capricious as a wit was at all likely to submit
the doctor did however endeavour to rally his
dignity and replied with the gravest and at the
same time the most respectful tone he could assume
that he also had business the most urgent
nature which prevented him from complying
with master kerneguy's wishes and leaving
that spot
excuse this untimely interruption said
charles taking off his hat and bowing to colonel
everard which i will immediately put an
 to
everard gravely returned his salute and was
silent
are you mad doctor rochecliff'e said
charles or are you deaf or have you forgotten
your mothertongue i desired you to
leave this place
i am not mad said the divine rousing up
c woodstofif
his resolution and regaining the natural firmness
 his voice i would prevent others from being
so i am not deaf i would pray others to
hear the voice reason and religion i have
not forgotten my mothertongue but i have
come hither to speak the language the master
 kings and princes
to fence with broomsticks i should rather
suppose said the king come doctor rochecliffs
this sudden fit assumed importance befits
you as little as your late frolic you are not
i apprehend either a catholic priest or a scotch
mass john to claim devoted obedience from
your hearers but a church englishman
subject to the rules that communion and to
its head in speaking the last words the king
lowered his voice to a low and impressive whisper
everard observing this drew back the natural
generosity his temper directing him to avoid
overhearing private discourse in which the safety
 the speakers might be deeply concerned
they continued however to observe great caution
in their forms expression
master kerneguy said the clergyman it
woodstock 
is not i who assume authority or control over
your wishes god forbid i do but tell you
what reason scripture religion and morality
alike prescribe for your rule conduct
and i doctor said the king smiling and
pointing to the unlucky cane will take your
example rather than your precept if a reverend
clergyman will himself fight a bout at singlestick
what right can he have to interfere in gentlemen's
quarrels come sir remove yourself
and do not let your present obstinacy cancel former
obligations
bethink yourself said the divine i can
say one word which will prevent all this
 do it replied the king and in doing
so belie the whole tenor and actions an honourable
life abandon the principles your
church and become a perjured traitor and an
apostate to prevent another person from discharging
his duty as a gentleman this were indeed
killing your friend to prevent the risk 
his running himself into danger let the passive
obedience which is so often in your mouth
and no doubt in your head put your feet for
vol m c
 woodstock
once into motion and step aside for ten minutes
within that space your assistance may be needed
either as bodycurer or soulcurer
nay then said doctor rochechffe i have
but one argument left
while this conversation was carried on apart
everard had almost forcibly detained by his
own side his follower wildrake whose greater
curiosity and lesser delicacy would otherwise
have thrust him forward to get if possible into
the secret but when he saw the doctor turn into
the coppice he whispered eagerly to everard
 a gold carolus to a commonwealth farthing
the doctor has not only come to preach a peace
but has brought the principal conditions along
with him 
everard made no answer he had already
unsheathed his sword and charles hardly saw
rochecliffe's back fairly turned than he lost no
time in following his example but ere they
had done more than salute each other with the
usual courteous flourish their weapons doctor
rochecliffe again stood between them leading
in his hand alice lee her garments dank
woodstock 
with lew and her long hair heavy with moisture
and totally uncurled her face was extremely
pale but it was the paleness desperate
resolution not fear there was a dead
pause astonishment the combatants rested
on their swords and even the forwardness 
wildrake only vented itself in half suppressed
ejaculations as well done doctor this beats
the parson among the pease no less than
your patron's daughter and mistress alice
whom i thought a very snowdrop turned out a
dogviolet after all a lindabrides by heavens
and altogether one ourselves 
excepting these unheeded muttering alice
was the first to speak
master everard she said master kern
you are surprised to see me here yet
why should i not tell the reason at once convinced
that i am however guiltlessly the unhappy
cause your misunderstanding i am too much
interested to prevent fatal consequences to pause
upon any step which may it master kerneguy
have my wishes my entreaties my prayers
have your noble thoughts the recollections 
your own high duties no weight with you in this
woodstock
matter let me entreat you to consult reason
religion and common sense and return your
weapon
 i am obedient as an eastern slave madam
answered charles sheathing his sword but i
assure you the matter about which you distress
yourself is a mere trifle which will be much better
settled betwixt colonel everard and myself
in five minutes than with the assistance the
m'hole convocation the church with a female
parliament to assist their reverend deliberations
mr everard will you oblige me by walking
a little further we must change ground it
seems
i am ready to attend you sir said everard
who had sheathed his sword so soon as his
antagonist did so
i have then no interest with you sir said
alice continuing to address the king do
you not fear i should use the secret in my power
to prevent this affair going to extremity think
you this gentleman who raises his hand against
you if he knew 
if he knew diet i were lord wilmot madam
you would say accident has given him
woodstock 
proof lo that effect with which he is already satisfied
and i think you would find it difficult to
induce him to embrace a different opinion
alice paused and looked on the king with
great indignation the following words dropping
from her mouth by intervals as if they burst forth
one by one in spite feelings that would have
restrained them cold selfish ungrateful 
unkind woe to the land which here
she paused with marked emphasis then added
 which shall number thee or such as thee
among her nobles and rulers 
nay fair alice said charles whose good
nature could not but feel the severity this reproach
though too slightly to make all the desired
impression you are too unjust to me too partial
to a happier man do not call me unkind 
i am but here to answer mr everard's summons
i could neither decline attending nor withdraw
now i am here without loss honour and my
loss honour would be a disgrace which must
extend to many i cannot fly from mr everard
it would be too shameful if he abides by m
los woodstock
message it must be decided as such affairs usually
are if he retreats or yields it up i will for
your sake wave punctilio i will not even ask
an apology for the trouble it has afforded me
but let all pass as if it were the consequence 
some unhappy mistake the grounds which
shall remain on my part inquired into this
i will do for your sake and it is much for a man
 honour to condescend so far you know that
the condescension from me in particular is great
indeed then do not call me ungenerous or
ungrateful or unkind since i am ready to do
all which as a man i can do and more perhaps
than as a man honour i ought to do
do you hear this markham everard exclaimed
alice do you hear this the dreadful
option is left entirely at your disposal you
were wont to be temperate in passion religious
forgiving will you for a mere punctilio drive
on this private and unchristian broil to a murderous
extremity believe me if you now contrary
to all the better principles your life give the
reins to your passions the consequences may be
woodstock 
such as you will rue for your lifetime and even
if heaven have not mercy rue after your life is
finished
markham everard remained for a moment
gloomily silent with his eyes fixed on the ground
at length he looked up and answered her
alice you are a soldier's daughter a soldier's
sister all your relations even including one
whom you then entertained some regard for have
been made soldiers by these unhappy discords
yet you have seen them take the field in some
instances on contrary sides to do their duty where
their principles called them without manifesting
this extreme degree interest answer me 
and your answer shall decide my conduct is
this youth so short while known already more
value to you than those dear connexions father
brother and kinsman whose departure to battle
you saw with comparative indifference say this
and it shall be enough i leave the ground never
to see you or this country again
 stay markham stay and believe me when
i say that if i answer your question in the affirmative
it is because master kerneguy's safety
 woods k
comprehends more much more than that any
 those you have mentioned
 indeed i did not know a coronet had been
so superior in value to the crest a private gentleman
said everard yet i have heard that
many women think so
you apprehend me amiss said alice perplexed
between the difficulty so expressing
herself as to prevent immediate mischief and at
the same time anxious to combat the jealousy
and disarm the resentment which she saw arising
in the bosom her lover but she found no
words fine enough to draw the distinction without
leading to a discovery the king's actual
character and perhaps in consequence to his destruction
 markham she said have compassion
on me press me not at this moment
believe me the honour and happiness my
father my brother and my whole family
are interested in master kerneguy's safety are
inextricably concerned in this matter resting
where it now does
oh ay i doubt not said everard the
house lee ever looked up to nobility and
woodstock 
valued in their connexions the fantastic loyalty
 a courtier beyond the sterling and honest patriotism
 a plain country gentleman for them
the thing is in course but on your part you
alice o on your part whom i have loved so
dearly who have suffered me to think that my
affection was not unpaid can the attractions
 an empty title the idle court compliments 
a mere man quality during only a few hours
lead you to prefer a libertine lord to such a heart
as mine 
no no believe me no said alice in the
extremity distress
put your answer which seems so painful
in one word and say for whose safety it is you
are thus deeply interested 
for both for both said alice
that answer will not serve alice answered
everard here is no room for equality i
must and will know to what i have to trust i
understand not the paltering which makes a
maiden unwilling to decide betwixt two suitors 
nor would i willingly impute to you the vanity
that cannot remain contented with one lover at
once
 woodstock
the vehemence everard's displeasure when
he supposed his own long and sincere devotion
lightly forgotten amid the addresses a profligate
courtier awakened the spirit alice lee
who as we elsewhere said had a portion in her
temper the lionhumour that was characteristic
 her family
 if i am thus misinterpreted she said if
i am not judged worthy the least confidence
or candid construction hear my declaration and
my assurance that strange as my words may
seem they are when truly interpreted such as
do you no wrong i tell you i tell all present
and i tell this gentleman himself who well
knows the sense in which i speak that his life
and safety are or ought to be more value tome
than those any other man in the kingdomnay
in the world be that other who he will
these words she spoke in a tone so firm and
decided as admitted no farther discussion
charles bowed low and with gravity but remained
silent everard his features agitated by
the emotions which his pride barely enabled him
to suppress advanced to his antagonist and said
woodstock 
in a tone which he vainly endeavoured to make
a firm one sir you heard the lady's declaration
with such feelings doubtless gratitude
as the case eminently demands as her
poor kinsman and an unworthy suitor sir i
presume to yield my interest in her to you and
as i will never be the means giving her pain
i trust you will not think i act unworthily in
retracting the letter which gave you the trouble
 attending this place at this hour alice he
said turning his head towards her farewell
alice at once and for ever 
the poor young lady whose adventitious spirit
had almost deserted her attempted to repeat
the word farewell but failing in the attempt only
accomplished a broken and imperfect sound and
would have sunk to the ground but for doctor
rochecliffe who caught her as she fell roger
wildrake also who had twice or thrice put to
his eyes what remained a kerchief interested
by the lady's evident distress though unable to
comprehend the mysterious cause hastened to
assist the divine in supporting so fair a burthen
meanwhile the disguised prince had beheld the
 oolsl' k
whole in silence but with an agitation to which
he was unwonted and which his swarthy features
and still more his motions began to betray
his posture was at first absolutely stationary with
his arms folded on his bosom as one who waits
to be guided by the current events presently
after he shifted his position advanced and retired
his foot clenched and opened his hand and
otherwise showed symptoms that he was strongly
agitated by contending feelings was on the point
too forming some sudden resolution and yet
still in uncertainty what course he should pursue
but when he saw markham everard after
one look unspeakable anguish towards alice
turning his back to depart he broke out into his
familiar ejaculation odds fish i this must not
be in three strides he overtook the slowlyretiring
everard tapped him smartly on the
shoulder and as he turned round said with an
air command which he well knew how to
adopt at pleasure one word with you sir
at your pleasure sir replied everard
and naturally conjecturing the purpose his antagonist
to be hostile took hold his rapier with
woodstock 
the left hand and laid the right on the hilt not
displeased at the supposed call for anger is at
least as much akin to disappointment as pity is
said to be to love
pshaw answered the king that cannot
be now colonel everard i am charles
stuart 
everard recoiled in the greatest surprise and
next exclaimed impossible it cannot be 
the king scots has escaped from bristol 
my lord wilmot your talents for intrigue are
well known but this will not pass upon me
the king scots master everard replied
charles since you are so pleased to limit
his sovereignty at any rate the eldest son
 the late sovereign britain is now before
you therefore it is impossible he could have
escaped from bristol doctor rochecliffe shall
be my voucher and will tell you moreover that
wilmot is a fair complexion and light hair 
mine you may see is swart as a raven
rochecliffe seeing what was passing abandoned
alice to the care wildrake whose extreme
delicacy in the attempts he made to bring
 woodstock
her back to life formed an amiable contrast to
his usual wildness and occupied him so much
that he remained for the moment ignorant the
disclosure in which he would have been so much
interested as for doctor rochecliffe he came
forward wringing his hands in all the demonstration
 extreme anxiety and with the usual ex 
exclamations attending such a state
peace doctor rochecliffe said the king
with such complete selfpossession as indeed became
a prince we are in the hands i am
satisfied a man honour master everard
must be pleased in finding only a fugitive prince
in the person in whom he thought he had discovered
a successful rival he cannot but be aware
 the feelings which prevented me from taking
advantage the cover which this young lady's
devoted loyalty afforded me at the risk her
own happiness he is the party who is to profit
by my candour and certainly i have a right to
expect that my condition already indifferent
enough shall not be rendered worse by his becoming
privy to it under such circumstances at
any rate the avowal is made and it is for cowoodstock
ill
lonely everard to consider how he is to conduct
himself
oh your majesty my liege my king 
my royal prince exclaimed wildrake who
at length discovering what was passing had
crawled on his knees and seizing the king's
hand was kissing it more like a child mumbling
gingerbread or a lover devouring the yielded
hand his mistress than in the manner in which
such salutations pass at court if my dear
friend mark everard should prove a dog on this
occasion rely on me i will cut his throat on the
spot were i to do the same for myself the moment
afterward 
hush hush my good friend and loyal subject
said the king and compose yourself 
for though i am obliged to put on the prince
for a moment we have not privacy or safety to
receive our subjects in king cambyses vein
everard who had stood for a time utterly
confounded awoke at length like a man from a
dream
sire he said bowing low and with profound
deference if i do not offer you the homage 
 woodstock
a subject with knee and sword it is because
god by whom kings reign has denied you for
the present the power ascending your throne
without rekindling civil war for your safety
being endangered by me let not such an imagination
for an instant cross your mind had i
not respected your person were i not bound to
you for the candour with which yovir noble avowal
has prevented the misery my future life your
misfortunes would have rendered your person as
sacred so far as i can protect it as it could be
esteemed by the most devoted royalist in the
kingdom if your plans are soundly considered
and securely laid think that all which is now
passed is but a dream if they are in such a
state that i can aid them saving my duty to the
commonwealth which will permit me to be privy
to no schemes actual violence your majesty
may command my services
it may be i may be troublesome to you
sir said the king for my fortunes are not such
as to permit me to reject even the most limited
offers assistance but if i can i will dispense
with applying to you i would not willingly put
woodstock 
any man's compassion at war with his sense 
duty on my account doctor i think there will
be no farther taking today either with sword or
cane so we may as well return to the lodge
and leave these looking at alice and everard
 who may have more to say in explanation
 no no exclaimed alice who was now perfectly
come to herself and partly by her own observation
partly from the report dr rochecliffs
comprehended all that had taken place
my cousin everard and i have nothing to explain
he will forgive me for having riddled with
him when i dared not speak plainly and i forgive
him for having read my riddle wrong but
my father has my promise we must not correspond
or converse for the present i return instantly
to the lodge and he to woodstock unless
you sire bowing to the king command his
duty otherwise instant to the town cousin
markham and if danger should approach give
us warning
everard would have delayed her departure
would have excused himself for his unjust suspicion
would have said a thousand things but she
vor tit h
 woodstock
would not listen to him saying for all other answer
 farewell markham till god send better
days 
 she is an angel truth and beauty said
roger wildrake and i like a blasphemous
heretic called her a lindabrides but has your
majesty craving your pardon no commands
for poor hodge wildrake who will blow out his
own or any other man's brains in england to do
your grace a pleasure 
we entreat our good friend wildrake to do
nothing hastily said charles smiling such
brains as his are rare and should not be rashly dispersed
as the like may not be easily collected we
recommend him to be silent and prudent to tilt
no more with loyal clergymen the church 
england and to get himself a new jacket with all
convenient speed to which we beg to contribute
our royal aid when fit time comes we hope to
find other service for him
as he spoke he slid ten pieces into the hand
 poor wildrake who confounded with the excess
 his loyal gratitude blubbered like a child
and would have followed the king had not 

tor rochecliife in few words but peremptory
insisted that he should return with his patron
promising him he should certainly be employed
in assisting the king's escape could an opportunity
be found using his services
be so generous reverend sir and you bind
me to you for ever said the cavalier and i
conjure you not to keep malice against me on
account the foolery you wot 
i have no occasion captain wildrake said
the doctor for i think i had the best it
well then doctor i forgive you on my part
and i pray you for christian charity let me have
a finger in this good service for as i live in hope
 it rely that i shall die disappointment
while the doctor and soldier thus spoke together
charles took leave everard who remained
uncovered while he spoke to him with
his usual grace i need not bid you no longer
be jealous me said the king for i presume
you will scarce think a match betwixt
alice and me which would be too losing a one
on her side for other thoughts the wildest libertine
could not entertain them towards so highminded
a creature and believe me that my sense
 i woodstock
 her merit did not need this last distinguished
proof her truth and loyalty i saw enough
 her from her answers to some idle sallies 
gallantry to know with what a lofty character she
is endowed mr everard her happiness i see
depends on you and i trust you will be the careful
guardian it if we can take any obstacle
out the way your joint happiness be assured
we will use our influence farewell sir if we
cannot be better friends do not at least let us entertain
harder or worse thoughts each other
than we have now
there was something in the manner charles
that was extremely affecting something too in
his condition as a fugitive in the kingdom which
was his own by inheritance that made a direct
appeal to everard's bosom though in contradiction
to the dictates that policy which he
judged it this duty to pursue in the distracted circumstances
 the country he remained as we
have said uncovered and in his manner testified
the highest expression reverence up to the
point when such might seem a symbol allegiance
he bowed so low as almost approach his
lips to the hand charles but he did not kiss
woodstock 
it i would rescue your person sir he said
with the purchase my own life more 
ho stopped short and the king took up his sentence
where it broke off more you cannot do
said charles to maintain an honourable consistency
 but what you have said is enough you
cannot render homage to my proffered hand as
that a sovereign but you will not prevent my
taking yours as a friend if you allow me to call
myself so i am sure as a wellwisher at least
the generous soul everard was touched 
he took the king's hand and pressed it to his
lips
oh he said were better times to come 
bind yourself to nothing dear everard
said the goodnatured prince partaking his emotion
 we reason ill while our feelings are moved
i will recruit no man to his loss nor will i
have my fallen fortunes involve those others
because they have humanity enough to pity my
present condition if better times come why we
will meet again and i hope to our mutual satisfaction
if not as your future fatherinlaw
would say a benevolent smile came over ki
 woodstock
face and accorded not iinmeetly with his glistening
eyes if not this parting was well
made
everard turned away with a deep bow almost
choking under contending feelings the uppermost
 which was a sense the generosity with
which charles at his own imminent risk had
cleared away the darkness that seemed about to
overwhelm his prospects happiness for life 
mixed with a deep sense the perils by which he
was environed he returned to the little town
followed by his attendant wildrake who turned
back so often with weeping eyes and hands clasped
and uplifted as supplicating heaven that
everard was obliged to remind him that his gestures
might be observed by some one and occasion
suspicion
the generous conduct the king during the
closing part this remarkable scene had not
escaped alice's notice and erasing at once from
her mind all resentment charles's former conduct
and all the suspicions they had deservedly
excited awakened in her bosom a sense the
natural goodness his disposition which perwoodstock

mitted her to unite regard for his person with
that reverence for his high office in which she
had been educated as a portion her creed she
felt convinced and delighted with the conviction
that his virtues were his own his libertinism the
fault education or rather want education
and the corrupting advice sycophants and flatterers
she could not know or perhaps did not
in that moment consider that in a soil where no
care is taken to eradicate tares they will outgrow
and smother the wholesome seed even if the last
is more natural to the soil for as doctor rochecliffs
informed her afterwards for her edification
promising as was his custom to explain the
precise words on some future occasion if she would
put him in mind virtus restored ducemqiie 
 vita sine magistri discuntur
the quotations the learned doctor and antiquary were often
left uninterpreted though seldom un communicated owing to his
contempt for those vho did not understand the learned languages
and his dislike to the labour translation for the benefit ladies
and country gentlemen that fair readers and country thanes
may not on this occasion burst in ignorance we add the meaning
 the passage in the text virtue requires the aid a govern
nor and director vices arc learned without a teacher
 woodstock
there was no room for such reflections at present
conscious mutual sincerity by a sort 
intellectual communication through which individuals
are led to understand each other better
perhaps in delicate circumstances than bywords
reserve and simulation appeared to be
now banished from the intercourse between the
king and alice with manly frankness and at
the same time with princely condescension he
requested her exhausted as she was to accept 
his arm on the vay homeward instead that 
doctor rochecliffe and alice accepted his
support with modest humility but without a shadow
 mistrust or fear it seemed as if the last
half hour had satisfied them perfectly with the
character each other and that each had full
conviction the purity and sincerity the
other's intentions
doctor rochecliffe in the meantime had
fallen some four or five paces behind for less
light and active than alice who had besides
the assistance the king's support he was unable
without effort and difficulty to keep up
with the pace charles who then was as we
woodstock 
have elsewhere noticed one the best walkers
in england and was sometimes apt to forget
as great men will that others were inferior to
him in activity
 dear alice said the king but as if the
epithet were entirely fraternal i like your everard
much i would to god he were our determination
 but since that cannot be i am sure
he will prove a generous enemy
may it please you sire said alice modestly
but with some firmness my cousin will never
be your majesty s personal enemy and he
is one the few on whose slightest word you
may rely more than on the oath those who
profess more strongly and formally he is utterly
incapable abusing your majesty's most generous
and voluntary confidence
on my honour i believe so alice replied
the king but odd's fish my girl let majesty
sleep for the present it concerns my safety as
i told your brother lately call me sir then
which belongs alike to king peer knight and
gentleman or rather let me be wild louis kern
again
 woodstock
alice looked down and shook her head that
cannot be please your majesty
 what louis was a saucy companion a
naughty presuming boy and you cannot abide
him well perhaps you are right but we
will wait for doctor rochechffe he said desirous
with goodnatured delicacy to make alice
aware that he had no purpose engaging her in
any discussion which could recall painful ideas
they paused accordingly and again she felt relieved
and grateful
i cannot persuade our fair friend mistress
alice doctor said the king that she must
in prudence forbear using titles respect to me
while there are such very slender means sustaining
it
it is a reproach to earth and to fortune
answered the divine as fast as his recovered
breath would permit him that your most sacred
majesty's present condition should not accord
with the rendering those honours which
are your own by birth and which with god's
blessing on the efforts your loyal subjects i
iiopc to see rendered to you as your hereditary
woodstock 
right by the universal voice the three kingdoms

true doctor replied the king but in
the meanwhile can you expound to mistress
alice lee two lines horace which i have carried
in my thick head several years till now
they have come pat to my purpose as my canny
subjects scotland say if you keep a thing seven
years you are sure to find a use for it at last
telephusdiy so it begins 
 tclephus et peleus cum pauper et exult uterqjic
project ampullas et sesquipedalia verba 
i will explain the passage to mistress alice
lee when she reminds me it or rather he
added recollecting that his ordinary dilatory
answer ought not to be returned when the order
for exposition emanated from his sovereign i
will repeat a poor couplet from my own translation
 the poem 
heroes and kings in exile forced to roam
leave swelling phrase and sevenleagued words at home 
a most admirable version doctors said
 woodstock
charles i feel all its force and particularly
the beautiful rendering sesquipedalia verba
into sevenleagued boots words i mean it reminds
me like half the things i meet with in
this world the contes de commerce uoye 
thus conversing they reached the lodge and
as the king went to his chamber to prepare for
the breakfast summons now impending the idea
crossed his mind wilmot and villiers and
killigrew would laugh at me did they hear a
campaign in which neither man nor woman had
been conquered but odd's fish let them laugh
as they will there is something at my heart
which tells me that for once in my life i have
acted well
that day and the next were spent in tranquillity
the king waiting impatiently for the intelligence
which was to announce to him that a

none such was yet in readiness but he learned

two gentlemen verona
it is time we should give some account the
other actors in our drama the interest due to the
principal personages having for some time engrossed
our attention exclusively
we are therefore to inform the reader that
the lingering longings the commissioners who
had been driven forth their proposed paradise
 woodstock not by a cherub indeed but as
they thought by spirits another sort still detained
them in the vicinity they had indeed
left the little borough under pretence indifferent
accommodation the more palpable reasons
were that they entertained some resentment
i
nvoodstock 
against everard as the means their disappointment
and had no mind to reside where their
proceedings could be overlooked by him although
they took leave in terms the utmost respect
they went however no farther than oxford and
remained there as ravens who are accustomed to
witness the chase sit upon a tree or crag at a little
distance and watch the disembowelling the
deer expecting the relics which fall to their share
meantime the university and city but especially
the former supplied them with some means
 employing their various faculties to advantage
until the expected moment when as they hoped
they should either be summoned to windsor or
woodstock should once more be abandoned to
their discretion
bletson to pass the time vexed the souls such
learned and pious divines and scholars as he could
intrude his hateful presence upon by sophistry
atheistical discourse and challenges to them to
impugn the most scandalous theses desborough
one the most brutally ignorant men the period
got himself nominated the head a college
and lost no time in cutting down trees and plum
 woodstock
during plate as for harrison he preached in
full uniform in saint mary's church wearing his
buffcoat boots and spurs as if he were about to
take the field for the fight at arrcageddon and
it was hard to say whether that seat learning
religion and loyalty as it is called by clarendon
was more vexed by the rapine lesbos
the cold scepticism bletson or the frantic
enthusiasm the fifth monarchy champion
ever and anon soldiers under pretence relieving
guard or otherwise went and came betwixt
woodstock and oxford and maintained it
may be supposed a correspondence with trusty
tomkins who though he chiefly resided in the
town woodstock visited the lodge occasionally
and to whom therefore they doubtless trusted
for information concerning the proceedings
there
indeed this man tomkins seemed by some secret
means to have gained the confidence in part
if not in whole almost every one connected with
these intrigues all closeted him all conversed
with him in private those who had the means propitiated
him with gifts those who had not were
vvohisttftck 
been previously imposed upon he pointed them
out to pearson with no farther comment than
was implied in the exclamation the simple
fools
but his assistants began to lose heart and be
discouraged and required all his spirit to raise
theirs he then called their attention to voices
which they seemed to hear before them and urged
these as evidence that they were moving on
the track some enemy the commonwealth
who for the execution his malignant plots
had retreated into these extraordinary fastnesses
the spirits the men became at last downcast
notwithstanding all this encouragement
they spoke to each other in whispers the devils
 woodstock who might be all the while
decoying them forward to a room said to exist
in the palace where the floor revolving on an
axis precipitated those who entered into a bottomless
abyss humgudgeon hinted that he
had consulted the scripture that morning by way
 lot and his fortune had been to alight on the
passage eutychus fell down from the third
loft the energy and authority cromwell
is
iss woodstock
however and the refreshment some food and
strong waters reconciled them to pursuing their
task
nevertheless with all their unwearied exertions
morning dawned on the search before they
had reached doctor rochecliff'e's sitting apartment
into which after all they obtained entrance
by a mode much more difficult than that
which the doctor himself employed but here
their ingenuity was long at fault from the
miscellaneous articles that were strewed around
and the preparations made for food and lodging
it seemed they had gained the very citadel the
labyrinth but though various passages opened
from it they all terminated in places with which
they were already acquainted or communicated
with the other parts the house where their
own sentinels assured them none had passed
cromwell remained long in deep uncertainty
meantime he directed pearson to take charge 
the ciphers and more important papers which
lay on the table though there is little there
he said that i have not already known by
means trusty tomkins honest joseph for
woodstock 
an artful and thoroughpaced agent the like 
thee is not left in england
after a considerable pause during which he
sounded with the pummel his sword almost
every stone in the building and every plank on
the floor the general gave orders to bring the
old knight and doctor rochecliffe to the spot
trusting that he might work out them some
explanation the secrets this apartment
so please your excellency to let me to
deal with them said pearson who was a thoroughpaced
soldier fortune and had been a
buccaneer in the west indies i think that
by a whipcord twitched tight round their forehead
and twisted round with a pistolbut i
could make either the truth start from their lips
or the eyes from their head
 out upon thee pearson said cromwell
with abhorrence we have no warrant for such
cruelty neither as englishmen nor christians
we may slay malignant as we crush noxious
animals but to torture them is a deadly sin for
it is written he made them to be pitied 
those who carried them captive nay i recall
vol iii t
 woodstock
the order even for their examination trusting
that wisdom will be granted us to discover their
most secret devices
there was a pause accordingly during which
an idea seized upon cromwell's imagination 
 bring me hither he said yonder stool 
and placing it beneath one the windows 
which there were two so high in the wall as not
to be accessible from the floor he clambered up
into the entrance the window which was six
or seven feet deep corresponding with the thickness
 the wall come up hither pearson
said the general but ere thou comest double
the guard at the foot the turret called love's
ladder and bid them bring up the other petard
so now come thou hither
the officer however brave in the field was
one those whom a great height strikes with
giddiness and sickness he shrunk back from
the view the precipice on the verge which
cromwell was standing with complete indifference
till the general catching the hand his
follower pulled him forward as far as he would
advance i think said the general i have
woodstock 
found the clew but by this light it is no easy one 
see you we stand in the portal near the top 
rosamond's tower and yon turret which rises
opposite to our feet is that which is called lover's
ladder from which the drawbridge reached
that admitted the profligate norman tyrant to
the bower his mistress
true my lord but the drawbridge is gone
said pearson
ay pearson replied the general but
an active man might spring from the spot we
stand upon to the battlements yonder turret
i do not think so my lord said pearson
what said cromwell not if the avenger
 blood were behind you with his slaughterweapon
in his hand 
the fear death might do much answered
pearson but when i look at that sheer depth
on either side and at the empty chasm between us
and yonder turret which is i warrant you twelve
feet distant i confess the truth nothing short 
the most imminent danger should induce me to
try pah the thought makes my head grow
giddy i tremble to see your highness stand
 woodstock
there balancing yourself as if you meditated a
spring into the empty air i repeat i would
scarce stand so near the verge as does your highness
for the rescue my life
ah base and degenerate spirit said the
general soul mud and clay would st thou
not do it and much more for the possession 
empire that is peradventure continued he
changing his tone as one who has said too much
shouldst thou be called on to do this that thereby
becoming a great man in the tribes israel
thou lightest redeem the captivity jerusalem
ay and it may be work some great work for
the afflicted people this land
your highness may feel such calls said the
officer but it is not for poor gilbert pearson
your faithful follower you made a jest me
yesterday when i tried to speak your language 
and i am no more able to fulfil your designs
than to use your mode speech
but pearson said cromwell thou hast
thrice yea four times called me your highness
did i my lord i was not sensible it
i crave your pardon said the officer
woodstock 
nay said oliver there was no offence i
do indeed stand high and i may perchance stand
higher though alas it were fitter for a simple
soul like me to return to my plough and my
husbandry nevertheless i will not wrestle
against the supreme will should i be called onto
do yet more in that worthy cause for surely
he who hath been to our british israel as a shield
 help and a sword excellency making her
enemies be found leers unto her will not give
over the flock to those foolish shepherds westminster
who shear the sheep and feed them not
and who are in very deed hirelings not shepherds

i trust to see your lordship quoit them all
down stairs answered pearson but may i
ask why we pursue this discourse even now until
we have secured the common enemy 
i will tarry no jot time said the general 
fence the communication love's ladder as
it is called below as i take it for almost certain
that the party whom we have driven from fastness
to fastness during the night has at length
sprung to the top yonder battlements from the
i woodstock
place where we now stand finding the turret is
guarded below the place he has chosen for his
security will prove a rattrap from whence there
is no returning
there is a cask gunpowder in this cabinet
said pearson were it not better my
lord to mine the tower if he will not render
himself and send the whole turret with its contents
one hundred feet into the air 
ah silly man said cromwell striking him
familiarly on the shoulder if thou hadst done
this without telling me it had been good service
but we will first summon the turret and then
think whether the petit will serve our turn it
is but mining at last blow a summons there
down below
the trumpets rung at his bidding till the old
walls echoed from every recess and vaulted archway
cromwell as if he cared not to look upon
the person whom he expected to appear drew back
like a necromancer afraid the spectre which he
has evoked
he has come to the battlement said pearson
to his general
woodstock 
in what dress or appearance answered
cromwell from within the chamber
a grey ridingsuit assented with silver
russet walkingboots a cut band a grey hat and
plume black hair
it is he it is he said cromwell and another
crowning mercy is vouchsafed 
meantime pearson and young lee exchanged
defiance from their respective posts
surrenders said the former or we blow
you up in your fastness
i am come too high a race to surrender to
rebels said albert assuming the air with which
in such a condition a king might have spoken
i bear you to witness cried cromwell exultingly
 he hath refused quarter a surety his
blood be on his head one you bring down the
barrel powder as he loves to soar high we
will add what can be taken from the soldiers bandelivers
 come with me pearson thou understands
this gear corporal gracebehere stand
thou fast on the platform the window where
captain pearson and i stood but even now and
bend the point thy partizan against any who
 woodstock
shall attempt to pass thou art as strong as a
bull and i will back thee against despair itself
but said the corporal mounting reluctantly
 the place is as the pinnacle the temple 
and it is written that eutychus fell down from
the third loft and was taken up dead
because he slept upon his post answered
cromwell readily beware thou carelessness
and thus thy feet shall be kept from stumbling 
you four soldiers remain here to support the
corporal if it be necessary and you as well as
the corporal will draw into the vaulted passage
the minute the trumpets sound a retreat it is as
strong as a casemate and you may lie there safe
from the effects the mine thou zerobabel
robins i know wilt be their lance private
robins bowed and the general departed to join
those who were without
as he reached the door the hall the petard
was heard to explode and he saw that it had succeeded
 for the soldiers rushed brandishing their
swords and pistols in at the postern the turret
whose gate had been successfully forced a thrill
woodstock 
 exultation but not unmingled with horror shot
across the veins the ambitious soldier
now now he cried they are dealing
with him 
his expectations were deceived pearson and
the others returned disappointed and reported
they had been stopt by a strong trap door grated
iron extended over the narrow stair and they
could see there was an obstacle the same kind
some ten feet higher to remove it by force
while a desperate and wellarmed man had the advantage
 the steps above them might cost many
lives which lackaday said the general
it is our duty to be tender what dost thou
advise gilbert pearson 
we must use powder my lord answered
pearson who saw his master was determined he
should have the whole merit the proceeding 
there may be a chamber easily and conveniently
formed under the foot the stair we have
a sausage by good luck to form the train and
so 
ah said cromwell i know thou canst
manage such gear well but gilbert i go to
b woodstock
visit the posts and give them orders to retire to
a safe distance when the retreat is sounded you
will allow them five minutes for this purpose
three is enough for any knave them all
said pearson they will be lame indeed that
require more on such a service i ask but one
though i fire the train myself
take heed said cromwell that the poor
soul be listened to if he asks quarter it may be
he may repent him his hardheartiness and
cal for mercy
and mercy he shall have answered pearson
 providing he calls loud enough to make me
hear him for the explosion that damned petard
has made me as deaf as the devils dam
hush gilbert hush said cromwell you
offend in your language
zooks sir i must speak either in your way
or in my own said pearson unless i am to be
dumb as well as deaf away with you my lord
to visit the posts and you will presently hear
me make some noise in the world
cromwell smiled gently at his aiddecamp's
petulance patted him on the shoulder and called
him a mad fellow walked a little way then turned
back to whisper what thou doest do quickly
then returned again towards the outer circle 
guards turning his head from time to time as if
to assure himself that the corporal to whom he
had intrusted the duty still kept guard with his
advanced weapon upon the terrific chasm between
rosamond's tower and the corresponding turret
seeing him standing on his post the general
muttered between his mustachios the fellow
hath the strength and courage a bear and yonder
is a post where one shall do more to keep back
than an hundred in making way he cast a last
look on the gigantic figure who stood in that airy
position like some gothic statue the weapon half
levelled against the opposite turret with the but
rested against his right foot his steel cap and
burnished corslet glittering in the rising sun
cromwell then passed on to give the necessary
orders that such sentinels as might be endangered
at their present posts by the effect the mine
should withdraw at the sound the trumpet to the
places which he pointed out to them never on
any occasion his life did he display more calmness
and presence mind he was kind nay
tk woodstock
facetious with the soldiers who adored him and
yet he resembled a volcano before the eruption
commences all peaceful and quiet without while
an hundred contradictory passions were raging in
his bosom
corporal humgudgeon meanwhile remained
steady upon his post yet though as determined
a soldier as ever fought among the redoubled regiment
 ironsides and possessed no small
share that exalted fanaticism which lent so keen
an edge to the natural courage those stern religionists
the veteran felt his present situation to
be highly uncomfortable within a pike's length
 him arose a turret which was about to be dispersed
in massive fragments through the air and
he felt small confidence in the length time
which might be allowed for his escape from such
a dangerous vicinity the duty constant vigilance
upon his post was partly divided by this
natural feeling which induced him from time to
time to bend his eyes on the miners below instead
 keeping them rivetted on the opposite turret
at length the interest the scene arose to the
uttermost after entering and returning from the
turret and coming out again more than once in
woodstock 
the course about twenty minutes pearson issued
as it might be supposed for the last time
carrying in his hand and uncoiling as he went
along the sausage or linen bag so called from
its appearance which strongly sewed together
and crammed with gunpowder was to serve asa
train betwixt the mine to be sprung and the
point occupied by the engineer who was to give
fire he was in the act finally adjusting it
when the attention the corporal on the tower
became irresistibly and exclusively rivetted upon
the preparations for the explosion but while he
watched the aiddecamp drawing his pistol to
give fire and the trumpeter handling his instrument
as waiting the order to sound the retreat
fate rushed on the unhappy sentinel in a way he
least expected
young active bold and completely possessed
 his presence mind albert lee who had
been from the loopholes a watchful observer 
every measure which had been taken by his besiegers
had resolved to make one desperate effort
for selfpreservation while the head the sentinel
on the opposite platform was turned from
 woodstock
him and bent rather downwards he suddenly
sprung across the chasm though the space on
which he lighted was scarce wide enough for two
persons threw the surprised soldier from his precarious
stand and jumped himself down into the
chamber the gigantic trooper went sheer down
twenty feet struck against a projecting battlement
which launched the wretched man outwards and
then fell on the earth with such tremendous force
that the head which first touched the ground
tinted a hole in the soil six inches in depth
and was crushed like an eggshell scarce knowing
what had happened yet startled and confounded
at the descent this heavy body which
fell at no great distance from him pearson snapt
his pistol at the train no previous warning given 
the powder caught and the mine exploded had
it been strongly charged with powder many 
those without might have suffered but the explosion
was only powerful enough to blow out ina
lateral direction a part the wall just above
the foundation sufficient however to destroy the
equipoise the building then amid a cloud
 smoke which began gradually to encircle the
woodstock 
turret like a shrewd arising slowly from its base
to its summit it was seen to stagger and shake
by all who had courage to look steadily at a sight
so dreadful slowly at first the building inclined
outwards then rushed precipitately to its
base and fell to the ground in huge fragments
the strength its resistance showing the excellence
 the masonwork the engineer so soon
as he had fired the train fled in such alarm that
he well nigh ran against his general who was
advancing towards him while a huge stone from
the summit the building flying farther than
the rest lighted within a yard them
thou hast been overhasty pearson said
cromwell with the greatest composure possible
 hath no one fallen in that same tower 
sloe
some one fell said pearson still in great
agitation and yonder lies his body halfburied
in the rubbish
with a quick and resolute step cromwell approached
the spot and exclaimed pearson
thou hast ruined methe young man hath escaped
 this is our own sentinel plague on the
 woodstock
idiot let him rot beneath the ruins which crushed
him 
a cry now resounded from the platform rosamond's
tower which appeared yet taller than
formerly deprived the neighbouring turret
which emulated though it did not attain to its
height a prisoner noble general a prisoner
the fox whom we have chased au night is now
in the snare the lord hath delivered him into
the hand his servants
look you keep him in safe custody exclaimed
cromwell and bring him presently
down to the apartment from which the secret passages
have their principal entrance
 your excellency shall be obeyed 
the proceedings albert lee to which these
exclamations related had been unfortunate he
had dashed from the platform as we have related
the gigantic strength the soldier opposed
to him and had instantly jumped down into
rochecliffe's chamber but the soldiers stationed
there threw themselves upon him and after a
struggle which was hopelessly maintained against
such advantage numbers had thrown the young
woodstock 
cavalier to the ground two them drawn down
by his strenuous exertions falling across him at
the same moment a sharp and severe report was
heard winch like a clap thunder in the immediate
vicinity shook all around them till the
strong and solid tower tottered like the mast a
stately vessel when about to part by the board
in a few seconds this was followed by another sullen
sound at first low and deep but augmenting
like the roar a cataract as it descends reeling
bellowing and rushing as if to astound boil
heaven and earth so awful indeed was the
sound the neighbour tower as it fell that both
the captive and those who struggled with him
continued for a minute or two passive in each
other's grasp
albert was the first who recovered consciousness
and activity he shook off those who lay
above him and made a desperate effort to gain
his feet in which he partly succeeded but as he
had to deal with men accustomed to every species
 danger and whose energies were recovered
nearly as soon as his own he was completely 
 ir
 woodstock
cured and his arms held down loyal and faithful
to his trust and resolved to sustain to the last
the character which he had assumed he exclaimed
as his struggles were finally overpowered rebel
villains would you slay your king 
ha heard you that cried one the soldiers
to the lanceprivate who commanded the
party shall i not strike this son a wicked
father under the fifth rib even as the tyrant 
moab was smitten by thud with a dagger a
cubit's length 
but robins answered be it far from us merciful
strickalthrow to slay in cold blood the captive
 our bow and our spear methinks since
the storm tredagh f we have shed enough 
blood therefore on your lives do him no evil 
but take from him his arms and let us bring him
before the chosen instrument even our general
that he may do with him what is meet in his
eyes
 lanceprivate or lancebrigade a private appointed
to a small command a sort temporary corporal
i tredagh or drogheda was taken by cromwell in by
storm and the governor and whole garrison put to the sword
woodstock 
by this time the soldier whose exultation had
made him the first to communicate the intelligence
from the battlements to cromwell returned
and brought commands corresponding to the orders
 their temporary officer and albert lee
disarmed and bound was conducted as a captive
into the apartment which derived its name from
the victories his ancestor and placed in the presence
 general cromwell
running over in his mind the time which had
elapsed since the departure charles till the
siege if it may be termed so had terminated in
his own capture albert had every reason to hope
that his royal master must have had time to accomplish
his escape yet he determined to maintain
to the last a deceit which might for a time
insure the king's safety the difference betwixt
them could not he thought be instantly discovered
begrimed as he was with dust and smoke
and with blood issuing from some scratches received
in the scuffle
in this evil plight but bearing himself with
such dignity as was adapted to the princely chaos
woodstock
racer albert was ushered into the apartment 
victor lee where in his father's own chair reclined
the triumphant enemy the cause to which

oliver cromwell arose from his seat as the
two veteran soldiers zerobabel robins and merciful
strickalthrow introduced into the apartment
the prisoner whom they held by the arms and
fixed his stern hazel eye on albert long before he
could give vent to the ideas which were swelling
in his bosom exultation was the most predominant

art not thou he at length said that egyptian
which before these days modest an uproar
and eldest out into the wilderness many thousand
men who were murderers ha youth i
 woodstock
have hunted thee from stirling to worcester and
we are met at last 
i would replied albert speaking in the character
which he had assumed that we had met
where i could have shown thee the difference betwixt
a rightful king and an ambitious usurper 
go to young man said cromwell say
rather the difference between a judge raised up
for the redemption england and the son 
those kings whom the lord in his anger permitted
to reign over her but we will not waste useless
words god knows that it is not our will
that we are called to such high matters being as
humble in our thoughts as we are ourselves 
and in our unassisted nature frail and foolish and
unable to render a reason but for the better spirit
within us which is not us thou art weary
young man and thy nature requires rest and refection
being doubtless dealt with delicately as
one who hath fed on the fat and drunk the
sweet and who hath been clothed in purple and
fine linen
here the general suddenly stopt and then
abruptly exclaimed but is this ah whom
woodstock till
have we here these are not the locks the swarthy
lad charles stuart a cheat a cheat 
albert hastily cast his eyes on a mirror which
stood in the room and perceived that a dark peruke
found among doctor rochecliffe's miscellaneous
wardrobe had been disordered in the
scuffle and that his own lightbrown hair was
escaping from beneath it
 who is this said cromwell again stamping
with fury pluck the disguise from him
the soldiers did so and bringing him at the
same time towards the light the deception could
not be maintained for a moment longer with any
possibility success cromwell came up to him
with his teeth set and grinding against each other
as he spoke his hands clenched and trembling
with emotion and speaking with a voice lowpitched
bitterly and deeply emphatic such as
might have preceded a stab with his dagger
thy name young man 
he was answered calmly and firmly while the
countenance the speaker wore a cast triumph
and even contempt
o woodstock
albert lee ditches a faithful subject 
king charles
i might have guessed it said cromwell 
ay and to king charles shalt thou go as soon
as it is noon on the dial pearson he continued
 let him be carried to the others and let
them be executed at twelve exactly
all sir said pearson surprised for cromwell
though he at times made formidable examples
was in general by no means sanguinary
all repeated cromwell fixing his eye on
yoimg lee yes young sir your conduct has
devoted to death thy father thy kinsman and the
stranger that was in thine household such wreck
hast thou brought on thy father's house
my father too my aged father said albert
looking upward and endeavouring to raise
his hands in the same direction which was prevented
by his bonds the lord's will be done 
all this havoc can be saved if said the general
 thou wilt answer one question where
is the young charles stuart who was called king
 scotland 
woods uk jis
under heavens protection and safe from
thy power was the firm and unhesitating answer
 the young royalist
 away with him to prisons said cromwell 
and from thence to execution with the rest 
them as malignant taken in the fact let a
court martial sit on them presently
one word said young lee as they led him
from the room
stop stop said cromwell with the agitation
 renewed hope let him be heard
you love texts scripture said albert
let this be the subject your next homily
had zimri peace who slew his master 
away with him said the general let
him die the death i have said it
as cromwell spoke these words his aiddecamp
observed that he became unwontedly pale
your excellency is overtoiled in the public
service said pearson a course the stag in
the evening will refresh you the old knight hath
a noble hound here if we can but get him to hunt
without his master which may be hard as he is
faithful and 
 woodstock
hang him up said cromwell
what whom hang the noble dog your
excellency was wont to love a good hound 
it matters not said cromwell let him be
killed is it not written that they slew in the valley
 anchor not only the accursed achan with
his sons and his daughters but also his oxen and
his asses and his sheep and every live thing belonging
unto him and even thus shall we do to
the malignant family lee who have aided
sisera in his flight when israel might have been
delivered his trouble for ever but send out
couriers and patrols follow pursue watch in
every direction let my horse be ready at the
door in five minutes or bring me the first thou
canst find
 it seemed to pearson that this was something
wildly spoken and that the cold perspiration was
standing upon the general's brow as he said it
he therefore again pressed the necessity repose
and it would appear that nature seconded strongly
the representation cromwell arose and made a
step or two towards the door the apartment 
but stopped staggered and after a pause sate
woodstock 
down in a chair truly friend pearson he
said this weary carcase ours is an impediment
to us even in our most necessary business
and i am fitter to sleep than to watch which is not
my wont place guards therefore tiu we repose
ourselves for an hour or two send out in every
direction and spare not for horses flesh wake
me if the court martial should require instruction
and forget not to see the sentence punctually executed
on the lees and those who were arrested
with them
as cromwell spoke thus he arose and halfopened
a bed room door when pearson again craved
pardon for asking if he had rightly understood
his excellency that all the prisoners were
to be executed
have i not said it answered cromwell
displeasedly is it because thou art a man 
blood and hast ever been that thou dost affect
these scruples to show thyself tenderhearted at
my expense i tell thee that if there lack one in
the full tale execution thine own life shall pay
the forfeit
so saying he entered the apartment followed
uj woodstock
by the groom his chamber who attended upon
pearson's summons
when his general had retired pearson remained
in great perplexity what he ought to do and
that from no scruples conscience but from uncertainty
whether he might not err either in postponing
or in too hastily and too literally executing
the instructions he had received
in the meantime strickalthrow and robins had
returned after lodging albert in prison to the
room where pearson was still musing on his generals
commands both these men were agitators
in their army and old soldiers whom cromwell
was accustomed to treat with great familiarity
 so that robins had no hesitation to ask captain
pearson whether he meant to execute the
commands the general even to the letter
pearson shook his head with an air doubt
but added there was no choice left
be assured said the old man that if thou
doest this folly thou wilt cause israel to sin and
that the general will not be pleased with your service
thou knowest and none better than thou
that oliver although he be like unto david the son
woodstock
 jesse in faith and wisdom and courage yet
there are times when the evil spirit cometh upon
him as it did upon saul and he uttered commands
which he will not thank any one for executing
pearson was too good a politician to assent directly
to a proposition which he could not deny 
he only shook his head once more and said that it
was easy for those to talk who were not responsible
but the soldier's duty was to obey his orders and
not to judge them
very righteous truth said merciful strickthrow
a grim old scotchman i marvel where
our brother zerobabel caught up this softness 
heart r
why i do but wish said zerobabel that
four or five human creatures nay draw the breath
 god's air for a few hours more there can be
small harm done by delaying the execution and
the general will have some time for reflection
ay said captain pearson but i in my service
must be more pointedly obsequious than thou
in thy plainness art bound to be friend zeroba
bel
o
 woodstock
 then shall the coarse friezecassock the
private soldier bear out the blast with the gilded
lining the captain said zerobabel ay indeed
i can show you warrant why we be artful to
each other in doing acts kindness 
seeing the best us are poor sinful crease
turns who might suffer being called to a brief accounting

 a verity you surprise me brother zeroba
bel said strickalthrow that thou being an old
and experienced soldier whose head hath grown
grey in battle should'st give such advice to a
young officer is not the general's commission to
take away the wicked from the land and to root
out the amalekite and the jebusite and the peruse
and the hittite and the graphite and
the morte and are not these men justly to be
compared to the five kings who took shelter in
the cave maketh who were delivered into the
hands joshua the son nun and he caused
his captains and his soldiers to come near and
tread on their necks and then he smote them
and he slew them and then he hanged them ony

woodstock 
five trees even till evening and thou gilbert
pearson by name be not withheld from the duty
which is appointed to thee but do even as has
been commanded by him who is raised up to
judge and to deliver israel for it is written cursed
is he who holdeth back his sword from the
slaughter 
thus wrangled the two military theologians
while pearson much more solicitous to anticipate
the wishes over than to know the will heaven
listened to them with great indecision and
perplexity

the reader will recollect that when rochecliffs
and joceline were made prisoners the party
which escorted them had two other captives in their
train colonel everard namely and the rev nehemiah
holdenough when they had obtained
entrance into woodstock and commenced their
search after the fugitive prince the prisoners were
placed in what had been an old guardroom and
which was by its strength well calculated to serve
for a prison and a guard was placed over them by
pearson no light was allowed save that a
woodstock 
glimmering fire charcoal the prisoners remained
separated from each other colonel everard conversing
with nehemiah holdenough at a distance
from doctor rochecliffe sir henry lee and jofeline
the party was soon after augmented by
wildrake who was brought down to the lodge
and thrust in with so little ceremony that his
arms being bound he had very nearly fallen on
his nose in the middle the prison
i thank you my good friend he said looking
back to the door which they who had pushed
him in were securing point de ceremonie no

yes replied the doctor and you know i
can use mine
i prithee be quiet master wildrake said
sir henry
nay good knight answered wildrake be
somewhat more cordial with a comrade in distress
this is a different scene from the brentford storming
party the jade fortune has been a very
stepmother to me i will sing you a song i made
on my own ill luck
at this moment captain wildrake we are
not in a fitting mood for singing said sir henry
civilly and gravely
nay it will aid your devotions egad it
sounds like a penitential psalm
when was a young lad
my fortune was bad
if e'er i do well tis a wonder
i spent all my means

the door opened as wildrake finished this
stanza at the top his voice and in rushed a
sentinel who greeting him by the title blasphemous
bellowing bull bashan bestowed a
severe blow with his ramrod on the shoulders 
the songster whose bonds permitted him no means
 returning the compliment
your humble servant again sir said wildrake
shrugging his shoulders sorry i have no
means showing my gratitude i am bound
over to keep the peace like captain boabdil 
ha knight did you hear my bones clatter that
blow came twanging off the fellow might inflict

pshaw this is not the tunc it goes to here he
fell fast asleep and sooner or later all his companions
in misfortune followed his example
the benches intended for the repose the soldiers
 the guard afforded the prisoners convenience
enough to lie down though their slumbers
it may be believed were neither sound nor undisturbed
but when daylight was but a little while
broken the explosion gunpowder which took
place and the subsequent fall the turret to
which the mine was applied would have awakened
the seven sleepers or morpheus himself the
smoke penetrating through the windows left them
at no loss for the cause the din
there went my gunpowder said rochecliffe
which has i trust blown up as many rebel
villains as it might have been the means destroying
otherwise in a fair field it must have
caught fire by chance
by chance no said sir henry depend on
it my bold albert has fired the train and that in
yonder blast cromwell was flying towards the heaven
whoso battlements he will never reach ah
 woodstock
my brave boy and perhaps thou art thyself sacrificed
like a youthful sampson among the rebellious
philistines but i wil not be long behind
thee alberti
everard hastened to the door hoping to obtain
from the guard to whom his name and rank might
be known some explanation the noise which
seemed to announce some dreadful catastrophe
but nehemiah holdenough whose rest had
been broken by the trumpet which gave signal for
the explosion appeared in the very acme horror
 it is the trumpet the archangel he
cried it is the crushing this world elements
 it is the summons to the judgmentseat 
the dead are obeying the call they are with us
they are amongst us they arise in their bodily
frames they come to summon us 
as he spoke his eyes were rivetted upon dr
rochecliffe who stood directly opposite to him
in rising hastily the cap which he commonly
wore according to a custom then usual both among
clergymen and townsmen a civil profession had
escaped from his head and carried with it the
large silk patch which he probably wore for the
woodstock 

purpose disguise for the cheek which was disclosed
was unscarred and the eye as good as that
which was usually covered
colonel everard returning from the door endeavoured
in vain to make master holdenough
comprehend what he learned from the guard without
that the explosion had only involved the death
 one cromwell soldiers the presbyterian
divine continued to stare wildly at him the
episcopal persuasion
but dr rochecliffe heard and understood the
news brought by colonel everard and relieved
from the instant anxiety which had kept him stationary
he advanced towards the retiring calvinist
extending his hand in the most friendly
manner
avoid thee avoid thee said holdenough
 the living may not join hands with the
dead
 but i said rochecliffe am as much alive
as you are
thou alive thou joseph albany whom
my own eyes saw precipitated from the battlements
 clidcsthrow castle 
 woodstock
ay answered the doctor but you did not
see me swim ashore on a marsh covered with
sedgesugit ad salicesaher a manner which
i will explain to you another time
holdenough touched his hand with doubt and
uncertainty thou art indeed warm and alive
he said and yet after so many blows and a fall
so tremendous thou canst not be my joseph
albany
i am joseph albany rochecliffe said the
doctor become so in virtue my mother's little
estate which fines and confiscations have made an
 
and is it so indeed said holdenough
and have i recovered mine old chum 
even so replied rochecliffe by the same
token i appeared to you in the mirror chamber
thou wert so bold nehemiah that our whole
scheme would have been shipwrecked had i not
appeared to thee in the shape a departed friend
yet believe me it went against my heart to do it
ah fie on thee fie on thee said holdenough
throwing himself into his arms and clasping
him to his bosom thou wert ever a naughty
woodstock 
wag how couwst thou play me such a trick t 
ah albany doest thou remember dr purely
and caius college 
marry do i said the doctor thrusting
his arm through the presbyterian divine's and
guiding him to a seat apart from the other prisoners
who witnessed this scene with much surprise
remember caius college said rochecliffe
ay and the good ale we drank and our parties
to mother huflcaps
vanity vanities said holdeuough smiling
kindly at the same time and still holding his
recovered friend's arm enclosed and handlocked
in his
but the breaking the principal's orchard so
cleanly done said the doctor it was the first
plot i ever framed and much work i had to prevail
on thee to go into it
oh name not that iniquity said nehemiah
since i may well say as the pious master baxter
that these boyish offences have had their punishment
in later years inasmuch as that inordinate
appetite for fruit hath produced stomachic affections
under which i yet labour
s woodstock
 true true clear nehemiah said rochecliffe
but care not for them a dram brandy will
correct it all mr baxter was he was about to
say an ass but checked himself and only filled
up the sentence with a good man i dare say
but over scrupulous
so they sat down together the best friends
and for half an hour talked with mutual delight
over old college stories by degrees they got on
the politics the day and though then they
unclasped their hands and there occurred between
them such expressions as nay my dear
brother and there i must needs differ and
on this point i crave leave to think yet a hue
and cry against the independents and other sectaries
being started they followed like brethren
in full hollo and it was hard to guess which wag
most forward unhappily in the course this
amiable intercourse something was mentioned
about the bishopric titus which at once involved
them in the doctrinal question church
government then alas the floodgates were
opened and they showered on each other greek
and hebrew texts while their eyes kindled their
woodstock 
cheeks glowed their hands became clenched and
they looked more like fierce polemics about to rend
each other's eyes out than christian divines
roger wildrake by making himself an auditor
 the debate contrived to augment its violence
he took course a most decided part in a question
the merits which were totally unknown to
him somewhat overawed by holdenough's ready
oratory and learning the cavalier watched with a
face anxiety the countenance dr rochecliffe 
but when he saw the proud eye and steady bearing
 the episcopal champion and heard him
answer greek with greek and hebrew with hebrew
he backed his arguments as he closed them
with a stout rap upon the bench and an exulting
laugh in the face the antagonist it was with
some difficulty that sir henry and colonel everard
having at length and reluctantly interfered
prevailed on the two alienated friends to adjourn
their dispute removing at the same time to a distance
and regarding each other with looks in
which old friendship appeared to have totally
given way to mutual animosity
but while they sate lowering on each other
j woodstock
and longing to renew a contest in which each
claimed the victory pearson entered the prison
and in a low and troubled voice desired the persons
whom it contained to prepare for instant
death
sir henry lee received the doom with the
stern composure which he had hitherto displayed
colonel everard attempted the interposition
 a strong and resentful appeal to the
parliament against the judgment the court
martial and the general but pearson declined
to receive or transmit any such remonstrance and
with a dejected look and mien melancholy presage
renewed his exhortation to them to prepare
for the hour noon and withdrew from the
prison
the operation this intelligence on the two
clerical disputants was more remarkable they
gazed for a moment on each other with eyes in
which repentant kindness and a feeling generous
shame quenched every lingering feeling resentment
and joining in the mutual exclamation 
my brother my brother i have sinned i have
sinned in offending thee they rushed into each
woodstock 
other's arms shed tears as they demanded each
other's forgiveness nd ike two warriors who
sacrifice a personal quarrel to discharge their
duty against the common enemy they recalled
nobler ideaij their sacred character and assuming
the part which best became them on an occasion
so melancholy began to exhort those around
them to meet the doom that had been announced
with the firmness and dignity which christianity
alone can give

most gracious prince good canning cried
leave vengeance to our god
and lay the iron rule aside
be thine the olive rod
ballad sir charles baxedin
the hour appointed for execution had been
long past and it was about five in the evening
when the protector summoned pearson to his presence
he went with fear and reluctance uncertain
how he might be received after remaining about
a quarter an hour the aiddecamp returned
to victor lee's parlour where he found the old
soldier zerobabel robins in attendance for his
return
how is oliver said the old man anxiously
why well answered pearson and hath
woodstock 
asked no questions the execution but many concerning
the reports we have been able to make regarding
the flight the young man and is much
moved at thinking he must now be beyond pursuit
also i gave him certain papers belonging to the
malignant doctor rochecuffe
then will i venture upon him said the adcurator
 so give me a napkin that i may look
like a sewer and fetch up the food which i directed
should be in readiness
two troopers attended accordingly with a ration
 beef such as was distributed to the private
soldiers and dressed after their fashion a pewter
pot ale a trencher with salt black pepper and
a loaf ammunition bread come with me he
said to pearson and fear not nol loves an
innocent jest he boldly entered the general's
sleeping apartment and said aloud arise thou
that art called to be a judge in israel let there
be no more folding the hands to sleep lo i
come as a sign to thee wherefore arise eat drink
and let thy heart be glad within thee for thou
shalt eat with joy the food him that laboured
in the trenches seeing that since thou wert comsc
woodstock
mander over the host the poor sentinel hath had
such provisions as i have now placed for thine
own refreshment
truly brother zerobabel said cromwell
accustomed to such starts enthusiasm among
his followers we would wish that it were so 
neither is it our desire to sleep soft nor feed more
highly than the meanest that ranks under our banners
verily thou hast chosen well for my refreshment
and the smell the food is savoury in my
nostrils
he arose from the bed on which he had lain
down half dressed and wrapping his cloak around
him sate down by the bedside and partook
heartily the plain food which was prepared for
him while he was eating cromwell commanded
pearson to finish his report you need not
desist for the presence a worthy soldier whose
spirit is as my spirit
nay but interrupted loins you are to
know that gilbert pearson hath not fully executed
thy commands touching a part those malignant
all whom should have died at noon
woodstock 
what execution what malignant said
cromwell laying down his knife and fork
those in the prison here at woodstock
answered zerobabel whom your excellency
commanded should be executed at noon as taken
in the fact rebellion against the commonwealth
wretch said cromwell starting up and
addressing pearson thou hast not touched
mark everard in whom there was no guilt for
he was deceived by him who passed between us 
neither hast thou put forth thy hand on the pragmatic
presbyterian minister to have all those 
the classes cry sacrilege and alienate them from
us for ever 
if your excellency wish them to live they
live their life and death are in the power a
word said pearson
enfranchise them i must gain the presbyterian
interest over to us if i can
rochecliffe the archplotters said pearson
i thought to have executed but 
barbarous man said cromwell alike ungrateful
and impolitic wouldst thou have destroyed
our decoyduck this doctor is but like
vol iii vr
 woodstock
a well a shallow one indeed but something deeper
than the springs which discharge their secret tribute
into his keeping then come i with a pump
and suck it all up to the open air enlarge him
and let him have money if he wants it i know his
haunts he can go nowhere but our eye will be
upon him but you look at each other darkly as
if you had more to say than you durst i trust
you have not done to death sir henry lee 
no yet the man replied pearson is a
confirmed malignant and 
 ay but he is also a noble relic the ancient
english gentleman said the general i
would i knew how to win the favour that race
but we pearson whose royal robes are the armour
which we wear on our bodies and whose leadingstaves
are our sceptres are too newly set up to
draw the respect the proud malignant who
cannot brook to submit to less than royal lineage
yet what can they see in the longest kingly line
in europe save that it runs back to a successful
soldier i grudge that one man should be honoured
and followed because he is the descendant
 a victorious commander while less honour
woodstock 
and allegiance is paid to another who in personal
qualities and in success might emulate the founder
 his rivers dynasty well sir henry lee lives
and shall live for me his son indeed hath deserved
the death which he has doubtless sustained
my lord stammered pearson since your
excellency has found i am right in suspending
your order in so many instances i trust you will
not blame me in this also i thought it best to
await more special orders
thou art in a mighty merciful humour this
morning pearson said cromwell not entirely
satisfied
if your excellency please the halter is ready
and so is the provost marshal
nay if such a bloody fellow as thou hast
spared him it would ill become me to destroy
him said the general but then here is
among ilochecliftes papers the engagement 
twenty desperadoes to take us off some example
ought to be made
my lord said zerobabel consider now
how often this young man albert lee hath been
near you nay probably quite close to your 
woodstock
excellency in these darkpassages which he knew
and we did not had he been an assassin's
nature it would have cost him but a pistolshot
and the light israel was extinguished nay
in the unavoidable confusion which must have
ensued the sentinels quitting their posts he might
have had a fair chance escape
enough zerobabel he lives said the general
 he shall remain in custody for sometime
however and be then banished from england
the other two are safe course for you
would not dream considering such paltry fellows
as fit victims for my revenge
one fellow the underkeeper called joliffe
deserves death however said pearson since
he has frailty admitted that he slew honest joseph
tomkins
he deserves a reward for saving us a labour
said cromwell that tomkins was a most doublehearted
villain i have found evidence among
these papers here that if we had lost the fight at
worcester we should have had reason to regret
that we had ever trusted master tomkins it was
only our success which anticipated his treachery
i
woodstock 
write us down debtor not creditor to joceline
an you call him so and to his quarterstaffs
there remains the sacrilegious and graceless
cavalier who attempted your excellency's life
last night said pearson
nay said the general that were stooping
too low for revenge his sword had no more
power than had he thrusted with a tobaccopipe
eagles stoop not at mallards or wilddrakes
either
yet sir said pearson the fellow should
be punished as a libeller the quantity foul
and pestilential abuse which we found in his pockets
makes me loath he should go altogether free
please to look at them sir
a most vile hand said oliver as he looked
at a sheet or two our friend wildrake's poetical
miscellanies the very hand writing seems
to be drunk and the poetry not very sober what
have we here 
when i was a young lad
my fortune was bad 
if e'er i do well tis a wonder 
why what trash is this and then again 
 woodstock
now a plague on the poll
 old politic noll
we will drink till we bring
in triumph back the king
in truth if it could be done that way this poet
would be a stout champion give the poor knave
five pieces pearson and bid him go sell his ballads
if he come within twenty miles our person
though we will have him flogged till the blood
runs down to his heels
there remains only one sentenced person
said pearson a noble wolfhound finer than any
your excellency saw in ireland he belongs to
the old knight sir henry lee should your excellency
not desire to keep the fine creature yourself
might i presume to beg that i might have
leave 
 no pearson said cromwell the old man
so faithful himself shall not be deprived his
faithful dog i would had any creature were
it but a dog that followed me because it loved
me not for what it could make me
your excellency is unjust to your faithful
soldiers said zerobabel bluntly who follow
woodstock s
you like dogs fight for you like dogs and have
the grave a dog on the spot where they happen
to fall
 how now old grumbler said the general
what means this change note 
corporal curmudgeon's remains are left to
moulder under the ruins yonder tower and
tomkins is thrust into a hole in a thicket like a
beast
true true said cromwell they shall be
removed to the churchyard and every soldier
shall attend with cockades seagreen and blue
ribbon every one the noncommissioned officers
and the agitators shall have a mourningscarf
we ourselves will lead the procession and
there shall be a proper dole wine burnt brandy
and rosemary see that it is done pearson after
the funeral woodstock shall be dismantled and
destroyed that its recesses may not again afford
shelter to rebels and malignant
the commands the general were punctually
obeyed and when the other prisoners were dismissed
albert lee remained for some time in
custody he went abroad after his liberation 
woodstock
tered in king charles's guards where he was promoted
by that monarch but his fate as we shall
see hereafter only allowed him a short though
bright career
we return to the liberation the other prisoners
from woodstock the two divines completely reconciled
to each other retreated arm in arm to the
parsonage house formerly the residence dr
rochecliffe but which he now visited as the guest
 his successor nehemiah holdenough the
presbyterian had no sooner installed his friend
under his roof than he urged upon him an offer to
partake it and the income annexed to it as his own
dr rochecliffe was much affected but wisely rejected
the generous offer considering the difference
 their tenets on church government which each
entertained as religiously as his creed another
debate though a light one on the subject the
office bishops in the primitive church confirmed
him in his resolution they parted the
next day and their friendship remained undisturbed
by controversy till mr holdenough's death
in a harmony which might be in some
degree owing to their never meeting again after
woodstock 
their imprisonment doctor rocheeliffe was restored
to his living after the restoration and ascended
from thence to high clerical preferment
the inferior personages the grand gaoldelivery
at woodstock lodge easily found themselves
temporary accommodations in the town among old
acquaintance but no one ventured to entertain the
old knight understood to be so much under the
displeasure the ruling powers and even the innkeeper
 the george who had been one his
tenants scarce dared to admit him to the common
privileges a traveller who has food and lodging
for his money everard attended him unrequested
unpermitted but also unforbidden the heart
 the old man had been turned once more towards
him when he learned how he had behaved
at the memorable rencontre at the king's oak
and saw that he was an object the enmity rather
than the favour cromwell but there was
another secret feeling which tended to reconcile
him to his nephew the consciousness that everard
shared with him the deep anxiety which he experienced
on account his daughter who was not
yet returned from her doubtful and perilous expel
woodstotft
lotion he felt that he himself would perhaps
be unable to discover where alice had taken refuge
during the late events or to obtain her
deliverance if she was taken into custody he
wished everard to offer him his service in making
a search for her but shame prevented his preferring
the request and everard who could not suspect
the altered state his uncle's mind was afraid to
make the proposal assistance or even to name
the name alice
the sun had already set they sate looking each
other in the face in silence when the trampling
 horses was heard there was knocking at the
door there was a light step on the stair and
alice the subject their anxiety stood before
them she threw herself joyfully into her father's
arms who glanced his eye heedfully round the
room as he said in a whisper is all safe 
safe and out danger as i trust replied
alice i have a token for you
her eye then rested on everard she blushed
was embarrassed and silent
you need not fear your presbyterian cousin
said the knight with a goodhumoured smile he
woodstock 
has himself proved a confessor at least for loyalty
and ran the risk being a martyr
she pulled from her bosom the royal rescript
written on a small and soiled piece paper and
tied round with a worsted thread instead a sealsuch
as it was sir henry ere he opened it pressed
the little packet with oriental veneration to iris
lips to his heart to his forehead and it was not
before a tear had dropt on it that he found courage
to open and read the billet it was in these
words 
loyal oui much esteemed friend our
trusty subject
it having become known to us that a purpose
 marriage has been entertained betwixt mrs alice
lee your only daughter and markham everard
esq severely chase her kinsman and by
affiance your nephew and being assured that
this match would be highly agreeable to you
had it not been for certain respects to our service
which induced you to refuse your consent
thereto we do therefore acquaint you that far
from our aflfiirs suffering by such an alliance we
 woodstock
do exhort and so far as we may require you to
consent to the same as you would wish to do us
good pleasure and greatly to advance our affairs
leaving to you nevertheless as becometh a christian
king the full exercise your own discretion
concerning other obstacles to such an alliance
which may exist independent those connected
with our service witness our hand together with
our thankful recollections your good services to
our late royal father as well as ourselves
c r
long and steadily did sir henry gaze on the
letter so that it might almost seem as if he were
getting it by heart he then placed it carefully
in his pocketbook and asked alice the account
 her adventures the preceding night they
were briefly told their midnight walk through
the chase had been speedily and safely accomplished
when she had seen charles and his
attendant set off she had taken some repose in
the cottage where they parted with the morning
came news that woodstock was occupied by
soldiers so that return thither might have led to
woodstock 
danger suspicion and inquiry alice therefore
did not attempt it but went to a house in the
neighbourhood inhabited by a lady established
loyalty whose husband had been major sir
henry lee's regiment and had fallen at the battle
 naseby mrs aylmer was a sensible woman
and indeed the necessities the singular times
had sharpened every one's faculties for stratagem
and intrigue she sent a faithful servant to scout
about the mansion at woodstock who no sooner
saw the prisoners dismissed and in safety and ascertained
the knight's destination for the evening
than he carried the news to his mistress and by
her orders attended alice on horseback to join
her father 
there was seldom perhaps an evening meal
made in such absolute silence as by this embarrassed
party each occupied with their own thoughts
and at a loss how to fathom those the others
at length the hour came when alice felt herself at
liberty to retire to repose after a day so fatiguing
everard handed her to the door her apartment
and was then himself about to take leave when
to his surprise his uncle asked him to return
 woodstock
pointed to a chair and giving him the king's
letter to read fixed his looks on him steadily during
the perusal determined that if he could discover
aught short the utmost delight in the
reading the commands the king himself should
be disobeyed rather than alice should be sacrificed
to one who received not her hand as the
greatest blessing earth had to bestow but the
features everard indicated joyful hope even
beyond what the father could have anticipated yet
mingled with surprise and when he raised his eye
to the knight's with timidity and doubt a smile was
on sir henry's countenance as he broke silence
the king he said had he no other subject
in england should dispose at will those the
house lee but methinks the family everard
have not been so devoted late to the crown as
to comply with a mandate inviting its heir to
marry the daughter a beggar
the daughter sir henry lee said everard
kneeling to his uncle and perforce kissing his
hand would grace the house a duke
the girl is well enough said the knight
proudly for myself my poverty shall neither
woodstock 
shame nor encroach on my friends some few
pieces i have by dr rochcliff'e's kindness and
joceline and i will strike out something
nay my dear uncle you are richer than you
think for said everard that part your
estate which my father redeemed for payment 
a moderate composition is still your own and
held by trustees in your name myself being one
 them you are only our debtor for an advance
 moneys for which if it will content you we will
count with you like usurers my father is incapable
 profiting by making a bargain on his own
account for the estate a distressed friend and
all this you would have learned long since but
that you would not i mean time did not serve
for explanation i mean 
you mean i was too hot to hear reason mark
and i believe it is very true but i think we ununderstand
each other nov tomorrow i go with
my family to kingston where is an old house i
may still call mine come hither at thy leisure
mark or thy best speed as thou wilt but come
with thy father's consent
 woodstock
with my father in person said everard
if you will permit
be that answered the knight as he and
you will i think joceline will scarce shut the
door in thy face or bevis growl as he did after
poor louis kerneguy nay no more raptures
but good night mark good night and if thou
art not tired with the fatigue yesterday why
if you appear here at seven in the morning i think
we must bear with your company on the kingston
road
once more everard pressed the knight's hand
caressed bevis who received his kindness graciously
and went home to dreams happiness
which were realized so far as this motley world
permits within a few months afterwards

years rush by us like the wind we see not

after the marriage alice and markham

ancient manorhouse belonging to the redeemed

now man and wife with one or two domestics

tired shakspeare and solitude he was ever a
welcome guest at his soninlaw's where he went
the more frequently that markham had given up
all concern in public affairs disapproving the
forcible dismissal the parliament and submitting
to cromweirs subsequent domination rather
as that which was the lesser evil than as to
a government which he regarded as legal cromwell
seemed ever willing to show himself his
friend but everard resenting highly the proposal
to deliver up the king which he considered
as an insult to his honour never answered
such advances and became on the contrary 
the opinion which was now generally prevalent
in the nation that a settled government could not
be obtained without the recall the banished
family there is no doubt that the personal
kindness which he had received from charles
rendered him the more readily disposed to such
a measure he was peremptory however in
declining all engagements during oliver's life
whose power he considered as too firmly fixed to
be shaken by any plots which could be formed
against it
woodstock 
meantime wildrake continued to be everard's
protected dependent as before though sometimes
the connexion tended not a little to his inconvenience
that respectable person indeed while
he remained stationary in his patron's house or
that the old knight discharged many little duties
in the family and won alice's heart by his
attention to the children teaching the boys 
whom they had three to ride fence toss the
pike and many similar exercises and above all
filling up a great blank in her father's existence
with whom he played at chess and backgammon
or read shakspeare or was clerk to prayers when
any sequestrated divine ventured to read the service
 the church or he found game for him
while the old gentleman continued to go a sporting
and especially he talked over the storming
 brentford and the battles edgehill
banbury roadwaydown and others themes
which the aged cavalier delighted in but which
he could not so well enter upon with colonel
everard who had gained his laurels in the parliament
service
the assistance which he received from 
woodstock
rake's society became more necessary after sir
henry was deprived his gallant and only son
who was slain in the fatal battle dunkirk
where unhappily english colours were displayed
on both the contending sides the french being
then allied with oliver who sent to their aid a
body auxiliaries and the troops the banished
king fighting in behalf the spaniards sir
henry received the melancholy news ike an old
man that is with more external composure than
could have been anticipated he dwelt for weeks
and months on the lines forwarded by the indefatigable
doctor rochcliffe superscribed in small
letters c r and subscribed louis kerneguy in
which the writer conjured him to endure this inestimable
loss with the greater firmness that he
had still left one son intimating himself who
would always regard him as a father
but in despite this balsam sorrow acting
imperceptibly and sucking the blood like a vampire
seemed gradually drying up the springs 
life and without any formed illness or outward
complaint the old man's strength and vigour
woodstock 
gradually abated and the ministry wildrake
proved daily more indispensable
it was not however always to be had the
cavalier was one those happy persons whom
a strong constitution an unreflecting mind and
exuberant spirits enable to play through their
whole lives the part a schoolboy happy for
the moment and careless consequences
once or twice every year when he had collected
a few pieces the cavaliers wildrake made a start
to london where as he described it he went on
the ramble drank as much wine as he could come
by and led a sheltering life to use his own
phrase among fostering cavaliers like himself
till by some rash speech or wild action he got
into the marshalsea the fleet or some other
prison from which he was to be delivered at the
expense interest money and sometimes a little
reputation
at length cromwell died his son resigned the
government and the various changes which followed
induced everard as well as many others
to adopt more active measures in the king's belial
everard even remitted considerable sums
woodstock
for his service but with the utmost caution and
corresponding with no intermediate agent but
with the chancellor himself to whom he communicated
much useful information upon public affairs
with all his prudence he was very nearly
engaged in the ineffectual rising booth and
middleton in the west and with great difficulty
escaped from the fatal consequences that illtimed
attempt after this although the estate
 the kingdom was trebly unsettled yet no card
seemed to turn up favourable to the royal cause
until the movement general monk from scotland
even then it was when at the point 
complete success that the fortunes charles
seemed at a lower ebb than ever especially when
intelligence had arrived at the little court which
he then kept in brussels that monk on arriving
in london had put himself under the orders 
the parliament
it was at this time and in the evening while
the king buckingham wilmot and some other
gallants his wandering court were engaged ina
convivial party that the chancellor clarendon
suddenly craved audience and entering with less
woodstock j
ceremony than he would have done at another
time announced extraordinary news for the messenger
he said he could say nothing saving that
he appeared to have drunk much and slept little 
but that he had brought a sure token credence
from a man for whose faith he would venture his
life the king demanded to see the messenger
himself
a man entered with something the manners 
a gentleman and more those a rakehelly debauchee
 his eyes swelled and inflamed his gait
disordered and stumbling partly through lack 
sleep partly through the means he had taken to
support his fatigue he staggered without ceremony
to the head the table seized the king's
hand which he mumbled like a piece gingerbread
while charles who began to recollect
him from his mode salutation was not very
much pleased that their meeting should have taken
place before so many witnesses
i bring good news said the uncouth messenger
 glorious news the king shall enjoy
his own again my feet are beautiful on the
mountains gad i have lived with presbyterians
till i have caught their language but we
s woodstock
are all one man's children now all your majesty's
poor babes the rump is all ruined in london
 bonfires flaming music playing rumps
roasting healths drinking london in a blaze 
light from the strand to rotherhithe tankards
clattering 
 we can guess at that said the duke 
buckingham
my old friend mark everard sent me oft
with the news i'm a villain if i've slept since
your majesty recollects me i am sure your
majesty remembers sa sa at the king's oak
at woodstock 
o we'll dance and sins and play
for twill be a joyous day
wheen the king shall enjoy his own again 
master wildrake i remember you well
said the king i trust the good news is certain

certain your majesty did i not hear the
bells did i not see the bonfires did i not
drink your majesty's health so often that my
legs would scarce carr me to the wharf it is
as certain as that i am poor roger ildrake 
ualtlcscamerc lincoln
woodstock 
the duke buckingham here whispered to
the king i have always suspected your majesty
kept odd company during the escape from
worcester but this seems a rare sample
why pretty much ike yourself and other
company i have kept here so many years as
stout a heart as empty a head said charles
as much lace though somewhat tarnished as
much brass on the brow and nearly as much
copper in the pocket
i would your majesty would intrust this
messenger good news with me to get the
truth out him said buckingham
thank your grace replied the king but
he has a will as well as yourself and such seldom
agree my lord chancellor hath wisdom
and to that we must trust ourselves master
wildrake you will go with my lord chancellor
who will bring us a report your tidings 
meantime i assure you that you shall be no
loser for being the first messenger good news
so saying he gave a signal to the chancellor to
take away wildrake whom he judged in his
present humour to be not unlikely to 
woodstock
cate some former passages at woodstock which
might rather entertain than edify the wits his
court
corroboration the joyful intelligence soon
arrived and wildrake was presented with a
handsome gratuity and small pension which by
the king's special desire had no duty whatever
attached to it
shortly afterwards all england was engaged
in crossing his favourite ditty 
oh the twentyninth may
it was a glorious day
when the king shall eijoy his own again
on that memorable day the king prepared to
make his progress from rochester to london
with a reception on the part his subjects so unanimously
cordial as made him say gaily it must
have been his own fault to stay so long away from
a country where his arrival gave so much joy
on horseback betwixt his brothers the dukes 
york and glocester the restored monarch trod
slowly over roads strewn with flowers by conduits
running wine under triumphal arches and
through streets hung with tapestry there were
the citizens in various bands some arrayed in coats
fostok 
 black velvet with gold chains some in military
suits cloth gold or cloth silver followed
by all those craftsmen who having hooted
the father from whitehall were now come to
shout the son into possession his ancestral palace
on his progress through blockhead he
passed that army which so long formidable to
england herself as well as to europe had been
the means restoring the monarchy which their
own hands had destroyed as the king passed
the last files this formidable host he came to
an open part the heath where many persons
 quality wide others inferior rank had stationed
themselves to gratulate him as he passed
towards the capital
there was one group however which attracted
peculiar attention from those around on account
 the respect shown to the party by the
soldiers who kept the ground and who whether
cavaliers or roundheads seemed to contest emulously
which should contribute most to their accommodation
 for both the elder and younger
gentlemen the party had been distinguished in
the civil war
s woodstock
it was a family group which the principal
figure was an old man seated in a chair having
a complacent smile on his face and a tear swelling
to his eye as he saw the banners wave on in
interminable succession and heard the multitude
shouting the long silenced acclamation god
save king charles his cheek was ashy pale
and his long beard bleached like the thistle down
his blue eye was cloudless yet it was obvious that
its vision was failing his motions were feeble
and he spoke little except when he answered the
prattle his grandchildren or asked a question
at his daughter who sate beside him matured
in matronly beauty or at colonel everard who
stood behind there too the stout yeoman joce
line joliffe still in his sylvan dress leaned like
a second benaiah on the quarterstaff that had
done the king good service in its day and his
wife a buxom matron as she had been a pretty
maiden laughed at her own consequence and
ever and anon joined her shrill notes to the stentorian
halloo which her husband added to the
general exclamation
three fine boys and two pretty girls prattled

around their grandfather who made them such
answers as suited their age and repeatedly passed
his withered hand over the fair locks the little
darlings while alice assisted by wildrake blazing
in a splendid dress and his eyes washed with
only a single cup canary took off the children's
attention from time to time lest they should weary
their grandfather we must not omit one other
remarkable figure in the group a gigantic dog
which bore the signs being at the extremity 
canine life being perhaps fifteen or sixteen years
old but though exhibiting but the ruin his
former appearance his eyes dim his joints stiff
his head slouched down and his gallant carriage
and graceful motions exchanged for a stiff rheumatic
hobbling gait the noble hound had lost
none his instinctive fondness for his master
to lie by sir henry s feet in the sun in summer
or by the fire in winter to raise his head to look
on him to lick his withered hand or his shrivelled
cheek from time to time seemed now all that
bevis lived for
three or four liveryservants attended to protect
this group from the thronging multitude 
iiiiij woodstock
but it needed not the high respectability and
unpretending simplicity their appearance gave
them even in th eyes the coarsest the people
an air patriarchal dignity which commanded
general regard and they sat upon the
bank which they had chosen for their station by
the way side as undisturbed as if they had been
in their own park
and now the distant clarion announced the
royal presence onward came pursuivant and
trumpet onward came plumes and cloth gold
and waving standards displayed and swords
gleaming to the sun and at length heading a
group the noblest in england and supported
by his royal brothers on either side onward came
king charles he had already halted more than
once in kindness perhaps as well as policy to
exchange a word nth persons whom he recognized
among the spectators and the shouts the
bysanders applauded a courtesy which seemed
so well timed but when he had gazed an instant
on the party we have described it was impossible
if even alice had been too much changed to be
recognized not instantly to know bevis and his
venerable master the monarch sprung from hi
wooustock st
horse and walked instantly up to the old knight
amid thundering acclamations which rose from
the multitudes around when they saw charles
with his own hand oppose the feeble attempts 
the old man to rise to do him homage gently
replacing him on his seat bless he said
father bless your son who has returned in
safety as you blessed him when he departed in
danger
 may god bless and preserve muttered
the old man overcome by his feelings and the
king to give him a few moments repose turned
to alice 
and you he said my fair guide how
have you been employed since our perilous nightwalk
 but i need not ask glancing round in
the service king and kingdom bringing up
subjects as loyal as their ancestors a fair lineage
by my faith and a beautiful sight to the eye
 an english king colonel everard we shall
see you i trust at whitehall here he nodded
to wildrake and thou joceline thou canst
hold thy quarterstaff with unhand sure thrust
forward the other palm
s woodstock
looking down in sheer bashfulness joceline
like a bull about to push extended to the king
over his lady's shoulder a hand as broad and hard
as a wooden trencher which the king filled with
gold coins buy a head gear for my friend phoebe
with some these said charles i she too has
been doing her duty to old england
the king then turned once more to the knight
who seemed making an effort to speak he took
his aged hand in both his own and stooped his
head towards him to catch his accents while the
old man detaining him with the other hand said
something faltering which charles could only
catch the quotation 
unthread the rude eye rebellion
and welcome home again discarded faith
extricating himself therefore as gently as possible
from a scene which began to grow painfully
embarrassing the goodnatured king said speaking
with unusual distinctness to insure the old
man's comprehending him this is something
too public a place for all we have to say but if
you come not soon to see king charles at whitehall
he will send down louis kerneguy to visit
woodstock s
you that you may see how rational he is become
since his travels
so saying he once more pressed affectionately
the old man's hand bowed to alice and all
around and withdrew sir henry lee listening
with a smile which showed he comprehended the
gracious tendency what had been said the
old man leaned back on his seat and muttered
the nunc dimittis
 excuse me for having made you wait my
lords said the king as he mounted his horse 
had it not been for these good folks you might
have waited for me long enough move on sirs
the array moved on accordingly the sound 
trumpets and drums again rose amid the acclamations
which had been silent while the kingstopped
 while the effect the whole procession
resuming its motion was so splendidly dazzling
that even alice's anxiety about her father's health
was for a moment suspended while her eye followed
the long line varied brilliancy that proceeded
over the heath when she looked again at
sir henry she was startled to see that his cheek
which had gained some colour during his convert

nation with the king had relapsed into earthy
paleness that his eyes were closed and opened
not again and that his features expressed amid
their quietude a rigidity which is not that sleep
they ran to his assistance but it was too late
the light that burned so low in the socket had
leaped up and expired in one exhilarating flash
the rest must be conceived i have only to
add that his faithful dog did not survive him
many days and that the image bevis lies carved
at his master's feet on the tomb which was
erected to the memory sir henry lee

 two gentlemen rompeii
sho diomed well met do you sup with
glaucus tonight said a young man small
stature who wore his timid in those loose and
effeminate folds which proved him to be a gentleman
and a coxcomb
alas no dear clodius he has not invited me
replied diomed a man a portly frame and 
middle age by pollux a scurvy trick for they
say his suppers are best in pompeii
pretty well though there is never enough 
wine for me it is not old greek blood that
flows in his veins for he pretends that wine makes
him dull next morning
 
 
there may be another reason for that thrift
said denied raining his brows with all his conceit
and extravagance he is not so rich i fancy ashe
affects to be and perhaps loves to save his 
better than his wit
an additional reason for supping with him
while sesterces next year diomed we
must find another glaucus
he is fond dice too i hear
he is fond every pleasure and awhile he
likes pleasure giving suppers we are all
fond ann
ha ha clodius that is well said have you
ever seen my winecellars by by 
i think not my good diomed
well you must sup with me some evening 
i have tolerable urania in my reservoir and i
will ask pansa stile to meet you
oh no state with mv persians odi apparatus
i am easily contented avell day wanes i
am for baths and you 
to questor business state afterwards
to temple isis vale 
murseiia lampreys

an ostentatious bustling illbred fellow muttered
clodius to himself as he sauntered slowly
away he thinks with his feasts and his winecellars
to make us forget that he is son a
freedman and so we will when we do him 
honour winning his money these rich plebeians
are a harvest for us spendthrift nobles
thus soliloquizing clodius arrived in via
domitian which was crowded with passengers
and chariots and exhibited all that gay and animated
exuberance life and motion which we
find at this day in streets naples
 bells cars as they rapidly glided by
each other jingled merrily on ear and clodius
with smiles or nods claimed familiar acquaintance
with whatever equipage was most elegant or fantastic
 in fact no young man was better known
about pompeii
what clodius and how have you slept on
your good fortune cried in a pleasant and musical
voice a young man in a chariot most
fastidious and graceful fashion upon its surface
 bronze were elaborately wrought in still
exquisite workmanship greece reliefs 

olympian games two horses that dream 
car were rarest breed parthia their
slender limbs seemed to disdain ground and
comet air and yet at slightest touch 
 charioteer who stood behind young owner
 equipage they paused motionless as if
suddenly transformed into stone lifeless but
lifelike as one breathing wonders 
praxiteles owner himself was that
slender and beautiful symmetry from which
 sculptors athens drew their models his
grecian origin betrayed itself in his light but
clustering locks and perfect harmony his
features he wore no toga which in time 
 emperors had indeed ceased to be general
distinction romans and was especially ridiculed
by pretenders to fashion but his tunic
glowed in richest hues tyrian dye and
 fibulae or buckles by which it was fastened
sparkled with emeralds around his neck he wore
a chain gold which in middle his breast
twisted itself into form a serpent's head
from mouth which hung pendant a large
signet ring elaborate and most exquisite workpompeii

manship sleeves tunic were loose and
fringed at hand with gold and across 
waist a girdle wrought in arabesque designs and
 same material as fringe served in lieu
 pockets for receptacle handkerchief
and purse stylus and tablets
my dear glaucus said clodius i rejoice
to see that yom losses have so little affected your
mien why you seem as if you had been inspired
by apollo and your face shines with happiness
like a glory any one might take you for winner
and me for loser
and what is there in loss or gain those
dull pieces metal that should change our spirit my
clodius per jove while yet young we can cover
our full locks with chaplets while yet cithara
sounds on unsated ears while yet smile 
lydia or chloe flashes over our veins in which
 blood runs so swiftly so long shall we find
delight in sunny air and make bald time itself
but treasurer our joys you sup with me
tonight you know
who ever forgets invitation glaucus 
but which way go you now 
 
 why i tlionglit visiting baths but it
savants yet an hour to usual time
well i will dismiss my chariot and go with
you so so my philips stroking horse
nearest to him which by a low neigh and with
backward ears playfully acknowledged courtesy
 ji holiday for you today is he not
handsome clodius
worthy phoebus returned noble parasite
 or glaucus

 blind flowergirl and beauty fashion
 athenian's confession reader's introduction
to graces egypt
talking lightly on a tlioiisand matters two
young men sauntered through streets they
were now in that quarter which was filled ith
 gayest shops their open interiors all and each
radiant with gaudy yet harmonious colours 
frescos inconceivably varied in fancy and design
 sparkling fountains that at every vista threw
upwards their grateful spray in summer air 
 crowd passengers or rather loiterers mostly
clad in robes tyrian dye gay groups
collected round each more attractive shop 
slaves passing to and fro with buckets bronze
cast in most graceful shapes and borne upon
their heads country girls stationed at free

quest intervals with baskets blushing fniit and
flowers more alluring to antient italians than
to their descendants with whom indeed late
ayigids in herbage a disease seems lurking in every
violet and rose a numerous haunts which
fulfilled with that idle people office cafes and
clubs at this day shops where on shelves
 marble were ranged vases wine and oil
and before whose thresholds seats protected from
 sun by a purple awning invited weary to
rest and indolent to lounge made a scene 
such glowing and vivacious excitement as might
well give athenian spirit glaucus an excuse
for its susceptibility to joy
talk to me no more rome said he to
clodius pleasure is too stately and ponderous
in those mighty walls even in precincts 
court even in golden house nero and 
incipient glories palace titus there is a
certain dulness magnificence eye aches 
 spirit is wearied besides my clodius we are
discontented when we see enormous luxury
and wealth others with mediocrity our
own state but here we surrender ourselves
easily to pleasure and we have brilliancy 
luxury without lassitude its pomp
it was from that feeling that you chose your
summer retreat at pompeii
it was i prefer it to baiae i giant 
charms latter but i love not pedants
who resort there and who seem to weigh out
their pleasures by drachm
yet you are fond learned too and as
for poetry why your house is literally eloquent
with aeschylus and homer epic and 
drama
yes but those romans who mimic my athenian
ancestors do everything so heavily even in
 chase they make their slaves carry plato
with them and whenever boar is lost out
they take their books and their papjtus in
order not to lose their time too when 
dancing girls swim before them in all blandishment
 persian manners some drone a freedman
with a face stone reads them a section 
cicero de ojjidis unskilful pharmacists pleasure
and study are not elements to be thus mixed
together they must be enjoyed separately 

romans lose both by this pragmatical affectation 
refinement and prove that they have no souls
for either oh my clodius how little your countrymen
know true versatility a pericles
 true witcheries an aspasia it was but
 other day that i paid a visit to pliny he
was sitting in his summerhouse writing while
an unfortunate slave played on tibia his
nephew oh whip me such philosophical coxcombs
 was reading thucydides description 
 plague and nodding his conceited little
head in time to music while his lips were
repeating all loathsome details that terrible
delineation puppy saw nothing incongruous
in learning at same time a ditty 
love and a description plague
why they arc much same thing said
clodius
so i told him in excuse for his coxcombry 
but my youth stared me rebukingly in face
without taking jest and answered that it was
only insensate ear that music pleased
whereas description plague
you elevated heart ah quoth
 
 fat uncle wheezing my boy is quite an athenian
always mixing xitih with diilct o
minerva how i laughed in my sleeve while
i was there they came to tell boysophist that
his favourite freedman was just dead a fever
 inexorable death cried he get me my
horace how beautifully sweet poet consoles
us for these misfortunes oh can these men
love my clodius scarcely even with senses
how rarely a roman has a heart he is but
 mechanism genius he wants its bones and
flesh
though clodius was secretly a little sore at
these invectives on his countrymen he affected to
sympathise with his friend partly because he was
by nature a parasite and partly because it was 
fashion among dissolute young romans to
affect a little contempt for very birth which in
reality made them so arrogant it was mode
to imitate greeks and yet to laugh at their
own clumsy imitation
thus conversing their steps were arrested by a
crowd gathered round an open space where three
streets met and just where porticos a light
 
and graceful temple threw their shade there stood
a young girl with a flowerbasket on her right
arm and a small threestringed instrument 
music in left hand to whose low and soft tones
she was modulating a wild and half barbaric air
at every pause in music she gracefully waved
her flowerbasket round inviting loiterers to
buy and many a sesterce was showered into 
basket either in compliment to music or in
compassion to songstress for she was blind
it is my poor thessalian said glaucus stopping
 i have not seen her since my return to
pompeii hush her voice is sweet let us listen

buy my flowers o buy i pray
 blind girl comes from afar 
if earth be as fair as i hear them say
these flowers her children are 
do they her beauty keep 
they are fresh from her lap i know 
for i caught them fast asleep
la her arms an hour ago
with air which is her breath 
her soft and delicate breath 
over them murmuring low 
on their lips her sweet kiss lingers yet
and their cheeks with her tender tears are wet
for she weeps that gentle mother weeps 
as morn and night her watch she keeps
with a yearning heart and a passionate care
to see young things grow so fair 
she weeps for love she weeps 
and dews are tears she weeps
from well a mother's love i
ye have a world light
where love in lov'd rejoices 
but blind girl's home is house night
and its beings are empty voices
as one in realm below
i stand by streams woe
i hear vain shadows glide
i feel their soft breath at my side
 
and i thirst lov'd forms to see
and i stretch my fond arms around
and i catch but a shapeless sound
for having are ghosts to me
come buy come bus i 
hark how sweet things sigh
for they have a voice hke ours
 breath bind girl closes
 leaves saddening roses 
we are tender we sons light
we shrink from this child night 
from grasp blind girl free us 
we yearn for eyes that see us
we are for night too gay
jn your eyes we behold day 
o buy o buy flowers 
i must have yon bunch violets sweet
nydia said glaucus pressing through croavd
and diepping a handful small coins into 
basket your voice is more charming than ever
tic blind girl started forward as she heard 
athenian's voice then as suddenly paused while
 
 blood rushed violently over neck cheek and
temples
so you are returned said she in a low
voice and then repeated half to herself glaucus
is returned 
yes child i have not been at pompeii above
a few my garden wants your care as before
you will visit it i trust tomorrow and mind
no garlands at my house shall be woven by any
hands but those pretty nydia
nydia smiled joyously but did not answer and
glaucus placing violets he had selected in
his breast turned gaily and carelessly from 
crowd
so she is a sort client yours this child
said clodius
ay does she not sing prettily she interests
me poor slave besides she is from
 land gods hill olympus frowned upon
her cradle she is thessaly
 witches country
true but for my part i find every woman a
witch and at pompeii by venus very air
seems to have taken a love philtre so handsome
 
does every face without a beard seem in my
eyes
and lo one handsomest in pompeii
old diomed's daughter rich juba said claudius
as a yomig lady her face covered by her veil
and attended by two female slaves approached
them in her way to baths
fair julia we salute thee said clodius
julia partially raised her veil so as with some
coquetry to display a bold roman profile a full
dark bright eye and a cheek over whose natural
olive art shed a fairer and softer rose
and glaucus too is returned said she
glancing meaningly at athenian has he
forgotten she added in a half whisper his
friends year 
beautiful julia even lethe itself if it disappear
in one part earth rises again in
another jupiter does not allow us ever to forget
for more than a moment but venus more harsh
still vouchsafes not even a moments oblivion
glaucus is never at a loss for ftiir words
who is when object them is so fair 
we shall see you both at my father's villa
soon said julia turning to clodius

we will mark day in which we visit you
with a white stone answered gamester
julia dropped her veil but slowly so that her
 glance rested on athenian with affected
timidity and real boldness glance bespoke
tenderness and reproach
 friends passed on
julia is certainly handsome said glaucus
and year you would have made that
confession in a warmer tone
true i was dazzled at first sight and
mistook for a gem that mliich was but an artful
imitation
nay returned clodius all women are 
same at heart happy he who weds a handsome
face and a large dower what more can he
desire 
glaucus sighed
they were now in a street less crowded than
 rest at which they beheld that
broad and most lovely sea which upon those delicious
coasts seems to have renounced its prerogative
 terror so soft are crispin winds
that hover around its bosom so glowing and so
various are hues which it takes from rosy
 
clouds so fragrant are perfumes liicli 
breezes from land scatter over its depths
from such a sea might youwell believe that
anadyomene rose to take empire earth
it is still early for bath said greek
who was creature every poetical impulse 
let us wander from crowded city and look
upon sea while noon yet laughs along its
billows
with all my heart said clodius and 
bay too is always most animated part 
 city
pompeii was miniature civilization 
that age within narrow compass its
walls was contained as it were a specimen 
every gift which luxury offered to power in its
minute but glittering shops its tiny palaces its
baths its forum its theatre its circus in energy
yet corruption in refinement yet vice 
 its people you beheld a model avhole
empire it was a toy a plaything a showbox in
which gods seemed pleased to keep representation
 great monarchy earth and
which they afterwards hid from time to give
to wonder posterity moral 
 
maxim that under sun there is nothingnew

crowded in glassy bay were vessels 
commerce and gilded galleys for pleasures
 rich citizens boats fishermen
glided rapidly to and fro and afar off you sav 
tall masts fleet under command pliny
upon shore sate a sicilian who with vehement
gestures and flexile features was narrating to a
group fishermen and peasants a strange tale 
shipwrecked mariners and friendly dolphins just
as at this day in modern neighbourhood you
may hear upon mole naples
drawing his comrade from crowd greek
bent his steps towards a solitary part beach
and two friends seated on a small crag which
rose amidst smooth pebbles inhaled voluptuous
and cooling breeze which dancing over 
waters kept music with its invisible feet there
was perhaps something in scene that invited
them to silence and reverie clodius shading his
eyes from burning sky was calculating 
gains week and greek leaning
upon his hand and shrinking not from that sun 
his nation s tutelary deity with whose fluent
 
light poesy and joy and love his own veins
were filled gazed upon broad expanse and
envied perhaps every wind that bent its pinions
towards shores greece
tell me clodius said greek at 
hast thou ever been iu love 
yes very often
he who has loved often answered glaucus
has loved never there is but one eros though
there are many counterfeits him
 counterfeits are not bad little gods upon
 whole answered clodius
i agree with you returned greek i
adore even shadow love but i adore himself
yet more
art thou then in sober and earnest love 
hast thou that feeling poets describe a feeling
that makes us neglect our suppers forswear
 theatre and write elegies i should never
have thouiifht it you dissemble well
i am not far gone enough for that returned
glaucus smiling or rather i say with tibullus
whom soft love rules where'er his path
walks safe and sacred

in fact i am not in love but i could be if there were
but occasion to see object eros would light
his torch but priests have given him no oil
shall i guess object is it not diomed's
daughter she adores you and does not affect to
conceal it and by hercules i say again and
again she is both handsome and rich she will
bind doorposts her husband with golden
meets
no i do not desire to sell myself diomed's
daughter is handsome i grant and at one time
had she not been grandchild a freedman i
might have yet no she carries all her beauty
on her face her manners are not maidenlike and
her mind knows no culture save that pleasure 
you are ungrateful tell me then who is
 fortunate virgin 
you shall hear my clodius several months
ago i was sojourning at neapolis a city utterly to
my own heart for it still retains manners and
stamp its grecian origin and it yet merits 
name parthenope from its delicious air and its
beautiful shores one day i entered temple 
minerva to offer up my prayers not for myself
 
more than for city on which pachas smiles no
longer temple was empty and deserted 
recollections athens crowded fast and meltingly
upon me imagining myself still alone in 
temple and absorbed in earnestness my
devotion my prayer gushed from my heart to my
lips and i wept as i prayed i was startled in
 midst my devotions however by a deep
sigh i turned suddenly round and just behind me
alas a female she had raised her veil also in
prayer and when our eyes met methought a
celestial ray shot from those dark and shining orbs
at once into my soul never my clodius have
i seen mortal face more exquisitely moulded a
certain melancholy softened and yet elevated
its expression that unutterable something which
springs from soul and aahich our sculptors
have imparted to aspect psyche gave her
beauty i know not what divine and noble 
tears were rolling down her eyes i guessed at
once that she was also athenian lineage and
that in my prayer for athens her heart had responded
to mine i spoke to her though with a
faltering voice art thou not too athenian 

said i o beautiful virgin at sound my
voice she blushed and half drew her veil across
her face my forefathers ashes said she repose
by waters ulysses my birth is 
neapolis but my heart as my lineage is athenians
 let us then said i make our offerings
together and as priest now appeared
we stood side by side while we followed priest
in his ceremonial prayer together we touched
 knees goddess together we laid our
olive garlands on altar i felt a strange
emotion almost sacred tenderness at this companionship
we strangers from a far and fallen
land stood together and alone in that temple
 our country's deity was it not natural that
my heart should yearn to my countrywoman for
so i might surely call her i felt as if i had
known her for years and that simple rite seemed
as by a miracle to operate on sympathies and
ties time silently we left temple and i
was about to ask her where she dwelt and if i
might be permitted to visit her when a youth in
whose features there was some kindred resemblance
to her own and who stood upon steps

 
 fane took her by hand she turned
round and bade me farewell crowd separated
us i saw her no more on reaching my
home i found letters which obliged me to set out
for athens for my relations threatened me with
litigation concerning my inheritance when that
suit was happily over i repaired once more to
neapolis i instituted inquiries throughout 
whole city i could discover no clue my lost
countrywoman and hoping to lose in gaiety
all remembrance that beautiful apparition i
hastened to plunge myself amidst luxuries 
pompeii this is all my history i do not love 
but i remember and regret
as clodius was about to reply a slow and
stately step approached them and at sound
it made amongst pebbles each turned and
each recognised newcomer
it was a man who had scarcely reached his
fortieth year tall stature and a thin but
nervous and sinewy frame his skin dark and
bronzed betrayed his eastern origin and his
features had something greek in their outline
especially in chin lip brow and 
throat save that nose was somewhat raised and

aquiline and bones hard and visible forbade
that fleshy and wasong contour which on grecian
physiognomy preserved even in manhood round
and beautiful curves youth his eyes large and
black as deepest night shone with no varying
and uncertain lustre a deep thoughtful and
half melancholy calm seemed unalterably fixed
in their majestic and commanding gaze his
step and mien were peculiarly sedate and lofty
and something foreign in fashion and sober
hues his sweeping garments added to impressive
effect his quiet countenance and stately
form each young men in saluting 
newcomer made mechanically and with care to
conceal it from him a slight gesture or sign with
their fingers for arbaces egyptian was supposed
to possess fatal gift evil eye
 scene must indeed be beautiful said
arbaces with a cold though courteous smile
which draws gay clodius and glaucus 
alladmired from crowded thoroughfares 
 city
is nature ordinarily so unattractive asked
 greek
to dissipated yes

an austere but scarcely a wise one
pleasure delights in contrasts it is from dissipation
that we learn to enjoy solitude and from solitude dissipation
so think young philosophers garden
replied egyptian they mistake lassitude
for meditation and imagine that because
they are sated with others they know delight
 loneliness but not in such jaded bosoms can
nature awaken that enthusiasm which alone draws
from her chaste reserve all her unspeakable beauty 
she demands from you not exhaustion passion
but all that fervour from which you only seek
in adoring her a release when young athenian
 moon revealed herself in visions light to
endymion it was after a day passed not amongst
 feverish haunts men but on still mountains
and in solitary valleys hunter
beautiful simile cried glaucus most unjust
application exhausted ah youth is never
exhausted and by me at least one moment 
satiety has never been known 
again egyptian smiled but his smile was
cold and blighting and even unimaginative clog

dies froze beneath its light he did not however
reply to passionate exclamation glaucus 
but after a pause he said in a soft and melancholy
voice
after all you do right to enjoy hour while
it smiles for you rose soon withers perfume
soon exhales and we o glaucus strangers
in land and far from our fathers ashes what
is there left for us but pleasure or regret for
you first perhaps for me 
 bright eyes greek were suddenly
suffused with tears ah speak not arbaces he
cried speak not om ancestors let us forget
that there were ever other liberties than those 
rome and glory oh vainly would we call
her ghost from fields marathon and thermopylae

thy heart rebukes thee while thou speaketh
said egyptian and in thy gaieties this
night thou wilt be more mindful leana than
 lais vale r
leaena heroic mistress aristogeiton when put to 
torture she bit out her tongue that pain might not induce
her to betray conspiracy against sons pisistratus 
statue a lioness erected in her honour was to be seen at
athens in time pausanias
 
thus sang he gathered his robe around him
and slowly swept away
i breathe more freely said clodius imitating
 egyptians we sometimes introduce a skeleton
at our feasts in truth presence such
an egyptian as yon gliding shadow were spectre
enough to sour richest grape valerian
strange man i said glaucus musingly yet
dead though he seem to pleasure and cold to 
objects world scandal belies him or his
house and his heart could tell a different tale
ah there are whispers other orgies than
those osiris in his gloomy mansion he is rich
too they say can we not get him amongst us
and teach him charms dice pleasure 
pleasures hot fever hope and fear inexpressible
unsated passion how fiercely beautiful thou art
gaming 
inspired inspired cried glaucus laughing 
 oracle speaks poetry in clodius what
miracle next 

chapter iii
parentage glaucus description houses
 pompeii a classic revel
heaven had given to glaucus every blessing
but one it had given him beauty health fortune
genius illustrious descent a heart fire a mind
 poetry but it had denied him heritage 
freedom he was born in athens subject 
rome succeeding early to an ample inheritance
he had indulged that inclination for travel so natural
to young and had drunk deep intoxicating
draught pleasure amidst gorgeous
luxuries imperial comet
he was an alcibiades without ambition he
was what a man imagination youth fortune
and talents readily becomes when you deprive
him inspiration glory his house at
rome was theme debauchees but also 
 
 lovers art and sculptors greece delighted
to task their skill in adorning porticos
and exedra an athenian his retreat in pompeii
 alas colours are faded now walls
stripped their paintings its main hcauty its
elaborate finish grace and ornament is gone 
yet when first given once more to day what
eulogies what wonder did its minute and glowing
decorations create its paintings its mosaics
passionately enamoured poetry and drama
which recalled to glaucus wit and heroism
his race that fairy mansion was adorned with representations
aeschylus and homer and antiquaries
who resolve taste to a trade have turned
 patron to professor and still though 
error is now acknowledged they style in custom
as they first named in mistake disbursed
house athenian glaucus house 
 dramatic poet
previous to our description this house it may
 as well to convey to reader a general notion
 houses pompeii which he mill find to resemble
strongly plans vitruvius but withall
those differences in detail caprice and taste

which being natural to mankind have always
puzzled antiquaries we shall endeavour to make
this description as clear and pedantic as possible
you enter then usually by a small entrance
passage called vestibule into a hall sometimes
with but more frequently without ornament
 columns around three sides this hall are
doors communicating with several bedchambers
among which is porter's best these
being usually appropriated to country visitors at
 extremity hall on either side to 
right and left if house is large there are two
small recesses rather than chambers generally devoted
to ladies mansion and in 
centre tesselated pavement hall is invariably
a square shallow reservoir for rainwater
classically termed impluvium which was admitted
by a hole in roof above said
aperture being covered at will by an awning near
this impluvium which had a peculiar sanctity in
 eyes ancients were sometimes but at
pompeii more rarely than at rome placed images
 household gods hospitable hearth
often mentioned by roman poets and cones
 
crated to lares was at pompeii almost invariably
formed by a moveable rasher while in some
corner often most ostentatious place was deposited
a hugc avoodcn chest ornamented and
strengthened by bands bronze or iron and
secured by strong hooks upon a stone pedestal so
firmly as to defy attempts any robber to
detach it from its position this chest was supposed
to be moneybox or coffer master
 house though as no money has been found
in any chests discovered at pompeii it is
probable that it was sometimes rather designed for
ornament than use
in this hall or atrium to speak classically 
clients and visitors inferior rank were usually
received in houses more respectable
an atriensis or slave peculiarly devoted to 
service hall was invariably retained and his
rank among his fellowslaves was high and important
 reservoir in centre must have
been rather a dangerous ornament but centre
 hall was like grassplat a college and
interdicted to passers to and fio who found
ample space in margin right opposite 

entrance at other hall was an
apartment stabling in wliieh pavement was
usually adorned with rich mosaics and walls
covered with elaborate paintings here were usually
kept records family or those any
public office that had been filled by owner 
on one side this saloon if we may so call it
was often a diningroom or triclinium on other
side perhaps what we should now term a cabinet 
gems containing whatever curiosities were deemed
most rare and costly and invariably a small passage
for slaves to cross to farther parts 
 house without passing apartments thus
mentioned these rooms all opened on a square
or oblong colonnade technically termed peristyle
if house was small its boundary ceased with
this colonnade and in that case its centre however
diminutive was ordinarily appropriated to 
purpose a garden and adorned with vases 
flowers placed upon pedestals while under 
colonnade to right and left were doors admitting
to bedrooms to a second triclinium or
 romans had bedrooms appropriated not only to 
sleep night but also to day siesta cubicula diurnal

eating room for ancients generally appropriated
two rooms at least to that purpose one for 
and one for winter or perhaps one for ordinary
 other for festive occasions and if 
owner affected letters a cabinet dignified by 
name hilary for a very small room alas sufficient
to contain few rolls papyrus which 
ancients deemed a notable collection books
at peristyle was generally 
kitchen supposing house was large it did not
 with peristyle and centre thereof
was not in that case a garden but might be perhaps
adorned with a fountain or basin for fish
and at its cud exactly opposite to tablinum was
generally another eating room on either side 
which were bedrooms and perhaps a picturesaloon
or pinatheca these apartments communicated
again with a square or oblong space usually
adorned on three sides with a colonnade like 
peristyle and very much resembling peristyle
only longer this was proper viridariion or
garden being usually adorned a with a fountain or
 in stately palaces rome pinatheca usually communicated
with atrium

statues and a profusion gay flowers at its extreme
 was gardener's house on either side
beneath colonnade were sometimes if size
 family required it additional rooms
at pompeii a second or third story was rarely
 importance being built only above a small part
 house and containing rooms for slaves
differing in this respect from more magnificent
edifices rome which generally contained 
principal eatingroom or coenaculum on second
floor apartments themselves were ordinarily
 small size for in those delightful climes they received
any extraordinary number visitors in 
peristyle or portico hall or garden 
and even their banquet rooms however elaborately
adorned and carefully selected in point aspect
were diminutive proportions for intellectual
ancients being fond society not crowds rarely
feasted more than nine at a time so that large 
were not so necessary with them as with
us but suite rooms seen at once from
 entrance must have had a very imposing
 when they entertained very large parties feast was
usually served in hall

effect you beheld at once hall richly paved
and painted tablinum graceful peristyle
and if house extended farther opposite
banquetroom and garden which closed 
view with some gushing fount or marble statue
 reader will now have a tolerable notion 
 pompeian houses which resembled in some respects
 grecian but mostly roman fashion
 domestic architecture in almost every house
there is some difference in detail from rest but
 principal outline is same in all in all you
find hall tablinum and peristyle communicating
with each other in all you find walls
richly painted and in all evidence a people
fond refining elegances life purity 
 taste pompeians in decoration is however
questionable they were fond gaudiest colours
 fantastic designs they often painted lower
half their columns a bright red leaving rest
uncoloured and where garden was small its
wall was frequently tinted to deceive eye as
to its extent imitating trees birds temples c
in perspective a meretricious delusion which 
 
graceful pedantry pliny himself adopted with
a complacent pride in its ingenuity
but house glaucus was at once one 
smallest and yet most adorned and finished
 all private mansions pompeii it would
be a model at this day for house a single

coelibian purchasers buhl and marquette
you enter by a long and narrow vestibule on
 floor which is image a dog in mosaic
with wellknown cave cane or beware
 dog on either side is a chamber some
size for interior house not being large enough
to contain two gieat divisions private and
public apartments these two rooms were set apart
for reception visitors who neither by rank
nor familiarity were entitled to admission in 
penetralia mansion
advancing up vestibule you enter an atrium
that when first discovered was rich in paintings
which in point expression would scarcely
disgrace a raphael you may see them now
transplanted to neapolitan museum they are
 
still admiration connoisseurs they depict
 parting achilles and arises who does
not acknowledge force vigour beauty
employed in delineating forms and faces 
achilles and immortal slave 
on one side atrium a small staircase admitted
to apartments for slaves on 
second floor there too were two or three small
bedrooms walls which pourtrayed rape
 europa battle amazons c
you now enter tablinum across which at
either hung rich draperies tyrian purple
half withdrawn on walls was depicted
a poet reading his verses to his friends and in 
pavement was inserted a small and most exquisite
mosaic typical instructions given by 
director stage to his comedians
you passed through this saloon and entered 
peristyle and here as i have said before was usually
 case w ili smaller houses pompeii
 mansion ended from each seven 
that adorned this court huns festoons 
garlands centre supplying place a
 tablinum waa also secured at pleasure by sliding doors

garden bloomed with rarest flowers placed in
vases white marble that were supported on
pedestals at left this small garden
was a diminutive fane resembling one those
small chapels placed at side roads in catholic
countries and dedicated to penates before it
stood a bronze tripod to left colonnade
were two small cubical or bedrooms to right
was triclinium in which guests were now
assembled
this room is usually termed by antiquaries
 naples chamber leda and in 
beautiful work sir william gell reader
will find an engraving from that most delicate and
graceful painting leda presenting her newborn
to her husband from which room derives
its name this beautiful apartment opened upon
 fragrant garden round table citron 
wood highly polished and delicately wrought
with silver arabesques were placed three
couches which were yet more common at pompeii
 most valued wood not modern citron tree some
amongst whom is my learned friend mr w s landor conjecture
it with much plausibility to have been mahogany

than semicircular seat that had grown lately
into fashion at rome and on these couches 
bronze studded with richer metals were laid thick
buildings covered with elaborate broidery and
yielding luxuriously to pressure
well i must own said aedile pansa
that your house though scarcely larger than a
case for one's fibula is a gem its kind how
beautifully painted is that parting achilles and
arises avhat a style wdiat heads what a hem 
praise from pansa is indeed valuable on
such subjects said clodius gravely why 
paintings on his walls ah there is indeed 
hand a zeuxis 
you flatter me my clodius indeed you do
quoth adilc who was celebrated through pompeii
for having worst paintings in avorld 
for he was patriotic and patronized none but
pompeians you flatter me but there is something
pretty yedepol yes in colours to say
nothing design and then for kitchen
my friends ah that mas all my fancy
what is design said glaucus i

have not yet seen your kitchen though i have
often witnessed excellence its cheer
a cook my athenian a cook sacrificing 
trophies his skill on altar vesta with a
beautiful muraena taken from life on a spit at
a distance there is some invention there 
at that instant slaves appeared bearing a
tray covered with first preparative initia 
 feast amidst delicious figs fresh herbs strewed
with snow anchovies and eggs were ranged
small cups diluted wine sparingly mixed with
honey as these were placed on table young
slaves bore round to each five guests for
there were no more silver basin perfumed
water and napkins edged with a purple fringe
but aedile ostentatiously drew forth his own
napkin which was not indeed so fine a linen
but in which fringe was twice as broad and
wiped his hands with parade a man who
felt he was calling for admiration
a splendid kappa that yours said
clodius why fringe is as broad as a
girdle
a trifle my clodius a trifle they tell me
 
tills stripe is latest fashion at rome hut
glaucus attends to these things more than i
be propitious o bacchus r said glaucus
inclining reverentially to a beautiful image 
god placed in centre table at corners
 which stood lares and shareholders
 guests followed prayer and then sprinkling
 wine on table they performed 
wonted libation
this over conviviality reclined themselves
on couches and business hour
commenced
may this cup be my said young
sallust as table cleared its first stimulants
was now loaded with substantial part 
entertainment and ministering slave poured
forth to him a brimming cyathus may this
cup be my but it is best wine i have
drunk at pompeii 
bring hither amihora said glaucus
and read its date and its character
 slave hastened to inform party that 
scroll fastened to cork betokened its birth from
chios and its age a ripe fifty years

how deliciously snow has cooled it 
said pansa it is just enough
it is like experience a man who has
cooled his pleasures sufficiently to give them a
double zest exclaimed sallust
it is like a woman's no added glaucus it
cools but to inflame more
when is our next wildbeast fight said
clodius to pansa
it stands fixed for ninth ide august
answered pansa on day after vulcan
 we have a most lovely young lion for 
occasion
avhom shall we get for him to eat asked
clodius alas there is a great scarcity criminals
you must positively find some innocent
or other to condemn to lion pansa 
indeed i have thought very seriously about it
 late replied senile gravely it was a
most infamous law that which forbade us to send
our ovn slaves to wild beasts not to let us
do what we like sith our own that s what t chill
an infringement on property itself
 
not so in good old repuhhe
sighed sallust
and then this pretended mercy to slaves
is such a disappointment to poor people how
they do love to see a good tough battle between a
man and a lion and all this innocent pleasure
they may lose if gods don't send us a good
criminal soon from this cursed law
 what can be worse policy said clodius
sententiously than to interfere with manly
amusements people 
well thank jupiter and fates we have
no nero at present said sallust
he was indeed a tyrant he shut up our
amphitheatre for ten years
i wonder it did not create a rebellions said
sallust
it very nearly did returned pansa with his
mouth full wild boar
here conversation was interrupted for a
moment by a fluurili flutes and two slaves
entered with a single dish
ah what delicacy hast thou in store for us
pompeii 
now my glaucus cried young sallust with
sparkling eyes
sallust was only twentyfour but he had no
pleasure in life like eating perhaps he had exhausted
all others yet had he some talent
and an excellent heart as far as it went
i know its face by pollux cried pansa 
it is an astrachan kid ho snapping his
fingers an usual signal to slaves we must
prepare anew libation in honour to newcomer
i had hoped said glaucus in a melancholy
tone to have procured you some oysters from
britain but winds that were so cruel to
caesar have forbid us oysters
are they in truth so delicious asked lepidus
loosening to a yet more luxurious ease his
girdled tunic
why in truth i suspect it is distance
that gives flavour they want richness
 brundusium oyster but at rome no supper
is complete without them
 poor britons there is some good in them
after all said sallust they produce an oyster 
 
i wish tlioy would produce us a gladiator
said aedile whose provident mind as still
musing over wants amphitheatre
by pallas cried glaucus as his favourite
slave crowned his steaming locks m'ith a new
chaplet i love these wild spectacles well enough
when least fights least but when a man one
with bones and blood like ours is coldly put on
 arena and torn limb from limb interest
is too horrid i sicken i gasp for breath i
lonof to rush and defend him yells 
populace seem to me more dire than voices 
 furies chacing orestes i rejoice that there is
so little chance that bloody exhibition for our
next show 
 adile shrugged his shoulders young
sallust who was thought bestnatured man
in pompeii stared in surprise graceful lepidus
who rarely spoke for fear disturbing his
features cried per ilercle parasite claudius
muttered iedepol and sixth banqueter
who was umbra clodius b and
whose duty it was to echo his richer friend when
pompeii 
he could not praise him parasite a parasite
 muttered also depol
well you italians are used to these spectacles
we greeks are more merciful ah shade pindar
 rapture a true grecian game 
emulation man against man generous
strife halfmournful triumph so proud to
contend with a noble foe so sad to see him overcome
 but ye understand me not
 kid is excellent said sallust
 slave whose duty it was to carve and who
valued himself on his science had just performed
that office on kid to sound music his
knife keeping time beginning with a ioav tenor
and accomplishing arduous feat amidst a magnificent
diapason
your cook is course from sicily said
pansa
yes syracuse
i will play you for him said clodius we
will have a game between courses
better that sort game certainly than a
beast fight but i cannot stake my sicilian 
vol i d
 
you have nothing so precious to stake me in re
tune
mj phillips my beautiful dancing girl 
i never buy women said greek carelessly
rearranging his chaplet
 musicians who were stationed in portico
without had commenced their office with 
kid they now directed melody into a more
soft a more gay yet it may be a more intellectual
strain and they chaunted that song horace
beginning persians odi c so impossible to
translate and which they imagined applicable to
a feast that effeminate as it seems to us was
simple enough for gorgeous revelry 
time we are witnessing domestic and not
 princely feast entertainment a gentleman
not an emperor or a senator
ah good old horace said sallust compassionately
 he sang well feasts and girls but
not like our modern poets
 immortal fulvius for instance said claudius

ah fulvius immortal said umbra
and spurana and caius xuthus who wrote
pompeii 
three epics in a year could horace do that or
virgil either said lepidus those old poets all
fell into mistake copying sculpture instead
 painting simplicity and repose that was their
notion but we moderns have fire and passion and
energy we never sleep we imitate colours 
painting its life and its action immortal fulvius

by way said sallust have you seen 
new ode by spuraena in honour our egyptian
isis it is magnificent true religious fervour
isis seems a favourite divinity at pompeii
said glaucus
yes said pansa she is exceedingly in repute
just at this moment her statue has been uttering
 most remarkable oracles i am not superstitious
but i must confess that she has more
than once assisted me materially in my magistracy
with her advice her priests are so pious too 
none your gay none your proud ministers 
jupiter and fortune they walk barefoot eat no
meat and pass greater part night in
solitary devotion 
an example to our other priesthood indeed 
d
 
tiipiters temple wants reforming sadly said
lepidus who was a great reformer for all but
himself
they say that arbaces egyptian has imparted
some most solemn mysteries to priests
 isis observed sallust he boasts his descent
from race rameses and declares that in his
family secrets remotest antiquity are treasured

 he certainly possesses gift evil eye
said clodius if i ever come upon that medusa
front without previous charm i am sure to lose
a favourite horse or throw canes nine times
running
 would be indeed a miracle said
sallust gravely
how mean ou sallust returned gamester
with a flushed brow
i mean what you would leave me if i played
often with you and that is nothing
clodius answered only by a smile disdain
if arbaces were not so rich said pansa with
a stately air i should stretch my authority a
canes oi caniculie lowest throw at dice
pompeii 
little and enquire into truth report
which calls him an astrologer and a sorcerer
agrippa when aedile rome banished all such
terrible citizens but a rich man it is duty
 an aedile to protect rich 
what think you this new sect which i am
told has even a few proselytes in pompeii these
followers hebrew god christ's
oh mere speculative visionaries said claudius
 they have not a single gentleman amongst
them their proselytes are poor insignificant ignorant
people 
who ought however to be crucified for their
blasphemy said pansa with vehemence they
deny venus and jove nazarene is but another
name for atheist let me catch them that's all 
 second course was gone feasters fell
back on their couches there was a pause while
they listened to soft voices south and
 music arcadian reed glaucus was 
most rapt and least inclined to break 
silence but clodius began already to think that
they wasted time
bene vobis your health my glaucus said
 
he quaffing a cup to each letter greek's
name with ease practised drinker
will you not be avenged on your illfortune 
yesterday see dice court us
as you will said glaucus
 dice in august and i an aedile c said
pansa magisterially it is against all law
not in your presence grave pansa returned
clodius rattling dice in a long box your
presence restrains all licence it is not thing
but excess thing that hurts
what wisdom murmured umbra
well i will look another way said 
aedile
not yet good pansa let us wait till we have
supped said glaucus
clodius reluctantly yielded concealing his vexation
with a yawn
he gapes to devour gold whispered
lepidus to sallust in a quotation from aulu
maria plautus
ah how well i know these polypi m ho hold
all they touch answered sallust in same
tone and out same play
pipeii 
 second course consisting a variety 
fruits pistachio nuts sweetmeats tarts and confectionary
tortured into a thousand fantastic and
airy shapes was now placed upon table and
 ministry or attendants also set there wine
which had hitherto been handed round to 
guests in large jugs glass each bearing upon
it schedule its age and quality
taste this lesbian my pansa said sallust 
it is excellent
it is not very old said glaucus but it has
been made precocious like ourselves by being put
to fire wine to flames vulcan 
we to those his wife to whose honour i pour
this cup
it is delicate said pansa but there is perhaps
 least particle too much rosin in its
flavour
what a beautiful cup cried clodius taking
up one transparent crystal handles
 which were wrought with gems and twisted
in stage serpents favourite fashion at
pompeii
this ring said glaucus taking a costly jewel
 
from first joint his finger and hanging it on
 handle gives it a richer show and renders
it less unworthy thy acceptance my clodius
hom may gods give health and fortune long
and oft to crown it to brim 
you are too generous glaucus said 
gamester handing cup to his slave but your
love gives it a double value
this cup to graces said pansa and he
thrice emptied his calix guests followed his
example
we have appointed no director to feast
cried sallust
let us throw for him then said clodius
rattling dicebox
nay cried glaucus no cold and trite
director for us no dictator banquet no rex
convivial have not romans sworn never to
obey a king shall we be less free than your ancestors
 ho musicians let us have song i
composed other night it has a verse on this
subject liacchic hymn hours
 musicians struck their instruments to a
w im tonic air while youngest voices in 
pompeii 
band chaunted forth in greek words as numbers
 following strain 
through summer day through weary day
we have glided long 
ere we speed to night through her portals grey
hail us with song 
with song with song
with a bright and joyous song 
such as cretan maid
while twilight made her bolder
woke high through ivy shade
when winegod first consoled her
from hush'd lowbreathing skies
halfshut looked their starry eyes
and all around
with a loving sound
 aegean waves were creeping 
son her lap lay lynx's head
wild thyme was her bridal bed 
and aye through each tiny space
in green vine's green embrace

 fauns were slyly peeping 
 fauns prying fauns
 arch laughing fauns 
 fauns were slyly peeping 

flagging and faint are we
with our ceaseless flight
and dull shall our journey be
through realm night
bathe us o bathe our weary wings
in purple wave as it freshly springs
to your cups from fount light 
from fount light from fount light
for there when sun has gone down in night
there in bowl we find him
 grape is well that summer sun
or rather stream that he gazed upon
till he left in truth like thespian youth
his soul as he gazed behind him

a cup to jove and a cup to love
and a cup to son maia
and honour with three band zonefree
 band bright aglaia narcissus

but since every bud in wreath pleasure
ye owe to sister hours
no stinted cups in a formal measure
 roman law makes ours
he honours us most who gives us most
and boasts with a bacchanal's honest boast
he never will count treasure
lastly we fleet then seize our wings
and plunge us deep in sparkling rings 
and aye as we rise with a dripping plume
we scatter spray round garland's bloom
we glow we glow
behold as girls eastern wave
bore once with a shout to their crystal cave
 prize mysian hylas
even so even so
we have caught young god in our warm embrace
we hurry him on in our laughing race 
we hurry him on with a whoop and song
 cloudy rivers night along 
ho ho we have caught thee silas 

 guests applauded loudly when poet
is your host his verses are sure to charm
thoroughly greek said lepidus 
wildness force and energy that tongue it is
impossible to imitate in roman poetry
it is indeed a great contrast said clodius
ironically at heart though not in appearance to
 old fashioned and tame simplicity that ode 
horace which we heard before air is beautifully
ionic word puts me in mind a toast
companions i give you beautiful lone
lone name is greek said glaucus ina
soft voice i drink health with delight
but who is lone 
 ah you have but just come to pompeii or
you would deserve ostracism for your ignorance
said lepidus conceitedly not to know lone is
not to know chief charm our city
sue is most rare beauty said pansa 
and what a voice 
she can feed only on nightingales tongues
said clodius
nightingales tongues beautiful thought
sighed umbra
enlighten me i beseech you said clodius

know then began lepidus
let me speak cried clodiiis you drawl
out your words as if you spoke tortoises
and you speak stones muttered coxcomb
to himself as he fell back disdainfully on his
couch know then my glaucus said clodius that
lone is a stranger who has but lately come to
pompeii she sings like sappho and her songs
are her own composing and as for tibia
and cithara and lyre i know not in which
she most outdoes muses her beauty is most
dazzling her house is perfect such taste such
gems such bronzes she is rich and generous
as she is rich
her lovers course said glaucus take
care that she does not starve and money lightly
won is always lavishly spent
her lovers ah there is enigma lone
has but one vice she is chaste she has all
pompeii at her feet and she has no lovers she
will not even marry
no lovers echoed glaucus
no she has soul vesta with girdle
 venus
 
what refined expressions said umbra
a miracle cried glaucus can v not
see her 
i will take you there this evening said claudius
 meanwhile added he once more rattling
 dice
i am your's said complaisant glaucus
pansa turn your face 
lepidus and sallust played at odd and even
and ximbra looked on while glaucus and claudius
became gradually absorbed in chances 
 dice
per jove cried glaucus this is second
time i have thrown caniculae lowest
throw
now venus befriend me said clodius rattling
 box for several moments o alma venus
 it is venus herself i as he threw highest
cast named from that goddess whom he who
wins money indeed usually propitiates 
venus is ungrateful to me said glaucus
gaily i have always sacrificed on her altar
lie who plays avitli clodius whispered lepidus
 will soon like plautus's curculio put his
pallium for stakes

poor glaucus lie is as blind as fortune
herself replied sallust iu same tone
i will play no more said glaucus i have
lost thirty sententia
i am sorry began clodius
amiable man groaned umbra
not at all exclaimed glaucus pleasure
 your gain compensates pain my loss
 conversation now became general and animated
 wine circulated more freely and lone
once more became subject eulogy to 
guests glaucus
instead twitching stars let us visit
one at whose beauty stars grow pale said
lepidus
clodius who saw no chance renewing 
dice seconded proposal and glaucus though
he civilly pressed his guests to continue banquet
could not but let them see that his curiosity
had been excited by praises lone they
therefore resolved to adjourn all at least but
pansa and umbra to house fair
greek they drank therefore to health 
glaucus and titus they performed their 
libation they resumed their slippers they 
 
scended stairs passed illumined atrium 
and walking unbeaten over fierce dog painted
on threshold found themselves beneath 
light moon just risen in lively and still
crowded streets pompeii
they passed jewellers quarter sparkling
with lights caught and reflected by gems
displayed in shops and arrived at at 
door lone vestibule blazed with rows 
lamps curtains embroidered purple hung on
either aperture tablinum whose walls and
mosaic pavement glowed with richest colours
 artist and under portico which surrounded
 odorous viridarium they found lone
already surrounded by adoring and applauding
guests
did you say she was athenian whispered
glaucus ere he passed into peristyle
no she is from neapolis
weapons echoed glacis and at that moment
 group dividing on either side lone
gave to his view that bright that nymphlike
beauty ahich for months had shone down upon
 waters his memory

chapter iv

 story returns to egyptian we left
arbaces upon shores noonday sea after
he had parted from glaucus and his companion
as he approached to more crowded part 
 bay he paused and gazed upon that animated
scene with foiled arms and a bitter smile upon
his dark features
gulls dupes fools that ye are muttered he to
himself whether business or pleasure trade or
religion be your pursuit you are equally cheated
by passions that ye should rule how i could
loathe you if i did not hate yes hate greek or
roman it is from us from dark lore egypt
that ye have stolen fire that gives you souls 
your knowledge your poesy your laws your
 
arts your barbarous mastery war all how
tame and mutilated when compared with vast
original ye have filched as a slave filches 
fragments feast from us and now ye
mimics a mimic romans forsooth mushroom
herd robbers ye are our masters 
pyramids look down no more on race rameses
 eagle cowers over serpent 
nile our masters no not mint my soul by
 power its wisdom controls and chains you
though fetters are unseen so long as craft
can master force so long as religion has a cave
from which oracles can dupe mankind wise
hold an empire over earth even from your vices
arbaces distills his pleasures pleasures profaned
by vulgar eyes pleasures vast wealthy inexhaustible
 which your enervate minds in their
unimaginative sensuality cannot conceive or dream 
plod on plod on fools ambition and avarice 
your petty thirst for fasces and quaestor ships and
all mummery servile power provokes my
laughter and my scorn my power can extend
wherever man believes i ride over souls that
 purple veils thebes may fall egypt be a

name world itself furnishes subjects 
arbaces
thus saying egyptian moved slowly on 
and entering town his tall figure towered
above crowded throng forum and swept
towards small but graceful temple consecrated
to isis that edifice was then but recent erection 
ancient temple had been thrown down in earthquake
sixteen years before and new building
had become as much in vogue with versatile
pompeians as a new chich or a new preacher maybe
with us oracles goddess at pompeii
were indeed remarkable not more for mysterious
language in which they were clothed than for 
credit which was attached to their mandates and
predictions if they were not dictated by a divinity
they were framed at least by a profound
knowledge mankind they applied themselves
exactly to circumstances individuals and
made a notable contrast to vague and loose
generalities their rival temples as arbaces now
arrived at rails which separated profane
from sacred place a crowd composed all

classes but especially commercial collected
breathless and reverential before many altars
which rose in open court in walls 
cella elevated on seven steps parian marble
various statues stood in niches and those walls
were ornamented with pomegranate consecrated
to isis an oblong pedestal occupied 
interior building on which stood two statues one
 isis and its companion represented silent
and mystic ores but building contained many
other deities to grace court egyptian
deity her kindred and manytitled bacchus and
 cyprian venus a grecian disguise for herself
rising from her bath and dogheaded anubis
and ox apis and various egyptian idols uncouth
form and unknown appellations
but we must not suppose that among cities
 magna graeca isis was worshipped with those
forms and ceremonies which were right her own
 mongrel and modern nations south with
a mingled arrogance and ignorance confounded 
worships all climes and ages and theprofound
mysteries nile were degraded by a hundred
 
meretricious and frivolous admixtures from 
creeds ceiaisus and tibur temple 
isis in pompeii was served by roman and greek
priests ignorant alike language and customs
 her ancient votaries and descendant 
 dread egyptian kings beneath appearance
 reverential awe now secretly laughed to scorn
 puny mummers which imitated solemn
and typical worship his burning clime
ranged now on either side steps was 
sacrificial croavd arrayed in white garments while
at summit stood two inferior priests 
one holding a palm branch other a slender
sheaf corn in narrow passage in front
thronged bystanders
and what whispered arbaces to one 
bystanders who alas a merchant engaged in 
alexandrian trade which trade had probably first
introduced in pompeii worship egyptian
goddess avhat occasion now assembles
you before altars venerable isis it
seems by white robes group before me
that a sacrifice is to be rendered and by 
 
semble priests tlmt ye are prepared for
some oracle to what question is it to vouchsafe
a reply
we are merchant's replied bystander
who was no other than diomed in same
voice who seek to know fate onr vessels
aa'hich sail for alexandria tomorrow we are
about to offer up a sacrifice and implore an answer
fiom goddess i am not one those who
have petitioned priest to sacrifice as you may
see by my dress but i have some interest in 
success fleet per jove yes i have a
pretty trade else how could i live in these hard
times r
 egyptian replied gravely that though
isis was properly goddess agriculture she
was no less patron commerce these
turning his head towards east arbaces seemed
absorbed in silent prayer
and now in centre steps appeared a
priest robed in white from head to foot veil
parting over cromu two new priests relieved
those hitherto stationed at either corner being
naked half way down breast and covered for
pompeii i
 rest in white and loose robes at same
time seated at bottom steps a priest
commenced a solemn air upon a long windinstrument
 music half way down steps stood
another flamen holding in one hand votive
wreath in other a white wand while adding
to picturesque scene that eastern ceremony
 stately ibis bird sacred to egyptian worship
looked mutely down from wall upon 
rit or stalked beside altar at base 
steps
at that altar now stood sacrificial flamen
 countenance arbaces seemed to lose
all its rigid calm while aruspices inspected
 entrails and to be intent in pious anxiety to
rejoice and brighten as signs were declared
favourable and fire began bright and clearly to
consume sacred portion victim amidst
odours myrrh and frankincense it was then
that a dead silence fell over whispering crowd
and priests gathering round cella another
priest naked save by a cincture round middle
 see a singular picture in museum naples an egyptian
sacrifice
 
rushed forward and dancing with wild gestures
implored an answer from goddess he ceased
at in exhaustion and a low murmuring noise
was heard within body statue thrice
 head moved and lips parted and then a
hollow voice uttered these mystic words 
there are waves like chargers that meet and glow
there are graves ready wrought in rocks below 
on brow future dangers lower
but blest are your barks in fearful hour
 voice ceased crowd breathed more
freely merchants looked at each other 
nothing can be more plain murmured diomed
there is to be a storm at sea as there very often
is at beginning autumn but our vessels are
to be saved o beneficent isis v
landed eternally be goddess said 
merchants avhat can be less equivocal than her
prediction 
raising one hand in sign silence to people
for rites isis enjoined what to lively
pompeii 
pomjeians was an impossible suspense from use
 vocal organs chief priest poured his
libation on altar and after a short concluding
prayer ceremony was over and congregation
dismissed still however as crowd dispersed
themselves here and there egyptian
lingered by railing and when space became
tolerably cleared one priests approaching it
saluted him with great appearance friendly familiarity

 countenance priest was remarkably
unprepossessing his shaven skull was so low and
narrow in front as nearly to approach to conformation
 that an african savage save only towards
 tempts where in that organ styled acquisitiveness
by pupils a science modern in name
but best practically known as their sculpture teaches
us amongst antients two huge and almost pre 
unnatural protuberances yet more distorted 
unshapely head around brows skin was
puckered into a web deep and intricate wrinkles
 eyes dark and small rolled in a muddy and
yellow orbit nose short yet coarse was distended
at nostrils like a satis and thick
vol i e
t 
but pallid lips high cheekbones livid and
motley hues that struggled through parchment
skin completed a countenance which none could
behold without repugnance and few without terror
and distrust whatever wishes mind 
animal frame was well fitted to execute them 
wiry muscles throat broad chest 
nervous hands and lean gaunt arms which were
bared above elbow betokened a form capable
alike great active exertion and passive endurance

calenus said egyptian to this fascinating
flamen you have improved voice statue
much by attending to my suggestion and
your verses are excellent always prophesy good
fortune unless there is an absolute impossibility 
its fulfilment
besides added calenus if storm does
come and if it does overwhelm accursed ships
have we not prophesied it and are barks not
blest to be at rest for rest prays mariner in
 gaan sea or at least so says horace can
 mariner be more at rest in sea than when
he is at bottom it 
pompeii 
right my calenus i wish apaecides would
take a lesson from yom wisdom but i desire to
confer with you relative to him and to other matters
you can admit me into one your less sacred
apartments 
assuredly replied priest leading way
to one small chambers which surrounded 
open gate here they seated themselves before a
small table spread with dishes containing fruit and
eggs and various cold meats with vases excellent
wine which while companions partook
a curtain drawn across entrance opening to 
court concealed them from view but admonished
them by thinness partition to speak low
or to speak no secrets they chose former alternative

thou knowest said arbaces in a voice
that scarcely stirred air so soft and inward
was its sound that it has ever been my maxim
to attach myself to young from their flexile
and unformed minds i can carve out my fittest
tools i weave i warp i mould them at my
will men i make merely followers or servants
 women 
e 
 
mistresses said calenus as a livid grin distorted
his ungainly features
yes i do not disguise it woman is 
main object great appetite my soul
as you feed victim for slaughter love
to rear votaries my pleasure i love to
train to ripen their minds to unfold sweet
blossom their hidden passions in order to prepare
 fruit to my tastes i loathe your readymade
and ripened courtesans it is in soft
and unconscious progress innocence to desire
that find true charm love it is thus that
 defy satiety and by contemplating freshness
 others i sustain freshness my own sensations
from young hearts my victims i
draw ingredients cauldron in miucii i
reyouth myself but enough this to subject
before us you lino then that in neapolis
some time since i encountered lone and apacides
brother and sister children athenians who
had settled at neaolis death their
parents o knew and esteemed me constituted
me their guardian i was not unmindful 
trust youth docile and mild yielded readily
pompeii 
to impression i sought to stamp upon him next
to woman i love old recollections my ancestral
land i love to keep alive to propagate on
distant shores which her colonies perchance yet
people her dark and mystic creeds it may be
that it pleases me to delude mankind while i thus
serve deities to apaecides i taught 
solemn faith isis i unfolded to him something
those sublime allegories which are couched
beneath her worship i excited in a soul peculiarly
alive to religious fervour that enthusiasm
which imagination begets on faith i have placed
him amongst you he is one you
he is so said calenus but in thus stimulating
his faith you have robbed him wisdom
he is horror struck that he is no longer
duped our sage delusions our speaking statues
and secret staircases dismay and revolt him he
pines he wastes away he mutters to himself 
he refuses to share our ceremonies he has been
known to frequent company men suspected
 adherence to that new and atheistical creed
which denies all our gods and terms our oracles
 inspirations that malevolent spirit which
 
eastern tradition speaks our oracles alas we
know well whose inspirations ihet are 
this is what i feared said arbaces musingly
 from various reproaches he made me
when i saw him late he hath shunned
my steps i must find him i must continue my
lessons i must lead him into actus wisdom
i must teach him that there are two stages
 sanctity first faith next delusion
 one for vulgar second for 
sage
i never passed through first said calenus
 nor you either i think my arbaces
you err replied egyptian gravely i believe
at this day not indeed that which i teach
but that which i teach not nature has a sanctity
against which i cannot nor would i steel conviction
i believe in mine own knowledge and
that has revealed to me but no matter now to
earthlier and more inviting themes if i thus fulfilled
my object with apaecides what was my
design for lone thou knowest already i intend
her for my queen my bride my heart's isis
pompeii 
never till i saw her knew i all love which
my nature was capable
i hear from a thousand lips that she is a
second helen said calenus and he smacked his
own lips but whether at wine or at notion
it is not easy to decide
yes she has a beauty that greece itself never
excelled resumed arbaces but that is not
all she has a soul worthy to match with mine
she has a genius beyond that woman keen 
dazzling bold poetry flows spontaneous to her
lips utter but a truth and however intricate
and profound her mind seizes and commands it
her imagination and her reason are not at war
with each other they harmonize and direct her
course as winds and waves direct some
lofty bark with this she unites a daring independence
 thought she can stand alone in 
world she can be brave as she is gentle this is
 nature i have sought all my life in woman
and never found till now lone must be mine 
in her i have a double passion i wish to enjoy a
beauty spirit as form
 
she ie not yoms yet then said priest
no she loves me but as a friend she
loves me with her mind only she fancies in me
 paltry virtues which i have only profounder
virtue to disdain but you must jnirsue
with me her history brother and sister were
young and rich lone is proud and ambitious 
proud her genius magic her poetry 
 charm her conversation when her brother
left me and entered your temple in order to be
near him she removed also to pompeii she has
suffered her talents to be known she summons
crowds to her feasts her voice enchants them 
her poetry subdues she delights in being thought
 successor erinna
or sappho 
but sappho without love i encouraged her
in this boldness career in this indulgence 
vanity and pleasure i loved to steep her amidst
 dissipations and luxury this abandoned city
mark me calends i desired to enervate her mind 
it has been too pure to receive yet breath
which i wish not to pass but burningly to eat
into crystal mirror i wished her to be
pompeii 
surrounded by lovers hollow vain and frivolous
lovers that her nature must despise in order
to feel want love then in those soft
intervals lassitude that succeed to excitement
i can weave my spells excite her interest
attract her passions possess myself her
heart for it is not young nor beautiful
nor gay that alone can fascinate lone 
her imagination must be won and life 
arbaces has been one scene triumph over 
imaginations his kind
and hast thou no fear then thy rivals 
 gallants italy are skilled in art to
please
none her greek soul despises barbarian
romans and would scorn itself if it admitted
a thought love for one that upstart race
but thou art an egyptian not a greek 
egypt replied arbaces is mother 
athens her tutelary minerva is our deity 
and her founder cecrops was fugitive 
egyptian sais this have i already taught to
her and in my blood she venerates eldest
dynasties earth but yet i will own that 
e 
 
late some uneasy suspicions have crossed my mind
she is more silent than she used to be she loves
melancholy and subduing music she sighs without
an outward cause this may be beginning 
love it may be want love in either case
it is time for me to begin my operations on her
fancies and her heart in one case to divert
 source love to me in other in me to
awaken it it is for this that i have sought you
and how can i assist you 
i am about to invite her to a feast in my
house i wish to dazzle to bewilder to inflame
her senses our arts arts by which egypt
trained her young noviciates must be employed 
and under veil mysteries religion i will
open to her secrets love
ah now i understand one these voluptuous
banquets that despite our dull vows mortified
coldness we thy priests isis have shared
at thy house
no no thickest thou her chaste eyes are
ripe for such scenes no but first we must
ensnare brother an easier task listen tome
while i give you my instructions
pompeii 
chapter v
more flower girl progress love
 sun shone gaily into that beautiful chamber
in house glaucus which i have
before said is now called room leda
 morning rays entered through rows small
casements at higher part room and
through door which opened on garden
that answered to inhabitants southern
cities same purpose that a greenhouse or
conservatory does to us size garden
did not adapt it for exercise but various
and fragrant plants with which it was filled gave
a luxmy to that indolence so dear to dwellers
in a sunny clime and now odours fanned
by a gentle wind creeping from adjacent sea
scattered themselves over that chamber whose walls
vied with richest colours most glowing
 
flowers besides gem room painting
 leda and tyndareus in centre each
compartment walls were set other pictures
 exquisite beauty in one you saw cupid leaning
on knees venus in another ariadne
sleeping on beach unconscious perfidy
 theseus merrily sunbeams played to and
fro on tesselated floor and brilliant walls 
far more happily came rays joy to heart
 young glaucus
i have seen her then said he as he paced
that narrow chamber i have heard her nay
i have spoken to her again i have listened to
 music her song and she sung glory and
 greece i have discovered longsought idol
 my dreams and like cyprian sculptor i
have breathed life into my own imaginings
longer perhaps had been enamoured soliloquy
 glaucus but at that moment a shadow
darkened threshold chamber and a
young female still half a child in years broke
upon his solitude she was dressed simply in a
white tunic which reached from neck to 
ancles under her arm she bore a basket 
pompeii 
flowers and in other haud she held a bronze
watervase her features were more formed than
exactly became her years yet they were soft and
feminine in their outline and without being beautiful
in themselves they were almost made so by
their beauty expression there was something
ineffably gentle and you would say patient in her
aspect a look resigned sorrow tranquil endurance
had banished smile but not sweetness
from her lips something timid and cautious
in her step something wandering in her eyes
led you to suspect affliction which she had
suffered from her birth she alas blind but in
 orbs themselves there was no visible defect
their melancholy and subdued light was clear
cloudless and serene they tell me that glaucus
is here said she may i come in 
ah my nydia said greek is that you
i knew you would not neglect my invitation
glaucus did but justice to himself answered
nydia with a blush for he has always been kind
to poor blind girl
who could be otherwise said glaucus tenderly
and in voice a compassionate brother
 
nydia sighed and paused before she resumed
without replying to his remark you have
but lately remned 
this is sixth sun that hath shone upon meat
pompeii
 and you are well ah i need not ask 
for who that sees earth which they tell me is
so beautiful can be ill 
i am well and you nydia how you have
grown next year you will be thinking what
answer we shall make your lovers
a second blush passed over cheek nydia
but this time she frowned as she blushed i
have brought you some flowers said she without
replying to a remark that she seemed to resent
and feolinof about room till she fomid 
table that stood by glaucus she laid basket
non it they are poor but they are fresh
gathered
they might come from flora herself said he
kindly and i renew again my vow to graces
that i will wear no other garlands while thy hands
can weave me such as these
pompeii 
and how find j'ou flowers in your viridarius
 are they thriving 
wonderfully so lares themselves must
have tended them
ah now you give me pleasure for i came
as often as i could steal leisure to water and
tend them in your absence
how shall i thank thee fair nydia said
 greek glaucus little dreamed that he left
one memory so watchful over his favourites at
pompeii
 hand child trembled and her breast
heaved beneath her tunic she turned romid in embarrassment
 sun is hot for poor flowers
said she today and they will miss me for i
have been ill lately and it is nine since i
visited them
 nydia yet your cheek has more colour
than it had year
i am often ailing said blind girl touchingly
and as i grow up i grieve more that i am
blind but now to flowers so saying she
made a slight reverence with her head and passes
 oping
into viviparous busied herself with watering
 flowers
poor nydia thought glaucus gazing on her 
thine is a hard doom thou seest not earth
nor sun nor ocean nor stars 
above all thou canst not behold lone
at that thought his mind flew back to 
past evening and was a second time disturbed in
its reveries by entrance clodius it was
a remarkable thing and a proof how much a
single evening had sufficed to increase and to
refine love athenian for lone that
whereas he had confided to clodius secret
 his first interview with her and effect it
had produced on him he now felt an invincible
aversion even to mention to him her name he
had seen lone bright pure unsullied in midst
 gayest and most profligate gallants 
pompeii charming rather than anng boldest
into respect and changing very nature 
most sensual and least ideal as by her
intellectual and refining spells she reversed 
fable circe and converted animals into men
they who could not understand her soul were
pompeii 
etlierealised as it were by magic her beauty
they who had no heart for poetry had ears at
least for melody her voice seeing her
thus surrounded purifying and brightening all
things with her presence glaucus almost for 
first time felt that which his own native was
capable he felt how unworthy goddess his
dreams had been his companions and his pursuits
a veil seemed lifted from his eyes he saw that
immeasurable distance between himself and his
associates which deceiving mists pleasure
had hitherto concealed he was refined by a
sense his courage in aspiring to lone he felt
that henceforth it was his destiny to look upward
and to soar he could no longer breathe that
name which sounded to sense his ardent
fancy as something sacred and divine to lewd and
vulgar ears she was no longer beautiful girl
once seen and passionately remembered she was
already mistress divinity his soul
this feeling who has not experienced if thou
hast not then thou hast never loved 
when clodius therefore spoke to him in affected
transports beauty lone glaucus felt
 
only resentment and disgust that such hips
shoukl dare to praise her he answered coldly
and roman imagined that his passion was
cured instead heightened clodius scarcely
regretted it for he was anxious that glaucus
should marry an heiress yet more richly endowed 
julia daughter wealthy diomed whose
gold gamester imagined he could readily divert
into his own coffers their conversation did
not flow with its usual ease and no sooner had
clodius left him than glaucus bent his way to
 house lone in passing by threshold
he again encountered nydia who had finished her
graceful task she knew his step on instant
you are early abroad said she
yes for skies campania rebuke 
sluggard who neglects them
ah would i could see them murmured 
blind girl but so low that glaucus did not overhear
 complaint
 thessalian lingered on threshold a few
moments and then guiding her steps by a long
staff which she used with great dexterity she
pompeii
took her way homeward she soon tmned from
 more gaudy streets and entered a quarter 
 town but little loved by decorous and 
sober but from low and rude evidences 
vice around her she was saved by her misfortune
and at that hour streets were quiet and silent
nor was her youthful ear shocked by sounds
which too often broke along obscene and obscure
haunts she patiently and sadly traversed
she knocked at backdoor a sort 
tavern it opened and a rude voice bade her
give an account sesterces ere she could
reply another voice less vulgarly accented said
never mind those petty profits my turbo
 girls voice will be wanted again soon at our
rich friend's revels and he pays as thou knowest
pretty high for his nightingale's tongues
oh i hope not i trust not cried nydia
trembling i will beg from sunrise to sunset
but send me not there
and why asked same voice
because because i am young and delicately
born and female companions i
 
meet there are not fit associates for one who 
who
is a shive in house burbo returned
 voice ironically and with a coarse laugh
 thessalian put down flowers and leaning
her face on her hands wept silently
meanwhile glaucus sought house 
beautiful neapolitan he found tone sitting
amidst her attendants who were at work around
her her harp stood at her side for lone herself
was unusually idle perhaps unusually thoughtful
that day he thought her even more beautiful by
 morning light and in her simple robe than
amidst blazing lamps and decorated with 
costly jewels previous night not less
so from a certain paleness that overspread her
transparent hues not less so from blush
that mounted over them when he approached
accustomed to flatter flattery died upon his lips
when he addressed lone he felt it beneath her
to utter homage which every look conveyed
they spoke greece this was a theme on which
lone loved rather to listen than to converse it
pompeii 
was a theme on wliieli greek could have been
eloquent for ever he described to her silver
groves that yet clad banks ulysses and 
temples already despoiled half their glories 
but how beautiful in decay he looked back on
 melancholy city harmonious free and
pericles magnificent from height that
distant memory in which all ruder and darker
shades were mellowed into light he had seen
 land poetry chiefly in poetical age 
early youth and associations patriotism
were blended with those flush and spring
life and lone listened to him absorbed and
mute dearer were those accents and those descriptions
than all prodigal adulation her numberless
adorers was it a sin to love her countrymen
 she loved athens in him gods her
race land her dreams spoke to her in his
voice from that time they daily saw each other
at cool evening they made excursions
on placid sea by night they met again in
lone's porticos and halls their love was sudden
but it was strong it filled all sources their
life heart brain sense imagination all ere
 
its ministers and priests as you take some
obstacle from two objects that have a mutual
attraction they met and united at once their
wonder was that they had lived separate so
long and it was natural that they should so
love young beautiful and gifted same
birth and same souls there was poetry in
their very union they imagined heavens
smiled upon their affection as persecuted
seek refuge at shrine so they recognized in
 altar their love an asylum from sorrows
 earth they covered it with flowers they
knew not serpents that lay coiled behind
one evening fifth after their first meeting
at pompeii glaucus and lone with a
small party chosen friends were returning
from an excursion round bay their vessel
skimmed lightly over twilight waters whose
lucid mirror was only broken by dripping
oars as rest party conversed gaily
with each other glaucus lay at feet lone
and he would have looked up in her face but
he did not dare lone broke pause between
them
pompeii 
my poor brother said she sighing how
once he would have enjoyed this hour
your brother said glaucus i have not
seen him occupied with you i have thought 
nothing else or i shoukl have asked if that was
not your brother for whose companionship you
left me at temple jniinerva in neapolis
it was
and is he here 
his 
at pompeii and not constantly with you 
impossible 
he has other duties answered lone sadly 
he is a priest isis
so young too and that priesthood in
its laws at least so severe said warm
and brighthearted greek in surprise and
pity what could have been his inducement

he was always enthusiastic and fervent in religious
devotion and eloquence an egyptian
 our friend and guardian kindled in him
 pious desire to consecrate his life to most
mystic our deities perhaps in intenseness
 
 his zeal he found in severity that peculiar
priesthood its peculiar attraction
and he does not repent his choice i trust
he is happy 
tone sighed deeply and lowered her veil over
her eyes
i wish said she after a pause that he had
not been so hasty perhaps like all who expect
too much he is revolted too easily 
then he is not happy in his new condition 
and this egyptian was he a priest himself was
he interested in recruits to sacred hand 
no his main interest was in our happiness
he thought he promoted that my brother we
were left orphans
like myself said glaucus with a deep
meaning in his voice
lone cast down her eyes as she resumed 
and arbaces sought to supply place 
our parent you must know him he loves
genus
arbaces i know him already at least we
speak avhen we meet hut for your iraisc i
would not seek to know more him my heart
pompeii 
inclines readily to most my kind but that
dark egyptian with his gloomy brow and icy
smile seems to me to sadden very sun one
would think that like eumenides cretan he
had spent forty years in a cave and had found
something unnatural in daylight ever afterwards

yet like eumenides he is kind and wise
and gentle answered lone
oh happy that he has thy praise he needs
no other virtues to make him dear to me
his calm his coldness said lone evasively
pursuing subject are perhaps but exhaustion
 past sufferings as yonder mountain
and she pointed to vesuvius which we see dark
and tranquil in distance once nursed fires
for ever quenched
they both gazed on mountain as lone said
these words rest sky was bathed in rosy
and tender hues but over that grey summit rising
amidst woods and vineyards that then clomb
half way up ascent there hung a black and
ominous cloud single frown landscape
a sudden and unaccountable gloom came over each
vol i f
 
as they thus gazed and in that sympathy which
love had already taught them and which bade
them in slightest shadows emotion faintest
presentiment evil turn for refuge to each
other their gaze at same moment left 
mountain and full unimaginable tenderness
met what need had they words to say they
loved

 fowler snares again bird that had just
escaped and sets his nets for a new victim
in history i relate events are crowded
and rapid as those drama i write an
epoch in vhich sufficed to ripen ordinary
fruits years
meanwhile graces had not late much frequented
 house lone and when he had visited
her he had not encountered glaucus nor
knew he as yet that love which had so suddenly
sprung up between himself and his designs
in his interest for brother lone he had been
forced too a little while to suspend his interest in
lone herself his pride and his selfishness were
aroused and alarmed at sudden change which
had come over spirit youth he trembled
lest himself should lose a docile pupil and
f 
 
isis an enthusiastic servant apacides had ceased
to seek or to consult him he was rarely to be
found he turned sullenly from egyptian nay
he fled when he perceived him in distance
arbaces was one those haughty and powerful
spirits accustomed to master others he chafed at
 notion that one once his own should ever
elude his grasp he swore inly that apaecides
should not escape him
it was with this resolution that he passed
through a thick grove in city a'hich lay between
his house and that lone in his way to
 latter and there leaning against a tree and
gazing on ground he came unawares on 
young priest isis
apaecides said he and he laid his hand
affectionately on young man's shoulder
 priest started and his first instinct seemed
to be that flight my son said egyptian
what has chanced that you desire to shun me 
ascites remained silent and sullen looking
down on earth as his lips quivered and his
breast heaved with emotion
speak to me my friend continued egypt

tian speak something burdens thv spirit
what hast thou to reveal 
to thee nothing
and why is it to me thou art thus confidential

because thou hast been my enemy
let us confer said arbaces in a low voice 
and drawing reluctant arm priest in his
own he led him to one seats which were
scattered within grove they sate down and
in those gloomy forms there was something congenial
to shade and solitude place
apaecides was in spring his years yet he
seemed to have exhausted even more life than
 egyptian his delicate and regular features
were worn and colourless his eyes were hollow
and shone with a brilliant and feverish glare his
frame bowed prematurely and in his hands which
were small to effeminacy blue and swollen
veins indicated lassitude and weakness 
relaxed fibres you saw in his face a strong resemblance
to lone but expression was altogether
different from that majestic and spiritual
calm which breathed so divine and classical a re
 
pose over his sister's beauty in her enthusiasm
was visible but it seemed always suppressed and
restrained this made charm and sentiment 
her countenance you longed to awaken a spirit
which reposed but evidently did not sleep in
apaecides whole aspect betokened fervour
and passion his temperament and intellectual
portion his nature seemed by wild fire
 eyes great breadth temples when
compared with height brow trembling
restlessness lips to be swayed and tyrannized
over by imaginative and ideal fancy
with sister had stopped short at golden goal
 poetry with brother less happy and less restrained
it had wandered into visions more intangible
and unbodied and faculties which gave
genius to one threatened madness to other
you say i have been your enemy said arfaces
 i know cause that unjust accusation
 i have placed you amidst priests isis
you are revolted at their trickeries and imposture
 you think that i too have deceived you 
 purity your mind is offended you imagine
that i am one deceitful 
pipeii 
you knew jiiggliugs that impious
craft answered ascites why did you disguise
them from me when you excited my
desire to devote myself to office whose garb
i bear you spoke to me holy life 
men resigning themselves to knowledge you
have given me for companions an ignorant and
sensual herd who have no knowledge but that 
 grossest frauds you spoke to me men
sacrificing earthlier pleasures to sublime
cultivation virtue you place me amongst men
reeking with all filthiness vice you spoke
to me friends enlighteners om common
kind i see but their cheats and deluders 
oh it was basely done you have robbed me 
 glory youth convictions virtue 
 sanctifying thirst after wisdom young as i
was rich fervent sunny pleasees earth before
me i resigned all without a sigh nay with
happiness and exultation in thought that i resigned
them for abstruse mysteries diviner
wisdom for companionship gods for 
revelations heaven and now now 
convulsive sobs checked priest's voice he
 
covered his face with his hands and hirge tears
forced themselves through wasted fingers and
ran profusely down his vest
what i promised to thee that will i give my
friend my pupil these have been but trials to thy
virtue it comes forth brighter for thy novitiate
 think no more those dull cheats 
assort no more with those menials goddess
 atrienses her hall you are worthy to enter
into penetralia i henceforth will be your
priest your guide and you who now curse my
friendship shall live to bless it 
 young man lifted up his head and gazed
with a vacant and wondering stare upon egyptian

listen to me continued arbaces in an earnest
and solemn voice casting first his searching eyes
around to see that they were still alone from
egypt came all knowledge world from
egypt came lore athens and profound
policy crete from egypt came those early
and mysterious tribes which long before 
hordes romulus swept over plains 
 slaves who had care atrium
pipei 
italy and in eternal cycle events drove
back civilization into barbarism and darkness possessed
all arts wisdom and graces 
intellectual life from egypt came rites and
 grandeur that solemn care whose inhabitants
taught their iron vanquishers rome all
that they yet know elevated in religion and
sublime in worship and how deepest thou
young man that that dread egypt mother 
countless nations achieved her greatness and
soared to her cloud capt eminence wisdom 
it was result a profound and holy policy
your modern nations owe their greatness to egypt
egypt her greatness to her priests rapt in
themselves coveting a sway over nobler part
 man his soul and his belief these ancient ministers
 god were inspired with grandest thought
that ever occurred to mortals from revolutions
 stars from seasons earth
from round and unvarying circle human destinies
they devised an august allegory they made
it gross and palpable to vulgar by signs 
gods and goddesses and that which in reality was
government they named religion isis is a fable
f 
 
start not that for which isis is a type is
a reality an immortal being isis is nothing 
nature which she represents is mother 
all things dark ancient inscrutable same to
 gifted few none among mortals hath ever
taken off my veil so saith isis that you adore 
but to wise that veil hath been removed
and eve have stood face to face with solemn
loveliness nature priests then were 
benefactors civilizers mankind true they
were also cheats impostors if you will but think
you young man that if they had not deceived their
kind they could have served them ignorant
and servile vulgar must be blinded to attain to
their proper good they would not believe a maxim
 they revere an oracle emperor rome
sways vast and various tribes earth and
harmonizes conflicting and disunited elements 
thence come peace order law blessings 
life think you it is man emperor that
thus sways no it is pomp awe 
majesty that surround him these are his impostures
his delusions our oracles and our divinations
our rites and our ceremonies are means
pompeii 
 our sovereignty and engines our power
they are same means to same 
welfare and harmony mankind you listen tome
rapt and intent light begins to dawn upon
you
apsecides remained silent but changes rapidly
passing over his speaking countenance betrayed
 effect produced upon him by words
 egyptian words made tenfold more eloquent
by voice aspect and manner 
 man
while then resumed arbaces our fathers
 nile thus achieved first elements by whose
life chaos is destroyed namely obedience and
reverence multitude for few they
drew from their majestic and starred meditations
that wisdom which alas rio delusion they invented
 codes and regularities law arts and
glories existence they asked belief they
returned gift by civilization were not their
very cheats a virtue trust me whosoever in yon
far heavens a diviner and more beneficent
nature look down upon our aorld smile approvingly
upon wisdom which has worked such
 
ends but you wish me to apply these generalities
to yourself i hasten to obey wish 
altars goddess our ancient faith must be
served and served too by stolid and soulless
things that are but as pegs and hooks whereon
to hang fillet and robe remember two
sayings sixtus pythagorean sayings borrowed
from lore egypt first is
speak not god to multitude second
is man worthy god is a god among
men as genius gave to ministers egypt
worship that empire in late ages so fearfully
decayed thus by genius only can dominion
be restored i saw in you apaecides a pupil
worthy my lessons a minister worthy 
great ends which may yet be wrought your
energy your talents your purity faith your
earnestness enthusiasm all fitted you for
that calling which demands so imperiously high
and ardent qualities i fanned therefore your
sacred desires i stimulated you to step
you have taken but you blame me that i did
not reveal to you little souls and juggling
tricks your companions had i done so apa
pompeii 
cites i had defeated my own object your noble
nature would have at once revolted and isis would
have lost her priest
apaecides groaned aloud egyptian continued
without heeding interruption
i placed you therefore without preparation
in temple i left you suddenly to discover and
to be sickened by all those mummers which dazzle
 herd i desired that you should perceive
how those engines are moved by which fountain
that refreshes world casts its waters in 
air it was trial ordained old to all our
priests those who accustom themselves to 
impostures atilgar are left to practise them 
for those like you whose higher natures demand
higher pursuit religion opens more godlike secrets
i am pleased to find in you character
i had expected you have taken vows you
cannot recede advance i will be your guide
and what wilt thou teach me o singular and
fearful man new cheats new 
 no i have thrown thee into abyss 
disbelief i will lead thee now to eminence 
faith thou hast seen false types thou shalt
 
learn now realities they represent there is
no shadow apaecides without its substance come
to me this night your hand
impressed excited bewildered by language
 egyptian apaecides gave him his hand
and master and pupil parted
it was true that for apaecides there was no retreat
he had taken vows celibacy he had
devoted himself to a life that at present seemed to
possess all austerities fanaticism without
 consolations belief it was natural that he
should yet cling to a yearning desire to reconcile
himself to an irrevocable career powerful
and profound mind egyptian yet claimed an
empire over his young imagination excited him
with vague conjecture and kept him alternately
vibrating between hope and fear
meanwhile arbaccs pursued his slow and stately
way to house lone as he entered tables
he heard a voice from porticos 
peristyle beyond which musical as it was sounded
displeasingly on his ear it was voice 
young and beautiful glaucus and for first time
an involuntary thrill jealousy crossed breast
pompeii ill
 egyptian on entering peristyle he
found glaucus seated by side lone 
fountain in odorous garden cast up its silver
spray in air and kept a delicious coolness m
 midst sultry noon handmaids
almost invariably attendant on lone who rith her
freedom life preserved most delicate modesty
sate at a litle distance by feet glaucus
lay lyre on which he had been playing to

group before arbaces was stamped by that peculiar
and refined ideality poesy which we yet not
erroneously imagine to be distinction 
ancients marble columns vases flowers
 statue white and tranquil closing every vista
and above all two living forms from which a
sculptor might have caught either inspiration or
despair 
arbaces pausing for a moment gazed on 
pair with a brow from which all usual stern
serenity had fled he recovered himself by an
effort and slowly approached them but with a
step so soft and echoless that even attendants
heard him not much less lone and her lover
 op
and yet said glaucus it is only before
we love that we imagine that our poets
have truly described passion instant 
sun rises all stars that had shone in his absence
vanish into air poets exist only
in night heart they are nothing tous
when we feel full glory god
a gentle and most glowing image noble
glaucus
both started and recognised behind seat
 lone cold and sarcastic face egyptian

you are a sudden guest said glaucus
rising and with a forced smile
so ought all to be who know they are
welcome returned arbaces seating himself
and motioning to glaucus to do same
i am glad said lone to see you at
length together for you are suited to each other
and you are formed to be friends
give me back some fifteen years life
replied egyptian before you can place
me on an equality with glaucus happy should
i be to receive his friendship but what can i
pompeii 
give him in return can i make to him same
confidences that he would repose in me 
banquets and garlands parthian steeds and
 chances dice these pleasures suit his
age his nature his career they are not for
mine
so sang artful egyptian looked down
and sighed but from corner his eye he
stole a glance towards lone to see how she received
these insinuations pursuits her
visiter her countenance did not satisfy him
glaucus slightly colouring hastened gaily to reply
nor was he perhaps without same
wish to disconcert and abash egyptian
you are right wise arbaces said he we
can esteem each other but we cannot be friends
my banquets lack secret salt which according
to rumour gives such zest to your own and
per hercle when i have reached your age if i
like you may think it wise to pursue pleasures
 manhood like you i shall be doubtless sarcastic
on gallantries youth
 egyptian raised his eyes to glaucus with
a sudden and piercing glance
 
i do not understand you said he coldly
but it is custom to consider wit lies in
obscurity he turned as he spoke from glaucus
with a scarcely perceptible sneer contempt
and after a moment's pause addressed himself to
lone i have not beautiful lone said he
been fortunate enough to find you within doors
 two or three times that i have visited
your vestibule
 smoothness sea has tempted me
much from home replied lone with a little embarrassment

 embarrassment did not escape arbaees 
but without seeming to heed it he replied with
a smile you know old poet says that
women should keep within doors and there
converse 
 poet was a cynic said glaucus and
hated women
he spake according to customs his
country and that country is your boasted greece
to different periods different customs had our
forefathers known lone they had made a different
law
 euripides
pompeii 
did you learn these pretty gallantries at
rome said arbaces vritli ill suppressed emotion
one certainly would not go for gallantries
to egypt retorted glaucus playing carelessly
with his chain
come come said lone hastening to interrupt
a conversation which she saw to her great
distress was so little likely to cement intimacy
she had desired to effect between glaucus and
her friend arbaces must not be so hard upon his
poor pupil an orphan and without a mother's care
i may be to blame for independent and
almost masculine puberty life that i have chosen
yet it is not greater than roman women
are accustomed to it is not gieater than 
grecian ought to be alas is it only to be
among mei that freedom and virtue are to be
deemed united why should slavery that
destroys you be considered only method to
preserve us ah believe me it has been great
error men and one that has worked bitterly
on their destinies to imagine that nature 
women is i will not say inferior that may be
 
so but so different from their oti in making
laws favourable to intellectual advancement
 women have they not in so doing made
laws against their children whom women are to
rear against husbands whom women are
to be friends nay sometimes advisers 
lone stopped short suddenly and her face alas
suffused with most enchanting blushes she
feared lest her enthusiasm had led her too far 
yet she feared austere arbaces less than 
courteous glaucus for she loved and
it alas not custom greeks to allow
their women at least such their women as
they most honoured same liberty and 
same station as those italy enjoyed she
felt therefore a thrill delight as glaucus
earnestly replied 
ever mayest thou think thus lone ever
be your pure heart your unerring guide happy
had it been for greece if she had given to 
chaste same intellectual charms that are
so celebrated amongst less worthy her
avoient no state falls from freedom from
pompeii 
knowledge while your sex smile only on 
free and by appreciating encourage wise
arbaces was silent for it was neither his
part to sanction sentiment glaucus nor
to condemn that lone and after a short and
embarrassed conversation glaucus took his leave
 lone
when he was gone arbaces drawing his
seat nearer to fair neapolitan's said in those
bland and subdued tones in which he knew so
well how to veil mingled art and fierceness
 his character
think not my sweet pupil if so i may
call you that i wish to shackle that liberty
you adorn while you assume but which if not
greater as you rightly observe than that possessed
by roman women must at least be
accompanied by great circumspection when arrogated
by one unmarried continue to draw
crowds gay brilliant wise themselves
to your feet continue to charm them with
 conversation an aspasia music an
erinna but reflect at least on those censorious
 
tongues which can so easily blight tender
reputation a maiden and while you provoke
admiration give i beseech you no victory to
envy
what mean you arbaces said lone in an
alarmed and trembling voice i know you are
my friend that you desire only my honour and
my welfare what is it you would say 
your friend ah how sincerely may i
sieak then as a friend without reserve and without
offence 
i beseech you do so
this young profligate this glaucus how
didst thou know him hast thou seen him
often and as arbaces spoke he fixed his gaze
steadfastly upon lone as if he sought to penetrate
into her soul
recoiling before that gaze with a strange fear
which she could not explain greek answered
with confusion and hesitation he was brought
to my house as a countryman my father's and i
may say mine i have known him only within
this week or so but why these questions f
forgive me said arbaces i thought you
pompeii 
might have laiotti him longer base insinuate
that he is 
how what mean you why that term 
it matters not let me not rouse your indignation
against one who does not deserve so
grave an honour
i implore you speak what has glaucus insinuated
 or rather in what do you suppose he
has offended 
smothering his resentment at part 
lone's question arbaces continued you know
his pursuits his companions his habits compensation
and ale revel and dice make
his occupation and amongst associates 
vice how can he dream virtue 
still you speak riddles by gods i entreat
you say worst at once
well then it must be so know my lone
that it was but yesterday that glaucus boasted
openly yes in public baths your love to
him he said it amused him to take advantage
 it nay i will do him justice he praised your
beauty who could deny it but he laughed
scornfully when his clodius or his lepidus
 
asked him if he loved you enough for marriage
and when he purposed to adorn his doorposts with
flowers 
impossible how heard you this base
slander 
nay would you have me relate to you all 
comments insolent coxcombs with which 
story has circled through town be assured that
i myself disbelieved at first and that i have now
painfully been convinced by several earwitnesses
 truth what i have reluctantly told thee
lone sank back and her face was whiter than
 pillar againstwhich she leant for support
i own it vexed it irritated me to hear your
name thus lightly pitched from lip to lip like
some mere dancing girls fame i hastened this
morning to seek and to avaro you i found glaucus
here i was stung from my selfpossession i
could not conceal my feelings nay i mss uncourteous
in thy presence canst thou forgive thy
friend lone 
lone placed her hand in his but replied not
think no more this said he but let it
be a warning voice to tell thee iiom much pru
pompeii 
thence thy lot requires it cannot hurt thee lone
for a moment for a gay thing like this could
never have been honoured by even a serious
thought from lone these insults only wound
hen they come from one we love far different
indeed is he whom lofty lone shall stoop to
love
love muttered lone with an hysterical
laugh ay indeed
it is not without interest to observe in those remote
times and under a social system so widely
different from modern same small causes
that ruffle and interrupt course life which
operate so commonly at this day same inventive
jealousy same cunning slander 
same crafty and fabricated retailing petty
gossip which so often now suffice to break ties
 truest love and counteract tenor circumstances
most apparently propitious when
 bark sails on over smoothest wave 
fable tells us diminutive fish that can cling
to keel and arrest its progress so is it ever
with great passions mankind and we should
paint life but ill if even in times most provol
i 
 
cligal romance and romance which we
most largely avail omselves we did not also describe
 mechanism those trivial and household
springs mischief which we see every day at
work in our chambers and at our hearths it is
in these lesser intrigues life that we mostly
find ourselves at home with past if you
scorn them you are only a romance writer and
you do not interest heart because you do not
portray it
most cunningly had egyptian appealed to
lone's ruling foible most dexterously had he applied
 poisoned dart to her pride he fancied
he had arrested what at most he hoped from 
shortness time she had known glaucus was
but an incipient fancy and hastening to change
 subject he now led her to talk her brother
their conversation did not long he left her
resolved not again to trust so much to absence
but to visit to watch her every day
no sooner had his shadow glided from her presence
than woman's pride her sex's dissimulation
 deserted his intended victim and haughty
lone burst into passionate tears

when glaucus left lone he felt as if he trod
upon air in interview wth which he had
just been blessed he had for first time gathered
from her distinctly that his love was not unwelcome
to and would not be unrewarded by her
this hope filled him with a rapture for which
earth and heaven seemed too narrow to afford a
vent unconscious sudden enemy he had
left behind and forgetting not only his taunts but
his very existence glaucus passed through 
gay streets repeating to himself in wantonness
 joy music soft air to avliich lone
had listened with such intentness and no he
entered street fortune with its raised footpath
 its houses painted without and open doors
g 
 
admitting view glowing frescos within
each street was adorned with a triumphal
arch and as glaucus now came before temple
 fortune jutting portico that beautiful
fane which is supposed to have been built by one 
 family cicero perhaps by orator himself
imparted a dignified and venerable feature to a
scene otherwise more brilliant than lofty in its
character that temple was one most
graceful specimens roman architecture it
was raised on a somewhat lofty podium and
between two flights steps ascending to a
platform stood altar goddess from
this platform another flight broad stairs led
to portico from height whose fluted
columns hung festoons richest flowers
on either side extremities temple
were placed statues grecian workmanship 
and at a little distance from temple rose
 triumphal arch crowned with an equestrian
statue caligula which was flanked by
trophies bronze in space before 
temple a lively throng were assembled some
seated on benches and discussing politics 
pompeii 
 empire some conversing on approaching
spectacle amphitheatre one knot young
men were lauding a new beauty another discussing
 merits play a third group
more stricken in age were speculating on
 chance trade with alexandria and
amidst these were many merchants in eastern
costume whose loose and peculiar robes painted
and gemmed slippers and composed and serious
countenances formed a striking contrast to tucked
forms and animated gestures italians
for that impatient and lively people had as now
a language distinct from speech a language 
signs and motions inexpressibly significant and vivacious
 their descendants retain it and learned
joiio hath written a most entertaining work
upon that species hieroglyphical gesticulation
sauntering through crowd glaucus soon
found himself amidst a group his merry and
dissipated friends
ah said sallust it is a lustrum since i saw
you
and how have you spent lustrum 
what new dishes have you discovered 
 
i have been scientific returned sallust
and have made some experiments in feeding
 lampreys i confess i despair bringing them
to perfection which our roman ancestors
attained
miserable man and why 
because returned sallust with a sigh it
is no longer lawful to give them a slave to eat
i am very often tempted to make away with a
very fat captor butler that i possess and pop
him slyly into reservoir he would give 
fish a most oleaginous flavour but slaves are
not slaves nowadays and have no sympathy with
their master's interest or davis would destroy
himself to oblige me 
what news from rome said lepidus ashe
languidly joined group
 emperor has been giving a splendid supper
to senators answered sallust
he is a good creature quoth lepidus they
say he never sends a man away without granting
his request
perhaps he would let me kill a slave for my
reservoir returned sallust eagerly
pompeii 
not unlikely said glaucus for he who
grants a favour to one roman must always do it
at expense another be sure that for every
smile titus has caused a hundred eyes have
wept
long live titus cried pansa overhearing
 emperor's name as he swept patronizingly
through crowd he has promised my brother
a tutorship because he had run tlu'ough his
fortune
and wishes to now enrich himself among 
people my pansa said glaucus
exactly so said pansa
that is putting people to some use said
glaucus
to be sure returned pansa well i
must go and look after geranium it is a little
out repair and followed by a long train 
clients distinguished from rest throng
by togas they wore for togas once sign
 freedom in a citizen were now badge 
servility to a patron aedile fidgeted fussily
away
poor pansa said lepidus he never has
 
time for pleasure thank heaven i am not an
aedile 
ah glaucus care caput how are you gay
as ever said clodius joining group
are you come to sacrifice to fortune said
sallust
i sacrifice to her every night returned 
gamester
i do not doubt it no man has made more
victims 
per hercle a biting speech cried glaucus
laughing
 dog's letter is never out your mouth
sallust said clodius angrily you are always
snarling
i may well have dog's letter in my mouth
since whenever i play with you i have dog's
throw in my hand returned sallust
hist said glaucus taking a rose from a
flower girl who stood beside
 rose is token silence replied
sallust but i love only to see it at supper
table
talking that diomed gives a grand feast
pompeii 
this week said sallust are you invited
glaucus 
yes i received an invitation this morning
and i too said sallust drawing a square
piece papyrus from his girdle i see that he
asks us an hour earlier than usual an earnest 
something sumptuous 
oh he is rich as croesus said clodius 
and his bill fare is as long as an epic
well let us to baths said glaucus 
this is time when all world is there 
and fulvius whom you admire so much is going
to read us his ode
 young men assented readily to proposal
and they strolled to baths
although public thermae or baths were instituted
rather for poorer citizens than wealthy
for had baths in their own horses yet to
 crowds all ranks who resorted to them it was
a favourite place for conversation and for that indolent
lounging so dear to a gay and thoughtless
people baths at pompeii differed course in
 romans sent tickets invitation like moderns
specifying hour repast which if intended feast
was to be sumptuous was earlier than usual
g
 
plan and construction from vast and complicated
thermae rome and indeed it seems that in
each city empire there was always some slight
modification arrangement in general architecture
 public baths this mightily puzzles 
learned as if architects and fashion were not capricious
before nineteenth century our party
entered by principal porch in street fortune
at wing portico sat keeper 
 baths with his tmo boxes before him one for 
money he received one for tickets he dispensed
round walls portico were seats crowded
with persons all ranks while others as 
regimen physicians prescribed were walking
briskly to and fro portico stopping every now
and then to gaze on innumerable notices 
shows games sales exhibitions which averse
painted or inscribed upon avails general
subject conversation alas however spectacle
announced in amphitheatre and each ncav
comer alas fastened upon by a group eager to
knoav if pompeii had been so fortunate as to produce
some monstrous criminal some happy case
 sacrilege or murder which avould allow 
pompeii 
exiles to provide a man for jaws lion 
all other more common exhibitions seemed dull and
tame when compared with possibility this
fortunate occurrence
for my part said oae jollylooking man who
was a goldsmith i think emperor if he is as
good as they say might have sent us a jew
why not take one new sect nazarenes
said a philosopher i am not cruel but
an atheist one who denies jupiter himself deserves
no mercy
i care not how many gods a man likes to
believe in said jeweller but to deny all
gods is something monstrous
yet i fancy said glaucus that these
people are not absolutely atheists i am told that
they believe in a god nay in a future state
quite a mistake my dear glaucus said 
philosopher i have conferred with them tlie
laughed in my face avhen i talked pluto and
hades
o ye gods exclaimed goldsmith in horror
are there any these wretches in pompeii
i know there are a few but they meet so prig
 
lately tluat it is impossible to discover who they
are
as glaucus turned away a sculptor who was a
great enthusiast in his art looked after him admiringly

ah said he if we could get him on 
arena there would be a model for you what
limbs what a head he ought to have been a
gladiator a subject a subject worthy our
art why don't they give him to lion
meanwhile fulvius roman poet whom his
contemporaries declared immortal and who but for
this history would never have been heard ot in
our neglectful age came eagerly up to glaucus
oh my athenian my glaucus you have come
to hear my ode that is indeed an honour you
a greek to whom very language common
life is poetry how i thank you it is buta
trifle but if i secure your approbation 
perhaps i may get an introduction to titus o
glaucus a poet without a patron is an amphora
without a label wine may be good but nobody
will laud it and what says pythagoras frankincense
to gods but praise to man a patron
pompeii 
then is poets priest he procures him incense
and obtains him his believers
but all pompeii is your patron and every
portico an altar in your praise
ah poor pompeians are very civil 
they love to honour merit but they are only 
inhabitants a petty town sperm nieliora shall
we within 
certainly we lose time till we hear your
poem
at this instant there was a rush some twenty
persons from baths into portico and a
slave stationed at door a small corridor now
admitted poet glaucus clodius and a troop
 bard's other friends into passage
a poor place this compared with roman
thei'mse said lepidus disdainfully
yet is there some taste in ceilings said
glaucus who was in a mood to be pleased with
everything pointing to stars which studded
 roof
lepidus shrugged his shoulders but was too
languid to reply
they now entered a somewhat spacious 
 
ber which served for purposes apodite
rum that is a place where bathers prepared
themselves for their luxurious ablutions 
vaulted ceiling was raised from a cornice knowingly
coloured with motley and grotesque paintings
 ceiling itself was panelled in white compartments
bordered with rich crimson unsullied
and shining floor was paved with white mosaics
and along walls were ranged benches for 
accommodation loiterers this chamber did
not possess numerous and spacious windows
which vitruvius attributes to his more magnificent
frigidarium pompeians as all southern
italians were fond banishing light their
sultry skies and combined in their voluptuous
associations idea luxury with darkness
two windows glass alone admitted soft
and shaded ray and compartment in which
one ofthese casements was placed was adorned
with a large relief destruction titans
 discoveries at pompeii have controverted long
established error antiquaries that glass windows were
unknown to romans use them was not however
common among middle and inferior classes in their private
dwellings
pompeii 
 this apartment fulvius seated himself with a
magisterial air and his audience gathering round
him encouraged him to commence his recital
 poet did not require much pressing he
drew forth from his vest a roll papyrus and
after hemming three times as much to command
silence as to dear his voice he began that wonderful
ode which to great mortification 
author this history no single verse can be
discovered
by plaudits he received it was doubtless
worthy his fame and glaucus was only
listener who did not find it excel best odes 
horace
 poem concluded those who took only 
cold bath began to undress they suspended their
garments on hooks fastened in wall and re
ceiling according to their condition either from
their own slaves or those thermae a loose
robe withdrew into that graceful and circular
building which yet exists to shame unloving
posterity south
 more luxurious departed by another door
to tepidarium a place which was heated to a
 op
voluptuous warm til partly by a moveable fireplace
principally by a suspended pavement beneath
which was conducted caloric 
laconic
here this portion intended bathers after
undoing themselves remained for some time
enjoying artificial warmth luxurious
air and this room as befitted its important
rank in long process ablution was more
richly and elaborately decorated than rest 
 arched roof was beautifully carved and
painted windows above ground glass admitted
but wandering and uncertain rays below
 massive cornices were rows figures in massive
and bold relief walls glowed with crimson
 pavement was skilfully tesselated in white
mosaics here habituated bathers men who
bathed seven times aday would remain in a state
 enervate and speechless lassitude either before
or mostly after waterbath and many 
these victims pursuit health turned their
listless eyes on new comers recognising their
friends with a nod but dreading fatigue 
conversation
pompeii 
from this place party again diverged according
to their several fancies some to sudato
rimini which answered purpose our vapour 
baths and from thence to warmbath itself
those more accustomed to exercise and capable 
dispensing with so cheap a purchase fatigue
resorted at once to calidarium or waterbath
in order to complete this sketch and give to 
reader an adequate notion this main luxury
 ancients we will accompany lepidus who
regularly underwent whole process save only
 coldbath which had gone lately out fashion
being then gradually warmed in tepidarium
which has just been described delicate steps 
 pompeian elegant were conducted to sanatorium
here let reader depict to himself 
gradual process vapourbath accompanied by
an exhalation spicy perfumes after our bather
had undergone this operation he was seized by
his slaves who always awaited him at baths
and dews heat were removed by a kind 
scraper which by way a modern traveller
has gravely declared to be used only to remove
 dirt not one particle which could ever
 
settle on polished skin practised bather
thence somewhat cooled he passed into 
waterbath over which fresh perfumes were profusely
scattered and on emerging from opposite
part room a cooling shower played over
his head and form then wrapping himself in a
light robe he returned once more to tepid
where he found glaucus who had not encountered
 sanatorium and now main delight
and extravagance bath commenced
their slaves anointed bathers from vials gold
 alabaster or crystal studded with profuse
gems and containing rarest unguents gathered
from all quarters world number 
these stigmata used by wealthy would fill a modern
volume especially if volume were printed
by a fashionable publisher amoracinum megahum
narduvi omne quod exit in uni while soft
music played in an adjacent chamber and such as
used bath in moderation refreshed and restored
by grateful ceremony conversed with all
 zest and freshness rejuvenated life
blest be he who invented baths said glaucus
stretching himself along one those bronze
pompeii 
seats then covered with soft cushions which 
visiter to pompeii sees at this day in that same
tepidarium whether he were hercules or bacchus
he deserved deification
but tell me said a corpulent citizen who was
groaning and wheezing under operation being
rubbed dol tell me o glaucus evil chance
to thy hands o slave why so rough tell me 
ugh ugh are baths at rome really so magnificent
 glaucus turned and recognised diomed
though not without some difficulty so red and so
inflamed were good man's cheeks by sudatory
and scraping he had so lately undergone
 i fancy they must be a great deal finer than
these eh suppressing a smile glaucus replied
imagine all pompeii converted into baths
and you would then form a notion size 
 imperial thermae rome but a notion 
size only imagine every entertainment for mind
and body enumerate all gymnastic games
our fathers invented repeat all books italy
and greece have produced suppose places for all
these games admirers for all these works add
to this baths vastest size most com
 
plicated construction intersperse whole
with gardens with theatres with porticos with
schools suppose in one word a city 
gods composed but palaces and public edifices
and you may form some faint idea glories
 great baths rome
per hercle said diomed opening his eyes
why it would take a man's whole life to bathe
at rome it often does so replied glaucus
gravely there are many who live only at 
baths they repair there first hour in avhicli
they are opened and remain till that in which
they are closed they seem as if they knew
nothing rest rome as if they despised
all other existence
per hercle 
even those who bathe only thrice a day contrive
to consume their lives in occupation
they take their exercise in tennis court or
 porticos to prepare them for first bath 
they lounge into theatre to refresh themselves
after it they take their cranium under 
trees and think over their second bath by 
time it is prepared cranium is digested
pompeii 
from second bath they stroll into one 
perishes to hear some new poet recite or into
 library to sleep over an old one then comes
 supper which they still consider but a part 
 bath and then a third time they bathe again
as best place to converse with their fiiends
per hercle but we have their imitators at
pompeii
yes and without their excuse magnificent
voluptuaries roman baths are happy 
they see nothing but gorgeousness and splendour
they visit not squalid parts city they
know not that there is poverty in world all
nature smiles for them and her only frown is
 one which sends them to bathe in cactus
believe me they are your only true philosophers 
while glaucus was thus conversing lepidus
with closed eyes and scarce perceptible breath
was undergoing all mystic operations not one
 which he ever suffered his attendants to omit
after perfumes and unguents they scattered
over him luxurious powder which
prevented any farther accession heat and this
being rubbed away by smooth surface 
 
pumice he began to indue not garments he
had put off but those more festive ones termed
 synthesis with which romans marked
their respect for comme ceremony supper
if rather from its hour three o'clock in our measurement
 time it might not be more fitly denominated
dinner this done he at length opened
his eyes and gave signs returning life
at same time too sallust betokened by a
long yawn evidence existence
it is supper time said epicure you
glaucus and lepidus come and sup with me
recollect you are all three engaged to my
house this week cried diomed who was mighty
proud acquaintance men fashion
ah ah we recollect said sallust seat
 memory my diomed is certainly in 
stomach
passing now once again into cooler air and
so into street our gallants that day concluded
 ceremony a pompeian bath
pompeii
chapter viii
graces cogs his dice with pleasure anb veins 
game
 evening darkened over restless city as
apaecides took his way to house egyptian
he avoided more lighted and populous
streets and as he strode onward with his head
buried in his bosom and his arms folded within
his robe there was something startling in 
contrast which his solemn mien and wasted form
presented to thoughtless brows and animated
air those who occasionally crossed his path
at length however a man a more sober and
staid demeanour and who had twice passed him
with a curious but doubting look touched him on
 shoulder
apaecides said he and he made a rapid sign
with his hands it was sign cross
 
well nazarene replied priest and his
pale face grew paler what wouldst thou 
nay returned stranger i would not
interrupt thy meditations hut time we
met i seemed not to he so unwelcome
you are not unwelcome olynthus hut i am
sad and weary nor am i able this evening to discuss
with you those themes which are most acceptable
to you
o backward heart said olinthus with
bitter fervour and art thou sad and weary and
silt thou turn from very springs that refresh
and heal 
o earth cried young priest striking his
breast passionately from what regions shall my
eyes open to true olympus where thy gods
really dwell am i to believe with this man that
none whom for so many centuries my fathers
worshipped have a being or a name am i to
break down as something blasphemous and profane
 very altars which i have deemed most
sacred or am i to think with arbaces what 
he paused and strode rapidly away in impatience
 a man who strives to get rid himself
pompeii 
but nazarene was one those hardy vigorous
and enthusiastic men among whom god in
all times has worked revolutions earth and
above all whether in establishment whether in
 reformation his own religion who were
formed to convert because formed to endive men
whom nothing discoages nothing dismays in 
fervour belief they are inspired and they inspire
their reason first kindles their passion but 
passion is instrument they use they force
themselves into men's hearts while they appear
only to appeal to their judgment nothing is so
contagious as enthusiasm it is real allegory
 tale orpheus it moves stones it charms
brutes enthusiasm is genius sincerity
and truth accomplishes no victories without it
olinthus did not then suffer apaecides thus
easily to escape him he overtook and addressed
him thus 
i do not wonder apaecides that i distress
you i that i shake all elements your mind
that you are lost in doubt that you drift here
and there in vast ocean uncertain and benighted
thought i wonder not at this but bear
vol i h
 
vvith me a little watch and pray darkness
shall vanish storm sleep and god himself as
he came yore on seas samaria shall
walk over lulled billows to delivery 
your soul ours is a religion jealous in its demands
but how infinitely prodigal in its gifts 
it troubles you for an hour it repays you by
immortality
such promises said apascides sullenly are
 tricks by which man is ever gulled oh glorious
were promises which led me to shrine
 isis 
but answered nazarene ask thy reason
can that religion be sound which outrages
all morality you are told to worship your gods
vhat are those gods even according to 
what their actions what attributes
 their divinity are they not all represented
to you as blackest criminals yet you are
asked to serve them as holiest divinities
jupiter himself is a parricide and an adulterer
what are meaner divinities but imitators his
vices you are told not to murder but you worship
murderers you are told not to commit adultery
pompeii 
and you make your prayers to an adulterer oh 
what is this but a mockery holiest part 
man's nature which is faith turn now to 
god one true god to whose shrine i
would lead you if he seem to you too sublime
too shadowy for those human associations those
touching connections between creator and creature
to which weak heart clings contemplate
him in his son who put on mortality like
ourselves his mortality is not indeed declared
like that your fabled gods by faces our
nature but by practice all its virtues in
him are united austere morals with tenderest
affections if he were but a mere man he
had been worthy to become a god you honour
socrates he has his sect his disciples his schools
but what are doubtful virtues athenian
to bright undisputed active unceasing
 devoted holiness christ i speak
to you now only his human character he
came in that as pattern future ages to
show us form virtue which plato thirsted
to see embodied this was true sacrifice that
he made for man but halo that encircled
h 
 
his dying hour not only brightened earth but
opened to us sight heaven you are
touched you are moved god works in your
heart his spirit is with you come resist
not holy impulse come at once unhesitatingly
a few us are now assembled to expound
 word god come let me guide you
to them you are sad you are weary listen
then to words god come to me saith
he all ye that are heavy laden and i will give
you rest 
i cannot now said apaecides another time
now now exclaimed olinthus earnestly
and clasping him by arm
but apaecides yet unprepared for renunciation
 that faith that life for which he had
sacrificed so much and still haunted by promises
 egyptian extricated himself forcibly
from grasp and feeling an effort necessary to
conquer irresolution which eloquence 
 christian had begin to effect in his heated and
feverish mind he gathered up his robes and fled
away with a speed that defied pursuit
breathless and exhausted he arrived at in a
pompeii 
remote and sequestered part city and 
lone house egyptian stood before him ashe
paused to recover himself moon emerged
from a silver cloud and shone full upon walls
 that mysterious habitation
no other house was near darksome vines
clustered far and wide in front building
and behind it rose a copse lofty foresttrees
sleeping in melancholy moonlight beyond
stretched dim outline distant hills and
amongst them quiet crest vesuvius not
then so lofty as traveller beholds it now
apaecides passed through arching vines and
arrived at broad and spacious portico before
it on either side steps reposed image 
 egyptian sphinx and moonlight gave an
additional and yet more solemn calm to those large
and harmonious and passionless features in which
 sculptors that type wisdom united so
much loveliness with awe half way up extremities
 steps darkened green and
massive foliage aloe and shadow 
eastern palm cast its long and un waving boughs
partially over marble smface stairs
 
something there was in stillness 
place and strange aspect sculptured
sphynges which thrilled blood priest
with a nameless and ghostly fear and he longed
even for an echo to his noiseless steps as he ascended
to threshold
he knocked at door over which was
wrought an inscription in characters unfamiliar to
his eyes it opened without a sound and a tall
ethiopian slave without question or salutation
motioned to him to proceed
 wide hall was lighted by lofty candelabra
 elaborate bronze and round walls were
wrought vast hieroglyphics in dark and solemn
colours which contrasted strangely with 
bright hues and graceful shapes with which 
inhabitants italy decorated their abodes at
 extremity hall a slave whose countenance
though not african was darker by many
shades than usual colour south advanced
to meet him
i seek arbaces said priest but his
voice trembled even in his own ear slave
bowed his head in silence and leading appetites
pompeii 
to a wing without hall conducted him up a
narrow staircase and then traversing several rooms
in which stern and thoughtful beauty 
sphinx still made chief and most impressive
object priest's notice speeches found himself
in a dim and halflighted chamber in presence
 egyptian
arbaces was seated before a small table on
which lay unfolded several scrolls papyrus impressed
with same character as that on 
threshold mansion a small tripod stood
at a little distance from incense in which 
smoke slowly rose near this was a vast globe
depicting signs heaven and upon another
table lay several instruments curious and
quaint shape whose uses were unknown to appetites
 further extremity room was
concealed by a curtain and oblong window in
 roof admitted rays moon mingling
sadly with single lamp which burned in 
apartment
seat yourself apsecides said egyptian
without rising
 young man obeyed
l 
you ask me resumed graces after a
short pause in which he seemed absorbed in
thought you ask me or would do so 
mightiest secrets which soul man is fitted to
receive it is enigma life itself that you
desire me to solve placed like children in 
dark and but for a little while in this dim and
confined existence we shape out spectres in 
obscurity our thoughts now sink back into ourselves
in teitor now wildly plunge themselves into
 guideless gloom guessing what it may contain 
stretching our helpless hands here and there lest
blindly we stumble upon some hidden danger not
knowing limits that confine thinking now they
suffocate us with confusion thinking now that
they extend far away into eternity in this state
all wisdom consists necessarily in solution 
two questions what are we to believe and what
are we to reject these questions you desire me to
decide
ajacides bowed his head in assent
man must have some beliefs continued 
egyptian in a tone sadness he must fasten
his hope to something it is our common nature
pompeii 
that you inherit when aghast and terrified to
see that in which you have been taught to place
your faith swept away you float over a dreary
and shoreless sea incertitude you cry for
help you ask for some plank to cling to some
land however dim and distant to attain well
then listen you have not forgotten our conversation
 todays
forgotten
i confessed to you that those deities for
whom smoke so many altars were but inventions
i confessed to you that our rites and ceremonies
were but mummers to cheat herd to their
proper good i explained to you that from those
cheats came bonds society harmony 
 world power wise that power is in
 obedience vulgar continue we then
these salutary delusions if man must have some
belief continue to him that which his fathers have
made dear to him and which custom sanctifies and
strengthens in seeking a subtler faith for us
whose senses are too spiritual for gross one let
us leave others that support which crumbles from
ourselves this is wise it is benevolent
h 
 
proceed
this being settled resumed egyptian
 old landmarks being left uninjured for those
w hom we are about to desert we gird up our
loins and depart to new climes faith dismiss
at once from your recollection from your thought
all that you have believed before suppose 
mind a blank an unwritten scroll fit to receive
impressions for first time look round
 world observe its order its regularity 
its design something must have created it 
design speaks a designer in that certainty we first
touch land but what is that something a god
you cry stay no confused and confusing names
 that which created world we know we
can knoav nothing save these attributes power
and unvarying regularity stern crushing relentless
regcharity heeding no individual cases 
rolling sweeping burning on no matter what
scattered hearts severed from general mass
fall ground and scorched beneath its wheels 
mixture evil with good existence suffering
and crime in all times have perplexed 
wise they created a god they supposed him
pipei 
benevolent how then came this evil why did
he permit nay why invent why perpetuate it 
to account for this persian creates a second
spirit whose nature is evil and supposes a continual
war between that and god good
in our own shadowy and tremendous typhon
 egyptians image a similar demon perplexing
blunder that yet more bewilders us folly
that arose from vain delusion that makes
a palpable a corporeal a human being this
unknown power that clothes invisible with
attributes and a nature similar to seen no 
to this designer let us give a name that does not
command our bewildering associations and 
mystery becomes more clear that name is necessity
necessity say greeks compel 
gods then why gods their agency becomes
unnecessary dismiss them at once necessity is
 ruler all we see power regularity these
two qualities make its nature would you ask
more you can learn nothing whether it be
eternal whether it compel us its creatures to
new careers after that darkness which we call
death we cannot tell there leave we this
 
ancient unseen unfathomable power and come
to that which to our eyes is great minister 
its functions this wc can task more from this
we can learn more its evidence is around us 
its name is nature error sages has
been to direct their researches to attributes 
necessity where all is gloom and blindness had
they confined their researches to nature what 
knowledge might we not already have achieved 
here patience examination are never directed
in vain we see what we explore our minds
ascend a palpable ladder causes and effects
nature is great spirit external universe
and necessity imposes upon it laws by which
it acts and imparts to us powers by which
we examine those powers are curiosity and
memory their union is reason their perfection is
wisdom well then i examine by help 
these powers this inexhaustible nature i examine
 earth air ocean heaven i find
that all have a mystic sympathy with each other 
that moon sways tides that air maintains
 earth and is medium life and
sense things that by knowledge 
pompeii 
stars we measure limits earth that we
portion out epochs time that by their pale
light we are guided into abyss past 
that in their solemn lore we discern destinies
 future and thus while we know not that
which necessity is we learn at least her decrees
and now what morality do we glean from this
religion for religion it is i believe in two
deities nature and necessity i worship 
by reverence first by investigation what is
 morality it teaches this all things are
subject but to general rules sun shines for
 joy many it may bring sorrow to 
few night sheds sleep on multitude but
it harbours murder as well as rest forests
adorn earth but shelter serpent and 
lion ocean supports a thousand barks but it
engulphs one it is only thus for general
and not for universal benefit that nature acts
and necessity speeds on her awful course this
is morality dread agents world 
it is mine who am their creature i would preserve
 delusions priestcraft for they are
serviceable to multitude i would impart to
 
man arts i discover sciences i perfect 
i would speed vast career civilizing lore in
this i serve mass i fulfil general lav i
execute gieat moral that nature preaches
for myself i claim individual exception i
claim it for wise satisfied that my individual
actions are nothing in great balance good
and evil satisfied that product my knowledge
can give greater blessings to mass than
ray desires can operate evil on few for 
first can extend to remotest regions and humanize
nations yet unborn i give to world wisdom
to myself freedom i enlighten lives others
and i enjoy my oaati yes our wisdom is eternal
but our life is short make most it
while it lasts surrender thy youth to pleasure
and thy senses to delight soon comes hour
avhcn winecup is shattered and garlands
shall cease to bloom enjoy while you may be
still o apaecides my pupil and my follower 
i will teach thee mechanism nature her
darkest and her wildest secrets lore which
fools call magic and mighty mysteries 
pompeii 
 stars by this shalt thou discharge thy duty
to mass by this shalt thou enlighten thy
race but i will lead thee also to pleasures 
which vulgar do not dream and day
which thou gives to men shall be followed by
 sweet night which thou surrendered to
thyself
as egyptian ceased there rose about
around beneath softest music that lydia
ever taught or ionia ever perfected it came
like a stream sound bathing senses unawares
 enervating subduing with delight it
seemed melodies invisible spirits such as
 shepherd might have heard in golden age
floating through vales thessaly or in
 noontide glades paphos words which
had rushed to lip apascides in answer to
 sophistries egyptian died tremblingly
away he felt it as a profanation to break upon
that enchanted strain susceptibility his
excited nature greek softness and ardour 
his secret soul were swayed and captured by
surprise he sank on seat with parted lips
 
and thirsting ear while in a chorus voices
bland and melting as those which waked psyche
in halls love rose following song 
by cool banks where soft ephesus flows
a voice sailed trembling down waves air 
 leaves blushed brighter in tian's rose
 doves couch'd breathless in their summer air 
while from their hands purple flowerets fell
 laughing hours stood listening in sky 
from pan's green cave to egle's haunted cell
heaved charmed earth in one delicious sigh
love sons earth i am power love

learn from waves that ever kiss shore
and winds nestling on heaving sea

melted in light yet still airs above
 waving sedges and whispering stream
and green forest rustling murmured love 
as voices died away egyptian seized
 hand apaecides and led him wanderingintoxicated
yet half reluctant across chamber
towards curtain at far and now from
behind that curtain there seemed to burst a thousand
sparkling stars veil itself hitherto dark
was now lighted by these fires behind into 
tenderest blue heaven it represented heaven
 learned reader will recognise this image more than
once among antient poets
 
itself such a heaven as in nights june
might have shone down over streams castle
here and there were painted rosy and
aerial clouds from which smiled by limner's
art faces divinest beauty and on which reposed
 shapes which phidias and apelles dreamed
and stars which studded transparent azure
rolled rapidly as they shone while music
that again woke with a livelier and lighter sound
seemed to imitate melody joyous
spheres
oh what miracle is this arbaces said
apsecides in faltering accents after having denied
 gods art thou about to reveal to me 
their pleasures interrupted arbaces in a
tone so different from its usual cold and tranquil
harmony that apaecides started and thought 
egyptian himself transformed and now as they
neared curtain a wild a loud an exulting
melody burst from behind its concealment with
that sound veil was as it were to be rent in
twain it parted it seemed to vanish into air and
a scene which no sybarite ever more than rivalled
broke upon dazzled gaze youthful priest
pompeii 
a vast banquetroom stretched beyond blazing with
countless lights which filled warm air with
 scents frankincense jasmine violets
 myrrh all that most odorous flowers all
that most costly spices could distil seemed
gathered into one ineffable and ambrosial essence 
from light columns that sprang upward to 
airy roof hung draperies white studded with
golden stars at extremities room two
fountains cast up a spray which catching rays
 roseate light glittered like countless diamonds
in centre room as they entered
there rose slowly from floor to sound
 unseen minstrelsy a table spread with all 
viands which sense ever devoted to fancy and
vases that lost morphine fabric so glowing in
its colours so transparent in its material were
crowned with exotics east couches
to which this table was centre were covered
with tapestries azure and gold and from invisible
tubes in vaulted roof descended showers
 fragrant waters that cooled delicious air
which however was probably porcelain china 
though this is a matter which admits considerable dispute
 
and contended with lamps as if spirits 
wave and fire disputed which element could furnish
forth most delicious odours and now from
behind snowy draperies trooped such forms as
adonis beheld when he lay on lap venus
they came some with garlands others with lyres 
they surrounded youth they led his steps to
 banquet they flung chaplets round him
in rosy chains earth thought earth
vanished from his soul he imagined himself hi a
dream and suppressed his breath lest he should
wake too soon senses to which he had never
yielded as yet beat in his burning pulse and
confused his dizzy and reeling sight and while
thus amazed and lost once again but in brisk and
bacchic measures rose magic strain

who sat beside him and turning with swimming
eyes to seek for arbaces whom he had lost in 
whirl his emotions he beheld him seated beneath
a canopy at upper table and
gazing upon him with a smile that encouraged
him to pleasure he beheld him but not as he
had hitherto seen with dark and sable garments
with a brooding and solemn brow a robe that
dazzled sight so studded was its whitest surface
with gold and gems blazed upon his majestic
form white roses alternated with emerald and
 ruby and shaped tiaralike crowned his raven

while cups were emptied and refilled at that
glowing board they sang following strain 
ibggiiig jsssets t tim esstoii if

thou art in land shadowy host

if memory yet can fly
back to golden sky
and mourn pleasures lost 
by ruined hall these flowers we lay
where thy soul once held its palace 
when rose to thy scent and sight was gay
and smile was in chalice
and cithara's silver voice
could bid thy heart rejoice
when night eclipsed day

at this moment she who sat beside apaecides
suddenly took up song 

happy is yet our doom

they indulged practical jokes on each other boxing one

worthless and perhaps more witty associate courtesan

to greece latin comic writers make indeed prodigal use

higher rank and to have met with a somewhat milder treatment
than at athens nor do delineations terence which in
portraying athenian manners probably soften down whatever
would have been exaggerated to a roman audience present so degraded
or so abandoned a character as parasite alciphron

a flash house in pompeii and gentlemen
 classic ring
to one those parts pompeii which were
teuaiited not hy lords pleasure but by its
minions and its victims haunt gladiators
and prizefighters vicious and penniless
 savage and obscene alsatia
 an antient city we are now transported
it was a large room that opened at once on 
confined and crowded lane before threshold
were a group men whose iron and avellstrung
muscles whose short and herculean necks whose
hardy and reckless countenances indicated 
champions arena on a shelf without 
shop were ranged jars wine and oil and right
over this was inserted in wall a coarse painting
which exhibited gladiators drinking so 

 
tient and so venerable is custom signs 
within room were placed several small tables
arranged somewhat in modern fashion 
boxes and round these were seated several knots
 men some drinking some playing at dice
come at that more skilful game called chwdecim
ticn'pta which certain blundering learned
have mistaken for chess though it rather perhaps
resembled backgammon two and
was usually though not always played by 
assistance dice hour was in early forenoon
and nothing better perhaps than that unseasonable
time itself denoted habitual indolence 
these tavern loungers yet despite situation 
 house and character its inmates it indicated
none that sordid squalor which would have
characterized a similar haunt in a modern city
 gay disposition all pompeians who
sought at least to gratify sense even where
they neglected mind was typified by gaudy
colours which decorated avails and shapes
fantastic but not inelegant in which lamps
 drinking cups commonest household utensils
were wrought
pompeii 
by pollux said one gladiators ashe
leant against wall threshold 
wine thou eldest us old silenus and as he
spoke he slapped a portly personage on 
back is enough to thin best blood in one's
veins
 man thus caressingly saluted and whose
bared arms white apron and keys and napkin
tucked carelessly within his girdle indicated him
to be host tavern was ahlady passed
into autumn his years but his form was still
so robust and athletic that he might have shamed
even sinewy shapes beside him save that 
muscle had seeded as it were into flesh that 
cheeks were swelled and bloated and increasing
stomach threw into shade vast and massive
chest which rose above it 
none thy scurrilous blustering with me
growled gigantic landlord in gentle semiroar
 an insulted tiger my wine is good
enough for a carcase which shall so soon soak 
dust spollarium
 place to which killed or mortally wounded were
dragged from arena
 
croaker thou thus old raven returned 
gladiator laughing scornfully thou shalt live to
hang thyself with despite when thou seest me win
 palm crown and when get purse at 
amphitheatre as i certainly shall my first vow to
hercules shall be to forswear thee and thy vile
potations evermore
hear to him hear to this modest pyrgopo
lines he has certainly served under bombs

sporus niger tetraides he declares he shall
win purse from you why by gods each
 your muscles is strong enough to stifle all his
body or know nothing arena 
ha said gladiator colouring with rising
fury our lanista would tell a different story
what story could he tell against me vain

or me who have conquered in fifteen fights 
said gigantic niger stalking up to gladiator

or me grunted sporus with eyes fire

phrase lie has served under bonibastes furioso

tush said lydon folding his arms and regarding
his rivals with a reckless air defiance
 time trial will soon come keep your
valour till then
ay do said surly host and if i press
down my thumb to save you may fates cut
my thread
your rope you mean said lydon sneeringly
 here is a sesterce to buy one
 titan winevender seized hand extended
to him and griped it in so stern a vice that 
blood spirted from fingers ends over garments
 bystanders
they set up a savage laugh
i will teach thee young braggart to play 
macedonian with me i am no puny persian i
warrant thee what man have i not fought
twenty years in ring and never lowered my
arms once and have i not received rod from
 editor's own hand as a sign victory and asa
grace to retirement on my laurels and am i
now to be lectured by a boy so saying he
flung hand from him in scorn
without changing a muscle but with same
 
smiling face with which he had previously taunted
mine host did gladiator have painful
grasp he had undergone but no sooner was his
hand released than crouching for one moment as a
wild cat crouches you might see his hair bristle
on his head and heard and with a fierce and shrill
yell he sprang on throat giant with an
impetus that threw him vast and sturdy as he
was from his balance and down with crash
 a falling rock he fell while over him fell
also his ferocious foe
our host perhaps had had no need rope
so kindly recommended to him by lydon had he
remained three minutes longer in that position
but summoned to his assistance by noise 
his fall a woman who had hitherto kept in an
inner apartment rushed to scene battle
this new ally was in herself a match for gladiator
 she was tall lean and with arms that
could give other than soft embraces in fact 
gentle lk'lmate burbo mineseller had
like himself fought in lists nay under 
not only did women sometimes fight in amphitheatres 
but even those noble birth participated in that meek ambition
pompeii 
emperor's eye and bmbo himself burbo
 unconquered in field according to report
now and then yielded palm to his soft strategic
this sweet creature no sooner saw 
imminent peril that awaited her worse half than
without other weapons than those with which
natme had provided her she darted upon 
incumbent gladiator and clasping him round 
waist mith her long and snakelike arms lifted
him with a sudden wrench from body her
husband leaving only his hands still clinging to
 throat his foe so have we seen a dispatched
by hind legs from strife with
a fallen rival in arras some envious
groom so have we seen one half him high in air
passive and offenceless while other half
head teeth eyes claws seemed buried and engulfed
in mangled and prostrate enemy
meanwhile gladiators lapped and pampered
and glutted upon blood crowded delightedly round
 combatants their nostrils distended their
lips grinning their eyes gloatingly fixed on 
bloody throat one and indented talons

t 
habet he lias got it habet cried they with
a sort yell rubbing their nervous hands
non habet ye liars t have not got it shouted
 host as with a mighty effort he wrenched himself
from those deadly hands and rose to his feet
breathless panting lacerated bloody and fronting
with reeling eyes glaring look and grinning
teeth his baffled foe now struggling but struggling
with disdain in gripe sturdy
amazon
fair play cried gladiators one to one
and crowding round lydon and woman they
separated our pleasing host from his courteous
guest
but lydon feeling ashamed at his present position
and endeavouring in vain to shake off 
grasp virago slipped his hand into his girdle
and drew forth a short knife so menacing
was his look so brightly gleamed blade that
stratonice who was used only to fistic methods
 battle started back in alarm 
gods cried she ruffian he has
concealed weapons is that fair is that like a
gentleman and a gladiator no indeed i scorn
pompeii 
such fellows with that she contemptuously
turned her back on gladiator and hastened to
examine condition her husband
but he as much inured to these constitutional
exercises as an english bulldog is to a contest
with a more gentle antagonist had already recovered
himself purple hues receded from 
crimson surface his cheek veins forehead
retired into their wonted size he shook
himself with a complacent grunt satisfied that he
was still alive and then looking at his foe from
head to foot with an air more approbation than
he had ever bestowed upon him before 
by castor said he thou art a stronger
fellow than i took thee for i see thou art a
man merit and virtue give me thy hand my
hero
jolly old burbo cried gladiators applauding
 staunch to backbone give him thy
hand lydon
oh to be sure said gladiator but now
i have tasted his blood i long to lap whole 
per hercle returned my host quite unmoved
 that is true gladiator feeling pollux 
 day 
to think what good training may make a man 
why a beast could not be fiercer 
a beast o duuard we beat beasts
hollow cried tetraides
well well said stratonice who was now
employed in smoothing her hair and adjusting her
locks if ye are all good friends again i recommend
you to be quiet and orderly for some young
noblemen your patrons and backers have sent
to say they will cone here to pay you a visit 
they wish to see you more at their ease than at 
schools before they make up their bets on 
great fight at amphitheatre so they always
come to my house for that purpose they know
we only receive best gladiators in pompeii 
our society is very select praised be gods 
yes continued burbo drinking oif a bowl
or rather a pail wine a man who has won my
laurels can only encourage brave lydon
drink my boy may you have an honourable old
age like mine i
come here said stratonice drawing her
husband to her affectionately by ears in that
pompeii 
caress which tibullus lias so prettily described
come here 
not so hard she wolf thou art worse than
 gladiator murmured huge jaws burbo
hist r said she whispering him calenus
has just stole in disguised by back way i hope
he has brought sesterces
ho ho i will join him said burbo 
meanwhile i say keep a sharp eye on cups
attend to score let them not cheat thee
wife they are heroes to be sure but then they
are arrant rogues caius was nothing to them
never fear me fool was conjugal reply 
and burbo satisfied with dear assurance
strode tlu'ough apartment and sought penetralia
 his house
so those soft patrons are coming to look atour
muscles said niger who sent to previse
thee it my mistress 
lepidus he brings with him clodius 
surest better in pompeii and young greek

a wager on a wager cried tetraides clothe
 
dins bets on me fur twenty sesterces what say
you lydon 
he bets on me said lydon
no on me grunted sporus
dolts do you think he woidd prefer any 
you to niger said athletic thus modestly
naming himself
well mell said stratonice as she pierced a
huge amjhora for her guests who had now seated
themselves before one tables great
men and brave as ye all think yourselves which
 you will fight numidia lion in case no
malefactor should be found to deprive you 
option 
i who have escaped your arms stout strategic
said lydon might safely i think encounter
 lion
but tell me said tetraides where is that
pretty young slave yours blind girl with
bright eyes i have not seen her a long time
oh she is too delicate for you my son 
neptune said hostess and too nice even
 son neptune a latin phrase for a boisterous ferocious
fellow
pompeii 
for us i think we send her into town to
sell flowers and sino to ladies she makes his
more money so than she would by waiting on
you besides she has often other employments
which lie under rose
other employments said niger why she
is too young for them
silence beast said stratonice you think
there is no play but corinthian if nydia were
twice age she is at present she would be
equally fit for vesta poor girl
but harkye stratonice said lydon how
didst thou come by so gentle and delicate a slave 
she were more meet for handmaid some rich
matron rome than for thee
that is true returned stratonice and
some day or other i shall make my fortune by
selling her how came i by nydia thou askest 
ay
why thou seest my slave staph yla thou
remembered staphyla niger 
ay a largehanded wench with a face like
a comic mask how should i forget her by pluto 
whose handmaid she doubtless is at this moment
 
tush brute mell stapliyla died one day
and a great loss she was to me and i went into 
market to buy me another slave but by 
gods they were all grown so dear since i had
bought poor staphyla and money was so scarce
that i was about to leave place in despair
when a merchant plucked me by robe mistress
said he dost thou want a slave cheap 
i have a child to sell a bargain she is but little
and almost an infant it is true but she is quick
and quiet docile and clever sings well and
brothers and is good blood i assure you
 what country said i thessalonians now i
knew thessalonians were acute and gentle so i
said would see girl i found her just as you
see her now scarcely smaller and scarcely younger
in appearance she looked patient and resigned
enough with her hands crossed on her bosom and
her eyes downcast i asked merchant his
price it was moderate and i bought her at once
 merchant brought her to my house and disappeared
in an instant well my friends guess
my astonishment when i found she was blind
ha ha a clever fellow that merchant i ran at
pompeii 
once to magistrates but rogue was ahlady
gone from pompeii so i was forced to go home
in a very ill humour i assure you and poor
girl felt effects it too but it was not her
fault that she was blind for she had been so from
her birth by degrees we got reconciled to our
purchase true she had not strength stag
and was very little use in house but
she could soon find her way about town as
avell as if she had eyes argais and when
one morning she brought us home a handful 
sesterces which she said she had got from selling
some flowers she had gathered in our poor little
garden we thought gods had sent her to us
so from that time we let her go out as she likes
filling her basket with flowers which she wreaths
into garlands after thessalian fashion which
pleases gallants and great people seem to
take a fancy to her for they always pay her more
than they do any other flower girl and she brings
all it home to us mhich is more than any other
slave would do so i work for myself but i shall
soon aftbrd from her earnings to buy me a second
staphyla doubtless thessalian kidnapper had
 
stolen blind girl from gentle parents besides
her skill in garlands she sings and plays on
 cithara which also brings money and lately 
but that is a secret
that is a secret what v cried lydon art
thou turned sphinx 
sphinx no why sphpix 
cease thy gabble good mistress and bring
us our meat i am hungry said sporus impatiently

and i too echoed grim niger whetting
his knife on palm his hand
 amazon stalked away to kitchen and
soon returned with a tray laden with large pieces
 meat halfraw for so as now did heroes 
 prizefight imagine they best sustained their
hardihood and ferocity they drew round table
with eyes famished wolves meat vanished
 wine flowed so leave we those important
personages classic life to follow

two worthies
in efivlier times rome priesthood was
a profession not kicre but honour it was
embraced by noblest citizens it was forbidden
to plebeians afterwards and long previous
to present date it was equally open to
all ranks at least that part profession
which embraced stamens or priests not 
religion generally but peculiar gods even
 priest jupiter flamen dials preceded
by a lictor and entitled by his office to entrance
 senate at first especial dignitary
 patricians was subsequently choice
 people less national and less honoured
deities were usually served by plebeian ministers
and many embraced profession as now 
catholic christians enter monastic fraternity less
vol i k
 tie 
from impulse devotion than suggestions
 a calculating poverty thus calenus priest
 isis was lowest origin his relations
though not his parents were freedmen he had
received from them a liberal education and from
his father a small patrimony which he had soon
exhausted he embraced priesthood as a 
resource from distress whatever state emoluments
 sacred profession which at that
time were probably small officers a popular
temple could never complain profits their
calling there is no profession so lucrative as
that which practises on superstition 
multitude
calenus had but one surviving relative at pompeii
and that was burbo various dark and disreputable
ties stronger than those blood united
together their hearts and interests and often 
minister isis stole disguised and furtively from
 supposed austerity his devotions and gliding
through backdoor retired gladiator
a man infamous alike by vices and by profession
rejoiced to throw off rag an hypocrisy
which but for dictates avarice his ruling
pompeii j 
passion would at all times have sat clumsily upon
a nature too brutal for even mimicry virtue
wrapt in one those large mantles which
came in use among romans in proportion
as they dismissed toga whose ample folds
well concealed form and in which a sort 
hood attached to it afforded no less a security to
 features calenus now sate in small and
private chamber wineseller from which a
small faux or passage ran at once to that back
entrance with which nearly all houses pompeii
were furnished
opposite to him sat sturdy burbo carefully
counting on a table between them a little pile 
coins which priest had just poured from his
purse for purses avere as common then as now with
this difference they were usually better furnished 
you see said calenus that we pay you
handsomely and you ought to thank me for recommending
you to so advantageous a market
i do my cousin i do replied burbo affectionately
as he swept coins into a leathern
receptacle which he then deposited in his girdle
drawing buckle round his capacious waist more
k 
 
closely than he was wont to do in lax hours
 his domestic avocations and hy isis isis
and nysis or whatever other gods there may be
in egypt my little nydia is a very hesperides
a garden gold to me
she sings well and plays like a mnse returned
calenus those are virtues that he who employs
me always pays liberally
he is a god cried burbo enthusiastically
every rich man who is generous deserves to be
worshipped but come a cup wine old friend
tell me more about it what does she do 
she is frightened talks her oath and reveals
nothing
nor will i by my right hand i too have
taken that terrible oath secrecy
oath what are oaths to men like us 
true oaths a common fashion but this 
and stalwart priest shuddered as he spoke
et he continued in emptying a huge cup unmixed
wine i will own to thee that it is not so
much oath that i dread as vengeance 
him who proposed it by gods he is a mighty
sorcerer and could draw my confession from 
pompeii 
moon did i dare to make it to her talk no
more this bj pollux wild as those banquets
are which i enjoy with him i am never quite at
my ease there i love my boy one jolly hour
with thee and one plain unsophisticated
laughing girls that i meet in this chamber all
smoke dried though it be better than whole nights
 those magnificent debauches
ho mayest thou so tomorrow night please
 gods we will have then a snug carousel
 with all my heart said priest rubbing
his hands and drawing himself nearer to table
at this moment they heard a slight noise at
 door as one feeling handle priest
lowered cowl over his head
tush whispered host it is but 
blind girl as nydia opened door and entered
 apartment
ho girl and how dost thou thou loosest pale
thou hast kept late revels no matter 
young must be always young said burbo
encouragingly
 girl made no answer but she dropped on
one seats with an air lassitude her
 
colour event and came rapidly she beat floor
impatiently with her small feet then she suddenly
raised her face and said with a determined voice 
master you may starve me if you will
you may beat me you may threaten me with
death but i will go no more to that unholy
place
how fool said burbo in a savage voice
and his heavy brows met darkly over his fierce
and bloodshot eyes how rebellious take
care
i have said it said poor girl crossing her
hands on her breast
what my modest one sweet vestal thou
wilt go no more very well thou shalt be carried
i will raise city with my cries said she
passionately and colour mounted to her brow
we will take care that too thou shalt go
gagged
then may gods help me said nydia
rising i will appeal to magistrates
thine oath remember said a hollow voice
as for first time calenus joined in dialogue

pompeii 
at those words a trembling shook frame 
 unfortunate girl she clashed her hands imploringly
 wretch that i am she cried and
burst violently into sobs
whether or not it was sound that vehement
sorrow which brought gentle stratonice
to spot her grisly form at this moment appeared
in chamber
how now what hast thou been doing with
my slave brute said she angrily to burbo
be quiet wife said he in a tone half sullen
half timid you want new girdles and fine clothes
do you well then take care your slave or
you may want them long va capite tuo vengeance
on thy head wretched one 
what is this r said hag looking from
one to other
nydia started as by a sudden impulse from 
wall against which she had leant she threw herself
at feet stratonice she embraced her
knees and looking up at her with those sightless
but touching eyes 
o my mistress sobbed she you are a
woman you have had sisters you have been
 i 
young like me feel for me save me i will go to
those horrible feasts no more
stuff said hag dragging her up rudely
by one those delicate hands fit for no harsher
labour than that weaving flowers which
made her pleasure or her trade stuft'i these fine
scruples are not for slaves
harkye said burbo drawing forth his purse
and chinking its contents you hear this music
wife by pollux if you do not break in yon
colt with a tight rein you will hear it no
more
 girl is tired said stratonice nodding to
calenus she will be more docile when you next
want her
you ou who is here cried nydia casting
her eyes round apartment with so fearful
and straining a survey that calenus rose in alarm
from his seat 
she must see with those eves muttered he
who is here speak in heaven's name 
ah if you were blind like me you would be less
cruel said she and she again burst into tears
pompeii 
take her away said burbo impatiently 
i hate these whisperings
come said stratonice pushing poor child
by shoulders
nydia drew herself aside with an air to wliieli
resolution gave dignity
hear me she said i have served you faithfully
 i who was brought up ah i my mother
my poor mother didst thou dream i should come
to this she dashed tear from her eyes and
proceeded command me in aught else and i
will obey but i tell you now hard stern inexorable
as you are i tell you that i will go there
no more or if i am forced there that i avill implore
 mercy praetor himself i have
said it hear me ye gods i swear 
 hag's eyes glowed with fire she seized
 child by hair with one hand and raised
on high other that formidable right hand
 least blow which seemed capable to crush
 frail and delicate form that trembled in her
grasp that thought itself appeared to strike her
for she suspended blow changed her purpose
k 
 
and dragging nydia to wall seized from a
hook a rope often alas applied to a similar purpose
 and next moment shrill agonized
shrieks blind girl rang piercingly

glaucus makes a purchase that afterwards
costs him hear
hollo my brave fellows said lepidus stooping
his head as he entered low doorway 
house burbo we have come to see avliieh
 you most honor's your lanista gladiators
rose from table in respect to three gallants
known to be among gayest and richest youths
 pompeii and whose voices were therefore 
dispensers amphitheatrical reputation
what fine animals said clodius to glaucus 
worthy to be gladiators
it is a pity they are not warriors returned
glaucus
a singular thing it was to see dainty and
fastidious lepidus whom in a banquet a ray 
daylight seemed to blind whom in bath a
breeze air seemed to blast in whom nature
seemed twisted and perverted from every natural
 
impulse and curdled into one dubious thing 
effeminacy and art a singular thing was it to see
this lepidus now all eagerness and energy and
life patting vast shoulders gladiators with
a blanched and girlish hand feeling with a mincing
gripe their great brawn and iron muscles all lost in
calculating admiration at that manhood which he
had spent his life in carefully banishing from himself
so have we seen at this day beardless flutterers
 saloons london thronging round 
heroes fivescourt so have we seen them admire
and gaze and calculate a bet so have we seen
meet together in ludicrous yet in melancholy assemblage
 two extremes civilized society
 patrons pleasure and its slaves vilest 
all slaves at once ferocious and mercenary male
prostitutes who sell their strength as women their
beauty beasts in act but outdoing beasts in
motive for at least do not mangle themselves
for money 
ha niger how will you fight said lepidus
and with whom
 sporus challenges me said grim giant 
we shall light to death i hoje 
pompeii 
ah to be sure grunted sporus with a
twinkle his small eye
he takes sword i net and trident 
it will be rare sport i hope survivor will
have enough to keep up dignity crown
never fear we fill purse my hector
said clodius let me see you fight against niger 
glaucus a bet i back niger
i told you so cried niger exultingly 
noble clodius knows me count yourself dead already
my sporus
clodius took out his tablet a bet ten sententia
what say you 
so be it said glaucus but whom have we
here i never saw this hero before and he glanced
at lydon whose limbs avere slighter than those
 his companions and who had something giace
and something even noble in his face which his
profession had not yet wholly destroyed
it is lydon a youngster practised only with
 wooden sword as yet answered niger condescendingly
 but he has true blood in him
and has challenged tetraides
a little more tluiii 
 
he challenged ne said lydon i accept 
offer
and how do you fight asked lepidus 
chut my hoy wait a while before you contend
with tetraides lydon smiled disdainfully
is he a citizen or a slave said clodius
a citizen we are all citizens here quoth
niger
stretch out your arm my lydon said lepidus
with air a connoisseur
 gladiator with a significant glance at his
companions extended an arm which if not so huge
in its girth as those his comrades was so firm
in its muscles so beautifully symmetrical in its
proportions that three visitors uttered simultaneously
an admiring exclamation
well man what is your weapon said claudius
tablet in hand
we are to fight first with cestus afterwards
if both survive with swords returned
tetraides sharply and with an envious scowl
with cestus cried glaucus there you
are wrong lydon cestus is greek fashion
 know it well you should have encouraged flesh
pompeii 
for that contest you are far too thin for it avoid
 cestus
i cannot said lydon
and why 
i have said because he has challenged me
but he will not hold you to precise
weapon
my honour holds me i returned lydon proudly
i bet on tetraides two to one at cestus
said clodius shall it be lepidus even betting
with swords
if you give me three to one i will not take 
odds said lepidus lydon will never come to
 swords you are mighty courteous
what say you glaucus said clodius
i will take odds three to one
ten sestertia to thirty 
yes
clodius wrote bet in his 
pardon me noble sponsor mine said lydon
 reader will not confound ses tertii with sestertia
a sestertium which was a sum not a coin was a thousand times
 value a sesterces first was equivalent to in cl
 to id j farthings our money
 
in a low voice to glaucus but how much think
you victor will gain 
how much why perhaps seven sestertia
you are sure it will be as much 
at least but out on you a greek would
have thought honour and not money
oh romans everywhere ye are romans 
a blush mantled over bronzed cheek 
gladiator
do not wrong me noble glaucus i think 
both but i should never have been a gladiator
but for money
base mayest thou fell a miser never was
a hero
i am not a miser said lydon haughtily and
he withdrew to other room
but i don't see burbo where is burbo i
must talk with bm'bo cried clodius
he is within said niger pointing to 
door at extremity room
and stratonice brave old lass where is
she quoth lepidus
hy she was here just before you entered
but she heard something that displeased her yonder
pompeii
and vanished pollux old burbo had perhaps
caught hold some girl in backroom i heard
a female's voice crying out old dame is as jealous
as juno
ho excellent cried lepidus laughing
come clodius let us go shares mith jupiter
perhaps he has caught a leda
at this moment a loud cry pain and terror
startled group
oh spare me spare me i am but a child i
am blind is not that punishment enough 
o pallas i know that voice it is my poor
flower girl exclaimed glaucus and he darted at
once into quarter whence cry rose
he burst door he beheld nydia writhing in
 grasp infuriate hag cord already
dabbled with blood was raised in air it was
suddenly arrested
fury said glaucus and with his left hand
he caught nydia from her grasp how dare ye
use thus a girl one your own sex a child 
my nydia my poor infant 
oh i is that you is that glaucus exclaimed
 flower girl in a tone almost transport 
 
tears stood attested on her cheek she smiled she
ching to his breast she kissed his robe as she chmg
and how dare you pert stranger interfere
between a free woman and her slave bv 
gods despite yom fine tmiie and your filthy perfumes
i doubt whether you are even a roman
citizen my mannikin
fair words mistress fair words said claudius
now entering with lepidus this is my
friend and sworn brother he must be put under
shelter your tongue sweet one it rains stones r
give me my slave shrieked virago placing
her mighty grasp on breast greek
not if all your sister furies could help you
answered glaucus fear not sweet nydia an
athenian never forsook distress 
hollo said burbo rising reluctantly what
turmoil is all this about a slave let go young
gentleman wife let him go for his sake pert
thing shall be spared this once so saying he
drew or rather dragged off his ferocious hcljunate
methought when we entered said clodius
there was another man present
he is gone
pompeii
for priest isis had indeed thought it high
time to vanish
oh a friend mine a brother eupman a
quiet dog who does not love these snarling said
burbo carelessly but go child you vriw tear
 gentleman's tunic if you cling to him so tight 
go you are pardoned
oh do not do not forsake me cried nydia
clinging yet closer to athenian
moved by her forlorn situation her appeal to
him her own innumerable and touching graces
 greek seated himself on one rude chairs
he held her on his knees he wiped blood
from her shoulders with his long hair he kissed
 tears from her cheeks he whispered to her a
thousand those soothing words with which we
calm grief a child and so beautiful did he
seem in his gentle and consoling task that even
 fierce heart stratonice was touched his
presence seemed to shed light over that base and
obscene haunt young beautiful glorious he was
 emblem all that earth made most happy
comforting one that earth had abandoned 
well who could have thought our blind nydia
 
lead been so honoured said virago wiping her
heated brow
glaucus looked up at burbo
my good man said he this is your shive 
she sings well she is accustomed to care 
flowers i wish to make a present such a slave to
a lady will you sell her to me as he spoke
he felt whole frame poor girl tremble
with delight she started up she put her dishevelled
hair from her eyes she looked around as if
alas she had power to see
sell our nydia no indeed said stratonice
gruffly
nydia sank back with a long sigh and again
clasped robe her protector
nonsense said clodius imperiously you
must oblige me what man what old dame 
offend me and your trade is ruined is not burbo
my kinsman pansa's client am i not 
oracle amphitheatre and its heroes if i
say word break up your winejars you sell no

burlo scratched his huge head in evident embarrassment

pompeii 
 girl is worth her weight in goal to me
name your price i am rich said glaucus
 antient italians were like modern there
was nothing they woukl not sell much less a poor
blind girl
i paid six sestertia for her she is worth twelve
now muttered stratonice
you shall have twenty come to magistrates
at once and then to my house for your
money's
i would not have sold dear girl for a hundred
but to oblige noble clodius said burbo
whiningly and you will speak to pansa about
 place designate at amphitheatre noble
clodius it would just suit me
thou shalt have it said clodius adding in a
whisper to burbo yon greek can make your
fortune money runs through him like a sieve 
mark today with white chalk my priam

question sale and barter
dabitiir answered burbo
then then t am to go with you with you

pretty one yes and tliy hardest task henceforth

loveliest lady in pompeii
 girl sprang from his clasp a change came
over her whole face so bright instant before 
she sighed heavily and then once more taking his
hand she said
i thought i was to go to your house

united in highest perfection rarest earthlygifts
 genius and beauty no one ever possessed
superior intellectual qualities without knowing
them alliteration modesty and merit is pretty
enough but where merit is great veil that
modesty you admire never disguises its extent
fi'om its possessor it is proud consciousness
 certain qualities that it cannot reveal to 
everyday world that gives to genius that shy and
reserved and troubled air which puzzles and flatters
you when you encounter it do not deceive yourself
vain worldling by thought that embarrassed
manner yon great man is a sign that
 
he does not know his superiority to you that
which you take for modesty is but struggle 
selfesteem he knows but too oppressively how
immeasurably greater he is than you and is only
disconcerted because in places you encounter
him he finds himself suddenly descended to amour
level he has not conversation he has not
thoughts lie has not intercourse with such as you
it is your littleness that disconcerts him not his

lone then knew her genius but with that
charming versatility that belongs right to
women she had faculty so few a kindred
genius in less malleable sex can claim 
faculty to bend and model her graceful intellect
to all whom it encountered sparkling
fountain threw its waters alike upon strand 
cavern and flowers it refreshed it smiled
it dazzled everywhere that pride which is
 necessary result superiority she wore
easily in her breast it concentred itself in
independence she pursued thus her ovn bright
and solitary path she asked no aged matron to
direct and guide her she walked alone by 
pompeii 
torch her own flickering purity she obeyed
no tyrannical and absolute custom she moulded
custom to her own will but this so delicately and
with so feminine a grace so perfect an exemption
from error that you could not sav she oiitrased
custom but commanded it it was possible not to
love lone perhaps she seemed too high for love
 atilgar natures but if you did once love her
it was to adoration wealth her graces
was inexhaustible she beautified commonest
action a word a look from her seemed maoie
love her and you entered into a new world you
passed from this trite and commonplace earth you
were in a land in which your eyes saw everything
through an enchanted medium in her presence
you felt as if listening to exquisite music you
were steeped in that sentiment which has so little
 earth in it and which music so well aspires 
that intoxication which refines and exalts which
seizes it is true senses but gives them character
 soul
she was peculiarly formed then to command
and fascinate less ordinary and bolder natures
 men to love her was to unite two passions
vol i l
 
that love and ambition you aspired when
you adored her it was no wonder that she had
completely chained and subdued mysterious
but burning soul egyptian a man in
whom dwelt fiercest passions her beauty and
her soul alike enthralled him
sot apart himself from common world he
loved that daringness character which also made
itself among common things aloof and alone he
did not or he would not see that that very isolation
put her yet more from him than from 
tilgar far as poles far as night from
day his solitude was divided from hers he was
solitary from his dark and solemn vices she from
her beautiful fancies and her purity virtue
if it was not strange that lone thus enthralled
 egyptian far less strange was it that she
had captured as suddenly as irrevocably bright
and sunny heart athenian gladness
 a temperament which seemed woven from 
beams light had led glaucus into pleasure he
obeyed no more vicious dictates when he wandered
into dissipations his time than exhilarating
voices youth and health he threw
pompeii 
 brightness his native over every abyss and
cavern through which he strayed his imagination
dazzled him but his heart never was corrupted
far more penetrating than his companions
deemed he saw that they sought to prey upon his
riches and his youth but he despised wealth save
as means enjoyment and youth was 
great sympathy that united him to them he felt
it is true impulse nobler thoughts and
higher aims than in pleasure could be indulged 
but world was one vast prison to which 
sovereign rome was imperial gaoler and

unnatural and bloated civilization all that alas

thus thrown back upon themselves more
ardent qualities glaucus found no vent save in
that overflowing imagination which gave grace to
pleasure and poetry to thought ease was less
despicable than contention with parasites and slaves
and luxury could yet be refined though ambition
could not be ennobled but all that was best and
brightest in his soul woke at once avhen he knew
lone here was an empire worthy demigods
to attain here was a glory which reeking
smoke a foul society could not soil or dim
love in every time in every state can thus find
space for its golden altars and tell me if there
ever even in ages most favourable to glory
could be a triumph more exalted and elating than
 conquest one noble heart 
and whether it was that this sentiment inspired
him his ideas glowed more brightly his soul
 
seemed more awake and more visible in lone's
presence if natural to love lier it was natial
that she should return passion young brilliant
eloquent enamoured and athenian he was
to her as incarnation poetry her
fathers land they were not like creatures a
world in which strife and sorrow are elements 
they were like things to be seen only in holyday
 nature so glorious and so fresh was
their youth their beauty and their love they
seemed out place in harsh and everyday
earth they belonged right to saturnian
age and dreams demigod and nymph it
was as if poetry life gathered and fed itself
in them and in their hearts were concentrated 
 rays sun delos and greece
but if lone was independent in her choice 
life so was her modest pride proportionably vigilant
and easily alarmed falsehood 
egyptian was invented by a deep knowledge 
her nature story coarseness indelicacy
in glaucus stung her to quick she felt it a
reproach upon her character and her career a punishment
above all to her love she felt for 
pompeii 
first time how suddenly she had yielded to that
love she blushed with shame at a weakness 
extent which she was startled to perceive she
imagined it was that weakness which had incurred
 contempt glaucus she endured bitterest
curse noble natures humiliation yet her
love perhaps was no less alarmed than her pride
if one moment she murmured reproaches upon
glaucus if one moment she renounced she almost
hated him at next she burst into passionate
tears her heart yielded to its softness and she said
in bitterness anguish he despises me he
does not love me 
from hour egyptian had left her she
had retired to her most secluded chamber she
had shut out her handmaids she had denied
herself to crowds that besieged her door
glaucus was excluded with rest he wondered
but he guessed not why he never attributed
to his lone his queen his goddess that
womanlike caprice which lovepoets italy
so unceasingly complain he imagined her in 
majesty her candour above all arts that
torture he was troubled but his hopes avere not
 
dimmed for he knew already that he loved and
was beloved vhat more could he desire as an
amulet against fear 
at deepest night then when streets were
hushed and high moon only beheld his devotions
he stole to that temple his heart her home and
wooed her after beautiful fashion his country
he covered her threshold with richest
garlands in which every flower was a volume 
sweet passion and he charmed long summer
night with sound lycian lute and
verses which inspiration moment sufficed
to weave
but window above opened not no smile
made yet more holy shining air night all
was still and dark he knew not if his verse was
welcome and his suit was heard
yet lone slept not nor disdained to hear those
soft strains ascended to her chamber they soothed
they subdued her while she listened she believed
nothing against her lover but when they
avere stilled at and his step departed 
 atlienspiis true temple cupid is house 
beloved one
pompeii 
spell ceased and in bitterness her soul
she almost conceived in that delicate flattery a
ncav affront
i said she was denied to all but there was one
exception there was one person who would not
be denied assuming over her actions and her house
something like authority a parent arbaces
for himself claimed an exemption from all 
ceremonies observed by others he entered 
threshold with licence one who feels that he
is privileged and at home he made his way to
her solitude and with that sort quiet and
apologetic air which seemed to consider 
right as a thing course with all independence
 lone's character his art had enabled him
to obtain a secret and powerful control over her
mind she could not shake it off sometimes lie
desired to do so but she never actively struggled
against it she was fascinated by his serpent eye
he arrested he commanded her by magic 
a mind long accustomed to awe and to subdue
utterly unaware his real character or his hidden
love she felt for him reverence which
genius feels for wisdom and virtue for sanctity
l 
 
she regarded him as one those mighty sages 
oil who attained to mysteries knowledge
by an exemption from passions their kind
she scarcely considered him as a being like herself
 earth but as an oracle at once dark and
sacred she did not love him but she feared
his presence alas unwelcome to her it dimmed
her spirit even in its brightest mood he seemed
with his chilling and lofty aspect like some eminence
which casts a shadow over sun but she
never thought forbidding his visits she was
passive under influence which created in her
breast not repugnance but something 
stillness terror
arbaces himself now resolved to exert all
his arts to possess himself that treasure he
so burning coveted he was cheered and
elated by his conquest over her brother from
 hour in which aacides fell beneath 
voluptuous sorcery that fete which we
have described he felt his empire over 
young priest triumphant and ensured he
knew that there is no victim so thoroughly
subdued ass a young and fervent man for 
pompeii 
first time delivered to thraldom 
senses
when apaecides recovered with morninglight
from profound sleep which succeeded to
 delirium wonder and please he was it is
true ashamed terrified appalled his vows 
austerity and celibacy echoed in his ear his thirst
after holiness had it been quenched at so unhallowed
a stream but arbaces knew well means
by which to confirm his conquest from arts
 pleasure he led young priest at once to
those his mysterious wisdom he bared to his
amazed eyes initiatory secrets sombre
philosophy nile those secrets plucked from
 stars and wild chemistry which in those
 when reason herself was but creature 
imagination might well pass for lore a
diviner magic he seemed to young eyes 
 priest as a being above mortality and endowed
with supernatural gifts that yearning
and intense desire for knowledge which is
not earth which had burnt from his boyhood
in heart priest was dazzled
until it confused and mastered his clearer
 
sense he gave himself to art which thus
addressed at once two strongest human
passions that pleasure and that knowledge
he was loth to believe that one so wise
could err that one so lofty could stoop to
deceive entangled in dark web metaphysical
moralities he caught at excuse by which
 egyptian converted vice into a virtue his
pride was insensibly flattered that arbaces had
deigned to rank him with himself to set him
apart from laws which bound vulgar to
make him an august participator both in 
mystic studies and magic fascinations his
solitude pure and stern lessons that creed
to which olinthus had sought to make him convert
were swept away from his memory by 
deluge new passions and egyptian who
was versed in articles that true faith and
who soon learned from his pupil effect which
had been produced upon him by its believers
sought not unskilfully to undo that effect by a
tone reasoning half sarcastic and half earnest
this faith said he is but a borrowed plagiarism
from one many allegories invented by
pompeii 
our priests old observe he added pointing to
a hieroglyphical scroll observe in these antient
figures origin christian's trinity here
are also three gods deity spirit and
 son observe that epithet son is
saviour observe that sign by which his
human qualities are denoted is cross note
here too mystic history osiris how he put
on death how he lay in grave and how thus
fulfilling a solemn atonement he rose again from
 dead in these stories we but design to
paint an allegory from operations nature
and evolutions eternal heavens but
 allegory unknown types themselves have
furnished to credulous nations materials 
many creeds they have travelled to vast
plains india they have mixed themselves up
in visionary speculations greek becoming
more and more gross and embodied as they
emerge farther from shadows their antique
origin they have assumed human and palpable
form in this novel faith and believers 
 believer will draw from this vague coincidence a very
different corollary than that egyptian
 
galilee are but unconscious repeaters one 
 superstitions nile 
this was argument which completely
subdued priest it was necessary to him as to
full to believe in something and undivided
and at reluctant he surrendered himself
to that belief which arbaces inculcated and which
all that was human in passion all that was flattering
in vanity all that was alluring in pleasure 
served to invite to and contributed to confirm
this conquest thus easily made egyptian
could now give himself wholly up to pursuit 
a far dearer and mightier object and he hailed
in his success with brother an omen his
triumph over sister
he had seen lone on day following revel
we have witnessed and which was also day
after he had poisoned her mind against his rival
 next day and next he saw her also and
each time he laid himself out with consummate
art partly to confirm her impression against glaucus
and principally to prepare her for impressions
he desired her to receive proud lone took
care to conceal anguish she endured and 
pompeii 
pride woman has an hypocrisy which can deceive
 most penetrating and shame most
astute but arbaces was no less cautious not to
recur to a subject which he felt it was most politic
to treat as lightest importance he knew
that by dwelling much upon fault a rival
you only give him dignity in eyes your mistress
 wisest plan is neither loudly to hate
nor bitterly to contemn wisest plan is to
lower him by an indifference tone as if you
could not dream that he could be loved your
safety is in concealing wound to your own
pride and imperceptibly alarming that umpire
avhose voice is fate such in all times will
be policy one who knows science 
sex it was now egyptian's
he recurred no more then to presumption
 glaucus he mentioned his name but
not more often than that clodius or lepidus
he affected to class them together as things 
a low and ephemeral species as things wanting
nothing butterfly save its innocence and its
grace sometimes he slightly alluded to some
invented debauch in which he declared them com
 
passions sometimes he reverted to them as 
antipodes those lofty and spiritual natures to
whose order that lone belonged blinded alike
by pride lone and perhaps by his own he
dreamed not that she already loved but he dreaded
lest she might have formed for glaucus first
fluttering prepossessions that lead to love and
secretly he ground his teeth in rage and jealousy
when he reflected on youth fascinations
and brilliancy that formidable rival he pretended
to undervalue
it was on fourth day from date 
close previous that arbaccs and lone
sate together
you wear your veil at home said egyptian
 that is not fair to those whom you honour
with your friendships
but to arbaces answered lone who indeed
had cast veil over her features to conceal eyes
red with weeping to arbaces who looks only
to mindwhat matters it that face is concealed

i do look only to mind replied egypt

tian show me then your face for there i shall
see it 
you grow gallant in air pompeii said
lone with a forced tone gaiety
do you think fair lone that it is only at
pompeii that i have learned to value you 
egyptian's voice trembled he paused for a moment
and then resumed
there is a love beautiful greek which is
not love only thoughtless and young 
there is a love which sees not with eyes which
hears not with ears but in which soul is
enamoured soul comitesman thy ancestors
 cavenursed plato dreamed such
a love his followers have sought to imitate it 
but it is a love that is not for herd to echo it
is a love that only high and noble natures can conceive
 it hath nothing in common with sympathies
and ties coarse affection wrinkles do
not revolt it homeliness feature does not
deter it asks youth it is true but it asks it only
in freshness emotions it asks beauty it
is true but it is beauty thought and 
 lear 
 spirit such is love o lone which is a
worthy offering to thee from cold and 
austere austere and cold thou deepest me 
such is love that i venture to lay upon thy
shrine thou canst receive it without a blush
and its name is friendship v replied lone 
her answer was innocent yet it sounded like 
reproof one conscious design speaker
friendship said arbaces vehemently no
that is a word too often profaned to apply to a
sentiment so sacred friendship it is a tie that
binds fools and profligates friendship it is 
bond that unites frivolous hearts a glaucus
and a clodius friendship i no that is an affection
 earth vulgar habits and sordid sympathies
 feeling which i speak is borrowed
from stars it partakes that mystic and ineffable
yearning which we feel when we gaze on
them it burns yet it purifies it is lamp 
naphtha in alabaster vase glowing with fragrant
odours but shining only through purest
vessels no it is not love and it is not friendship
that arbaces feels for lone give it no
plato
pompeii so
name earth has no name for it it is not 
earth why debase it with earthly epithets and
earthly associations
never before had arbaces ventured so far yet
he felt his ground step by step he knew that he
uttered a language which if at this day affected
platonism would speak unequivocally to ears
 beauty was at that time strange and unfamiliar
to which no precise idea could be attached from
which he could imperceptibly advance or recede
as occasion suited as hope encouraged or fear
deterred lone trembled though she knew not
why her veil hid her features and masked an
expression which if seen by egyptian would
have at once damped and enraged him in fact he
never meas more displeasing to her harmonious
modulation most suasive voice that ever disguised
unhallowed thought fell discordantly on
her ear her whole soul was still filled with 
image glaucus and accent tenderness
from another only revolted and dismayed yet
she did not conceive that any passion more ardent
than that platonism which arbaces expressed
kicked beneath his words she thought that he
 
in truth spoke only affection and sympathy
 soul but was it not precisely that affection
and that sympathy which had made a part those
emotions she felt for glaucus and could any other
footstep than his approach haunted actus 
her heart
anxious at once to change conversation she
replied therefore with a cold and indifferent
voice whomsoever arbaces honours with 
sentiments esteem it is natural that his elevated
wisdom should colour that sentiment with its own
hues it is natural that his friendship should be
purer than that others whose pursuits and errors
he does not deign to share but tell me arbaces
hast thou seen my brother late he has not
visited me for several and when i saw
him his manner disturbed and alarmed me much 
i fear lest he was too precipitate in severe
choice that he has adopted and that he repents an
irrevocable step
be cheered lone replied egyptian it
is true that some little time since he was troubled
and sad spirit those doubts beset him which
were likely to haunt one that fervent 

pompeii 
rament which ever ebbs and flows and vibrates
between excitement and exhaustion but ac lone
he came to me in his anxieties and his distress 
he sought one who pitied and loved him i have
called his mind i have removed his doubts i
have taken him from threshold wisdom into
its temple and before majesty goddess
his soul is hushed and soothed fear not he will
repent no more they who trust themselves to arfaces
never repent but for a moment
you rejoice me answered lone my dear
brother in his contentment i am happy
 conversation then turned upon lighter subjects
 egyptian exerted himself to please he
condescended even to entertain vast variety
 his knowledge enabled him to adorn and light
up every subject on which he touched and lone
forgetting displeasing effect his former ords
was carried away despite her sadness by 
magic his intellect her manner became unrestrained
and her language fluent and arbaces
who had waited his opportunity now hastened to
seize it
 you have never seen said he interior
 
 my home it may amuse you to do so it contains
some rooms that may explain to you what you
have often asked me to describe fashion 
an egyptian house not indeed that you will perceive
in poor and minute proportions roman
architecture massive strength vast space
 gigantic magnificence or even domestic
construction palaces thebes and memphis
 but something there is here and there that
may serve to express to you some notion that
antique civilization which has humanized world
devote then to austere friend your youth
one these bright summer evenings and let me
boast that my gloomy mansion has been honoured
with presence admired lone
unconscious pollutions mansion 
 danger that awaited her lone readily assented
to proposal next evening was
fixed for visit and egyptian with a
serene countenance and a heart beating with fierce
and unholy joy departed scarce had he gone
when another visiter claimed admission but now
we return to glaucus
pompeii 
chapter v
 poor tortoise new changes for lydia
 morning sun shone over small and
odorous garden enclosed within peristyle 
 house athenian he lay reclined sad
and listlessly on smooth giass which intersected
 viridarium and a slight canopy stretched
above broke fierce rays summer sun
when that fairy mansion was first disinterred
from earth they found in garden shell 
a tortoise that had been its inmate that animal
so strange a link in creation to whom nature
seems to have denied all pleasures life save
 i do not know whether it be sill preserved i hope so but
 shell a tortoise was found in house appropriated in
this work to glaucus
 
lifers passive and dreamlike perception had been 
guest place for years before glaucus purchased
it for years indeed which went beyond 
memory man and to which tradition assigned
an almost incredible date house had been
built and rebuilt its possessors had changed and
fluctuated generations had flourished and decayed
 and still tortoise dragged on its slow and
unsjinpathizing existence in earthquake
which sixteen years before had overthrown many
 public buildings city and scared
away amazed inhabitants house now inhabited
by glaucus had been terribly shattered
 possessors deserted it for many 
on their return they cleared away ruins which
encumbered viridarium and found still 
tortoise unharmed and unconscious surrounding
destruction it seemed to bear a charmed
life in its languid blood and imperceptible
motions yet was it not so inactive as it seemed 
it held a regular and monotonous course inch by
inch it traversed little orbit its domain
taking months to accomplish whole gyration
it was a restless voyager that tortoise patiently
pompeii 
and with pain did it perform its selfappointed
journeys evincing no interest in things
around it a philosopher concentred in itself
there was something grand in its solitary
selfishness sun in which it basked 
waters poured daily over it air which it
insensibly inhaled were its sole and unfailing
luxuries mild changes season in
that lovely clime affected it not it covered itself
with its shell as saint in his piety as 
sage in his wisdom as lover in his hope
it was impetuous to shocks and mutations
 time it was an emblem time itself slow 
regalar perpetual emitting passions that
fret themselves around wear and tear 
mortality poor tortoise nothing less than
 bursting volcanoes convulsions 
riven world could have quenched its sluggish
spark inexorable death that spared not
pomp or beauty passed unfeelingly by a thing
to which death could bring so insignificant a
change
for this animal mercurial and vivid greek
felt all wonder and affection contrast he
vol i m
 
could spend hours in surveying its creeping progress
in moralizing over its mechanism he
despised it in joy he envied it in sorrow
regarding it now as he lay along sward
its dull mass moving while it seemed motionless
 athenian murmured to himself 
 eagle dropped a stone from his talons
thinking to break thy shell stone crushed 
head a poet this is allegory fate 
dull thing thou hadst a father and a mother 
perhaps ages ago thou thyself hadst a mate
did thy parents love or didst thou did thy
slow blood circulate more gladly when thou didst
creep to side thy wedded one wert thou
capable affection could it distress thee if she
was away from thy side couldst thou feel
when shewas present what would i not give
to know history thy mailed breast to gaze
upon mechanism thy faint desires to mark
what hairbreadth difference separates thy sorrow
from thy joy yet methinks thou wouldst
know if lone were present thou wouldst feel her
coming like a happier air like a gladder sun i
envy thee now for thou knowest not that she is
pompeii 
absent and i would i could be like thee between
 intervals seeing her what doubt
what presentiment haunts me why avill she not
admit me have passed since i heard her
voice for first time life grows flat to me
i am as one who is left alone at a banquet 
lights dead and flowers faded ah lone
couldst thou dibeam how i adore thee 
from these enamoured reveries glaucus was
interrupted by entrance nydia she came
with her light though cautious step along 
marble tablinum she passed portico and
paused at flowers which bordered garden
she had her watervase in her hand and she
sprinkled thirsting plants which seemed to
brighten at her approach she bent to inhale
their odour she touched them timidly and caressingly
she felt along their stems if any withered
leaf or creeping insect marred their beauty
and as she hovered from flower to flower with
her earnest and youthful countenance and graceful
motions you could not have imagined a fitter
handmaid for goddess garden
nydia my child said glaucus
m 
 
at sound his voice she paused at once 
hastening blushing breathless with her lips parted
her face upturned to catch direction 
sound she laid down vase she hastened to
him and wonderful it was to see how unerringly
she threaded her dark way through flowers
and came by shortest path to side her
new lord
nydia said glaucus tenderly stroking back
her long and beautiful hair 
it is now three since thou hast been
under protection my household gods have
they smiled on thee art thou happy 
ah so happy sighed slave
and now continued glaucus that thou
hast recovered somewhat from hateful recollections
 thy former state and now that they
have fitted thee touching her broidered tunic
with garments more meet for thy delicate shape 
and now sweet child that thou hast accustomed
thyself to a happiness which may gods grant
thee ever i am about to pray at thy hands a boon
oil what can i do for thee said nydia clasping
her hands
pompeii 
listen said glaucus and young as thou art
thou shalt be my confidant hast thou ever heard
 name lone 
 blind girl gasped for breath and turning
pale as one statues which shone upon them
from peristyle she answered with an effort
and after a moment's pause 
yes i have heard that she is neapolis and
beautiful
 beautiful her beauty is a thing to dazzle 
day neapolis nay she is greek by origin greece
only could furnish forth such shapes nydia i
love her 
i thought so replied nydia calmly
i love and thou shalt tell her so i am about
to send thee to her happy nydia thou wilt be
in her chamber thou wilt drink music her
voice thou wilt bask in sunny air her
presence 
what what i wilt thou then send me from
thee r
thou wilt go to lone answered glaucus ina
tone that said what more canst thou desire v
nydia bmst into tears
 
glaucus raising himself drew her towards him
with soothing caresses a brother
my child my nydia thou deepest in ignorance
 happiness i bestow on thee she is
gentle and kind and soft as breeze spring
she will be a sister to thy youth she will appreciate
thy winning talents she will loae thy simple
graces as none other could for they are like her
own deepest thou still fond fool i will not
force thee sweet wilt thou not do for me this
kindness 
well if i can serve thee command see i
weep no longer i am calm
that is my own nydia continued glaucus
kissing her hand go then to her if thou art
disappointed in her kindness if i have deceived
thee return when thou wilt i do not give thee
to another i but lend my home ever be thy
refuge sweet one ah would it could shelter all
 friendless and distressed but if my heart whispers
truly i shall claim thee again soon my child
my home and lone's will become same and
thou shalt dwell with both
a shiver jasscd through slight frame 
pompeii 
 blind girl but she wept no more she was
resigned
go then my nydia to tone's house they
shall show thee way take her fairest
flowers thou canst pluck vase which contains
them i will give thee thou must excuse its unworthiness
they shall take too with thee lute
that i gave thee yesterday and from which thou
knowest so well to awaken charming spirit
thou shalt give her also this letter in which after
a mitred efforts i have embodied something 
my thoughts let thy ear catch every accent 
every modulation her voice and tell me when
we meet again if its music should flatter me or
discourage it is now nydia some since i
have been admitted to lone there is somethingmysterious
in this exclusion i am distracted with
doubts and fears learn for thou art quick and
 thy care for me will sharpen tenfold thy acuteness 
learn cause this unkindness speak me as
often as thou canst let my name come ever to thy
lips insinuate how i love rather than proclaim
it watch if she sighs while thou speaks if she
answer thee or if she reprove in what accents she
 
reproves be my friend plead for me and oh 
how vastly wilt thou overpay little i have
done for thee thou comprehended nydia thou
art yet a child have i said more than thou
canst understand 
no
and thou wilt serve me 
yes
joie to me vhen thou hast gathered 
flowers and i will give thee vase i spake 
seek me in chamber leda pretty one thou
dost not grieve now
glaucus i am a slave what business have i
with grief or joy 
say est thou so no nydia be free i give
thee freedom enjoy it as thou wilt and pardon
me that i reckoned on thy desire to serve me
you are offended oh i would not for that
ahich no freedom can give offend you glaucus 
my guardian my saviour my protector forgive
 poor blind girl she does not grieve even in
leaving thee if she can contribute to thy happiness
may gods bless this grateful heart said
glaucus greatly moved and unconscious 
pompeii 
fiies he excited he repeatedly kissed her forehead

thou forgives me said she and thou wilt
talk no more freedom my happiness is to be
thy slave thou hast promised thou wilt not give
me to another 
i have promised
and now then i will gather flowers
silently nydia took from hand glaucus
 costly and jewelled vase in which flowers
vied with each other in hue and fragrance tearlessly
she received his parting admonition she
paused for a moment when his voice ceased she
did not trust herself to reply she sought his
hand she raised it to her lips dropped her veil
over her face and passed at once from his presence
she paused again as she reached threshold 
she stretched her hands towards it and murmured
three happy unspeakable delight
have i known since i passed thee blessed threshold
i may peace dwell ever with thee when i am
gone and now my heart tears itself from thee
and only sound it utters bids me die

chapter vi
 happy beauty and blind slave
a slave entered chamber lone a messenger
from glaucus desired to be admitted
lone hesitated an instant
she is bund that messenger said slave 
she will do her commission to none but thee
base is that heart which does not respect affliction
 moment she heard messenger was
wind lone felt impossibility returning a
chilling reply glaucus had chosen a herald that
was indeed sacred a herald that could not be
denied
what can he want with me what message can
he send and heart lone beat quick 
curtain across door was withdrawn a soft and
pompeii 
eclioless step fell upon marble and nydia
led by one attendants entered with her precious
gift
she stood still a moment as if listening for some
sound that might direct her
will noble lone said she in a soft and
low voice deign to speak that i may know
whither to steer these benighted steps and that i
may lay my offerings at her feet 
fair child said lone touched and soothingly
give not thyself pain to cross these slippery
floors my attendant will bring to me what thou
hast to present and she motioned to handmaid
to take vase
i may give them to none but thee answered
nydia and guided by her ear she walked slowly
to place where lone sate and kneeling when
she came before her proffered vase
lone took it from her hand and placed it on 
table at her side she then raised her gently and
would have seated her on couch but girl
modestly resisted
 have not yet discharged my office said she
 
and she drew letter glaucus from her vest
this will perhaps explain why he who sent me
chose so unworthy a messenger to lone
 greek took letter with a hand 
trembling which nydia at once felt and sighed
to feel with folded arms and downcast looks she
stood before proud and stately form lone 
no less proud perhaps in her attitude submission
lone waved her hand and attendants
withdrew she gazed again upon form 
young slave in surprise and beautiful compassion 
then retiring a little from her she opened and
read following letter 
glaucus to lone sends more than he dares to
utter is lone ill tliy slaves tell me no and
that assurance comforts me has glaucus offended
lone ah that question i may not ask from
them for five i have been banished from
thy presence has sun shone i know it not 
has sky smiled it has had no smile for me
my sun and my sky are lone do i ostend thee 
am i too bold do i say that on tak't
which my tongue has hesitated to breathe alas 
it is in thine absence that i feel most 
pompeii
spells by which thou hast subdued me and absence
that deprives me joy brings me courage
thou wilt not see me thou hast banished also 
common flatterers that flock around thee canst
thou confound me with them it is not possible 
thou knowest too well that i am not them 
that their clay is not mine for even were i 
 humblest mould fragrance rose has
penetrated me and spirit thy nature hath
passed within me to embalm to sanctify to inspire
have they slandered me to thee lone 
thou wilt not believe them did delphic
oracle itself tell me thou wert unworthy i would
not believe it and am i less incredulous than
thou i think time we met 
song which i sang to thee look that thou
gayest me in return disguise it as thou wilt
lone there is something kindred between us and
our eyes acknowledged it though our lips were
silent deign to see me to listen to me and
after that exclude me if thou wilt i meant not

 greek flora
 op
it seemed to lone as she read this letter as if a
mist had fallen from her eyes what had been 
supposed offence glaucus that he had not
really loved and now plainly and in no dubious
terms he confessed that love from that moment
his power was fully restored at every tender
word in that letter so full romantic and trustful
passion her heart smote her and had she doubted
his faith and had she believed another and had she
not at least allowed to him culprit's right to
know his crime to plead in his defence tears
rolled down iior cheeks she kissed letter she
placed it in her bosom and turning to nydia who
stood in same place and in same posture 
wilt thou sit my child said she while i
write an answer to this letter 
you will answer it then said nydia coldly 
well slave that accompanied me will take
back your answer
for you said lone stay with me trust
me your service shall be light
nydia bowed her head
what is your name fair girl 
 they call me nydia
pompeii 
your country
 land olpupiis thessaly
thou shalt be to me a friends said lone
caressingly as thou art ahlady half a countrywoman
meanwhile i beseech thee stand not on
these cold and glassy marbles there now thou
art seated i can leave thee for an instant
lone to glaucus greeting come to me glaucus
wrote lone come to me tomorrow i
may have been unjust to thee but i will tell thee
at least faiilt that has been imputed to thy
charge fear not henceforth egyptian fear
none thou mayest thou hast expressed too much
alas in these hasty words i have already
done so farewell 
as lone reappeared with letter which she
did not dare to read after she had written ah 
common rashness common timidity love i 
nydia started from her seat
you have written to glaucus 
i have
and will he thank raessenwr who gives
to him thy letter 
lone forgot that her companion was blind she
 
blushed from brow to neck and remained
silent
i mean this added nydia in a calmer tone 
 lightest word coldness from thee will sadden
him lightest kindness will rejoice if it
be first let slave take back thine answer
 if it be let me i will return this
evening
and why nydia asked lone evasively
wouldst thou be bearer my letter p
 it is so then said nydia ah how could
it be otherwise who could be unkind to glaucus
my child said lone a little more reservedly
than before thou speaks warmly glaucus
then is amiable in thine eyes 
noble lone glaucus has been that to me which
neither fortune nor gods have been a friend t
 sadness mingled with dignity with which
nydia uttered these simple words affected 
beautiful lone she bent down and kissed her
thou art grateful and deservedly so why should
i blush to say that glaucus is worthy thy gratitude
 go my nydia take to him thyself this
letter but return again if i am from home
pompeii 
when thou returned as this evening perhaps i
shall be thy chamber shall be prepared next my
own nydia i have no sister wilt thou be one
to me
 thessalian kissed hand lone and
then said with some embarrassment
one favour fair lone may i dare to ask it 
thou canst not ask what i will not grant
replied neapolitan
they tell me said nydia that you are
beautiful beyond loveliness earth alas i
cannot see that which gladdens world wilt
thou suffer me then to pass my hand over thy face 
that is my sole criterion beauty and i usually
guess aright
she did not wait for answer lone but
as she spoke gently and slowly passed her handover
 bending and half averted features 
 greek features which but one image in 
world can yet depicture and recall that image is
 mutilated but all wondrous statue in her native
city her own neapolis that parian face before
which all beauty florentine venus
is poor and earthly that aspect so full 
 
mony youth genius soul which
modern speculators have supposed representation
 psyche
her touch lingered over braided hair and
polished brow over downy and damask cheek
over dimpled lip swanlike and whitest
neck i know now that thou art beautiful
she said and i can picture thee to my darkness
henceforth and for ever 
when nydia left her lone sank into a deep
but delicious reverie glaucus then loved her he
owned it yes he loved her she drew forth again
that dear confession she paused over every word
she kissed every line she did not ask why he had
been maligned she only felt assured that he had
been so she wondered how she had ever believed
a syllable against him she wondered how 
egyptian had been enabled to exercise a power
against glaucus she felt a chill creep over her as
she again turned to his warning against arbaces
and her secret fear that gloomy being dark
 wonderful remains statue so called in muse
borhonico face for sentiment and for feature is most
beautiful all which antient sculpture has bequeathed to us
pompeii 
ened into awe she was awakened from these
thoughts by her maidens who came to announce to
her that hour appointed to visit arbaees was
arrived she started she had forgotten promise
her first impression was to renounce it her second
was to laugh at her own fears her eldest surviving
friend she hastened to add usual ornaments
to her dress and doubtful whether she
should yet question egyptian more closely with
respect to his accusation glaucus or whether
she should wait till without citing authority
she should insinuate to glaucus accusation itself
she took her way to gloomy mansion 
arbaees
 
chapter vii
lone entrapped mouse tries to gnaw net
o dearest nydia exclaimed glaucus as he
read letter lone whitestrobed messenger
that ever passed between earth and heaven how
how shall i thank thee 
i am rewarded said poor thessalian
tomorrow tomorrow how shall i while 
hours till then 
 enamoured greek would not let njxlia
escape him though she sought several times to
leave chamber he made her recite to him over
and over again every syllable brief conversation
that had taken place between her and lone a
thousand times forgetting her misfortune he questioned
her looks countenance his
pompeii 
beloved and then quickly again excusing his fault
he bade her recommence whole recital which he
had thus interrupted hours thus painful to
nydia passed rapidly and delightedly to him and
 twilight had already darkened ere he once more
dismissed her to lone with a fresh letter and with
new flowers scarcely had she gone than clodius
and several his gay companions broke in upon
him they rallied him on his seclusion during 
whole daw and his absence from his customary
haunts they invited him to accompany them to
 various resorts in that lively city which night
and day proffered diversity to pleasure then as
now in south for no land perhaps losing more
 greatness has retained more custom it was
 delight italians to assemble at evening
 and under porticos temples or shade
 groves that interspersed streets listening
to music or recitals some inventive taleteller
 they hailed rising moon with libations 
wine and melodies song glaucus was too
happy to be unsocial he longed to cast off exuberance
 joy that oppressed him he willingly
accepted proposal his comrades and laughed
 
ingle they sallied out together down populous
and glittering streets
in mean time nvdia once more gained 
house lone who had long left it she inquired
indifferently whither she had sone
 answer arrested and appalled her
to house arbaces egyptian
impossible 
it is true my little one said slave who
had replied to her question she has known 
egyptian long
long ye gods yet glaucus loves her murmured
nydia to herself and has asked she
aloud has she often visited him before 
never till now answered slave if all
 rumoured scandal pompeii be true it would
 better perhaps if she had not ventured thereat
present but she poor mistress mine hears
nothing that which reaches us talk 
 vestibulum reaches not to peristyle
never till now repeated nydia art thou
sure r
sure pretty one but what is that to thee or
to us 
terence
pompeii 
nydia hesitated a moment and then pntthig
down flowers with which she had been charged
she called to slave who had accompanied her
and left house without saying another word
not till she had got halfway back to house
 glaucus did she break silence and even then she
only immured inly 
she does not dream she cannot dangers
into which she has plunged fool that i am shall
i save her yes for i love glaucus better than
myself
when she arrived at house athenian
she learnt that he had gone out with a party 
ills friends and none knew whither he probably
would not be home before midnight
 thessalian groaned she sank upon a seat in
 hall and covered her face with her hands as if
to collect her thoughts there is no time to be
lost thought she starting up she turned to 
slave who had accompanied her
knowest thou said she if lone has any
relative any intimate friend at pompeii 
why by jupiter answered slave art
thou silly enough to ask question every one
vol i n
 
in pompeii knows that lone has a brother who
young and rich has been under rose i speak
so foolish as to become a priest isis
a priest isis o gods his name 
apaecides
i know it all muttered nydia brother and
sister then are to be both victims apaecides yes
that was name i heard in ha he well
then knoavs peril that surrounds his sister i
will to him
she sprang up at that thought and taking 
staff which always guided her steps she hastened to
 neighbouring shrine isle till she had been
under guardianship kindly greek that
staff had sufficed to conduct poor blind girl
from corner to corner pompeii every street
every turning in more frequented parts was
familiar to her and as inhabitants entertained
a tender and half superstitious veneration for those
subject to her infirmity passengers had always
given way to lier timid steps poor girl she little
dreamt that she should ere very many were
passed find her blindness her protection and a
guide far safer than keenest eyes
pompeii 
but since she had been under roof glaucus
he had ordered a slave to accompany her always
 and poor devil thus appointed who was
somewhat fattest and who after having
twice performed journey to lone's house now
saw himself condemned to a third excursion
whither gods only knew hastened after her
deploring his fate and solemnly assuring castor
and pollux that he believed blind girl had 
talaria mercury as well as infirmity cupid
nydia however required but little his assistance
to find her way to popular temple isis 
 space before it was now deserted and she won
without obstacle to sacred rails
there is no one here said fat slave 
what dost thou want or whom knowest thou
not that priests do not live in temple 
call out said she impatiently night and day
there is always one flamen at least watching in
 shrines isis
 slave called no one appeared
seest thou no one 
no one
thou mistakes i hear a sigh look again
n 
 
 slave wondering and grumbling cast counties
heavy eyes and before one altars whose
remains still crowd narrow space he beheld a
form bending as in meditation
i see a figure said he and by white
garments it is a priest
o flamen isis cried nydia servant 
 most ancient hear me 
 who calls f said a low and melancholy voice
one who has no common tidings to impart to
a member your body i come to declare and not
to ask oracles
with whom wouldst thou confer this is no
hour for thy conference depart disturb me not 
 night is sacred to gods day to men
methinks i know thy voice thou art he whom
i seek yet i have heard thee speak but once
before art thou not priest apaecides
i am that man replied priest emerging
from altar and approaching rail
thou art gods be praised having her
hand to slave she bade him withdraw to a distance
and he who naturally imagined some superstition
connected perhaps with safety lone
pompeii 
could alone lead her to temple obeyed and
seated himself on gromid at a little distance
hush said she speaking quick and low art
thou indeed apaecides 
if thou knowest me canst thou not recall my
features 
i am blind answered nydia my eyes are
in my voice and that recognises thee yet swear
that thou art he
by gods i swear it by my right hand and
by moon
hush speak low bend near give me thy
hand knowest thou arbaces hast thou laid
flowers at feet dead ah thy hand
ig cold hark yet hast thou taken awful
vow r
who art thou whence comest thou pale maiden
 said apaecides fearfully i know thee not
thine is not breast on which this head hath
lain i have never seen thee before
but thou hast heard my voice no matter
those recollections it should shame us both to recall
listen thou hast a sister
speak speak i what her 
 
thou knowest banquets dead
stranger it pleases thee perhaps to share them 
would it please thee to have thy sister a partaker 
would it please thee that arbaees was her host p
o gods he dare not girl if thou pocket
me tremble i will tear thee limb from limb
i speak truth and awhile i speak lone is
in halls arbaees for first time his
guest thou knowest if there be peril in that
first time farewell i have fulfilled my charge
stay stay cried priest passing his wan
hand over his brow if this be true what what
can be done to save her they may not admit
me i know not all mazes that intricate
mansion o nemesis justly am i punished 
i will dismiss yon slave be thou my guide and
comrade i will lead thee to private door 
house i will whisper to thee word which admits
take some weapon it may be needful 
wait an instant said apaecides retiring into
one cells that flank temple and reappearing
in a few moments wrapped in a large cloak
avliich was then much worn by all classes and
ahich concealed his sacred dress now he
pompeii 
said grinding his teeth if graces hath dared
to but he dare not he dare not why should
i suspect him is he so base a villain i will
not think it yet sophist dark bewildered that
he is o gods protect hush are there gods 
yes there is one goddess at least whose voice
i can command and that is vengeance 
muttering these disconnected thoughts apsecides
followed by his silent and sightless companion
hastened through most solitary paths
to house egyptian
 slave abruptly dismissed by nydia 
shrugged his shoulders muttered an adjuration
and nothing loth rolled off to his cubiculum
 
chapter viii
 solitude and soliloquy egyptian 
his character analysed
we must go back a few hours in progress
 our story at first grey dawn day
which glaucus had already marked with avhite
 egyptian was seated sleepless and alone on
 summit lofty and pyramidal tower which
flanked his house a tall parapet around it served
as a wall and conspired with height 
edifice and gloomy trees that girded mansion
to defy prying eyes curiosity or observation
a table on which lay a scroll filled with mystic
figures was before him on high stars waxed
dim and faint and shades night melted from
 sterile mountain tops only above vesuvius there
rested a deep and massy cloud which for several
 past had gathered darker and more solid over
pompeii 
its summit struggle night and day was
more visible over broad ocean which stretched
calm like a gigantic lake and bounded by 
circling shores that covered with vines and foliage
and gleaming here and there with white walls 
sleeping cities sloped to scarce rippling waves
it was hour above all others most sacred
to daring and antique art egyptian 
 art which would read our changeful destinies
in stars
he had filled his scroll he had noted moment
and sign and leaning upon his hand
he had surrendered himself to thoughts which
his calculation excited
again do stars forewarn me some danger
then assuredly awaits me v said he slowly 
some danger violent and sudden in its nature
 stars wear for me same mocking menace
which if our chronicles do not err they once wore
for pyrrhus for him doomed to strive for all
things to enjoy none restless agitated fated 
all attacking nothing gaining battles without fruit
laurels without triumph fame without success 
at made craven by his own superstitions and
n 
 
slain like a clog by a tile from hand an old
roman erilj stars flatter when they give
me a type in this fool war when they promise
to ardour my wisdom same results as to
 madness his ambition perpetual exercise no
certain goal sisyphus task mountain and
 stone stone a gloomy image it reminds
me that i am threatened with somewhat 
same death as episode let me look again
beware say shining prophets how thou
passes under ancient roofs or besieged walls or
overhanging cliffs a stone hurled from above is
charged by curses destiny against thee 
and at no distant date from this comes peril 
but i cannot a certainty read day and
hour well if my glass runs low sands shall
sparkle to yet if i scape this peril 
ay if i scape bright and clear as moonlight
track along waters glows rest 
my existence i see honours happiness success
shining upon every billow dark gulf beneath
which i must sink at what then
with such destinies beyond peril shall i succumb
to peril my soul whispers hope it
pompeii 
sweeps exultingly beyond boding hour it
revels in future its own courage is its fittest
omen if i were to perish so suddenly and so
soon shadow death would darken over me
and i should feel icy presentiment my doom
my soul that so smiles within me woidd express
in sadness and in gloom its forecast dreary
arcus it smiles it assures me deliverance
as he thus concluded his soliloquy egyptian
involuntarily rose he paced rapidly narrow
space that starroofed floor and pausing at 
parapet looked again upon grey and melancholy
heavens chills faint dawn
came refreshingly upon his brow and gradually
his mind resumed its natural and collected calm
he withdrew his gaze from stars as one after
one they receded into depths heaven and
his eyes fell over broad expanse below dim
in silenced port city rose masts 
 gallies along that mart luxury and 
labour meas stilled mighty hum no lights
save here and there from before columns a
temple or in porticos voiceless forum
broke wan and fluctuating light strung
 
going mom from heart torpid city 
so soon to vibrate with a thousand passions 
there came no solid streams use circulated
not they lay locked and torpid under ice 
sleep from huge space amphitheatre
with its stony seats rising one above other 
coiled and round as some slumbering monster
rose a thin and ghastly mist which gathered
darker and more dark over scattered foliage
that gloomed in its vicinity city seemed as
after awful change seventeen ages it seems
now to traveller a city dead
 ocean itself that serene and tideless sea 
lay scarce less hushed save that from its deep
bosom came softened by distance a faint and
regular murmur like breathing its sleep 
and curving far as with outstretched arms into
 green and beautiful land it seemed unconsciously
to clasp to its breast cities sloping
to its margin stable and herculaneum and
pompeii those children and darlings deep
when sir walter scott visited pompeii with sir william
gell almost his only remark was exclamation city 
 dead city dead i
pompeii 
ye slumber said egyptian as he scowled
over cities boast and flower campania 
ye shiver would it were eternal repose
 death as ye now jewels in crown 
empire so once were cities nile 
their greatness hath perished from them they
sleep amidst ruins their palaces and their shrines
are tombs serpent coils in grass their
streets lizard basks in their solitary halls
by that mysterious law nature which humbles
one to exalt other ye have thriven upon their
ruins thou haughty rome hast usurped 
glories sesostris and semiramis thou art a
robber clothing thyself with their spoils and
these slaves in thy triumph that i son
 forgotten monarchs survey below reservoirs 
thine allpervading power and luxury i curse as
i behold time shall come when egypt
shall be avenged when barbarian's steed
shall make his manger in golden house 
nero and thou that hast sown wind with
conquest shalt reap harvest in whirlwind
 desolation
as egyptian uttered a prediction winch
 
fate so fearfully fulfilled a more solemn and
boding image ill omen never occurred to 
dreams painter or poet morning light
which can pale so wanly even young cheek
 beauty gave his majestic and stately features
almost colours grave with dark hair
falling massively around them and dark robes
flowing long and loose and arm outstretched
from that lofty eminence and glittering eyes
fierce with a savage gladness half prophet and
half fiend 
he turned his gaze from city and ocean
before him lay vineyards and meadows 
 rich campania gate and walls ancient
half elastic city seemed not to bound its
extent villas and villages stretched on every
side up ascent vesuvius not nearly then
so steep or so lofty as at present for as rome
itself is built on an exhausted volcano so in similar
security inhabitants south tenanted
 green and vineclad places around a volcano
whose fires they believed at rest for ever from
 gate stretched long street tombs various
pompeii 
in size and architecture by which on that side
 city is yet approached above all rose 
cloudcapt summit dread mountain with
 shadows now dark now light betraying 
mossy caverns and ashy rocks which testified 
past conflagrations and might have prophesied 
but man is blind that which was to come 
difficult was it then and there to guess 
causes why tradition place wore so
gloomy and stern a hue why in those smiling
plains for miles around to baiae and museum 
 poets had imagined entrance and thresholds
 their hell their acheron and their fabled
styx why in those phlegrae now laughing with
 vine they placed battles gods and
supposed daring titans to have sought 
victory heaven save indeed that yet in yon
seared and blasted summit fancy might think
to read characters olympian thunderbolt

but it was neither rugged height 
still volcano nor fertility sloping fields
 or phlegraei campi viz scorched or tourist fields
 op
nor melancholy avenue tombs nor glittering
villas a polished and luxurious people that
now arrested eye egyptian on one
part landscape mountain vesuvius
descended to plain in a narrow and uncultivated
ridge broken here and there by jagged crags and
copses vild foliage at base this lay a
marshy and unwholesome pool and intiit
gaze arbaces caught outline some living
form moving by marshes and stooping ever
and anon as if to pluck its rank produce
ho said he aloud i have then another
companion in these unworldly night watches 
witch vesuvius is abroad what doth she too 
as credulous imagine doth she too learn 
lore great stars hath she been uttering
foul magic to moon or culling as her pauses
betoken foul herbs from venomous marsh 
well i must see this fellow labourer whoever
strives to know learns that no human lore is despicable
despicable only you ye fit and bloated
tidings slaves luxury sluggards in thought 
who cultivating nothing but barren sense dream
pompeii 
that its poor soil can produce alike myrtle and
 laurel no wise only can enjoy to us
only true luxiuy is given when mind brain invention
experience thought learning imagination
all contribute like rivers to swell seas 
sense lone 
as arbaces uttered that and charmed word
his thoughts sunk at once into a more deep and
profound channel his steps paused he took not
his eyes from ground once or twice he smiled
joyously and then as he turned from his place 
vigil and sought his couch he muttered if
death froatis so near i avill say at least that i
have lived lone shall be mine
 character arbaces was one those intricate
and varied webs in which even mind
that sate within it was sometimes confused and perplexed
in him son a fallen dynasty 
outcast a sunken people was that spirit discontented
pride which ever rankles in one a
sterner mould who feels himself inexorably shut
from sphere in which his fathers shone and to
which nature as well as birth no less entitled 
 
self this sentiment hath no benevolence it wars
with society it sees enemies in mankind but
with this sentiment did not go its common companion
poverty arbaces possessed wealth which
equalled that most roman nobles and
this enabled him to gratify to utmost passions
which had no outlet in business or ambition
travelling from clime to clime and beholding still
rome everywhere he increased both his hatred 
society and his passion for pleasure he was in a
vast prison which however he could fill with 
ministers luxury he could not escape from 
prison and his only object therefore was to give it
 character palace egyptians from
 earliest time were devoted to joys sense 
arbaces inherited both their appetite for sensuality
and glow imagination which struck light
from its rottenness but still unsocial in his pleasures
as in his graver pursuits and brooking neither
superior nor equal he admitted few to his companionship
save willing slaves his profligacy
he was solitary lord a crowded harem
but withall he felt condemned to that satiety
pompeii 
which is constant curse men whose intellect
is above their pursuits and that which once had
been impulse passion froze down to ordinance
 custom from disappointments 
sense he sought to raise himself by cultivation
 knowledge but as it was not his object to serve
mankind so he despised that knowledge which is
practical and usefid his dark imagination loved
to exercise itself in those more visionary and obscure
researches which are ever most delightful
to a wayward and solitary mind and to which he
himself was invited by daring pride his disposition
and mysterious traditions his clime
dismissing faith in confused creeds 
heathen world he reposed gilatest faith in 
power human wisdom he did not know perhaps
no one in that age distinctly did limits
which nature imposes upon our discoveries seeing
that higher we mount in knowledge more
wonders we behold he imagined that nature not
only worked miracles in her ordinary course but
that she might by cabala some master soul
be diverted from that course itself thus he purthe
 
sued science across her appointed boundaries into
 land perplexity and shadow from 
truths astronomy he wandered into astrologic
fallacy from secrets chemistry he passed
into spectral labyrinth magic and he who
could be sceptical as to power gods was
credulously superstitious as to power man
 cultivation magic carried at that day to
a singular height among wouldbewise was
especially eastern in its origin it was alien to
 early philosophy greeks nor had it
been received by them with favour until states
who accompanied army xerxes introduced
amongst simple credulity hellas solemn
superstitions zoroaster under 
roman emperors it had become however naturalized
at rome a meet subject for juvenis
fiery wit intimately connected with magic
was worship isis and egyptian religion
was means by which was extended 
devotion to egyptian sorcery theurgic or
benevolent magic poetic or dark and evil
necromancy were alike in preeminent repute
pompeii 
during first century christian era and
 marvels faustus are not comparable to those
 apollonius a kings courtiers and sages all
trembled before professors dread science
and not least remarkable his tribe was 
formidable and profound arbaces his fame and
his discoveries avere known to all cultivators
 magic they even survived himself but it
was not by his real and worldly name that he was
honoured by sorcerer and sage he received
from their homage a more mystic appellation
and was long remembered in magna graeca
and eastern plains by name hermes
 lord flaming belt his subtle speculations
and boasted attributes wisdom recorded
in various volumes were among those tokens 
 curious arts which christian converts
most joyfully yet most fearfully burnt at ephesus
depriving posterity proofs cunning 
 fiend
 conscience arbaces was solely intellect
 it was awed by no moral laws if man
imposed these checks upon herd so he believed
 
that man by superior wisdom could raise himself
above them if he reasoned i have genius
to impose laws have i not right to command
my own creations still more have i not right
to control to evade to scorn fabrications 
yet meaner intellects than my on thus if he
were a villain he justified his villainy by what
ought to have made him virtuous namely 
elevation his capacities
as all men have more or less passion 
power in arbaces that passion corresponded
exactly to his character it was not passion
 an external and brute authority he desired
not purple and fasces insignia vulgar
command his pride his contempt for rome
which made world and whose haughty name
he regarded with same disdain as that which
rome herself lashed upon barbarian would
never have permitted him to aspire to sway over
others for that would have rendered him at once 
tool or creature emperor he son 
 great race rameses he execute orders
 and receive his power from another more
pompeii 
notion filled him with rage but in rejecting an
ambition that coveted nominal distinctions he but
indulged more in ambition to rule heart
honouring mental power as greatest earthly
gifts he loved to feel that power palpably in himself
by extending it over all whom he encountered
thus had he ever sought young thus had he
ever fascinated and controlled them he loved to
find subjects in men's souls to rule over an invisible
and immaterial empire had he been less sensual
and less wealthy he might have sought to become
 founder a new religion as it was his energies
were checked by his pleasures besides however
 vague love this moral sway vanity so
dear to sages he was influenced by a singular
and dreamlike devotion to all that belonged to 
mystic land his ancestors had swayed although
he disbelieved in her deities he believed in 
allegories they represented or rather he interpreted
those allegories anew he loved to keep
alive worship egypt because he thus maintained
 shadow and recollection her
power he loaded therefore altars osiris
bss 
and isis with regal donations and was ever
anxious to dignify their priesthood hy new and
wealthy converts vow taken priesthood
embraced he usually chose comrades his
pleasures from those whom he had made his victims
partly because he thus secured to himself their
secrecy partly because he thus yet more confirmed
to himself his peculiar power hence motives
 his conduct to apaecides strengthened as these
were in that instance by his passion for lone
he had seldom lived long in one place but ashe
grew older he grew more wearied excitement
 new scenes and he had sojourned among
 delightful cities campania for a period
which surprised even himself in fact his pride
somewhat crippled his choice residence he
could not live in those burning climes ahich he
deemed right his own hereditary possession and
which now cowered supine and sunken under 
wings roman eagle rome herself win
hateful to his indignant soul nor did he love to
find his riches rivalled by minions court
and cast into comparative poverty by mighty
magnificence court itself campanian
pompeii 
cities proffered to him all that his nature craved 
 luxuries an unequalled clime imaginative
refinements a voluptuous civilization he
was removed from sight a superior vtearth 
he was without rivals to his riches he was free
from spies a jealous court as long as he

 pleasures sense begin to pall their ardent
youth is frittered away in countless desires their
hearts are exhausted so ever chasing love and
taught by a restless imagination to exaggerate
perhaps its charms egyptian had spent all
 glory his years without attaining object
 his desires beauty tomorrow succeeded
 beauty today and shadows bewildered
him in his pursuit substance when
two years before present date he beheld lone

he could love he stood then upon that bridge

to be loved in this hope he had watched expanding
youth beautiful neapolitan and
knowing influence that mind possesses over
those who are taught to cultivate mind he had
contributed willingly to form genius and enlighten
 intellect lone in hope that she would
be thus able to appreciate what he felt would be his
best claim to her affection viz a character which
lowered criminal and perverted was rich in its original
elements strength and grandeur when he
felt that character to be acknowledged he willingly
allowed nay encouraged her to mix among 
idle votaries pleasure in belief that her
soul fitted for higher commune would miss 
companionship his own and that in comparison

direction was given to a passion long controlled
nothing kindles fire love like a

to true moral roman and 
sabine empire obtained by force would be
cemented by gentler means this resolution was
yet more confirmed in him by his belief in 
prophecies stars they had long foretold

as epoch some dread disaster menacing
life itself he was driven to a certain and

chapter ix
what becomes lone in house graces 
 first signal wrath dread foe
when lone entered spacious hall 
egyptian same awe which had crept over
her brother impressed itself also upon her there
seemed to her as to him something ominous and
warning in still and mournful faces those
dread theban monsters whose majestic and passionless
features marble so well portrayed 
their looks with reach past ages was wise
and soul eternity thought in their eyes
 tall ethiopian slave grinned as he admitted
her and motioned to her to proceed half way
up hall she was met by arbaces himself in
festive robes which glittered with jewels although
it was broad day without mansion according
 
to practice luxurious was artificially
darkened and lamps cast their still and odourgiving
light over rich floors and ivory roofs
beautiful lone said arbaces as he bent to
touch her hand it is you that have eclipsed 
day it is your eyes that light up halls it is
your breath which fills them with perfumes
you must not talk to me thus said lone
smiling you forget that your lore has sufficiently
instructed my mind to render these graceful
flatteries to my person unwelcome it was
you who taught me to disdain adulation will you
unteach your pupil 
there was something so frank and charming in
 manner lone as she thus spoke that 
egyptian was more than ever enamoured and
more than ever disposed to renew offence he
had committed he however answered quickly and
gaily and hastened to renew conversation
he led her through various chambers a
house which seemed to contain to her eyes unexperienced
to other splendour than minute elegance
 campanian cities treasures 
world
pompeii 
in walls were set pictures inestimable
art lights shone over statues noblest
age greece cabinets gems each cabinet itself
a gem filled up interstices columns
 most precious woods lined thresholds and
composed doors gold and jewels seemed prodigality
all around sometimes they were alone
in these rooms sometimes they passed through
silent rows slaves who kneeling as she passed
proffered to her offerings bracelets chains 
gems which egyptian vainly entreated her to
receive
i have often heard said she wonderingly
that you were rich but i never dreamed 
amount your wealth
would i could coin it all replied egyptian
 into one crown which i might place upon
that snowy brow 
alas weight would crush me i should
be a second tarpeia answered lone laughingly
but thou dost not disdain riches o lone
they know not what life is capable who are not
wealthy gold is great magician earth it
realizes our dreams it gives them power a
 
god there is a grandeur a sublimity in its possession
 it is mightiest yet most obedient
 our slaves
 artful arbaces sought to dazzle young
neapolitan by his treasures and his eloquence he
sought to awaken in her desire to be mistress
 what she surveyed he hoped that she would confound
 owner with possessions and that 
charms his wealth would be reflected on himself
meanwhile lone was secretly somewhat uneasy
at gallantries which escaped from those lips
which till lately had seemed to disdain common
homage we pay to beauty and with that
delicate subtlety which woman alone possesses
she sought to ward off shafts deliberately aimed
and to laugh or to talk away meaning from his
warming language nothing in world is more
pretty than that same species defence it is 
charm african necromancer who professed
vyith a feather to turn aside winds
 egyptian was intoxicated and subdued by
her grace even more than by her beauty it was with
difficulty that he suppressed his emotions alas 
pompeii 
 feather was only powerful against summer
breezes it would be sport storm
suddenly as they stood in one hall wliieh was
surrounded by draperies silver and white 
egyptian clapped his hands and as if by enchantment
a banquet rose from floor a couch
or throne with a crimson canopy ascended simultaneously
at feet lone and at same
instant from behind curtains swelled invisible
and softest music
arbaces placed himself at feet lone and
children young and beautiful as loves ministered
to feast
 feast was done music sank into a low
and subdued strain and arbaces thus addressed
his beautiful guest
hast thou never in this dark and uncertain
world hast thou never aspired my pupil to look
beyond hast thou never wished to put aside 
veil futurity and to behold on shores fate
 shadowy images things to be for it is not
 past alone that has its ghosts each event to
come has also its spectrum its shade when 
o
 
hour arrives life enters it shadow becomes corporeal
and walks world thus in land
beyond grave are ever two impalpable and
spiritual hosts things to be things that
have been if by our wisdom we can penetrate
that land we see one as other and learn as
 have learnt not alone mysteries dead
but also destiny living
as thou hast learnt can wisdom attain so far
wilt thou prove my knowledge lone and behold
 representation thine own fate it is a
drama more striking than those ofaeschylus it
is one i have prepared for thee if thou wilt see 
shadows perform their part
 neapolitan trembled she thought glaucus
and sighed as well as trembled were their
destinies to be united half incredulous half believing
half awed half alarmed by words 
her strange host she remained for some moments
silent and then answered
it may revolt it may terrify knowledge 
 future will perhaps only embitter present
not so lone i have myself looked upon thy
future lot and ghosts thy future bask in 
pompeii 
gardens elysium amidst asphodel and 
rose they prepare garlands thy sweet destiny
and fates so harsh to others weave only
for thee web happiness and love wilt
thou then come and behold thy doom so that thou
mayst enjoy it beforehand 
again heart lone murmured glaucus 
she uttered a half audible assent egyptian
rose and taking her by hand he led her
across banquetroom curtains withdrew
as by magic hands and music broke forth
in a louder and gladder strain they passed a
row columns on either side which fountains
cast aloft their fragrant waters they descended
by broad and easy steps into a garden
 eve had commenced moon was already
high in heaven and those sweet flowers
that sleep by day and fill with ineffable odours
 airs night were thickly scattered amidst
alleys cut through starlit foliage or gathered
in baskets lay like offerings at feet frequent
statues that gleamed along their path
whither wouldst thou lead me arbaces 
said lone wonderingly
 
but yonder said he pointing to a small building
which stood at vista it is a
temple consecrated to fates our rites require
such holy ground
they passed into a narrow hall at 
which hung a sable curtain arbaces lifted it lone
entered and found herself in total darkness
be not alarmed said egyptian light
avill rise instantly while he so spoke a soft and
warm and gradual light diffused itself around as
it spread over each object lone fancied that she
was in an apartment moderate size hung everywhere
with black a couch same hue was
beside her in centre room was a small
altar on which stood a tripod bronze at one
side upon a lofty column granite was a colossal
head blackest marble which she perceived
by crown wheatears that encircled brow
represented great egyptian goddess arbaces
stood before altar he had laid his garland on
 shrine and seemed occupied with pouring into
 tripod contents a brazen vase suddenly
from that tripod least into life a blue quick darting
irregular flame egyptian drew back to
pipeii 
 side lone and muttered some words in a
langage unfamiliar to her ear curtain at 
back altar waved tremulously to and fro 
it parted slowly and in aperture which was
thus made lone beheld an indistinct and pale landscape
which giactually grew brighter and clearer
as she gazed at length she discovered plainly
trees and rivers and meadows and all beautiful
diversity richest earth at length
before landscape a dim shadow glided it rested
opposite to lone slowly same charm
seemed to operate upon it as over rest 
scene it took form and shape and lo in its
feature and in its form lone beheld herself 
then scene behind spectre faded away
and was succeeded by representation a gorgeous
palace a throne was raised in centre
 its hall dim forms slaves and guards
were ranged around it and a pale hand held over
 throne likeness a diadem
a new actor now appeared he was clothed
from head to foot in a dark robe you saw neither
his face nor outline his figure he knelt at
 feet shadowy lone he clasped her hand 
 
he pointed to throne as if to invite her to
ascend it
 neapolitan's heart beat violently shall
 shadow disclose itself whispered a voice
beside her voice arbaces
ah yes answered lone softly
arbaces raised his hand spectre seemed to
drop mantle that concealed its form and lone
shrieked it was arbaces himself that thus knelt
before her
this is indeed thy fate whispered again
 egyptian's voice in her ear and thou art
destined to be bride arbaces
ine started black curtain closed over 
phantasmagoria and arbaces himself real
 living arbaces was at her feet
oh lone said he passionately gazing upon
her listen to one who has long struggled vainly
with his love i adore thee fates do not
lie thou art destined to be mine i have sought
 world around and found none like thee from
my youth upward i have sighed for such as thou
art i have dreamed till i saw thee i wake and
i behold thee turn not away from me lone 
pompeii 
think not me as thou hast thought i am not
that being cold insensate and morose which i
have seemed to thee never woman had lover so
devoted so passionate as i will be to lone do
not struggle in my clasp see i release thy hand
take it from me if thou wilt well be it so 
but do not reject me lone do not rashly reject 
judge thy power over me when thou canst thus
transform i who never knelt to mortal being
kneel to thee i who have commanded fate receive
from thee my own lone tremble not thou art
my queen my goddess be my bride all 
wishes thou canst form shall be fulfilled ends
 earth shall minister to thee pomp power
luxury shall be thy slaves arbaces shall have no
ambition save pride obeying thee lone
turn upon me those eyes shed upon me thy
smile dark is my soul when thy face is hid
from it shine over me my sun my heaven 
my daylight lone lone do not reject my
love
alone and in power this singular and
fearful man lone was not yet terrified respect
 his language softness his voice
 
reassured her and in her own purity she felt protection
but she was confused astonished it
was some moments before she could recover 
power reply
rise graces said she at length and she
resigned to him once more her hand which she
as quickly withdrew again when she felt upon it
 burning pressure his lips rise and if
thou art serious if thy language be in earnest 
ifr said he tenderly
well then listen to me you have been my
guardian my friend my monitor for this new
character i was not prepared think not she
added quickly as she saw his dark eyes glitter
with fierceness his passion think not
that i scorn that am not touched that i am
not honoured by this homage but say canst
thou hear me calmly p
ay though thy words were lightning and
could blast me
 love another's said lone blushingly butin
a firm voice
by gods by hell shouted arbaces
rising to his fullest height dare not tell me
pompeii 
that dare not mock me it is impossible 
whom hast thou seen whom known oh lone 
it is thy woman's invention thy woman's art that
speaks thou wouldst gain time i have surprised
 i have terrified thee do with me as thou
wilt say that thou lowest not me but say not
that thou lowest another 
alas began lone and then appalled before his
sudden and unlookedfor violence she burst into tears
arbaces came nearer to her his breath glowed
fiercely on her cheek he wound his arms round
her she sprang from his embrace in struggle
a tablet fell from her bosom on ground 
arbaces perceived and seized it it was letter
that morning received from glaucus lone sank
upon couch half dead with terror
rapidly eyes arbaces ran over writing
 neapolitan did not dare to gaze upon
him she did not see deadly paleness that came
over his countenance she marked not his writhing
frown nor quivering his lip nor convulsions
that heaved his breast he read it to 
 and then as letter fell from his hand he
said in a voice deceitful calmness 
 
is writer this man thou lowest 
lone sobbed but answered not
speak he rather shrieked than said
its its
and his name it is written here his name
is glaucus 
lone clasping her hands looked round as for
succour or escape
then hear me said arbaces sinking his
voice into a whisper j thou shalt go to thy tomb
rather than to his arms what thickest thou
arbaces avill brook a rival such as this puny
greek what thickest thou that he has watched
 fruit ripen to yield it to another pretty fool
no thou art mine all only mine and thus 
thus i seize and claim thee as he spoke he
caught lone in his arms and in that ferocious
grasp was all energy less love than 
revenge
but to lone despair gave supernatural strength 
she again tore herself from him she rushed to
that part room by which she had entered 
she half withdrew curtain he seized her 
again she broke away from him and fell expompeii

haunted and with a loud shriek at base 
 colin which supported head 
egyptian goddess arbaces paused for a moment
as to regain his breath and then once more
darted upon his prey
at that instant curtain was rudely torn
aside egyptian felt a fierce and strong grasp
upon his shoulder he turned he beheld before
him flashing eyes glaucus and pale 
worn but menacing countenance apascides
ha he muttered as he glared from one to 
other what fury hath sent ye hither 
ate answered glaucus and he closed at
once with egyptian meanwhile apaecides
raised his sister now lifeless from ground his
strength exhausted by his long overwrought mind
did not suffice to bear her away light and delicate
though her shape he placed her therefore on 
couch and stood over her with a brandished knife
watching contest between glaucus and egyptian
and ready to plunge his weapon in bosom 
arbaces should he be victorious in struggle
there is perhaps nothing on earth so terrible as 
naked and unarmed contest animal strength no
 
weapon lut those wliicli nature supplies to rage
both antagonists were now locked in each
o
other's grasp hand each seeking throat
 other face drawn back fierce eyes
flashing muscles strained veins swelled
 lips apart teeth set both were
strong beyond ordinary power men both animated
by relentless wrath they coiled they wound
around each other they rocked to and fro they
swayed from to their confined arena 
they uttered cries ire and revenge they were
now before altar now at base column
where struggle had commenced they
drew back for breath arbaces leaning against 
column glaucus a few paces apart
o ancient goddess exclaimed arbaces clasping
 column and raising his eyes towards 
sacred image it supported protect thy chosen
proclaim thy vengeance against this thing an
upstart creed who with sacrilegious violence profanes
thy restingplace and assails thy servant
as he spoke still and vast features 
goddess seemed suddenly to glow with life through
 black marble as through a transparent veil
pompeii 
flushed luminously a crimson and burning hue 
around head played and darted confiscations 
livid lightning eyes became like balls lurid
fire and seemed fixed in withering and intolerable
wrath upon countenance greek aved
and appalled by this sudden and mystic answer to
 prayer his foe and not free from hereditary
superstitions his race cheeks 
glaucus paled before that strange and ghastly animation
 marble his knees knocked together
he stood seized with a divine panic dismayed
aghast half unmanned before his foe arbaces
gave him not breathing time to recover his stupor
die wretch he shouted in a voice thunder
as he sprang upon greek mighty
mother claims thee as a living sacrifice taken
thus by surprise in first consternation his
superstitious fears greek lost his footing 
marble floor was as smooth as glass he slid he
fell arbaces planted his foot on breast his
fallen foe apaecides taught by his sacred profession
as well as by his knowledge arbaces
to distrust all miraculous interpositions had not
shared dismay his companion he rushed
q
 
forward his knife gleamed in air watchful
egyptian caught his arm as it descended one wrench
 his powerful hand tore weapon from weak
grasp priest one sweeping blow stretched
him to earth with a loud and exulting yell
arbaces brandished knife on high glaucus
gazed upon his impending fate with unwinking eyes
and in stern and scornful resignation a fallen
gladiator when at that awful instant floor
shook under them with a rapid and convulsive throe
a mightier spirit than that egyptian was
abroad a giant and crushing power before which
sunk into sudden impotence his passion and his
arts it woke it stirred that dread daemon 
 earthquake laughing to scorn alike magic
 human guile and malice human wrath
as a titan on whom mountains are piled it
roused itself from sleep years it moved on
its dscdal couch caverns below groaned and
trembled beneath motion its limbs in 
moment his vengeance and his power selfprized
demigod was humbled to his real clay far
and wide along soil went a hoarse and rumbling
sound curtains chamber shook as

reeled and high over place contest 
column trembled and waved from side to side 
 sable head goddess tottered and fell from
its pedestal and as egyptian stooped above
his intended victim right upon his bended form
right between shoulder and neck struck
 marble mass shock stretched him like

or motion or semblance life upon floor 
apparently crushed by very divinity he had
impiously animated and invoked 
 earth has preserved her children said
glaucus staggering to his feet blessed be 
dread convulsion let us worship providence

then turned upward face arbaces it seemed
locked as in death blood gushed from egyptian's
lips over his glittering robes he fell heavily
from arms glaucus and red stream
trickled slowly along marble again earth
shook beneath their feet they were forced to cling
to each other convulsion ceased as suddenly as
it came they tarried no longer glaucus bore
 
lone lightly in his arms and they fled from 
unhallowed spot but scarce had they entered
 garden than they were met on all sides by
flying and disordered groups women and slaves
whose festive and glittering garments contrasted in
mockery solemn terror hour they did
not appear to heed strangers they were occupied
only with their own fears after tranquillity
 sixteen years that burning and treacherous
soil again menaced destruction they uttered
but one cry earthquake earthquake

alleys passed a small open gate and there sitting
on a little mound over which gloomed dark

note to ii
a page marvels faustus are not comparable
to those apollonius
during earlier ages christian epoch heathen
philosophy especially pythagoras and plato had become
debased and adulterated not only by wildest mysticism
but most chimerical dreams magic pythagoras indeed
scarcely merited a nobler destiny for though he was an exceedingly
clever man he was a most prodigious mountebank and
was exactly formed to be great father a school magicians
pythagoras himself either cultivated magic or arrogated
its attributes and his followers told marvellous tales his
writing on moon's disc and appearing in several places at
once his golden rules and his golden thigh were in especial
veneration in ilagna grecian and out his doctrines occult
numbers his followers extracted numbers occult doctrines
 most remarkable later impostors who succeeded him
was apollonius tyana referred to in text all sorts 
prodigies accompanied birth this gentleman proteus 
egyptian god foretold to his mother yet pregnant that it was he
himself proteus who was about to reappear in world
through her agency after this proteus might well be considered
to possess power transformation apollonius knew

ed about with a familiar spirit he was a devil a fellow with a
devil and induced a mob to stone a poor demon venerable and
mendicant appearance who after lapidary operation changed
into a huge dog he raised dead passed a night with achilles
and when domitian was murdered he called out aloud though
at ephesus at moment strike tyrant 
so honest and great a man was worthy his life it would seem
that he ascended into heaven what less could be expected 
one who had stoned devil should any english writer meditate
a new faust i recommend to him apollonius
but magicians this sort were philosophers excellent
men and pious there were others a far darker and deadlier
knowledge followers poetic magic in other words 
black art both these poetic and theurgic appear
to be egyptian origin and it is evident at least that their
practitioners appeared to pride themselves on drawing their chief
secrets from that ancient source and both are intimately connected
with astrology in attributing to arbaces knowledge
and repute magic as well as that science 
stars i am therefore perfectly in accordance with spirit 
his time and circumstances his birth he is a characteristic
 that age at one time i purposed to have developed
and detailed more than i have done pretensions arbaces
to mastery his art and to have initiated reader into
 various sorceries period but as character 
egyptian grew upon me i felt that it was necessary to be sparing
 that machinery which thanks to this fiveshillings nuirch 
knowledge every one now may fancy he can detect such as he
is arbaces is become too much an intellectual creation to demand
a frequent repetition coarser and more physical materia
 terror i suffered him then merely to demonstrate his
capacities in elementary and obvious secrets his craft and
leave subtler magic he possesses to rest in mystery and
shadow

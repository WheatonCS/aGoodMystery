pericles and aspasia
aspasia to cleon
the parthenon is now completed and waits
but for the goddess a small temple raised
by cimon in honour theseus is the model
this until lately was the only beautiful edifice
in the athenian dominions pericles is resolved
that athens shall not only be the mistress but
the admiration the world and that her architecture
shall if possible keep pace with her
military and intellectual renown our countryvol
ii b
 pericles and aspasia
men who have hitherto been better architects
than the people attica think it indecorous
and degrading that loans as the athenians
are should follow the fashion the dorian
so inferior a race mortals many grand designs
were offered by ictinus to the approbation
and choice the publick those which he
calls ionian are the gracefully craters a
young architect perhaps to ridicule the finery
and extravagance the corinthians exposed to
view a gorgeous design slender columns and
topheavy capitals such as if ever carried into
execution would be incapable resisting the
humidity the seabreezes or even the action
 the open air uninfluenced by them these
however would not be misplaced as indoor
ornaments particularly in bronze or ivory and
indeed small pillars such a character would
be suitable enough to highly ornamented apartments
i have conversed on the subject with
pericles and aspasia 
ictinus who remarked to me that what we
call the dorick column is in fact egyptian modified
to the position and the worship and that
our noblest specimens are but reduced and
petty imitations those ancient and indestructible
supporters to the temples thebes 
memphis and entire he smiled at the ridicule
cast on the corinthians by the name designating
those florid capitals but agreed with
me that on a smaller scale in gold or silver
they would serve admirably for the receptacles
 waxhghts on solemn festivals he praised
the designs our ionian architects and acknowledged
that their pillars alone deserved the
appellation grecian but added that in places
liable to earthquakes inundations or accumulations
 sand the solider column was in its proper
situation the architraves the parthenon
are chiseled by the scholars phidias who
sometimes gave a portion the design it is
b 
 pericles and aspasia
reported that two the figures bear the marks
 the master's own hand he leaves it to the
conjecture future ages which they are some
 the young architects ionian and athenian
who were standing with me disputed not only
on the relative merits their architecture but
 their dialect one them psamiades 
ephesus ill enduring the taunt branches the
athenian that the ionian from its open vowels
resembled a pretty pulpy hand which could not
close itself made an attack on the letter t
usurping the place s and against the augments

is it not enough said he that you lisp
but you must also stammer 
let us have patience if any speak against us
o cleon when a censure is cast on the architecture
 ictinus and on the dialect athens
pericles and aspasia
cleone to aspasia
when the weather is serene and bright i
think the young aspasia her liveliness
her playfulness her invitations to sit down on
the grass and her challenges to run to leap
to dance and if nobody was near to gambol
the weather at this season is neither bright
nor serene and i think the more my aspasia
because i want her more fie upon me 
and yet on the whole
happy to me has been the day
the shortest the year
though some alas are far away
who made the longest yet more brief appear
i never was formed for poetry i hate whatever
i have written five minutes afterwards a
weakly kid likes the warm milk and likes the

drawing it from its sources but place the
same before her cold in a pail and she smells
at it and turns away
among the tales lately come out here
many contain occasional poetry in the 
to one the scene which lies mostly in athens
the author says
my reader will do well to draw his pen
across the verses they are not good for him
the olive especially the attic is pleasing to
few the first time it is tasted
this hath raised an outcry against him so
that the whole fraternity he is the most unpopular

the gods confound him with his witticisms 
exclaim the soberminded is not the man
contented to be a true and hearty marian
have we not roses and violets lilies and amaranths
crocuses and sow thistles have we not
pretty girls and loving ones have we not

desperate girls and cruel ones as abundantly as
elsewhere do not folks grieve and die to his
heart's content we possess the staple and
by castor and pollux we can bleach it and
comb it and twist it as cleverly as the sharpest

you will soon see his works among others
more voluminous in the meanwhile i cannot
 my letter in a pleasant way than with a

pericles and aspasia
aspasia to cleone
there are odes in alcaeus which the pen
would stop at trip at or leap over several in
our collection are wanting in yours this among
them

wormwood and rue be on his tongue
and ashes on his head
who chills the feast and checks the song
with emblems ot the dead 

by young and jovial wise and brave
such mummers are derided
his sacred rites shall bacchus have
inspired and undivided

impending from above
i only fear the later flask
that holds me from my love
b 
 pericles and aspasia
show these to any priest bacchus especially
to any at samos and he will shake his
head at you telling you that bacchus will never
do without his masks and mysteries which it is
holier to fear than the later flask on this
subject he would prove to you all fears are
empty ones
aspasia to cleone
in all ancient nations there are grand repositories
 wisdom although it may happen that
little it is doled out to the exigencies the
people there is more in the fables esp
than in the schools our athenian philosophers
 there is more in the laws and usages 
persia than in the greater part those communities
which are loud in denouncing them for
pericles and aspasia 
barbarism and yet there are some that shock
me we are told by herodotus who tells us
whatever we know with certainty a step beyond
our thresholds that a boy in persia is kept in
the apartments the women and prohibited
from seeing his father until the fifth year the
reason is he informs us that if he dies before
this age his loss may give the parent no uneasiness
and such a custom he thinks commendable
herodotus has no child cleon if he
had far other would be his feelings and his
judgment before that age how many seeds
are sown which future years and very distant
ones mature successively how much fondness
how much generosity what hosts other
virtues courage constancy patriotism spring
into the father's heart from the cradle his
child and does never the fear come over him
that what is most precious to him upon earth is
left in careless or perfidious in unsafe or 
pericles and aspasia
worthy hands does it never occur to him that
he loses a son in every one these five years 
what is there so affecting to the brave and virtuous
man as that which perpetually wants his
help and cannot call for it what is so different
as the speaking and the mute and hardly
less so are inarticulate sounds and sounds which
he receives halfformed and which he delights
to modulate and which he lays with infinite care
and patience not only on the tender attentive
ear but on the halfopen lips and on the eyes
and on the cheeks as if they all were listeners
in every child there are many children but
coming forth year after year each somewhat
like and somewhat varying when they are
grown much older the leaves as it were lose
their pellucid green the branches their graceful
pliancy
is there any man so rich in happiness that he
can afford to throw aside these first five years 
pericles and aspasia 
is there any man who can hope for another five
so exuberant in uniting joy 
o my sweet infant i would teach thee to
kneel before the gods were it only to thank em
that thou art athenian and not persian
aspasia to cleone
our good anaxagoras said to me this morning
 you do well aspasia to read history in
preference to philosophy not only on the recommendation
but according to the practice pericles
a good historian will also be a good
philosopher but will take especial care that hebe
never caught in the attitude disquisition or
declamation the golden vein must run through
his field but we must not see rising out it the
shaft and the machinery we should moderate
 pericles and aspasia
or repress our curiosity and fastidiousness
perhaps at no time will there be written by the
most accurate and faithful historian so much 
truth as untruth but actions enow will come
out with sufficient prominence before the great
tribunal mankind to exercise their judgment
and regulate their proceedings if statesmen
looked attentively at every thing past they
would find infallible guides in all emergencies
but leaders are apt to shudder at the idea 
being led and little know what different things
are experiment and experience the sagacity
 a pericles himself is neither rule nor authority
to those impetuous men who would rather have
rich masters than frugal friends
the young folks from the school your
suitor socrates who begin to talk already 
travelling in egypt when the plague is over
are likely to return with a distemper as incurable
breaking bulk with daemons and dreams
pericles and aspasia 
they carry stem and stern too high out the
water and are more attentive to the bustling
and bellying the streamers than to the
soundness the mast the compactness the
deck or the capacity and cleanliness the
hold
aspasia to cleone
anaxagoras told me yesterday that he had
been conversing with some literary men philosophers
and poets who agreed in one thing
only which is that we are growing worse day
after day both in morality and intellect hints
were thrown out that philosophy had mistaken
her road and that it was wonderful how she
could be at once so dull and so mischievous
the philosophers themselves made this com
 pericles and aspasia
plaint the poets were as severe on poetry and
were amazed that we were reduced so low as to
be the hearers sophocles and euripides and
three or four more who however were quite
good enough for such admirers
it is strange said anaxagoras that weare
unwilling to receive the higher pleasures
when they come to us and solicit us and when
we are sure they will do us great and lasting
good and that we gape and pant after the
lower when we are equally sure they will do us
great and lasting evil i am incapable continued
he enjoying so much pleasure from
the works imagination as these poets are
who would rather hate euripides and sophocles
than be delighted by them yet who follow the
shade orpheus with as ardent an intensity 
love as orpheus followed the shade eurydice
ignorant as i am poetry i dared not hazard
the opinion that our two contemporaries were
pericles and aspasia 
really deserving more commendation on the
score verse inferior as they might be to
marshal and thamyris and the centaur chiron 
and to the philosophers i could only say my
dear friends let us keep our temper firmly and
our tenets laxly and let any man correct both
who will take the trouble
i come to you aspasia to console me for
the derision i bring home with me
i kissed his brow which was never serene
and assured him that he possessed more comfort
than any mortal could bestow upon him and
that he was the only one living who never
wanted any
i am not insensible said he that every
year at my time life we lose some pleasure 
some twig that once blossomed cankers
i never was fond looking forward i have
invariably checked both hopes and wishes it
is but fair then that i should be allowed to turn
 pericles and aspasia
away my eyes ftxm the prospect age even if
i could believe that it would come to me as
placidly as it has come to anaxagoras i woiild
rather lie down to sleep before the knees tremble
as they bend with anaxagoras i never
converse in this manner for old men more
willingly talk age than hear others talk it 
and neither fool nor philosopher likes to think
 the time when he shall talk no longer i told
my dear old man that having given a piece 
moral to the philosophers he must not be so
unjust as to refuse a like present to the poets
about an hour before i began my letter he
came into the library and to my great surprise
brought me these verses telling me that if they
were satirical the satire fell entirely upon himself

pleasures away they please no more
friends are they what they were before 
pericles and aspasia s 
loves they are very idle things
the best about them are their wings
the dance tis what the bear can do 
musick i hate your musick too
whene'er these witnesses that time
hath snatcht the chaplet from our prime
are caird by nature as we go
with eye more wary step more slow
and will be heard and noted down
however we may fret or frown
shall we desire to leave the scene
where all our former joys have been 
no twere ungrateful and unwise 
but when die down our charities
for human weal and human woes
then is the time our eyes should close
aspasia to leone
we hear that another state has been rising
up gradually to power in the center italy
 pericles and aspasia
it was originally formed a band pirates
from some distant country who took possession
 two eminences fortified long before and overlooking
a wide extent country under these
eminences themselves but little elevation are
five hillocks on which they enclosed the cattle
by night it is reported that here were the remains
 an ancient and extensive city which
served the robbers for hidingplaces and temples
were not wanting in which to deprecate
the vengeance the gods for the violences and
murders they committed daily the situation
is unhealthy which perhaps is the reason why
the city was abandoned and is likewise a sufficient
one why it was rebuilt by the present occupants
they might perpetrate what depredations
they pleased confident that no force
could long besiege them in a climate so pestilential
relying on this advantage they seized
from time to time as many women as were re
pericles and aspasia 
quite for any fresh accession vagabonds
rogues and murderers
the sabines bore the loss tolerably well
until the romans so they call themselves went
beyond all bounds and even took their cattle
from the yoke the sabines had endured all
that it became them to endure but the lowing
 their oxen from the seven hills reached their
hearts and inflamed them with revenge they
are a pastoral and therefore a patient people
able to undergo the exertions and endure the
privations war but never having been
thieves the romans overmatched them in
vigilance activity and enterprise and have
several times since made incursions into their
country and forced them to disadvantageous
conditions emboldened by success they ventured
to insult and exasperate the nearest 
the tuscan princes
the tuscanss are a very proud and very
 pericles and aspasia
ancient nation and like all nations that are
proud and ancient excel chiefly in enjoying
themselves demaratus the corinthian dwelt
among them several years and from the corinthians
they learned to improve their pottery
which however it does not appear that they
ever have carried to the same perfection as the
corinthian the best it being very indifferently
copied both in the form and in the figures
on it
herodotus has written to pericles all he
could collect relating to them and pericles
says the account is interesting for my part i
could hardly listen to it although written by
herodotus and redd by pericles i have quite
forgotten the order events i think they are
such as neither you nor any one else excepting
those who live near them will ever care
about but the tuscanss really are an extraordinary
people they have no poets no histo
pericles and aspasia 
rians no orators no statuaries no painters 
they say they once had them so much the more
disgraceful the romans went out against
them and dispersed them although they blew
many trumpets bravely and brought pretty
nearly into action many stout soothsayers
the enemy it appears has treated them with
clemency they may stil feed soothsayers blow
horns and have wives in common
i hope it is near your bedtime if it is you
will thank me for my letter
aspasia to cleone
who would have imagined that the grave
sedate pericles could take such delight in mischief
after reading my dissertation on the
 pericles and aspasia
tyrrhenians and romans he gave it again
into my hands saying
pray amuse your friend cleon with your
first attempt at history
i sent it oif quite unsuspicious in the evening
lie looked at me with a smile no short
continuance and said at last
aspasia i perceive you are emulous 
our halicarnassus but pray do not publish
that historical essay either in his name or your
own he does not treat the romans quite so
lightly as you do and shows rather more justice
to the tyrrhenians you forgot to mention
some important facts recorded by him and some
doubts as weighty we shall come to them presently

having heard the romans but nothing
distinctly i wished to receive a clearer and a
fuller account them and wrote to herodotus
by the first ship that sailed for tarentum the
pericles and aspasia 
city where he is residing lies near it and i gave
orders that my letter should be taken thither
and delivered into his hands above a year is
elapsed during which time herodotus tells me
he has made all the inquiries that the pursuit
 his studies would allow that he is continuing
to correct the errors elucidate the doubtful
points and correct the style and arrangement 
his history and that when he has completed it
to his mind he shall have time and curiosity to
consider with some attention this remarkable
tribe barbarians
at present he has not been able to answer
my questions for never was writer so sedulous
in the pursuit and examination facts what
he sees he describes clearly what he hears he
relates faithfully and he bestows the same care
on the composition as he had bestowed on the
investigation
the romans i imagined had been subdued
vol ii c
 pericles and aspasia
by numa a sabine for it can hardly be credited
that so ferocious a community sent a
friendly invitation to be governed and commanded
by the prince a nation they had
grossly and repeatedly insulted what services
had he rendered them or by what means had
they become acquainted with his aptitude for
government they had ever been rude and
quarrelsome he was distinguished for civility
and gentleness they had violated all that is
most sacred in public and private life virgins
were seized by treachery detained by force and
compelled to wipe the blood their fathers off
the sword their ravishers a fratricide king
had recently been murdered by a magistracy 
traitors what man in his senses would change
any condition life to become the ruler 
such a people none but he who had conquered
and could control them none but one
who had swords enough for every head among
pericles and aspasia
them absolute power alone can tame them
and fit them for any thing better and this
power must reside in the hands a brave and
sagacious man who will not permit it to be
shared or touched or questioned under such
a man such a people may become formidable
virtuous and great it is too true that to be
martial a nation must taste blood in its
cradle philosophers may dispute it but time
past has written it down and time to come will
confirm it these matters the sophists can
know nothing he who understands them best
will be the least inclined to discourse on them
another thing i doubted and wished to
know numa is called a sabine the sabines
are illiterate stil in the time numa they
were ruder they had no commerce no communication
with countries beyond italy and
yet there are writers who tell us that he introduced
laws on the whole not dissimilar to ours
c
 pericles and aspasia
and corrected the calendar is it credible is
it possible i am disposed to believe that both
these services were rendered by the son deparatus
and that the calendar might have been
made better were it not requisite on such an
occasion more than almost any other to consult
the superstition the populace
i myself am afraid touching the calendar
here in athens many as have been my conferences
with meton on the subject done it
shall be but it must be either just before a
victory or just after
if the sabine had sent an embassy or even
an individual to athens in order to collect our
laws the archives the city would retain a record
 so wonderful an event he certainly
could not have picked them up in the pastures
or woodlands his own country but the corinthians
know them well and have copied most
 them all nations are fond pushing the
pericles and aspasia 
date their civilisation as high up as possible
and care not how remotely they place the benefits
they have received and as probably
some the romans were aware that numa
was their conqueror they helped to abolish the
humiliating suspicion by investing him successively
with the robes a priest a legislator
and an astronomer
his two nearest successors were warriors
and conquerors the third was the son that
demaratus whom we have spoken and who
exiled from corinth settled among the tyrrel
and afterwards being rich and eloquent
won over to his interests the discontented and the
venal the romans at all times a great majority
we hear that he constructed hewn
stone a long a spacious and a lofty channel to
convey the filth the town into the river we
hear at the same time that the town itself was
fabricated hurdles and mud upon ruins 
 pericles and aspasia
massy workmanship that the best houses were
roofed with rushes and that the vases the
temples were earthen now kings in general
and mostly those whose authority is recent
and insecure think rather amusing the people
by spectacles or pampering their appetites by
feasts and donatives or dazzling their imagination
by pomp and splendour theaters not
common sewers suited best the romans their
first great exploit was performed in a theater at
the cost the sabines moreover they were
very religious and stole every god and goddess
they could lay their hands on surely so considerate
a person as the son demaratus
would have adapted his magnificence to the
genius the people who never cared about
filth but were always most zealous in their devotions
this we might imagine would occur
to him as more and more requisite on the capture
 every town or village for when the
pericles and aspasia 
romans had killed the inhabitants they transferred
the gods very diligently into their city
that they might not miss their worshippers
now the gods must have wanted room by degrees
and might not have liked their quarters
five hundred temples could have been erected
at less expense than the building this stupendous
duct did the son demaratus
build it then 
the people are stil ignorant stil barbarous
stil cruel stil intractable but they are acute
in the perception their interests and have
established at last a form government more
resembling the carthaginian than ours as
their power does not arise from commerce like
the power carthage but strikes its roots
into the solid earth its only sure foundation it
is much less subject to the gusts fortune and
will recover from a shock more speedily neither
is there any great nation in contact with
 pericles and aspasia
them when they were much weaker the
etruria conquered them under the command
 their prince porsena but thought they could
leave them nowhere less inconveniently than
in the place they themselves had abandoned
the sabines too conquered them a second time
and imposed a king over them but were so unsuspicious
and inconsiderate as not to destroy
the city and parcel out the inhabitants for
greece sicily and africa
living as they did on their farms with no
hold upon the romans but a king who residing
in the city with few his own countrymen
about him was rather a hostage than a ruler
his authority was soon subverted the sabines
at this time are partly won by conquest and
partly domiciliated by consanguinity the
etruria are spent and effete the government
 the romans from royal is now become
aristocratical and the people deprived their
pericles and aspasia 
lawful share in the lands they conquered from
so many enemies swear hatred to kings and
sigh for their return one flagrant crime consumed
the regal authority a thousand smouldering
ones eat deep into the consular the
military system stands apart admirable in its
formation and unless that too falls the roman
camps will move forward year after year until
the mountains and the seas italy shall
not contain them they are heirs to the wealth
 wornout nations and when they have seized
upon their inheritance they will fight with
braver the romans will be to italy what the
macedonians at some future day will be to
greece

buildings high antiquity have usually been
carried by the imagination very much higher
stil but by what we hear the tuscanss we
may believe that in their country there are remains
 earlier times than in ours everything
about them shows a pampered and dissolute
and decaying people
you will hardly think a sewer a subject for
curiosity and investigation yet nothing in
europe is so vast and so wellconstructed as
the sewer at rome excepting only the harbourwalls
and propylaea built recently here at
athens under the administration pericles
i have asked him some further questions on the
wonderful work stil extant in the city occupied
by the romans i will now give you his
answer
pericles and aspasia 
do not imagine that unable as i am to
ascertain the time when the great sewer 
rome was constructed i am desirous establishing
one opinion in prejudice another
or forward in denying that a rich corinthian
might have devised so vast an undertaking
but in corinth herself we find nothing equal
magnitude nothing at all resembling its architecture
 the tuscanss who are stated to have
been employed in building it have ceased for
many ages to be capable any thing similar 
all their great fabricks may be dated more thana
thousand years before the age tarquin i
feel no interest in the support an hypothesis
take it or reject it i would rather that you
rejected it if you would replace it with another
and a better many things pass across the
mind which are neither to be detained in it
with the intention insisting on them as truths
nor are to be dismissed from it as idle and in
 pericles and aspasia
trustee whatever gives exercise to our thoughts
gives them not only activity and strength but
likewise range we are not obliged to continue
on the trainingground nor on the other hand
is it expedient to obstruct it or plough it up
the hunter in quest one species game
often finds another and always finds what is
better freshness and earnestness and animation
were i occupied in literature i should little
fear stumbling in my ascent toward its untrodden
and abstruse scenery being a politician i
know that a single false step is a fall and a fall
is ruin we may begin wrong and continue
so with impunity but we must not deviate from
wrong to right
he said this with one his grave smiles 
and then to me
 a slender shrub the ornament your
private walk may with moderate effort be
drawn strait again from any obliquity but such
pericles and aspasia 
an attempt were it practicable would crack
every fibre in the twisted tree that overshadow
the forest
cleone to aspasia
who told you aspasia that instead 
poetry history philosophy our writers
at miletus are beginning to compose a species
 tales founded on love or madness and ending
in miserable death or wealthy marriage 
and that at the conclusion the work a
strict account is rendered all estrays all
that had once come into it and had disappeared
very true the people at large run after the
this is an answer to a letter not extant the
milesian are said to be the inventors tales not
always quite decorous
 pericles and aspasia
detail adventures and are as anxious to seethe
termination as they are to reach the bottom
 an amphora but i beseech you never to
imagine that we are reduced in our literature to
such a state destitution as to be without the
enjoyment those treasures which our ancestors
left behind them no aspasia we are not yet
so famished that a few morsels more nutritious
food would overpower us i assure you
we do not desire to see a death or a marriage
set upon the table every day we are grateful
for all the exercises and all the excursions 
intellect and our thanks are peculiarly due to
those by whose genius our pleasure in them is
increased or varied if we have among us anyone
capable devising an imaginary tale
wherein all that is interesting in poetry is
united with all that is instructive in history
such an author will not supersede the poets and
historians but will walk between them and be
cordially hailed by both

and many tears are shed
upon thy bridalbed
star the swimmer in the lonely night 
who with upbraided hair
wisest a breast so fair
bounding with toil more bounding with delight

but they whose prow hath past thy straits
and ranged before byzantium's gates
bring to the gods sea the victim due
even from the altar raise their eyes
and drop the chalice with surprise
and at such grandeur have forgotten you
at last there swells the hymn praise 
and who inspires those sacred lays

what human power could elevate

hail then miletus hail beloved town
parent me and mine 
but let not power alone be thy renown
nor chiefs ancient line

nor visits the gods unless
they leave their thoughts below
and teach us that we most should bless
those to whom most we owe

restless is wealth the nerves power
sink as a lute's in rain 
the gods lend only for an hour

all else than wisdom she alone

remains as long as godlike men
afford her audience meet
nor time nor war tread down agen
the traces her feet

always hast thou miletus been the friend
protector guardian father the wise 
therefore shall thy dominion never 
til fame despoil'd voice and pinion dies

with favoring shouts and flowers thrown fast behind
arctinus ran his race
no wanderer he alone and blind 
and alexander was unborn by thrace

there have been but not here
rich men who swept aside the royal feast
on child's or bondman's breast
bidding the wise and aged disappear
pericles and aspasia 

revere the aged and the wise
aspasia but thy sandal is not worn
to trample on these things scorn 
by his own sting the firebound scorpion dies
aspasia to cleone
today there came to visit us a writer who is
not yet an author his name is thucydides
we understand that he has been these several
years engaged in preparations for a history
pericles invited him to meet herodotus when
that wonderful man was returning to our
country and about to sail from athens until
then it was believed by the intimate friends 
thucydides that he would devote his life to
poetry and such is his vigour both thought
and expression that he would have been the
 pericles and aspasia
rival pindar even now he is fonder 
talking on poetry than any other subject and
blushed when history was mentioned by degrees
however he warmed and listened with
deep interest to the discourse pericles on the
duties an historian
may our first athenian historian not be the
greatest said he as the first our dramatists
has been in the opinion many aeschylus
was the creator tragedy nor did she ever
shine with such splendour ever move with such
stateliness and magnificence as at her first
apparition on the horizon the verses 
sophocles are more elaborate the language
purer the sentences fuller and more harmonious
but in loftiness soul and in the awfulness
with which he invests his characters
eschylus remains unrivalled and approached
we are growing too loquacious both on
the stage and off we make disquisitions which
pericles and aspasia 
render us only more and more dimsighted and
excursions that only consume our stores if
some among us who have acquired celebrity
by their compositions calm candid contemplative
men were to undertake the history 
athens from the invasion xerxes i should
expect a fair and full criticism on the orations
 antiphon and experience no disappointment
at their forgetting the battle salamis history
when she has lost her muse will lose her
dignity her occupation her character her
name she will wander about the agora she
will start she will stop she will look wild she
will look stupid she will take languidly to her
bosom doubts queries essays dissertations
some which ought to go before her some to
follow and all to stand apart the field 
history should not merely be well tilled but
well peopled none is delightful to me or interesting
in which i find not as many illustrate
pericles and aspasia
vous names as have a right to enter it we
might as well in a drama place the actors behind
the scenes and listen to the dialogue there
as in a history push valiant men back and protrude
ourselves with husky disputations shew
me rather how great projects were executed
great advantages gained and great calamities
averted shew me the generals and the statesmen
who stood foremost that i may bend
to them in reverence tell me their names
that i may repeat them to my children teach
me whence laws were introduced upon what
foundation laid by what custody guarded in
what inner keep preserved let the books
 the treasury lie closed as religiously as
the sibyl's leave weights and measures in
the marketplace commerce in the harbour
the arts in the light they love philosophy in
the shade place history on her rightful throne
and at the sides her eloquence and war
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia try your influence over thucydides 
perhaps he would not refuse you the pleasure
 hearing a few sentences the work he has
begun i may be a plagiary if i am a listener
and yet i would request permission to be present

thucydides was pleased at this deference
and has promised to return soonaspasia
to cleone
polynices a fishmonger has been introduced
upon the stage he had grown rich by his
honesty and good nature and latterly in this
hot season had distributed among the poorer
families the fish he could not sell in the daytime
at a reasonable price others the same
trade cried out against his unfairness and he
was insulted and beaten in the marketplace
so favorable an incident could not escape the
 pericles and aspasia
sagacious scent our comick writers he was
represented on the stage as aiming at supreme
power riding upon a dolphin through a stormy
sea with a lyre in one hand a dogfish in the
other and singing
i whom ye see so high on
a dolphin's backs am not arian
but should the favoring breezes blow me faster
europeans by the gods your master 
the people were very indignant at this and
demanded with loud cries the closing the
theater and the abolition comedies for ever
what the abuse the wisest and most powerful
men in the community could not effect the
abuse a fishmonger has brought about
the writers and actors comedy came in a
body to pericles telling him they had seen the
madness the people and had heard with
wonder and consternation that it was supported
by some the archons
he answered that he was sorry to see
pericles and aspasia 
comedy with a countenance so altered as to
make him tremble for her approaching dissolution
 her descent into the regions tragedy
he wondered how the archons should deem it
expedient to correct those whose office and
employment it had hitherto been to correct
them and regretted his inability to interpose
between two conflicting authorities he must
leave it entirely to the people who would soon
grow calmer and renew their gratitude to their
protectors and patrons
in the midst these regrets the theater for
comedy was closed the poets and actors as
they departed made various observations
dogs sweat and despots laugh inwardly
said heresies did you note his malice the
sisyphus 
we have nothing left for it said 
but to fall upon our knees among the
scales fins and bladders at the fishstall
vol ii d
 pericles and aspasia
better said aristophanes make up to
religion and look whether the haughty chieftain
has no vulnerable place in his heel for an
arrow from that quarter
he has broken your bow said pherecydes 
take heed that the people do not snatch at the
string they have shewn that they can pull
hard and may pull where we would not have
them
aspasia to cleone
thucydides has just left us he has been
reading to me a portion history at every
pause i nodded to pericles who i thought
avoided to remark it purposely but who in
reality was so attentive and thoughtful that it
was long before he noticed me when the reading
was over i said to him
so you two sly personages have laid your
pericles and aspasia 
sober heads together in order to deceive me as
if i am so silly so ignorant peculiarity in
style as not to discover in an instant the fraud
you would impose on me thucydides said
i you have redd it well only one could have
redd it better the author himself shaking
my head at pericles
o aspasia said our guest i confess to
you was always a little too fond praise
although i have lived in retirement to avoid it
until due wishing to receive the whole sum at
once however long i might wait for it but
never did i expect so much as this it overturns
the scale by its weight
o thucydides said pericles i am
jealous aspasia no one before ever flattered
her so in my presence
i entreated him to continue to write and to
bring down his history to the present times
my reverence for herodotus said he
d 
 pericles and aspasia
makes me stand out his way and look at
him from a distance i was obliged to take
another model style i hope to continue my
work beyond the present day and to conclude
it with some event which shall have exalted our
glory and have established our supremacy in
greece
go on said i fear no rivals others
are writing who fear not even herodotus nor
greatly indeed respect him they will be less
courteous with you perhaps whose crown is
yet in the garden the creatures run about
and kick and neigh in all directions with a
gadfly on them ever since they left the racecourse
at olympia at one moment they lay
the muzzle softly and languidly and lovingly
upon each other's neck at another they rear
and bite like python
i ought to experience no enmity from
them said he before my time comes theirs
will be over
pericles and aspasia 
pericles to aspasia
i am pleased with your little note and hope
you may live to write a commentary on the
same author you speak with your usual
judgment in commending our historian for his
discretion in metaphors not indeed that his
language is without them but they are rare
impressive and distinct history wants them
occasionally in oratory they are nearly as requisite
as in poetry they come opportunely
wherever the object is persuasion or intimidation
and no less where delight stands foremost
in writing a letter i would neither seek nor
reject one but i think if more than one came
forward i might decline its services if however
it had come in unawares i would take no
trouble to send it away but we should accustom
ourselves to think always with propriety
 pericles and aspasia
in little things as in great and neither be too
solicitous our dress in the house nor negligent
because we are at home i think it as
improper and indecorous to write a stupid or a
silly note to you as one in a bad hand or on
coarse paper familiarity ought to have another
and worse name when it relaxes in its
attentiveness to please
we began with metaphors i will with
one do not look back over the letter to
see whether have not already used my privilege
 nomination whether my one is not
there take then a simili instead it is a
pity that they are often lamps which light nothing
and show only the nakedness the walls
they are nailed against
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
sophocles left me about an hour ago
hearing that he was with pericles on business
i sent to request he would favor me with
a visit when he was disengaged after he had
taken a seat i entreated him to pardon me expressing
a regret that we hardly ever saw him
knowing as i did that no person could so ill
withstand the regrets the ladies i added a
hope that as much for my sake as for the sake
 pericles he would now and then steal an
hour from the muses in our behalf
lady said he it would only be changing
the place assignation
i shall begin with you said i just as if
i had a right to be familiar and desire you
to explain the meaning a chorus in king
oedipus which although i have redd the tragedy
 pericles and aspasia
many times and have never failed to be present
at the representation i do not quite comprehend

i took up a volume from the table 
no said i this is electro my favorite 
give me the other we unrolled it together

here it is vvhat is the meaning these
vords about the laws p
he looked over them first without opening
his hips then he redd them in a low voice to
himself and then placing the palm his left
hand against his forehead
well i certainly did think i understood
it at the time i wrote it
cleon if you could see him you would fall
in love with him fifteen olympiad have not
quite run away with all his youth what a
noble presence what an open countenance 
what a brow what a mouth what a rich barpericles
and aspasia 
noxious voice what a hearty full passion
and poetry
reply pericles
to the accusation cleon
there is a race men and they appear to
have led colonies into many lands whose courage
is always in an inverse ration to their
danger there is also a race who deem that a
benefit done to another is an injury done to
them would you affront them speak well 
their friends would you deprive them repose
labor and watch incessantly for their country
cleon in all your experience in all the territories
you have visited in all the cities and
islands you have conquered for us have you
never met with any such people and yet o
d 
 pericles and aspasia
generous cleon i have heard it hated that
the observation is owing to you
were my ife a private one were my services
done toward my friends alone had my youth
been exempt as yours hath been from difficulty
and peril i might never have displeased you 
might never have been cited to defend my character
against the foulest imputations o
athenians let me recall your attention to every
word that cleon has uttered i know how difficult
is the task where so much dust is blown
about by so much wind the valorous cleon
has made your ears tingle and ring with harmonious
and aristogiton i am ignorant which 
the two he would take for imitation the handsomer
or the braver he stalks along with
great bustle and magnificence but he shows the
dagger too plainly he neglects to carry it in
myrtle
in your astonishment at this sudden process
and aspasia 
dare there are doubtless many you who are
unable to comprehend the very title the denunciation
let me then tell you what it is
pericles son xanthippus may all
greece hear it may every herald in every city
proclaim it at every gate pericles son 
xanthippiis is accused embezzling thepuhlick
money collected reserved and set apart for the
building and decoration the parthenon the
accuser is cleon son cleceretus
the scribe has designated the father our
friend by this name in letters very legible
otherwise i should have suspected it was the
son clients the parasite the wealthy the
oppressor the poor the assailer the virtuous
and the ridicule all charges more
substantial might surely be brought against me
and indeed were threatened but never shall i
repent having by my advice a little decreased
the revenues the commonwealth in lowering
 pericles and aspasia
the price admission to the theaters and in
offering to the more industrious citizens out 
the publick treasury the trifle requisite for this
enjoyment in the theater let them see before
them the crimes and the calamities power
the vicissitudes fortune and the sophistries
 the passions let it be there and there
only that the just man suffers and that murmurs
are heard against the dispensations the
gods
but am forgetting the accusation will
cleon do me the favour to inform you in what
place i have deposited or in what manner i
have spent the money thus embezzled will
cleon tell you that i alone had the custody 
it or that had any thing at all to do in the
making up the accounts will cleon prove
to you that i am now richer than i was thirty
years ago excepting in a portion the spoil
won bravely by the armies you decreed i should
pericles and aspasia 
command such a portion as the laws allow
and the soldiers carry to their general with triumphant
acclamations cleon has yet to learn
all this certainly his wealth is derived from no
such sources far other acclamations does cleon
court those the idle the dissolute the malignant
the cowardly and the false but if he
seeks them in athens and not beyond his
party is small indeed and your indignation will
drown their voices what need have i pilfer
and peculation am i avaricious am i prodigal
does the indigent citizen does the
wounded soldier come to my door and return
unsatisfied point at me cleon and tell your
friends to mark that let them mark it but
for imitation not for calumny let them hear
for they are idle enough whence i possess the
means relieving the unfortunate raising the
dejected and placing men worth and genius
too often in that number where all their
 pericles and aspasia
fellow citizens may distinguish them my father
died in my childhood careful guardians superintended
it managing my affairs with honesty
and diligence the earliest my ancestors 
whom any thing remarkable is recorded was
cleisthenes whom your forefathers named general
with solon ordering them to conquer
cirrha he devoted his portion the spoils
to the building a portico i never have
heard that he came by night and robbed the
laborers he had paid by day perhaps cleon
has he won afterward at the olympian
games i never have ascertained that he bribed
his adversaries these actions are not in
history nor in tradition but cleon no doubt
has authorities that outvalue tradition and
history some years afterward cleisthenes
proclaimed his determination to give in marriage
his daughter agarista to the worthiest man he
could find whether at home or abroad it is
pericles and aspasia 
pity that cleon was not living in those days
agarista and her father in default him could
hear none worthier than miracles son 
alcmseon their riches all descended to me
and some perhaps their better possessions
these at least with cleon's leave i would
retain and as much the other as may be
serviceable to my friends without being dangerous
to the commonwealth
cleone to aspasia
now we are quiet and at peace again i
wish you would look into your library for more
pieces poetry to give you some provocation
i will transcribe a few lines on the old
subject which like old fountains is inexhaustible
while those later discovery are in danger
 being cut off at the first turn the plough
 pericles and aspasia
ebinna to love

who breathes to thee the holiest prayer
o love is ever least thy care
alas i may not ask thee why tis so 
because a fiery scroll i see
hung at the throne destiny
reason with love and register with woe

few question thee for thou art strong
and laughing loud at right and wrong
seizes and dashes down the rich the poor
thy scepter's iron studs alike
the meaner and the prouder strike
and wise and simple fear thee and adore
aspasia to cleone
among the poems sappho i find the following
but written in a different hand from the
pericles and aspasia 
rest it pleases me at least as much as any 
them if it is worse i wish you would tell mein
what it is so how many thoughts might
she have turned over and tossed away odious
is the economy in preserving all the scraps 
the intellect and troublesome the idleness 
tacking them together sappho is fond 
seizing as she runs on the most prominent and
inviting flowers she never stops to cut and
trim them she throws twenty aside for one
that she fixes in her bosom and what is more
singular her pleasure at their beauty seems
never to arise from another's admiration it
see it or not see it there it is
sweet girls upon whose breast that god descends
whom first ye pray to come and next to spare
o tell me whither now his course he bends
tell me what hymn shall thither waft my prayer
alas my voice and lyre alike he flies
and only in my dreams nor kindly then replies
 pericles and aspasia
cleone to aspasia
instead expatiating on the merits the
verses you last sent me or on the other hand
 looking for any pleasure in taking them to
pieces i venture to hope you will be my
opinion that these others are equal authenticity
neither do i remember them in the
copy you possessed when we were together
sappho to hesperus

i have beheld thee in the morning hour
a solitary star with thankless eyes 
ungrateful as i am who bade thee rise
when sleep all night had wandered from my bower

can it be true that thou art he
who shines now above the sea
pericles and aspasia b
amidst a thousand but more bright 
ah yes the very same art thou
that heard me then and hearest now 
thou keenest star love to throb with light
sappho is not the only poetess who has
poured forth her melodies to hesperus or vho
had reason to thank him i much prefer these
 her's to what appear to have been written by
some confident man and no doubt on a feigned
occasion

hesperus hail thy winking light
best befriends the lover
whom the sadder moon for spite
gladly would discover

thou art fairer far than she
fairer far and chaster 
she may guess who smiled on me
i know who embraced her
 pericles and aspasia

pan arcady twas pan
in the tamariskbushes 
bid her tell thee if she can
where were then her blushes

and were inclined to tattle
i could name a second
whom asleep with sleeping cattle
to her cave she beckon'd

hesperus hail thy friendly ray
watches o'er the lover
lest the nodding leaves betray
lest the moon discover

phryne heard my kisses given
acte's rival bosom 
twas the huts i swore by heaven
bursting into blossom
pericles and aspasia 

what she heard and half espied
by thy gleam she doubted
and with arms uplifted cried
how they must have sprouted 

hesperus hail again thy light
best befriends the lover
whom the sadder moon for spite
gladly would discover
the old poets are contented with narrow
couches but these couches are not stuffed
with chaff which lasts only for one season
they do not talk to us from them when they
are halfasleep but think it more amusing to
entertain us in our short visit with lively
thoughts and fancies than to enrich us with a
paternal prolixity studied and storedup meditations

 pericles and aspasia
pericles to alcibiades
my alcibiades if i did not know your good
temper from a whole life's experience i should
be afraid displeasing you by repeating what i
have heard this is that you pronounce in
publick as well as in private a few words somewhat
differently from our custom you cannot
be aware how much hostility you may excite
against you by such a practice remember
we are athenians and do not let us believe
that we have finer organs quicker perceptions
or more discrimination than our neighbours
every time we pronounce a word differently from
another we show our disapprobation his
manner and accuse him rusticity in all
common things we must do as others do it is
more barbarous to undermine the stability a
language than an edifice that hath stood as
pericles and aspasia 
long this is done by the introduction 
changes write as others do but only as the
best others and if one eloquent man forty
or fifty years ago spoke and wrote differently
from the generality the present follow him
although alone rather than the many but in
pronunciation we are not indulged in this
latitude choice we must pronounce as those
do who favor us with their audience never
hazard a new expression in publick i know
not any liberty we can take even with our
nearest friends more liable to the censure 
vanity whatever we do we must do from authority
or from analogy a young man however
studious and intelligent can know intrinsically
and profoundly but little the writers
who constitute authority for my part in this
our country where letters are far more advanced
than in any other i can name no one whatever
who has followed up to their origin the derivable
pericles and aspasia
tion words or studied with much success
their analogy i do not i confess use all the
words that others do but i never use one that
others do not remember one great writer
may have employed a word which a greater has
avoided or not having avoided it may have
employed in a somewhat different signification
it would be needless to offer you these remarks
if our language were subject to the capriciousness
 courts the humiliation sycophants
and the defilement slaves another may
suffer but little detriment by the admission 
barbarism to its franchises but ours is attick
and the words like the citizens we employ
should at once be popular and select
pericles and aspasia 
cleone to aspasia
the poetical merits the unhappy lesbian
are sufficiently wellknown thanks and more
than thanks if indeed there is any thing more
on earth are due for even one scrap from her
but allow me what is no great delicacy or delight
to me a reprehension a censure an
admirer can make room for it only when it
comes from an admirer sappho in the most
celebrated her odes tells us that she sweats
profusely now surely no female however
lowborn and illbred in short however eolian
could without indecorousness speak sweating
and spitting or any such things we never
ought to utter in relation to ourselves what
we should be ashamed being seen in writing
 war and contention such an expression
is unobjectionable to avoid it by circumlocution
ii e
 pericles and aspasia
tion or by another word less expressive and
direct would be the most contemptible and
ludicrous pedantry and were it anywhere
reduced to practice in the conversation ordinary
life it would manifestly designate a coarsegrained
unpolishable people there is nothing
in poetry or indeed in society so unpleasant as
affectation in poetry it arises from a deficiency
 power and a restlessness pretension
 in conversation from insensibility to the
graces from an intercourse with bad company
and a misinterpretation better
aspasia to cleone
you desire to know what portion history
it is the intention thucydides to undertake
he began with the earlier settlers greece
pericles and aspasia 
but he has now resolved to employ this section
as merely the portico to his edifice the peloponnesian
war appears to him worthier the
historian than any other he is opinion that
it must continue for many years and comprehend
many important events for pericles is resolved
to wear out the energy the spartans
by protracting it at present it has been carried
on but few months with little advantage to
either side and much distress to both what
our historian has read to us does not contain
any part these transactions which however
he carefully notes down as they occur we
were much amused by a speech he selected for
recitation as one delivered by an orator the
corinthians to the ephors lacedaemon
urging the justice and necessity hostilities
never was the athenian character painted in
such true and lively colours in composition
hischaracteristick is brevity yet the first sene

 pericles and aspasia
tetice the volume runs into superfluity the
words to the best my recollection are
these
thucydides athens has composed a history
 the war between the peloponnesian and
athenians
this is enough yet he adds
 as conducted by each the belligerents
 course it could not be conducted by one
only
i observed that in the fourth sentence he
went from the third person to the first
by what i could collect he thinks the peloponnesian
war more momentous than the persian
 yet had xerxespre wailed against us nota
vestige would be existing liberty or civilisation
in the world if sparta should there
will be little enough and a road will be thrown
open to the barbarians the north macedonians
and others with strange names we have
pericles and aspasia 
no great reason to fear it although the policy
 thebes on whom much depends is ungenerous
and unwise
he said moreover that transactions an
earlier time are known imperfectly and were
 small importance either in the wars or anything
else
yet without these wars or some other 
these transactions our miletus and athens our
pericles and thucydides would not be so
much does one thing depend upon another i
am little disposed to overvalue the potency
and importance the eastern monarchies but
surely there is enough to excite our curiosity
and interest our inquiries in the fall chaldea
the rise babylon and the mysteries 
egypt not indeed her mysteries in theology
which are impostures there as elsewhere but
the mysteries in arts and sciences which will
outlive the gods barbarians do not hold
 pericles and aspasia
steadily before us any moral or political lesson 
but they serve as graven images protuberant
eminent and gorgeously uncouth to support the
lamp placed on them by history and philosophy
if we knew only what they said and
did we should turn away with horrour and
disgust but we pound their mummies to
color our narratives and we make them as
useful in history as beasts are in fable
thucydides shews evidently by his preliminary
observations that he considers the trojan
war unimportant yet according to homer
the grecian troops amounted to above a hundred
thousand in reality so large a force hath
never been assembled in any naval expedition
nor even one half how was it provisioned at
aulis how on the shores the road and
all these soldiers with chariots and horses were
embarked for troy a few years after the first ship
 war left the shores greece yes a very few
pericles and aspasia 
years indeed for the argo had among her crew
the brothers helen who cannot well be supposed
to have been ten years older than herself
it is rare occurrence even in the climate 
sparta that a mother bears children after so
long an interval and we have no reason to believe
that such a time had elapsed between the
brothers and their sister suppose the twins to
have been twentytwo years old for they had
become celebrated for horsemanship and boxing
and helen seventeen for her daughter was an
infant and such beauty must have been sought
early in marriage you will find utile space left
between the expeditions
but away with calculation we make a bad
bargain when we change poetry for truth in the
affairs ancient times and by no means a
good one in any
remarkable men remote ages are collected
together out different countries within the
 pericles and aspasia
same period and perform simultaneously the
same action on an accumulation obscure
deeds arises a wild spirit poetry and images
and names burst forth and spread themselves
which carry with them something like enchantment
far beyond the infancy nations what
was vague imagination settles at last and is received
for history it is difficult to effect and
idle to attempt the separation it is like breaking
off a beautiful crystallization from the vault
 some intricate and twilight cavern out 
mere curiosity to see where the accretion terminates
and the rock begins
aspasia to cleone
we have tost another poet and have none
left besides the comick euripides is gone to
pericles and aspasia 
the court archelaus a very few years ago
he gained the prize against all competitors he
was hailed by the people as a deliverer for subverting
the ascendency and dominion which sophocles
had acquired over them the athenians
do not like to trust any man with power
for life sophocles is now an old man sixty
years age at the least and he had then been
absolute in the theater for above a quarter a
century what enthusiasm what acclamations 
for overthrowing the despot who had so often
made them weep and beat their breasts he
came to visit us on the day his defeat euripides
was with us at the time
euripides said he we are here alone
excepting our friends aspasia and pericles i
must embrace you now it cannot seem an act
 ostentation
he did so and most cordially
i should be glad to have conquered you

 pericles and aspasia
continued he it would have been very glorious

i never saw pericles more moved these
are the actions that shake his whole frame and
make his eyes glisten euripides was less affected
he writes tenderly but is not tender
there are hearts that call for imagination 
there are others that create it
i must abstain from all reflections that fall
too darkly on the departed we may see him
no more perhaps i am sorry for it he did
not come often to visit us nor indeed is there
any thing in his conversation to delight or interest
me he has not the fine manners sophocles
nor the open unreserved air which
pericles tells me he admired so much in the
soldierly and somewhat proud eschylus grave
and taciturn i hear like himself unless when
something pleased him and then giving way to
ebullitions and bursts rapture and filling
every one with it round about
pericles and aspasia 
the movers and masters our souls have
surely a right to throw out their urbs as carelessly
as they please on the world that belongs
to them and before the creatures they have
animated it is only such insects as petty autocrat
that feel opprest by it and would sting
them for it pericles is made the same clay
he cannot quite overcome his stateliness but
he bends the more gracefully for bending
slowly
when i think euripides i think how short
a time it is since he was hailed as a deliverer 
and how odious he is become for breaking in
upon our affections at an unseasonable hour
and for carrying our hearts into captivity all
the writers the day were resolved to humble
him and ran about from magistrate to magistrate
to raise money enough for the magnificent
representation his rival i have forgotten
the man's name pericles never thwarts the
b pericles and aspasia
passions and prejudices the citizens in his
adolescence he visited the humble habitation 
the venerable eschylus throughout life he
has been the friend sophocles he has comforted
euripides in his defeats telling him that
by degrees he would teach the people to be
better judges he rejoiced with him on his first
victory reminding him his prophecy and remarking
that they two all the athenians
had shown the most patience and had been the
best rewarded for it
we hope he may return
first speech pericles to the athenians
on the declarations corinth and lacedaemon
the regency at lacedsemon has resolved to
make an irruption into attica if we attempt
any thing adverse to potidaea hearing that on
pericles and aspasia 
the declaration hostilities by corinth we ordered
the potidseans whose infidelity we had
detected to demolish the wall facing fallen
in reliance on their treason perdiccas and the
corinthians had entered into confederacy and
were exciting the defection our thracian
auxiliaries perdiccas prevailed with the chaldeans
to dismantle all their towns upon the
seaside and to congregate in olynthus we
made a truce and afterwards a treaty with
perdiccas he evacuates the territory he had
invaded we strictly beleaguer the revolted 
the ephors lacedsemon now summon
to appear before them not only their allies but
whosoever has any complaint to prefer against
the athenians hereupon the megareans come
forward and protest that they have been prohibited
from our markets contrary to treaty
and what is worse that we exclude them from
the possession potidsea so convenient for exod
pericles and aspasia
tending their power and authority into thrace
they appear in their long oration to have forgotten
nothing unless that they had murdered
our citizens and embassadors
by what right o athenians is lacedaemon
our judge corinth may impel her into war
against us but corinth can never place her on
the judgmentseat greece nor shall their
united voices make us answer to the citation
we will declare not to her but to all our reasons
and our rights the corcyreans had
erected a trophy at lucina and had spared
after the victory their corinthian captives they
had laid waste the territory leucas and they
had burnt the arsenal college meanwhile
the corinthians sent embassadors to every
power in the peloponese and enlisted mariners
for their service upon every coast if
valour and skill and constancy could have
availed the corcyreans they would have conpericles
and aspasia 
tinned to abstain as they had ever done from
all alliances they only sought ours when
destruction was imminent knowing that in
policy and humanity we never could allow the
extinction one grecian state nor consequently
the aggrandisement and preponderance
 another and least so when the insolence 
corinth had threatened our naval ascendancy
by which all greece was saved and the rivalry
 lacedsemon our equality on land by our
treaty with the lacedaemonianss it is provided
that if any community be not in alliance with
one the parties it may confederate with
either at its discretion and this compact it
was agreed should be binding not only on the
principals but likewise on the subordinates in
such a predicament stands corcyra
it might behove us to chastise the inhumanity
 a nation which like corinth would devour
her own offspring but it certainly is most just
s pericles and aspasia
and most expedient when instead reasoning
or conferring with us on the propriety our
interference she runs at once to sparta conspiring
with her to our degradation and if
possible to our ruin satisfactorily to demonstrate
our justice and moderation i advise that
we stipulate with corcyra for mutual defence
never for aggression and admitting no article
which even by a forced interpretation may contravene
our treaty with lacedsemon
second speech pericles
the jealousy that sparta hath ever entertained
against us was declared most flagrantly
when leotychides who commanded the grecian
forces at mycale drew away with him all the
confederates the peloponese we continued
pericles and aspasia 
to assail the barbarians until we drove them
from sestos their last hold upon the hellespont
it was then and then only that the athenians
brought back again from miserable refuge their
wives and children and began to rebuild their
habitations and walls for their defence did
the spartans view this constancy and perseverance
with admiration and with pity as the
patriotick the generous the humane would do 
did they send embassadors to congratulate your
fathers on their valour their endurance their
prosperous return their ultimate security 
embassadors they sent indeed but insisting
that our walls should never rise again from their
ruins a proposal so unjust and arrogant we
treated with scorn and indignation when our
numbers were diminished and our wealth exhausted
shall we bend to their decisions and
obey their orders now if their power injuring
us were in proportion to their malice
 pericles and aspasia
their valour to their pride or their judgment to
their ferocity then were they most formidable
indeed but turn we to the examination facts
having occasion to reduce to obedience a few
revolted helots in the city ithome to whom
did they apply to the athenians for they
themselves were utterly ignorant how to attack
or even to approach a fortress even then
they showed their jealousy rewarding our
promptitude to assist them by the ignominious
dismissal our troops what was the consequence
 a ten years siege and these o
athenians are the men who now threaten the
acropolis and piraeus 
i can compare the lacedaemonianss to nothing
more fitly than to the heads spears without
the shafts there would be abundantly the
power doing mischief were there only the
means and method directing it where
these are wanting we have no better cause for
pericles and aspasia 
apprehension than at the sparks fire under
our horse's hoof lest they produce a conflagration
 which indeed they might do if by their
nature they were durable and delectable
let us see what powerful aid our enemies are
expecting what confederates they are stirring
up against us the megareans who left their
alliance for ours the megareans whom we
defended against the corinthians and whose
walls we constructed at our own expense from
megara to nisaea is it on the constancy or
on the gratitude this people that lacedaemon
in her wisdom so confidently relies no sooner
had we landed in euboea than intelligence was
brought us that the peloponnesian were about
to make an incursion into attica that the
athenian garrison was murdered by the megameans
who already had formed a junction with
the corinthians sicilians and epidaurus
we sailed homeward and discomfited the pelops
pericles and aspasia
designs returned and reduced euboea a
truce for thirty years was granted to lacedaemon
restoring to her nissea colchis pegs
and brazen five years afterwards a war broke
out between the samian and miletus justice
and our treaties obliged us to rescue that faithful
and unfortunate city from the twofold calamity
that impended over her many the
samian were as earnest in imploring our assistance
as the milesian were for whatever might
be the event the war they were sure being
reduced to subjection if conquered by a
wronged and exasperated enemy if conquerors
by the king a rapacious and insolent oligarchy
saw no other means retaining its usurped
authority than by extending it with rigour and
were conscious that it must fall from under
them unless the sceptre propt it honest men
will never seek such aid and free men will
never endure such
pericles and aspasia
there may be nations monarch and aristocratical
where the publick good is little thought
oi and often impeded by restless steps toward
personal or family aggrandisement but there
is no man even among these so barbarous and
inhumane as to be indifferent to the approbation
 some one in his city beloved above all
the rest from whom the happy rush forward for
admiration the less fortunate are gratified with
a tear life they would tell us is well lost for
either we athenians have loftier views and
i will not say purer but the same and more
ardent aspirations
in the late brief war the greater part you
here present have won immortal glory and let
us not believe that those who fell from your
ranks in battle are yet insensible to the admiration
and the gratitude their countrymen no
one among us whatever services he may have
rendered to athens has received such praises
 pericles and aspasia
such benedictions such imperishable rewards as
they have happy men they are beyond the
reach calumny and reverses there is only
one sad reflection resting with them they can
serve their country no more how high was the
value their lives they knew it and bartered
them for renown we in this war unjustly
waged against us shall be exposed to fewer
dangers but more privations in the endurance
 these cur manliness will be put severely to
the proof and virtues which have not been
called forth in fifty years virtues which our
enemies seem to have forgotten that we possess
must again come into action as if under the
eyes a themistocles and an aristides we
have all done much but we have all done less
than we can do ought to do and will do
archidamus king sparta now about to
march against us is bound to me by the laws 
hospitalityshould he whether in remem
pericles and aspasia 
france these or in the design rendering
me suspected abstain from inflicting on my
possessions the violence he is about to inflict on
the rest attica let it be understood that
henceforth i have no private property in this
land but in the presence the gods make a
free donation it to the commonwealth let
all withdraw their cattle corn and other effects
from the country and hold athens as one great
citadel from which the deity who presides over
her hath forbidden us to descend
oration pericles
on the approach the lacedaemonian to athens
long ago and lately and in every age intervening
o athenians have you experienced
 pericles and aspasia
the jealousy and insolence lacedaemon she
listens now to the complaints corinth because
the people corcyra will endure no longer her
vexations and because their navy in which the
greater part the mariners have fought and
conquered by the side ours seek refuge in
the piraeus a little while ago she dared to insist
that we should admit the ships megara to
our harbour her merchandize to our markets
when megara had broken her faith with us and
gone over to the spartans even this indignity
we might perhaps have endured we told the
lacedaemonianss that we would admit the megarians
to that privilege if the ports sparta
would admit us and our allies although we and
our allies were never in such relationship with
her and therefore could never have fallen oif
from her she disdained to listen to a proposal
so reasonable to a concession so little to be expericles
and aspasia 
petted from us resolved to prove to her that
generosity and not fear dictated it we chastised
the perfidious megara
the king the lacedaemonian archidamus
a wiser and honest man than any his people
is forced to obey the passions he would
control and an army sixty thousand men is
marching under his command to ravage attica
the braver will rather burn their harvests than
transfer to a sanguinary and insatiable enemy
the means inflicting evil on their relatives and
friends few i trust are base enough sacrilegious
enough to treat as guests those whom
you before men and gods denounce as enemies
we will receive within our walls the firm and
faithful and now let those orators who have
blamed our expenditure in the fortification 
the city tell us again that it was improvident
they would be flying in dismay had not those
bulwarks been raised effectually did it re
vol ii f
 pericles and aspasia
quire any sagacity to foresee that athens would
be the envy every state around was there
any man so ignorant as not to know that he
who has lost all his enemies will soon lose all his
energy and that men are no more men when
they cease to act than rivers are rivers when
they cease to run the forces our assailants
must be broken against our walls our fleets
are our farms henceforward until the spartans
find that if they can subsist on little they cannot
so well subsist on stones and ashes their
forces are vast but vast forces have never much
hurt us marathon and plataea were scarcely
wide enough for our trophies a victorious army
an unvanquished fleet miltiades himself retired
unsuccessful from the rock paros shall
we tremble then before a tumultuous multitude
ignorant how cities are defended or assailed
shall we prevent them from coming to their
discomfiture and destruction firmly do i bepericles
and aspasia 
lieve that the protectress our city leads them
against it to avenge her cause they may
ravage the lands they cannot cultivate they
cannot hold them mischief they will do and
great much our time much our patience
much our perseverance and something our
courage are required at present i do not
number this event among our happiest we
must owe our glory partly to ourselves and
partly to our enemies they offer us the means
 greatness let us accept the offer brief
danger is the price long security the countryman
from the mists the morning not only
foretells the brightness the day but discerns
in them sources fertility and he remembers
in his supplications to the immortal gods to
thank them alike for both blessings it is thus
o men athens that you have constantly
looked up at calamities never have they depressed
you always have they chastened your
f
 pericles and aspasia
hearts always have they exalted your courage
impelled by the breath xerxes the locusts
 asia consumed your harvests your habitations
crumbled away as they swarmed along
the temples the gods lay prostrate the gods
themselves bowed and fell the men athens
rose higher than ever they had turned their
faces in grief from the scene devastation and
impiety but they listened to a provident valour
and the myriads insects that had plagued
them were consumed
there is affront in exhortation i have
spoken
aspasia to cleone
on the shore overlooking the fountain 
arethusa there is a statue eschylus an
pericles and aspasia 
athenian who went to visit it crowned it with
bay and ivy and wrote these verses at the base
stranger athenian hands adorn
a bard thou knowest well
ah do not ask where he was born
for we must blush to tell
proud are we but we place no pride
on good or wise or brave 
hence what ephesus had denied
twas arethusa gave
you remember the story a barbarous king
who would have kept the muses in captivity
his armoury furnished an enemy the poet
lysis with these materials for skirmishing
to lysis
a curse upon the king old
who would have kidnap all the muses 
whether to barter them for gold
or keep them for his proper uses
 pericles and aspasia
lysis aware he meant them ill
birds they became and flew away 
thy muse alone continues still
a titmouse to this very day
aspasia to cleone
after an interval nearly three years
comedy may reappear on the stage it is reported
that pericles obtained this indulgence
from the archons and in consequence it he
is now represented by the dramatists as a jupiter
who lightens and thunders and what not
before he became a jupiter i believe he was
represented as the enemy that god and most
 the others and the people having no publick
amusement no diversion to carry off their
illhumours listened gloomily to such discourses
pericles noted it and turned them into their
fold again and had them piped to but not be 
fore the fly entered the fleece
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
twenty days o cleon twenty days are not
elapsed since anaxagoras told me that he was
about to leave attica for the propontis i
urged him to alter his resolution he affirmed
that his presence in the house pericles had
brought a cloud over it which would only disappear
by his absence late said he
i have received so much kindness from the
philosophers that i begin to suspect a change
 fortune by no means in my favour i must
fly while the weather is temperate as the
swallows do
he mixes not with the people he converses
with none them and yet he appears to have
penetrated into the deepest and darkest recesses
 their souls
pericles has lost their favour anaxagoras is
 pericles and aspasia
banished aspasia but what is aspasia
yours and therefore you must hear about her
we have all been accused impiety anaxagoras
and myself have been brought to trial
for the offence diopithes is the name our
accuser he began with anaxagoras and
having proved by three witnesses that he in their
hearing had declared his opinion that lightning
and thunder were the effect some combustion
and concussion in the clouds and that they
often happened when jupiter was in perfectly
good humour and not thinking at all
about the athenians there was instantly such
a rage and consternation in the whole assembly
that the judges were called upon from every
quarter to condemn him for impiety sentence
death
pericles rose he for the first time in his
life was silenced by the clamorous indignation
 the people all parties all classes men
pericles and aspasia 
women children priests sailors tavernkeepers
diviners slavemerchants threatened raved
foamed
pericles you yourself will soon be cited
before this august tribunal said diopithes
the clamour now began to subside curiosity
wonder apprehension consequences divided
the assembly and when pericles lifted up his
arm the agitation the murmurs and the whispers
ceased
o men athens said he calmly i
wish it had pleased the gods that the vengeance
 diopithes had taken its first aim
against me whom you have heard so often
known so long and trusted so implicitly but
diopithes hath skulked from his ambush and
seized upon the unsuspecting anaxagoras in
the hope that few knowing him few can
love him the calculation diopithes is correct
they who love him are but those few
f
 pericles and aspasia
they however who esteem and reverence him
can only be numbered by him who possesses a
register all the wise and all the virtuous menin
greece
anaxagoras stept forward saying
 you o athenians want defenders and
will want them more i look for protection to
no mortal arm i look for it to that divine
power the existence which my accuser tells
you i deny
he shirks the thunder said one
he sticks to the blind side jupiter
said another
such were the observations the pious and
malicious who thought to expiate all their sins
by throwing them on his shoulders and driving
him out the city he was condemned by a
majority voices pericles followed him through
the gates beyond the fury his persecutors
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
three days after the banishment anaxagoras
the threat diopithes was carried into effect
not against the person pericles but against your
aspasia diopithes had himsek denounced me on
the same count as anaxagoras and hermippus
whose entire life has been they tell me one
sluggish stream gross impurities impeached
me as a corrupters the publick morals
you will imagine my cleon that something
loose and lascivious was brought forward in
accusation against me no such thing nothing
 the kind is considered as having any
concern with publick morals here in athens
my crime was seducing young men from their
parents and friends retaining them in conversation
at our house encouraging them to study
the sciences in preference to the machinations
 pericles and aspasia
 sophists to leave the declaimers an empty
room for the benefit their voices and to
adhere more closely to logick before they
venture upon rhetorick
you will nov perceive that all who have the
most interest and the most exercise in the various
artifices deception were my enemies i
feared lest pericles should run farther into the
danger losing his popularity by undertaking
my defence and resolved to be my own pleader
the hour had been appointed for opening the
trial i told him it was one hour later when
it was nearly at hand i went out the house
unobserved and took my place before the assembly
 the people my words were these
if any the accusations brought against
me were wellfounded they would have been
known to pericles it would be strange were
he indifferent to any offence mine against the
laws especially such as you accuse me unless
pericles and aspasia 
he is as the accusation would imply insensible
to honour propriety and decency is this his
character he never has had an enemy bold
and false enough to say it i wonder at this
yet he never has
the people who had been silent now began
to favor me when diopithes asked me whether
i could deny my conversations with anaxagoras
and my adherence to his tenets
love truth pity for anaxagoras and pride
it may be in the strength mind he had
given me and in the rejection unworthy
notions on the gods urged me to say
i deny no conversation i ever had with
him no tenet i ever received no duty i ever
learnt from him he taught me veneration for
the gods and i pray them to render me grateful
for it
pericles at this moment stood at my side
indignation that he should have followed anax
 pericles and aspasia
agoras out the gates and should have embraced
him affectionately at parting turned
many furious faces furious cries and furious
gestures against him he looked round disdainfully
and said aloud
respect the laws and the unfortunate you
who revere the gods 
it was net the condemned man i followed
out the city it was age which would have
sunk under blows it was rectitude which
feared not death it was friendship which if i
cannot make you esteem i will not implore
you to pardon
at last o athenians my enemies and
yours have persuaded you to assemble in this
place and to witness the humiliation and affliction
 one who never failed to succour the
unfortunate and who has been the solace 
my existence many years am i all in
athens the man who should mistake crimes for
pericles and aspasia ill
virtues the man pointed out from among the
rest as the most insensible to his dignity
how widely then have you erred in calling me
to your counsels how long how wilfully how
pertinaciously is it not easier to believe that
two or three are mistaken now than that you
all together with your fathers and best friends
whose natal days and days departure from
us you still keep holy have been always so 
hermippus and diopithes seeing that many
were moved interrupted him furiously
o pericles cried hermippus we are
aware that this woman ionia this milesian
this aspasia entertains the same opinions as
yourself
highly criminal answered pericles with
a smile i hope no other athenian is cursed
with a wife liable to so grievous an accusation
scoffer cried diopithes dare you deny
that in the summer this very year when you
 pericles and aspasia
were sailing to lay waste the coasts the pelo
ponese you attempted to pervert the religion 
the sailors the sun was suddenly bedimmed 
darkness came over the sea as far even as unto
our city the pilot fell upon his face and
prayed and did not you o pericles raise him
up with one hand and throwing your mantle
over his eyes with the other ask whether he
found any thing dreadful in it and when he
answered in his piety it is not that's did not
you reply
 the other darkness is no otherwise different
than in its greater extent and produced by
somewhat larger than my mantle 
proceed to interrogate said pericles
answer that first o sacrilegious man 
exclaimed diopithes
athenians said pericles many you
here present were with me in the expedition
do assure diopithes that it was not my
pericles and aspasia 
mantle which darkened the sea and sun
that to your certain knowledge both sun and
sea were dark before i took it off so that
the gods if they were angry at all were
angry earlier in the day and not only did the
sun shine out again bright and serene as ever
but the winds were favorable the voyage prosperous
the expedition successful
it appears to me that the gods are the most
angry when they permit the malicious and the
false to prevail over the generous and simplehearted
 when they permit the best affections
to be violated and the worst to rise up in disorder
to our ruin nor do i believe that they
are very well pleased at hearing their actions
and motives called in question or at winks and
intimations that they want discernment to find
out offenders and power and justice to punish
them
 pericles and aspasia
in spite philosophers cried diopithes
we have still our gods in athens
and our men too replied he or these
before me must only be the shadows those
who but lately under my command won eternal
renown in samos
tears rose into his eyes they were for me 
but he said in a low voice audible however in
the silence that had succeeded to a loud and
almost universal acclamation
at least for our lost comrades a few tears
are not forbidden us
the people struck their breasts the judges
unanimously acquitted me surrounded pericles
and followed us home with enthusiastic
congratulations
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia to cleone
never did our house receive so many visitors
as on my acquittal not only our friends and
acquaintances but every one who had fought
under pericles came forward to offer his felicitations
and his services i was forgotten 
the danger the insult seemed his when they
had all retired to dinner he too left me with
my musick and i did not see him again until
late the next morning it was evident he had
slept but little he came up to me and pressing
my hand said 
aspasia have gained a great victory 
the greatest the most glorious and the only one
not subject to a reverse
i thought his words related to his defence 
me i was mistaken
it was yesterday for the first time said he
 pericles and aspasia
that i knew the extent my power i could
have demolished the houses my adversaries 
i could have exiled them from the city i
could have been their master i am more i
am my own
great injuries create great power no feeble
virtues are necessary to its rejection in polity
continued he the humble may rise but
not the fallen states live but once had i
no aspasia no children i am ignorant what
support i could have found against the impulses
 ambition many who seize upon kingly
power are the more desirous possessing it
because they have sons to succeed them imprudent
men they expose those sons to infinite
dangers and create no new advantages for
them if they provided for their security they
would abdicate their power when about to betaken
away by death from those over whom they
exercised it if they provided for their glory
i
pericles and aspasia 
they would not subject them to the reproach
always merited possessing less activity and
sagacity than their father do they care about
their wisdom or their virtue they will not cast
them among idlers and sycophants nor abandon
them in a solitary island where many sing and
none discourse what life is wretched what
state more abject
yours my dear pericles said i is far
happier but by no means enviable
true answered he i am subject to
threats curses denunciations ostracism and
hemlock but i glory in the glory the state
and i know that i can maintain it
i was listening with attention when he said
to me with an air playfulness
am i not a boaster am i not proud 
my command am i not overfond it when
i am resolved not to transmit it hereditarily to
another 
 pericles and aspasia
rightly judged dear pericles said i 
you always act judiciously and kindly
political men like goats continued he
usually thrive best among inequalities i have
chosen the meadow and not on the whole imprudently
my ife has been employed in
making it more pleasurable more even more
productive the shepherds have often quarrelled
with me and but now the sheep too in
their wisdom turned their heads against me
we went into the air and saw alcibiades
walking in the garden he not observing us
strode along rapidly striking with his cane
every tree in the alley when we came up
nearer he was repeating
the fanatical knaves i would knock the
heads off all their mercuries
noisy demagogues i would lead them into
the midst the enemy i would drag them
on by the ears not fifty should return they
pericles and aspasia 
in their audacity impeach aspasia they bring
tears into the eyes pericles i will bring
more into theirs by holy jupiter 
he started at our approach my husband
laid his hands upon the youth's shoulder and
said to him
but alcibiades if you do not lead fifty
back where will you leave the captives 
he sprang to the neck his uncle and
turning his face toward me blushed and
whispered
did she too hear me 
aspasia to pericles
i would not disturb you my beloved pericles
 but let not any thing else why are you
so busy now the danger is over why do so many
come to you with countenances so earnest when
 pericles and aspasia
they enter and so different from composed when
they go away you never break your resolutions
otherwise i should fear they might lead
you above the place fellowcitizen then
farewell happiness farewell manliness security
sincerity affection honour 
o pericles descend from the car victory
on the course itself in abandoning power and
station what do you abandon but inquietude
and ingratitude 
pericles to aspasia
we never alight from a carriage while it is
going down a hill but always at the top or at
the bottom there is less danger in being
shaken out than there is in leaping out
were at this juncture to abdicate my author
and aspasia 
city i should appear to the people to confess a
fault and to myself to commit one
i must defend those who would have defended
me rely on my firmness in all things on
pericles one immutable
aspasia to cleone
alcibiades will one time or other bring us
all into peril by his recklessness and precipitation

when he heard i was arraigned and pericles
threatened he ran from house to house among
the officers the army embraced them knelt
before them adjured them to save their general
from ignominy his wife from insult the city
fi'om mourning and themselves from inactivity
he swore that if they would not he would 
vol n g
 pericles and aspasia
that two thousand the same age or rather
older would join him and obey him and that
he would throw judges accusers applauders
listeners over the piraeus not a soldier did
he pass without a kiss without a pressure 
the hand without a promise not a girl in
athens that was not his sister not a matron
that was not his mother
within an hour in every part the city there
were cries
the lacedaemonianss have none these
rogues among them
no accusers there no judges there
archidamus is wise pericles is wiser 
shall the one be a king the other a culprit
shall his warhorse cried a soldier carry
paniers 
forefoot and hindfoot say i cried another
 against these marketplace swine these
blackmuzzled asses 
pericles and aspasia 
gut upon them what have they won for
us cried another
and what have we not won for them 
roared the next
what was all the stir about asked one
more quiet they dared to accuse our general
 denying their dues to the gods liars 
he gives every man his due a laugh arose
no laughing here i uphold it we soldiers
can take as good care the gods as they can
who believes they ever were in danger pericles
might have cracked them by the dozen 
he has left them all standing not a head missing
save him comrades from the cowards
the poisoners
on all sides the city the soldiers ran to
their officers and then toward the house 
pericles it was with difficulty he could dissuade
them from their resolution to confer upon
him the same authority and station as archida
mus holds among the spartans
g
 pericles and aspasia
we shall then meet the enemy upon equal
terms said they ay more than equal affability
for moroseness liberality for parsimony
the greater part the citizens would have
followed the turbulent for change the peaceable
for tranquility
my husband has allayed the tempest his
ambition is higher nothing can be taken from
the name pericles and what is added to it
must be baser metal
jd aspasia
tireless i will tell you and aspasia what is
lampsacus
shrimps and oysters are the lower order 
the inhabitants and these it is pretended have
reason to complain the aristocracy above
them the aristocracy on their side contend
that such complaints are idle and unfounded
that they are well fed and well clothed and
that the worst that ever happens to them is to
be taken out their beds and to be banded
marshalled and embarked in the service 
their country in few more words we all are
either fishermen or vinedressers i myself ama
chief proprietor my tenement is small but
my vineyard is as spacious as any about it is
nearly a hundred my paces broad its length
i cannot tell you for in this direction it is too
steep for me to walk up it my neighbours
have informed me that there is a fine spacious
view the hellespont and headlands from the
pericles and aspasia 
summit i only know that there is a noble
god a century old at the least he who protects
our gardens and vines an image him
stands either at the top or the bottom every
avenue in the vicinity he frowns in many 
them yet amid all his threats there is in his
goodhumoured gravity something like a halfinvitation
the boys and girls write verses under
him very derogatory to his power and
dignity they usually write them i understand
in one another's name just as if he
could not find them out and would not punish
them in due season enough this i have
somewhat less to say about myself the people
love me for i am no philosopher here and have
scarcely a in the house i begin to find
that eyes are valuables and books utensils
sitting at my door i am amused at the whistle
 curlews and at their contentions and evolutions
for a better possession than a rabble's ear
 pericles and aspasia
sometimes i go down and enjoy a slumber on
the soft deep sands an unexpected whisper and
gentle flap on the face from the passing breeze
awakens me or a startling plash from the
cumbersome wave as it approaches nearer
idleness is as dear to me reflection as intense
and friendship as warm as ever yes pericles 
friendship may pause may question may agonize
but her semblance alone can perish
my moon is in the last quarter and my days
ought now to be serene they are so be yours
no less yours and aspasia's 
pericles to aspasia
one true and solid blessing i owe to my
popularity seldom is it that popularity has
afforded any man more than a fallacious one
pericles and aspasia 
late wisdom and dearly bought is mine aspasia
 but i am delaying your delight at one
moment by the hurry my spirits at another
by the intensity my reflections our pericles
is athenian in privileges as in birth i
have obtained a law to revoke a former one enforced
by me and felt no shame if i could
hope that other statesmen would take example
from my faults if i could hope that at any
future time they would cease to be operative
imperious and selfwilled mistaking the eminence
 station for the supremacy wisdom i
would entreat them to urge no measure in
which might be traced the faintest sign 
malice or resentment whether in regard to
parties or individuals but alas the inferior
part man is the stronger we cannot cut the
centaur in twain we must take him as we find
him composed and derive all the advantage we
can both from his strength and his weakness
 pericles and aspasia
i am growing the politician again when i
should be the husband and father
the odious law the weight which i drew
upon my own heads is abrogated the chili
is stated in every life pericles that he obtained
the enactment it this is incorrect the
law was an ancient one and required fresh vigour and
vigilant observance at a time when hostilities were
imminent and when many thousands were residing in
the city who would otherwise have claimed a right to
vote as citizens while their connexions were to be
found among the inveterate enemies or the seceding
allies athens long antecedently to the administration
 pericles it appears that at a certain age the
illegitimate were assembled at cynosure in the
wrestlingring dedicated to hercules who himself
was in that predicament and these alone entered
it on which occasion themistocles his mother
being a thracian gave the earliest proof his
astuteness by inviting some unmixt blood and
aristocratical lineage to wrestle with him it is far
pericles and aspasia 
drew women not athenian are declared free
citizens many good men many good mothers
have mourned the degradation theirs through
my severity
how dear above the sweetest spring are
the blossoms that appear in the less genial
hours winter how dear above earth above
all things upon earth aspasia will pardon this
whether true or false is our little pericles 
am i dreaming when i imagine i see this
beautiful boy with health and hope beside
him kneeling on the border the tomb and
raising up from it a whole family in long
perspective we were gone i thought we
were lost for ever the powerful father merged
from improbable that pericles insisted the rather
on the execution this law in opposition to cimon
whose father miltiades had married the daughter 
chorus a prince thrace and who himself was
descended also from a ruler that nation
 pericles and aspasia
his whole progeny in utter darkness an infant
shall reclaim it
no longer is there a cloud upon my brow
no longer is there i am apt to think a pestilence
in athens
aspasia to pericles
blessings on the generosity the athenians 
blessings a thousand fold on the paternal heart
 pericles 
o pericles how wrong are all who do not
for ever follow love under one form or other 
there is no god but he the framer the preserver
 the world the pure intelligence all
wisdom that is not enlightened and guided by
him is perturbed and perverted he will shed
o my husband his brightest tints over our
pericles and aspasia 
autumnal days were we ever happy until
now ah yes we were but undeserving
a fresh fountain opens before us subject to no
droughts no overflowing how gladly how
gratefully do i offer to immortal love the first
libation 
come hither my sweet child come hitherto
my heart thou art man thou art athenian
thou art free we are now beyond the reach
beyond the utmost scope and vision calamity

aspasia to cleone
alcibiades is now grown up to the highest
beauty adolescence i think i should be
enamoured him were i a girl and disengaged
no cleon the so easy mention 
him proves to me that i never should be he
 pericles and aspasia
is petulant arrogant impetuous and inconsistent
pericles was always desirous that he
should study oratory in order that it might keep
him at home gratify his vanity the most perfectly
and compendiously and render him
master his own thoughts and those others
he plainly told pericles that he could learn
little from him except dissimulation
even that replied pericles is useful and
necessary it proceeds from selfcommand simulation
on the contrary is falsehood and
easily acquired by the meanest intellect a
powerful man often dissembles he stands erect
in the course glory with open brow but with
breath supprest the feebler mind is ready to
take refuge in its poverty under the sordid garb
 whining simulation
he then remarked to pericles that his oratory
was somewhat like his economy wanting
in copiousness and display
pericles and aspasia 
alcibiades said my husband it is particularly
this part it which i could wish you
to adopt in oratory there are few who can
afford to be frugal in economy there are few
who can afford to act otherwise than frugally
i am a publick man and it little becomes me
to leave room for suspicion that by managing
ill my own small affairs i may be negligent in
the greater the commonwealth there are
kingdoms in thrace and asia where the cares
 government are consigned to ministers or
satraps and where it shall be thought honorable
and glorious in one these functionaries to
die in debt after managing the treasury but
surely there is in this no proof whatever that he
managed it discreetly on the contrary there is
a fair presumption that neglecting his household
he left the community in worse disorder
unquestionably he was a dishonest man to incur
a debt beyond the extent his estate 
pericles and aspasia
balance from accumulation in his own house
can hardly be deemed a merit by the most inconsiderate
in one who can unlock the treasury
to every relative every friend every associate
and every dependent such persons will
generally be found to have been gamesters and
prodigals and to have entrusted the subordinate
branches publick concerns to servants as unfaithful
and improvident as those menials who
administered their own and the reigns the
princes who employed them if recorded at all
are recorded as prodigies expenditure profligacy
and disaster
aristides died poor but aristides never
was rich he threw away nothing but his good
example and was his the fault there he
was frugal he was provident every action he
performed every word he uttered will excite
inform and direct remotest generations thus
indeed it cannot properly be said that however
pericles and aspasia 
now neglected his example was thrown away
like the seeds plants which a beneficent
god hath scattered throughout the earth although
many fail to come up in the season 
their sowing or soon after yet do they not decay
and perish but germinate in the sterile
soils many ages later aristides will be forefather
to many brave and honest men not descended
from his lineage nor his country he
will be the founder more than nations he
will give body vitality and activity to sound
principles had he merely been a philosopher he
could effect little this commander as he was
imperial persia served only for a mirrour to reflect
his features from attica on the world
alcibiades in several parts this discourse
had given signs weariness and impatience
pericles perceived it and reverted to aristides
at every word that was now spoken he grew
more and more animated at the close he
 pericles and aspasia
sprang up seized the hand pericles and told
him he would listen as long as he went on in
that manner
speak to the purpose as you have begun
to do and all about aristides and i shall like
you better than aspasia i think after all i
may perhaps let you be my teachers he said
this laughing
my husband replied
i will not undertake it alcibiades peradventure
i may offer you from time to time a
little at once some serviceable observations
some fruits my experience but it is only to
grace and beauty that your restless intractable
mind is obedient for an hour
call me any thing do any thing or nothing
said the youth if you will only give
me such a smile again
go and ride into the country said my
husband as he was rising if you retain
pericles and aspasia 
your high opinion me on your return you
will find me at leisure to continue i leave you
for the present with aristides
away he went without a word more to either
 us when he was out the apartment
pericles said after a thoughtful and serious
pause
he is as beautiful playful and uncertain
as any hartamed young tiger feasted and caressed
on the royal carpets persepolis not
even aspasia will ever quite subdue him
cleone to aspasia
i shall never more be in fear about you my
aspasia frolicksome and giddy as you once
appeared to me at no time your life could
alcibiades have interested your affections you
 pericles and aspasia
will be angry with me when i declare to you
that i do not believe you ever were in love
the renown and genius pericles won your
imagination his preference his fondness his
constancy hold and will for ever hold your
heart the very beautiful rarely love at all
those precious images are placed above the
reach the passions time alone is permitted
to efface them time the father the gods
and even their consumer
aspasia to cleone
angry yes indeed very angry am i but
let me lay all my anger in the right place i
was often jealous your beauty and i have
told you so a thousand times nobody for many
years ever called me so beautiful as cleon
pericles and aspasia 
and when some people did begin to call me so
i could not believe them few will allow the
first to be first but the second and third are
universal favorites we are all insurgents
against the despotism excellence
ah cleon if i could divide my happiness
with you i do think i should have much to give
you i would demand a good deal your sound
judgment for it but you should have it we
both us value our beauty i suspect less than
we used to do which is certainly wrong for
whatever we may be told or may tell ourselves
we have rather a scantier store it however
we are not yet come to the last loaf in the
citadel
i did not see alcibiades again that day or
the following when he came to me he told
me he was ashamed having said an uncivil
thing
 which are you ashamed said i o
vol il l
 pericles and aspasia
alcibiades for there were several not distinguished
for courtesy
as usual in good humour which always
punishes me said he but i remember i
made a rude observation on what lies within
your department
economy said i
before he could answer me pericles informed
that alcibiades had enquired for him
entered the apartment
i am glad you are come in cried he for
although i have taken two days to collect my
courage and words i think i shall have more
 both now you are present
he then began his apology which pericles
thus interrupted
be prepared for chastisement i shall impose
a heavy mulct on your patience i shall
render an account to you my administration
and i hope you will permit it to pass
pericles and aspasia 
i have a son as you know in whose character
parsimony is not among the more prominent
virtues i am unwilling to shock him
by it which is always apt to occasion a rebound
to the opposite side and i am equally unwilling
to offer an example or pretext for luxury
and expense my own character will permit
neither i never gave a splendid feast i never
gave a sparing entertainment i never closed
my diningroom to a man elegant manners or
 sound information i have not the ample
fortune our cousin cimon who always used
it magnificently and glad am i that i have it
not for it would oblige me to receive many
who must disgust me and who would occupy
more hours my leisure than i can spare my
system domestick life has produced me contentment
and happiness may yours my dear
alcibiades whether like it or unlike it do the
same 
l 
 pericles and aspasia
thank you said he carelessly and added
but your manner speaking which we
first began to talk about the other day is
proper only for yourself in any other man it
would be ridiculous were i to employ it
people would believe i assumed the character
 jupiter or hermes walking among mortals
aspasia's is good enough for me many think
her language as pure and elegant as yours
and i have never known it enrage and terrify
men as yours does
study then aspasia in preference said
he you possess already some her advantages
a beautiful mouth is always eloquent 
its defects are but tropes and figures let us
try together which can imitate her best neither
 us hath ever seen her out temper or
forgetful what argument to urge first and most
forcibly when we have much to say the chief
difficulty is to hold back some favorite thought
pericles and aspasia 
which presses to come on before its time and
thereby makes a confusion in the rest if you
are master your temper and conscious 
your superiority the words and thoughts will
keep their ranks and will come into action withall
their energy compactness and weight
never attempt to alter your natural tone 
voice never raise it above its pitch let it at
first be somewhat low and slow this appears
like diffidence and men are obliged to listen
the more attentively that they may hear it
beginning with attention they will retain it
during the whole speech but attention is with
difficulty caught in the course one
i am intruding a little on the province 
aspasia if she approves my advice pursue
it if she disapproves be sure i have spoken
inconsiderately although i fancy i have observed
such effects on several occasions
he ceased i enforced as well as i could his
 pericles and aspasia
admonition but alcibiades with grace nearly
equal wants his gravity and if ever he should
be his successor in the administration the
republick he must become so by other methods

anaxagoras to aspasia
proxenus is sailing back to massilia before
he left us he collected a large cargo inscriptions
chiefly poetical in massilia these matters
are curiosities the people who cannot
have them fresh are glad to accept them dry
although according to proxenus they are little
acute in relishing or distinguishing them
in his last conversation with me he gave
evidence that should he ever fail as a merchant
he hopes to make his fortune as a critick
among his remarks was this
pericles and aspasia 
i cannot for my life imagine why zephyr is
such a favourite with the poets
i answered that we loans were always shy
 him but that in other parts and especially
toward gaul and italy he certainly was better
behaved
better behaved cried proxenus by
the twins he hath split my sail more than
once
to comfort him i replied he has done
that with his best friends o proxenus 
and no longer ago continued he than
last boedromion he carried off my nether garment
that was drying upon deck
ah there said i mischievous as he is
he could not do the same to them without homicide
 few them have one to spare
at the recollection his superior wealth
and dignity he grew composed again the
gods grant him a prosperous voyage ere
 pericles and aspasia
this letter shall reach athens he must be almost
as far as cythera what labours and
perils do seafaring men undergo what marvels
are ships they travel in a month farther than
the fleetest horse can do to such perfection
have they been brought and such confidence is
there now in human courage and skill as there
hath been little or no improvement in them for
some centuries we may suppose that contrary
to all other inventions the ingenuity mortals
can do nothing more for them
i forgot to mention proxenus what maybe
it were better not to mention at all that he is
reported to have broken off the extremity a
leaf or two on some curious old vases and a
particle a volute from a small column at the
 one eyes irwin who was not poor nor quite
uneducated tells us in his travels that he broke off a
volute as a relick from what was called pompey's
pillar this happened so lately as the last century
pericles and aspasia 
comer a lane nothing can so distinctly
prove say the lampsacenes that proxenus hasa
few drops barbarian blood in him genuine
greeks may travel through all the world and
see every vase every column every statue worth
seeing in its whole circumference without a
thought mutilation those people who cannot
keep their hands from violating the purest
works ancient days ought if there are not
we are it seems about to remove from egypt the
obelisk named cleopatra's needle do we believe
that egypt is never to come to life again it maybe
some hundreds it may be some thousands years 
but these are to the glories egypt as pounds are
to our national debt itself so glorious and which
has constituted our glorious men are we sure that
the genius who created these eternal works derives
no portion his beatitude from the hourly contemplation
 them in the country where they were formed
and fixed 
l 
 pericles and aspasia
too many them to be confined in separate
cages among the untameable specimens 
zoology
the lampsacenes you see by this are not
averse to protect the arts
cleone to aspasia
i have found eight verses which i send
you only the four last so entirely do they express
what i have felt it seems as if i myself
had composed them
they who tell us that love and grief are
without fancy and invention never knew invention
and fancy never felt grief and love
the thorns that pierce most deep are prest
only the closer to the breast 
to dwell on them is now relief
and tears alone are balm to grief 
pericles and aspasia 
you perhaps will like these better aspasia 
though very unlike in sentiment and expression


pyrrha your smiles are gleams sun
that after one another rmi
incessantly and think it fun

pyrrha your tears are short sweet rain
that glimmering on the flowerlit plain
zephyrs kiss back to heaven again

pyrrha both anguish me do please
to shed but if you wish me ease

anaxagoras to aspasia
ships are passing and repassing through the
hellespont all hours the day some them
from the piraeus urging the allies athens to
come forward in her defence others from the
peloponese inciting them to rise up in arms
and at once to throw off allegiance
would there be half this solicitude in either
 the belligerents to be virtuous and happy
supposing it possible to persuade the one or the
other that she might be and without an effort
supposing it in other words to be quite as easy
and pleasant to receive a truth as an untruth
would these mariners and soldiers and those
statesmen who send them out exert half the
anxiety half the energy and prowess to eating
and aspasia 
guise the conflagration a friend's house in
the neighbourhood as they are exerting now to
lay in ashes all the habitations that lie beyond
it and such are brave men such are wise men
such are the rulers the world well hath
it been said by some old poet
men let themselves slide onward by degrees
into the depths madness one bold spring
back from the verge had saved them but it seems
there dwells rare joy within it 
o thou sire
 gods and mortals let the blighting cloud
pass over me o grant me wholesome rest
and innocent uprisings although call'd
the only madman on thy reeling earth 
 pericles and aspasia
anaxagoras to aspasia
it is well that you are removed from the city
and that the enemies athens pay respect
either to your birthplace or your wisdom either
to your celebrity or your confidence i remember
that speaking the human form and countenance
both as existing in life and represented
in the ideal you remarked that the perfection
 beauty is what is farthest fi'om all similitude
to the brutes surely then in like manner
the perfection our moral nature is in our remoteness
from all similitude to their propensities
now the worst propensity the worst
beasts is bloodshed for which we pursue them
as nearly as we can to extermination but which
they never commit with so little urgency or to
so great an extent as we do until we bring
ourselves at least to an equality with them we
pericles and aspasia j
can hardly be said to have made much progress
in wisdom it will appear wonderful and perhaps
incredible to future generations that what
are now considered the two highest gifts man
oratory and poetry should be employed the one
chiefly in exciting the other in emblazoning
deeds slaughter and devastation if we could
see in the nature things a child capable 
forming a live tiger and found him exercising
his power doing it i think we should say to
him
vou might employ your time better child 
but then aspasia we must not be orators
nor poets nor hope for any estimation in the
state beware how you divulge this odd
opinion or you may be accused as before 
crimes against the purity morals against the
customs our forefathers and against the
established and due veneration the gods
i hardly know what i am treading on when i
 pericles and aspasia
make a single step toward philosophy on
sand i fear it is and whether the impression
be shallow or profound the eternal tide 
human passions will cover and efface it there
are many who would be vext and angry at this
and would say in the bitterness their hearts
that they have spent their time in vain aspasia
 aspasia they have indeed if they are
angry or vext about it
anaxagoras to aspasia
we are now so near winter that there may
not be after the vessel which is about to sail
any more them bound for athens all the
remainder the year and who knows what
another may bring or take away 
i remain in health but feeble life slips from
me softly and imperceptibly i am unwilling to
pericles and aspasia 
tire myself by blowing a fire which must soon
go out whether i blow it or not had i any
species curiosity to send you were it pebble
seaweed or new i would send it not
for it is idle to talk so as a memorial me
if the friend is likely to be forgotten can we
believe that any thing he has about him will
repose a longer time on the memory 
thus far i had written when my strength
failed me testicles and apouodorus have
told me i must prepare for a voyage the
shore is neither so broad nor so stormy as the
hellespont
i was resolved not to go until i had looked
in my garden for some anemones which i
recollected to have seen blossoming the other
day it occurred to me that usually they appear
in spring so does poetry i will present
to you a little both for the first time they
are equal value and are worth about as
 pericles and aspasia
much as the pebble or the seaweed or the new

where are the blooms many dyes
that used m every path to rise 
whither are gone the lighter hours 
what leave they i can only send
my wisest loveliest latest friend
these weatherworn and formless flowers
think me happy that i am away from athens 
 who always lose my composure in the presence
 crime or calamity if any one should note
to you my singularities remembering me a year
hence as i trust you and pericles will do add
to them but not aloud a singularity felicity
 he neither lived nor died with the
multitude there are however some clazo
menials who know that anaxagoras was 
clazomenai
pericles and aspasia 
alcibiades to pericles
you commanded me o pericles that i should
write to you whenever i found an opportunity
on land phormio cast anchor before naupac
tus we command the gulph crissa and
check the movements the corinthians the
business blockading is little to my mind
writing is almost as insufferable it is the only
thing i do not willingly undertake when my
friends desire it beside i have nothing in the
world to write about we have done little but
sink a few vessels and burn a few villages it
is really a hard matter to find a table to write
upon so quick and so complete is the devastation
i fancied war had something in it more
animating and splendid the people the
peloponese are brave however they sometimes
ask for their children if very young
 pericles and aspasia
but never for their lives why cannot we think
them as little worth taking as they giving 
i am heartily tired this warfare and
phormio has told me in plain words he is
heartily tired me upon this i requested
his permission to join without delay our army
before potidsea i expected not only an uncivil
refusal but a sharp rebuke
the gods have begun to favor us cried
phormio this offer is better than the
luckiest omen alcibiades thou art the
whitest white birds and thy flight whichever
wind it float upon is worth a victory
i would have been angry but laughter
sprang uppermost so throwing my arms round
old phormio's neck i almost pulled him down
with it
how now stripling cried he as willing
to be angry as i was all this buffoonery before
the commander the fleet 
pericles and aspasia 
alcibiades to pericles
hardly could it have been expected that the
whitest white birds should have been so
speedily on the wing the day had not closed
when phormio told me that knowing my
fickleness he had given orders for my voyage
back every voyage is prosperous that brings
me within sight an enemy worth seeing
brave fellows these potidseans they never
lose their appetite even in the greatest want 
air and exercise you who hear every thing
must know that they eat one another rather
than surrender i have been but three days in
the camp where to my delight i found the
brave and kindly socrates do you disapprove
 my renewing my intimacy with philosophy
in the midst battles let philosophy then
stand aside and behold in her place the 
pericles and aspasia
fender his country and the saviour his
friend
the morning after my arrival the potidaeans
burst forth with incredible bravery from their
gates overthrowing all opposition now was
my time the heavyarmed in general being old
soldiers were somewhat slower and many 
the enemy were assailing me when they came
up nor indeed was it then in sufficient force
i was wounded and overthrown and at the
beginning stunned but presently i fancied i
heard the sound a brisk sword on armour
over me and felt something heavy fall on my
legs i was drawn forcibly from under the last
 my antagonists socrates raised me up and
defended me from the weapons not a few
unwilling to retire and irresolute to renew the
engagement
i write now because i am so wounded i can
do nothing else
pericles and aspasia 
pericles to alcibiades
you are courageous my alcibiades to a
degree which i hardly ever observed in another
this alone induces me to doubt whether you
will become so soon as we both us wish it
an accomplished and perfect soldier to rush
against the enemy before your comrades is not
indeed quite so unseemly as to lag behind yet
it may be even more detrimental in an officer
with old troops who know their duty it is
always so with younger alone who want encouragement
it may not be socrates deserved
the first honours in the action his modesty and
his affection transferred them to the imprudent
and the vanquished whom he rescued from the
shame rashness and the wretchedness captivity
with all my fondness for you i could not
have given you my vote and had i commanded
 pericles and aspasia
against potidsea i must have reproved you in
presence the army
never o alcibiades inflict on me the misery
 passing so severe a sentence i praised you
before others did i condemn you after them
your high spirit deserved its reward your temerity
its rebuke i who have been the careful
guardian your fortune am the more
anxious one your safety and your fame
in my former letter i gave unobstructed way
to the more pleasurable emotions and in
every one that i shall have occasion to write to
you hereafter i am confident the same enjoyment
reply to me in those as your
friend your comrade the partaker your pains
and pleasures and at most the director 
your studies but here my alcibiades we
must be grave and serious i must for once
not guide but dictate no answer is here admissible
excepting the answer a soldier to
his general
pericles and aspasia 
anaxagoras to aspasia
did i tell you o aspasia we were free and
remote from the calamities war we were
the flute and the tyrrel and the harp alone
were heard along our streets and the pavement
was bestrewn with cistus and lavender
and myrtle which grow profusely on the rocks
behind us melanthus had arrived from the
chersonese to marry phanera and his friend
sosigenes had determined to be united on the
same day with her sister eurycleia
those who have seen them say that they
were the prettiest girls in the city they were
also the happiest but less happy than their
lovers who however owed at present but a part
 the happiness to either they were sworn
friends from early youth and had not met since
but always had corresponded
why cannot men draw a line against war as
vol ii m
 pericles and aspasia
against plague and shut up the infected instead
 which they are proud being like the
dogs in the worst feature rushing forth into
every affray and taking part in it instantly with
equal animosity i wish we had arrived at such
a degree docility and had advanced so many
steps in improvement that by degrees we might
hope to acquire any thing better these good
creatures we have the worst every beast
and the best none
this is not o aspasia my usual tone 
thinking and discoursing nor is what has happened
here among the usual occurrences my
life the generous heart needs little to be reminded
what are the embraces young and
ardent friends and the withered one could ill
represent them
eurycleia in the silence fondness in the
fulness content was holding the hand her
melanthus love has few moments more sweet
philosophy none more calm that moment
pericles and aspasia 
was interrupted by the entrance sosigenes 
and composure was exchanged for rapture by
the friendly soul melanthus yes yes aspasia
 friendship even in the young may be
more animated than love itself it was not
long however
where is phanera 
i will call her said eurycleia and went
out
phanera whether fond ornament i know
not and ambitious to surpass her sister and enchant
her lover came not speedily nor indeed
did eurycleia very soon for it was not at first
that she could find her conversation had
begun in the meanwhile about the war mexanthus
was a little more vehement than the
mildness his nature it is said ever allowed
him before and blamed the corinthians for inciting
so many states to hostility often had
sosigenes been looking toward the door 

 pericles and aspasia
petting his phanera and now began to grow
impatient the words melanthus who felt
the cruelty war chiefly because it would separate
the two sisters and the two friends
touched the pride sosigenes unable to
moderate his temper now excited by the absence
 phanera after the sister had some time
returned he said fiercely
it is well to blame the citizens the
noblest city upon earth for not enduring an
indignity it is well but in slaves alone or
viler dependents
sosigenes sosigenes cried melanthus
starting up and rushing toward him at that
instant the impetuous sosigenes believing violence
was about to follow affront struck him
vdth his dagger to the heart
 i could not then calm thy anger with my
embrace o too unhappy friend while the
blood gurgled through the words sobbed forth
melanthiis
pericles and aspasia 
alcibiades to pericles
pericles i did wrong and rashly the
praises the athenians are to me as the hum
 insects they linger in my ear but are senseless
and unexciting i swear to you i will do
better but i must see you before i go
aspasia whose letter you have sent me since
is even more severe than you have been and
she has neither right nor reason she is the
only woman upon earth that ever railed at rashness
the only one that could distinguish it from
fortitude but every man must be rash once 
it saves him from as much inconvenience and
mischief as being oftener rash would incur
do not consider this nonsense as vindication
or reply let it not stand in the way your
pardon
 pericles and aspasia
aspasia to alcibiades
are you not ashamed young man to leave
the aged behind you with all their wounds
merely to show how dexterous you are become
in the management your sword unworthy
alcibiades do not expect that the athenians
with all their levity and inconsiderateness will
award to you the honour superiority in valour
socrates well deserved it not for saving a life
which on the next occasion will be thrown away
but for giving to every one capable profiting
by it an example steadiness and constancy
pericles i hope will not allow you to disembark
until you have acquired the rudiments 
discipline in the only art in which you ever
seemed likely to excell have you forgotten too
that the pestilence is raging in the city o
rash alcibiades the sight pericles himself
pericles and aspasia 
to you at least could hardly have been worth so
desperate a hazard but pericles will reprove
you confident boy let me hear no more 
you until i have heard that he has granted you
his forgiveness
aspasia to pericles
censure not too severely o my pericles
your inconsiderate cousin in these days when
so many your adherents are fallen some by
the fever some by war we must be parsimonious
in the treasury friendship at all times
far from inexhaustible
a hundred men more wisdom and more
virtue than alcibiades would prevail much less
with the multitude should any thing sinister
befall you may the gods avert it but i
 pericles and aspasia
always fear something and what certainly is
more foolish i fancy my presence could avert
from you any calamity i wish i were persuaded
that the immortals hear us i would
then so perpetually pray for you as hardly to
give myself time to read your letters and you
should quarrel with the shortness mine but
reason which strengthens our religion weakens
our devotion happy are those who have retained
throughout life their infantine simplicity
which nurses a tractable idol in an unsuspicious
bosom is assured it knows and heeds the voice
addressing it and shuts it up again with a throb
 joy and keeps it warm for this the mind
must be nurtured to the last with the same
milky food as in childhood the gods must have
their tangible images and must laugh to us out
 ivy and flowers
thinking you i had forgotten that i began
to write in favour alcibiades lest by taskpericles
and aspasia 
ing him with impetuosity and imprudence you
should alienate his fickle mind i myself have
written to him with quite enough severity at
least i think so you shall judge for yourself
when you have perused it let it go to him instantly
 for here we are uncertain at what point
the troops will land from potidaea i shall be
grieved if any thing happens to him he has
more life in him than is enough to animate a
city yet the point an arrow may extinguish
it in an instant with however long experience
before us we yet might wonder that what is so
animated should ever cease at all you men
often talk glorious death death met bravely
for your country i too have been warmed by
the bright idea in oratory and poetry bit ah 
my dear pericles i would rather read it on an
ancient tomb than a recent one
m 
 pericles and aspasu
pericles to aspasia
i had already warned alcibiades his imprudence
and irregularity your letter will
ensure his correction the reply he sent me
is worthy a man formed for command we
must watch over him he will do great good or
great evil those who are most capable 
both always miserably for although they
may have done many things well yet the first
or second that they do badly is their ruin
they know not whom to choose as their follower
up the scalingladder nor when to loosen their
grasp the pinnacle intractable as you may
think alcibiades there is not a youth in athens
so easily led away by a weaker judgment than his
own he wishes to excell in everything and
succeeded but this wish brings him into contact
with too many and he cannot at present
pericles and aspasia 
push them off far enough from him to see
plainly and distinctly what they are he will
soon stand above them and know them better
i must leave off the dying call me forth
blessings on my aspasia and her little athenian

aspasia to cleone
the verses i shall presently write out for
you at the bottom my letter are composed
as you will perceive in the broadest dorian
on the extraordinary death eschylus probably
the unhappy poet was murdered by some
enemy or some robber he was found with his
skull fractured and it may be with a tortoise
near him but who in the world can believe
that an eagle dropped it from above that the
quickest in sight all animals mistook a bald
pericles and aspasia
head for a rock and did ever man walk in
the fields sicily with his head uncovered
if he did his death might easily be accounted
for without a tortoise or eagle whenever i
find a containing this gross absurdity i
instantly throw it aside as the effusion an
idle and silly writer and am well assured it
must be incapable instructing or interesting
me
the petulant author the verses you will
find below is evidently a disappointed poet
hero and thereon could never treat eschylus
with neglect or with indifference little as
may be our regard and our respect for royalty
we hardly can suppose any king who knows
greek so barbarous and stupid as to fancy in
himself a nobility more exalted than in aeschylus
or gifted by the gods with a higher office
than stewardship to the greatest men among
whom he himself is the richest
pericles and aspasia 

bard eleusis art thou dead
so strangely can it be
an eagle dropt upon thy head
a tortoise no not he

they who devised the fable marr'd
the moral their song 
they meant the eagle by the bard
but placed the creature wrong

quickest in courts those ever move
whom nature made most slow 
tortoise wears plumes and springs above
while eagle mounts below
alcibiades to pericles
pray why did you tell phanomachus to station
some confidential one near me who should be
 pericles and aspasia
an eternal check on me there is little
chance that i should do any thing extravagant
unless the potidseans invite me to dinner and
i accept the invitation i will not allow any
man to defend me before i stand in need 
defence and before i have deserved to save my
life by proving it worth something i should
quarrel with socrates himself much more with
another presuming to take what belongs tome
 danger or glory it is not kind
in you nor open nor prudent would you
wish any one to say pericles takes care 
his own relatives this ought only to be
said the vilest men in the worst governments
and you until now it never could
be you have given no such orders in regard
to xanthippus he may be as rash and violent
as he pleases even here he dares to call me
neaniskos and kouridion and ta paidika
this expression was usually reproachful not
always as we see in plato
rjericles and aspasia 
by castor if he were not the son pericles
his being my cousin should not save from a
stroke the sabre that fierce disdainful visage
i promise you it shall soon be seen which 
us is the braver and the better man i would
not say this to you unless that you might let
him know my sentiments i have no words
written or spoken for the contumelious my
complaints are for the ear those only who
are kind to me
pericles to alcibiades
do not think my alcibiades that i recommended
you to the guardianship phanoma
chus in order that he should exercise over you
a troublesome vigilance controul or indulge
toward you an unmilitary partiality but i
am more intimate with him than i am with
 pericles and aspasia
xenophon or aristophanes or cassiodorus and
having sons he knows that restraints are often
necessary on the impatience military ardour
your letter is a proof that i judged rightly
my praises your valour are lost amidst those
 the army and the city but the delight it
has given me is i am confident one among the
thoughts that have assuaged your wounds on
your return the citizens will express their sense
 your conduct
endeavour to prove now that you are acknowledged
to be the first in bravery that you are
more discreet than xanthippus many in every
army are so nearly on an equality in courage that
any attempt theirs to show a superiority is
ineffectual unbecoming language can neither
prove nor disprove it but must detract from its
worth and merit discretion on the contrary
is the sure sign that presence mind without
 these three were appointed to commands with
phanomachus
pericles and aspasia 
which valour strikes untimely and impotently
judgement alone makes courage available and
conciliates power with genius consider that
you never will have attained the scope your
ambition until you lead and govern those men
against whom your passions now exasperate
you and unless you do conciliate them you
never can induce them to acknowledge your
superiority much less submit to your governance
it is best the germs power should
spring forth early that they may have time
enough for gaining strength therefore i write
to you no longer as a youth in pupilage but
as a candidate for the highest offices the
commonwealth
try whether your forbearance may not produce
a better effect on xanthippus than my remonstrances
i write to you rather than to
him because i rely more firmly on your affection
be worthy such a secret o alci
 pericles and aspasia
blades and think how highly i must esteem
your prudence and manliness when i delegate
to you who are the younger the power correcting
in him the faults which i have been
unable to eradicate or suppress go and in
the spirit with which i send it give my love to
xanthippus he may neglect it he may despise
it he may cast it away but i will gather
it all up again for him you must help me
alcibiades to pericles
pericles i was much edified by your letter 
but pardon me when i came to the close it
i thought you rather mad
 what said i beard this panther 
however when i had considered a little more
and a little better on it i went to him and delivered
your love he stared at me and then
pericles and aspasia 
desired to see the direction ay said he
i remember the handwriting he oftener
writes to me than i to him i suppose he has
less to do and less to think 
the few other words he added are hardly
worth the trouble repetition in fact they
were not very filial dear pericles i would
love him were it only out perversity but
beside all other rights over me you have made
me more disposed than ever to obey you in
making me more contented with myself as you
have by this commission i may do something
yet if we can but fumigate or pray away the
plague two thousand four hundred soldiers
who landed but forty days before me from the
bosphorus under the command anon son
 nicias one thousand and fifty are already
dead i shall have nobody to persuade or manage
or even to fight with if we go on so
 pericles and aspasia
alcibiades to pericles
potidaea has surrendered the dead the
city are scarcely more shadows than the living
and yet how bravely they fought to the last i
should have been sorry for them a few months
ago but i have now learned what it is to be a
soldier we must rise superior to pain and
then take another flight farther afield and
rise superior to pity beside the potidaeans
were traitors and next they were against us 
and furthermore they were so wicked as to eat
one another rather than submit this shows
their malice now we have done nothing half
so bad toward them and i assure you if others
are disposed to such cruelty i will take no part
in it for who would ever kiss me afterward

pericles and aspasia 
pericles to alcibiades
the remembrance past days that were
happy increases the gloominess those that
are not and intercepts the benefits those
that would be
in the midst the plague this reflection
strikes me on the intelligence i have received
fi'om lampsacus you likewise will be sorry
o alcibiades to hear that anaxagoras is dying
although he seldom conversed with you and
seldom commended you in private yet believe
me he never omitted an occasion pointing
out to your friends any sign you had manifested
 ability or virtue he declined the character
 teacher yet few have taught so much wherever
his wisdom was accessible philosophers
there have been indeed at athens and elsewhere
earnest in the discovery and in the 
pericles and aspasia
termination truth but excepting thales and
pherecydes none among them has been free
from ostentation or from desire obtaining
the absolute and exclusive possession weak
and ductile minds now the desire great
influence over others is praiseworthy only where
great good to the community may arise from it
to domineer in the arbitrary sway a dogmatical
and grasping yet loose and emptyhanded
philosophy which never bears upon inventions
and uses nor elevates nor tranquilizes the mind 
and to look upon ourselves with a sweet complacency
from so petty an eminence is worse
than boyish ambition to call idlers and
stragglers to us and to sit among them and regale
on their wonder is the selfishness an
indigent and illappointed mind anaxagoras
was subject to none these weaknesses nor to
the greater condescending to reprove or to
argue with those who are he made every due
pericles and aspasia 
allowance for our infirmities understanding
and variations temper the effect them
and he was no less friendly toward those who
differed widely in opinion from him than toward
those who quite agreed when a friend his
was admiring and praising him for it he interrupted
him saying
why not is it not too selfevident for
language that if i had taken the same road i
should have gone in the same direction and
would not the same direction have led to the
same conclusion 
yes alcibiades it is indeed selfevident
and were it spoken unwarily it would be reprehended
for being so and yet scarcely one
man in ten millions acts consistently upon it
there are humanities my friend which require
our perpetual recollection and are needful
to compensate in some measure for those many
others we must resign to the necessities and
exactions war
i
 pericles and aspasia
aspasia to cleone
serene and beautiful are our autumnal days
in thessaly we have many woods about us
and many woodland sounds among them in
this season the year i am more inclined to
poetry than in any other and i want it now
more than ever to flow among my thoughts and
to bear up the heavier
i hesitate o cleon to send you what i have
been writing you will say it is a strange fancy
 mine and fitter for me in those earlier hours
 life when we were reposing in the island
nothing i must confess would be more illplaced
than a drama or dialogue in the world
below at least if the shades entered into captious
disquisitions or frivolous pleasantries but
we believe that our affections outlive us and
that love is not a stranger in elysium
humours the idioms life are lost in the traj
pericles and aspasia 
siphon or are generalized in the concourse and
convergency innumerable races passions the
universal speech are throughout intelligible
the genius homer is never to be gainsaid
by us and he shews us how heroes and women
worthy heroes felt and reasoned a long
dialogue a formal drama would be insupportable
 but perhaps a single scene may win attention
and favour from my own cleon
i imagine then agamemnon to descend from
his horrible death and to meet instantly his
daughter by the nature things by the suddenness
 the event iphigeneia can have heard
nothing her mother's double crime adultery
and murder
i suspend my pen although i promised
you in the morning my short acherusian
scene i am almost ready to retract my words
everybody has found out that i am deficient in
tenderness while i was writing i could not
vol ii n
 pericles and aspasia
but shed tears just as priests do libations
you will say to save other people the trouble
the shades agamemnon and 
iphigenia
iphigenia
father i now may lean upon your breast
and you with unreserved eyes will grasp
iphigeneia's hand
we are not shades
surely for yours throbs yet
and did my blood
win troy for greece 
ah twas ill done to shrink 
but the sword gleam'd so sharp and the good priest
trembled and pallas frown'd above severe
agamemnon
daughter 
iphigenia
beloved father is the blade
again to pierce a bosom now unfit
pericles and aspasia 
for sacrifice no blood is in its veins
no god requires it here here are no wrongs
to vindicate no realms to overthrow
you standing as at aulis in the fane
with face averted holding as before
my hand but yours burns not as then it burn'd 
this alone shews me we are with the blest
nor subject to the sufferings we have borne
i will win back past kindness
tell me then
tell how my mother fares who loved me so
and griev'd as twere for you to see me part
frown not but pardon me for tarrying
amid too idle words nor asking how
she prais'd us both which most for what we did
agamemnon
ye gods who govern here do human pangs
reach the pure soul thus far below do tears
spring in these meadows 
iphigenia
no sweet father no 
i could have answered that why ask the gods 
n
 pericles and aspasia
agamemnon
iphigeneia o my child the earth
has gendered crimes unheardof heretofore
and nature may have changed in her last depths
together with the gods and all their laws
iphigenia
father we must not let you here condemn 
not were the day less joyful recollect
we have no wicked here no king to judge
poseidon we have heard with bitter rage
lashes his foaming steeds against the skies
and laughing with loud yell at winged fire
innoxious to his fields and palaces
affright the eagle from the sceptred hand 
while pluto gentlest brother the three
and happiest in obedience views sedate
his tranquil realm nor envies theirs above
no change have we not even day for night
nor spring for summer
all things are serene
serene too be your spirit none on earth
ever was half so kindly in his house
pericles and aspasia
and so compliant even to a child
never was snatcht your robe away from me
though going to the council the blind man
knew his good king was leading him indoors
before he heard the voice that marshal'd greece
therefore all prais'd you
proudest men themselves
in others praise humility and most
admire it in the scepter and the sword
what then can make you speak thus rapidly
and briefly in your step thus hesitate 
are you afraid to meet among the good
incestuous helen here 
agamemnon
oh gods hell
iphigenia
she hath not past the river
we may walk
with our hands links nor feel our house's shame
agamemnon
never mayst thou iphigeneia feel it 
 pericles and aspasia
aulis had no sharp sword thou wouldst exclaim
greece no avenger i her chief so late
through erebus through elysium writhe beneath it
iphigenia
come i have better diadems than those
 argos and mycenae come away
and i will weave them for you on the bank
you will not look so pale when you have walked
a little in the grove and have told all
those sweet fond words the widow sent her child
agamemnon
oh earth i suffered less upon thy shores 
casidej
the bath that bubbled with my blood the blows
that spilt it o worse torture must she know 
ah the first woman coming from mycenae
will pine to pour this poison in her ear
taunting sad charon for his slow advance
iphigeneia 
pericles and aspasia 
iphigenia
why thus turn away 
calling me with such fondness i am here
father and where you are will ever be
agamemnon
thou art my child yes yes thou art my child
all was not once what all now is come on
idol love and truth my child my child 
alone
fell woman ever false false was thy last
denunciation as thy bridal vow 
and yet even that found faith with me the dirk
which sever'd flesh from flesh where this hand rests
severs not as thou boasted in thy scoffs
iphigeneia's love from agamemnon 
the wife's a spark may light a straw consume
the daughter's not her heart's whole fount hath
quench
tis worthy the gods and lives for ever
 pericles and aspasia
iphigenia
what spake my father to the gods above 
unworthy am i then to join in prayer 
if on the last or any day before
 my brief course on earth i did amiss
say it at once and let me be unblest 
but o my faultless father why should you 
and shun so my embraces 
am wild
and wandering in my fondness 
we are shades 
groan not thus deeply blight not thus the season
 fullorb'd gladness shades we are indeed
but mingled let us feel it with the blest
i knew it but forgot it suddenly
altho i felt it all at your approach
look on me smile with me at my illusion 
you are so like what you have ever been
except in sorrow i might well forget
i could not win you as i used to do
it was the first embrace since my descent
i ever aim'd at those who love me live
save one who loves me most and now would chide me
pericles and aspasia 
agamemnon
we want not o iphigeneia we
want not embrace nor kiss that cools the heart
with purity nor words that more and more
teach what we know from those we know and sink
often most deeply where they fall most light
time was when for the faintest breath thine
kingdom and life were little
iphigenia
value them
as little now
agamemnon
were life and kingdom all 
iphigenia
ah by our death many are sad who loved us
they will be happy too
cheer king men 
cheer there are voices songs cheer arms advance
n

come to me soul peace these these alone
these are not false embraces
iphigenia
both are happy

are so many who would teach me concede
that the shades were not happy at once in elysium

as allegorical and where shall we fix a
boundary between the allegorical and divine 
aspasia to cleone
you build your nest aspasia like the swallow
bringing a little on the bill at once
and fixing it attentively and fondly
and trying it and then from your soft breast
warming it with the inmost the plumage
nests there are many this very year
many the nests are which the winds shall shake
the rains run thro and other birds beat down

 heavenly love and thence inviolate
it shall not fall this winter nor the next
 pericles and aspasia
cleone to aspasia
the lacedaemonianss we hear have occupied
not only all attica but are about to enter if
they have not entered already the territory 
their confederates the thebes and to join
their forces whither will you go my aspasia
thessaly is almost as perilous as boeotia it is
worse than criminal to be so nearly allied to
the greatest man on earth who must always
have the greatest enemies there are more
who will forgive injury than there are who will
forgive station and those who assail in vain
the power pericles will exert their abilities
in diminishing his equanimity and happiness
i fear your fondness will have induced you
again to enter the city that you may assuage
and divide those cares which must weigh heavily
on his wisdom and patriotism and the more
since his health has been undermined by the
pericles and aspasia 
pestilence i dare not advise you to forego a
duty but remember he has commanded you to
remain away your return would afflict him
i am quite incapable judging for you were
i with you then perhaps i might know many
things which should influence your decision
and can two years have passed over since
this evil entered your city without my flying to
comfort you two years have indeed passed
over but my house too has had its days 
mourning the prayers my father were
heard he died contentedly and even joyfully
he told me he had implored the gods that
they would bestow on me a life as long and
happy as his own and was assured they would
until we have seen some one grow old our
existence seems stationary when we feel
certain having seen it which is not early
the earth begins a little to loosen from us
nothing now can detain me at miletus although
 pericles and aspasia
when i have visited you i shall return you
must return with me which you can do from
any region but attica pericles will not refuse
for you have already conciliated me his favour
in the meanwhile do not think yourself bound
by the offices humanity to bestow those cares
on others which are all required for your own
family do not be so imprudent as to let the
most intimate your friends persuade you to
visit them you have a child you have a husband
and without your presence you possess
the means procuring every human aid for the
infected o that i were with you to snatch
you away from the approach the distemper
but i sadly fear i should grow hardhearted
toward others in your danger
i must be with my aspasia and very soon
o athens athens are there not too many
 the dead within thy walls already and are
none there who never should have been 
this seems to refer to xeniades
pericles and aspasia 
pericles to aspasia
the pestilence has taken from me both my sons
you who were ever so kind and affectionate to
them will receive a tardy recompence in hearing
that the least gentle and the least grateful
did acknowledge it
i mourn for paratus because he loved me 
for xanthippus because he loved me not
preserve with all your maternal care our little
pericles i cannot be fonder him than i
have always been i can only fear more for
him
is he not with my aspasia what fears
then are so irrational as mine but oh i am
living in a widowed house a house desolation
 i am living in a city tombs and
torches and the last i saw before me were for
my children
 pericles and a spa si a
pericles to aspasia
it is right and orderly that he who has
partaken so largely in the prosperity the
athenians should close the procession their
calamities the fever that has depopulated our
city returned upon me last night and hippocrates
and acron tell me that my is near
when we agreed o aspasia in the beginning
 our loves to communicate our thoughts by
writing even while we were both in athens
and when we had many reasons for it we little
foresaw the more powerful one that has rendered
it necessary late we never can meet again
the laws forbid it and love itself enforces
them let wisdom be heard by you as imperturbably
and affection as authoritatively as
ever and remember that the sorrow pericles
pericles and aspasia 
can arise but from the bosom aspasia there
is only one word tenderness we could say
which we have not said oftentimes before and
there is no consolation in it the happy never
say and never hear said farewell
reviewing the course my life it appears tome
at one moment as if we met but yesterday 
at another as if centuries had past within it for
within it have existed the greater part those
who since the origin the world have been the
luminaries the human race damon called
me from my musick to look at aristides on his
way to exile and my father pressed the wrist
by which he was leading me along and whispered
in my ear
walk quickly by glance cautiously it is
there miltiades is in prison
in my adolescence i offered the rites hospitality
to pindar and empedocles not long
afterward i embraced the neck eschylus
 pericles and aspasia
about to abandon his country with sophocles
i have argued on eloquence with euripides on
polity and ethicks i have discoursed as became
an inquirer with protagoras and democritus
with anaxagoras and meton from herodotus
i have listened to the most instructive history
conveyed in a language the most copious and
the most harmonious a man worthy to carry
away the collected suffrages universal greece
a man worthy to throw open the temples 
egypt and to celebrate the exploits cyrus
and from thucydides who alone can succeed
to him how recently did my aspasia hear
with me the energetick praises his just supremacy

as if the festival life were incomplete and
wanted one great ornament to crown it phidias
placed before us in ivory and gold the tutelary
deity this land and the jupiter homer
and olympus
pericles and aspasia 
to have lived with such men to have enjoyed
their familiarity and esteem overpays all labours
and anxieties i were unworthy the friendships
i have commemorated were i forgetful 
the latest sacred it ought to be formed as it
was under the portico death my friendship
with the most sagacious the most scientifick
the most beneficent philosophers acron and
hippocrates if mortal could war against
pestilence and destiny they had been victorious
i leave them in the field unfortunate
he who finds them among the fallen 
and now at the close my day when every
light is dim and every guest departed let me
own that these wane before me remembering as
i do in the pride and fulness my heart
that athens confided her glory and aspasia her
happiness to me
have i been a faithful guardian do i resign
them to the custody the gods undiminished
 pericles and aspasia
and unimpaired welcome then welcome my
last hour after enjoying for so great a number
 years in my publick and my private
life what i believe has never been the lot 
any other i now extend my hand to the urn and
take without reluctance or hesitation what is the
lot all
alcibiades to aspasia
i returned to athens in time to receive the
last injunctions my guardian what i promised
him to comfort him in his departure i
dare not promise his aspasia lest i fail in the
engagement nevertheless i will hope that my
natural unsteadiness may sometimes settle on
his fixt principles but what am i what are all
my hopes in comparison with the last few words
 this great man surely the greatest that earth
pericles and aspasia 
has ever seen or ever will see hereafter let
me repeat them to you for they are more than
consolation and better if on such a loss i or
any one could console you i should abominate
you eternally
i found him surrounded by those few friends
whom pestilence and despair had left in the
city they had entered but a little while before
me and it appears that one or other 
them had been praising him for his exploits
in these replied he fortune hath had
her share tell me rather if you wish to gratify
me that never have i caused an athenian to
put on mourning
i burst forward from the doorway and threw
my arms around his neck
o pericles my first last only friend afar
be that hour yet cried i and my tears rolled
abundantly on his cheeks either he felt them
not or dissembled and disregarded them for
vol ii o
 pericles and aspasia
seeing his visitors go away he began with perfect
calmness to give me such advice as would
be the best to follow in every occurrence and
chiefly in every difficulty when he had ended
and i was raising my head from above his pillow
for i continued in that posture ashamed that
he who spake so composedly should perceive
my uncontrollable emotion i remarked i knew
not what upon his bosom he smiled faintly
and said
alcibiades i need not warn you against
superstition it never was among your weaknesses
do not wonder at these amulets above
all do not order them to be removed the
kind old nurses who have been carefully watching
over me day and night are persuaded that
these will save my life superstition is rarely
so kindhearted whenever she is unable as weare
to reverence let us at least respect her
after the good patient creatures have found as
pericles and aspasia 
they must soon all their traditional charms unavailing
they will surely grieve enough and
perhaps from some other motive than their
fallibility in science inflict not o alcibiades 
a fresh wound upon their grief by throwing
aside the tokens their affection in hours
like these we are the most indifferent to opinion
and greatly the most sensible to kindness
the statesman the orator the conqueror the
protector had died away the philosopher the
humane man yet was living alas few moments
more
alcibiades to aspasia
must i again aspasia torment my soul
again must i trouble yours has the pestilence
then seized me that i want hardihood strength
understanding to begin my labour no i walk
o
 pericles and aspasia
through the house mourning firmly swiftly
incessantly my limbs are alert as ever
write it i must somebody was at the gates 
admittance was it seems not granted readily
i heard a voice feeble and hoarse and looking
forth saw two women who leaned against the
lintels
let her enter let her enter look at her 
she is one us
these words were spoken by the younger 
and maliciously scarcely had she uttered them
when her head dropped forward the stranger
caught and supported her and cried help
help and rubbed her temples and gazing on
her with an intensity compassion closed her
eyelids for death had come over them in my
horrour my fright and dastardly cowardice i
should rather call it i failed to prevent or check
her
aspasia has then her equal on the earth 
pericles and aspasia 
aspasia is all that women in their wildest
wishes can desire to be cleon all that the
immortals are but she has friendship she has
sympathy have those 
she has did i say and can nothing then
bring me back my recollection not even she 
i want it not those moments are present yet
and will never pass away
she asked for you
aspasia answered i is absent
not with her husband not with her husband
 cried she
pericles i replied is gone to the
blessed
she was with him then while hope remained
for her i knew she would be tell
me she was
and saying it she grasped my arm and
looked earnestly in my face suddenly as it
appeared to me she blushed slightly on her
 pericles and aspasia
countenance there was momentarily somewhat
less its paleness she walked into the aviary 
the lattice stood open the birds were not flown
but dead she drew back she hesitated she
departed i followed her for now and not
earlier i bethought me it was cleon before
i came up to her she had asked a question 
an elderly man who opened his lips but could
not answer her and whose arm raised with
difficulty from the pavement when it would have
directed her to the object her inquiry dropped
upon his breast a boy was with him
gazing in wonder at the elegance and composure
 her attire such as in these years calamity
and indifference to seemliness can nowhere
be found in athens he roused himself from
his listless posture beckoned and walked before
us reaching the garden epimedea we entered
it through the house silent vacant the
doors broken down sure sign that some family
pericles and aspasia 
perhaps many had but few days since utterly
died off within its chambers for nearly all the
habitations in all quarters the city are
crowded with emigrants from the burghs 
attica the pestilence is now the least appalling
where it has made the most havock
but how hideous how disheartening is the sudden
stride before our eyes from health and
beauty to deformity and death in this waste
and desolation there was more peacefulness i
believe than anywhere else beyond in the whole
extent our dominions it was not to last
a tomb stood opposite the entrance cleon
rushed toward it reposed her brow against it
and said at intervals
i am weary i ache throughout i thirst
bitterly i cannot read the epitaph
the boy advanced drew his finger slowly
along at the bottom the letters and said
surely they are plain enough 
 pericles and aspasia
xeniades son charondas
he turned round and looked at me well satisfied
cleon lowered her cheek to the inscription
but her knees bent under her and she
was fain to be seated on the basement
cleon said i she started at the
name come i beseech you from that sepulcher

the reproof is just she replied here
too even here i am an allen 
aspasia she will gladden your memory no
more never more will she heave your bosom
with fond expectancy there is none to whom
in the pride your soul you will run with her
letters in your hand he upon whose shoulder
you have redd them in my presence lies also
in the grave the last them is written
reflections on athens
at the
decease pericles
for many years and indeed for many ages it
has been the fashion to condemn the government
 athens and every one at all similar in
its principles and these censures are passed
and transmitted by gentlemen who never perused
a single author that country and are
utterly ignorant its polity among the objections
urged against it is this that it was
liable to turbulence and subversion
first for turbulence and few words will do
ebullitions are often the representatives eruptions
rebellions and revolutions at schools
there is more turbulence in a holiday than in a
whippingday which would the gentlemen
prefer 
o 
 pericles and aspasia
now to subversion a mausoleum and a
pyramid are less liable to be overthrown thana
hospital and an almshouse are they usefuller
 but we find by one glance at the history
 athens that few governments have been
so durable she flourished for nearly a millennium
interrupted it is true by the supremacy
 pisistratus the struggle his successor
the spartan imposition the thirty
oligarchy the intrusive satrapy the per
sianized macedonian and the bloody grasp 
sulla altogether a segment a century she
was no less happy no less liberal in her institutions
when forty years after this champion 
aristocracy she became the residence titus
pompous nor later when she found herself
the cherished home another who deserved
like him the appellation attics the elegant
and generous heroes the romans neither
in the republick nor under the emperors deprived
her her municipal privileges nor
meddled materially with her ancient forms
she stood in all her strength and beauty
against the whirlwind macedon that swept
away the wealth asia and against the malaria
 rome that prostrated the liberties europe 
and she fell when the world had fallen athens was
pericles and aspasia 
not ruined by the violence the citizens nor by
the improvidence the rulers but by the most
intractable malady that ever befell mankind
nor indeed was she then so ruined but that
she rose again in full splendour a few years
afterward and displayed before greece all the
pageantry intellect in a socrates and a plato 
all its solider glory in an aristotle a demosthenes
and a potion it was athens who not
only defeated and dispersed the naval and military
power xerxes but it also was athens
who becoming in her turn the assailant overthrew
the realm darius for after the victory
 cimon a young impetuous macedonian
had only to strike boldly at the heart persia
carouse in persepolis and sleep in babylon
mischief was done to the commonwealth at
various times by the inflammatory speeches 
intemperate and venal demagogues but hath
no such mischief ever been done by such characters
in governments reputedly better balanced
and among a calmer people it would
be folly to wish the introduction the athenian
system government into england and hardly
less although somewhat less to resist those
gradual changes which in one form or other
all things must undergo every season hath
 pericles and aspasia
its peculiar distempers which may be checked
and remedied in that season but which are
chronical and incurable if they last beyond it
but among the moderns there has rarely been
a ruler or a minister inclined to take instruction
from the example past ages among
the ancients by whom polity was more studied
few neglected this advantage and none with
impunity the plague athens obliterated
all human calculations nor was any thing to be
learned in the records antiquity that could
countervail its effects it seized on pericles 
and the gates the city flew open to the spartans
they could inflict no punishment more
opprobrious than the restoration the oligarchy
athens soon threw them off again
and with short intervals grief and disgrace
she remained the favorite abode eloquence
 poetry and philosophy so that
whatever were the defects her constitution
they cannot be said to have been fatal
certain men who might have learnt better
in the lowest her schools are pleased to
represent her as insignificant philosophy
loosely picked up in france and meagerly
fed in scotland failed to crutch up the weaker
side hume from this bias by what we
pericles and aspasia 
have been accustomed to see we may well
imagine that nothing can correct the opinions
 frenchmen in regard to greatness monsieur
rapin calls the peloponnesian a war between
two petty states
the athenians at that time were the most
powerful nation in the universe and athens
in that halfcentury contained within her walls
a greater number great men than the universe
with the exception italy and england
has contained since a war between the tartars
and china is a war between two great nations
as monsieur rapin would call them yet
no more interest is excited by them than by
measles in a rabbitwarren france is also a
great nation yet what great man did france
bring forward in her long and sanguinary revolution
 him whom she chiefly boasts she
introduced from corsica a vast galley moored
eternally in the sea for the receptacle crime
we have lately seen the counterpart napoleon
in a less successful traitor that country 
the same incestuous connexions the same vulgarity
and effrontery the same rudeness bluffness
selfishness the same impetuosity and incontinence
 temper the same contempt for
veracity the same desertion friends the
s pericles and aspasia
same denunciation accomplices the same
improvidence and miscalculation the same
prurience for promiscuous celebrity the same
disregard for generous affection fair reputation
and righteous judgement the same
favorite cast much certainty for more uncertainty
 the same prodigality and waste human
life the same indifference to national content 
the same faintheartedness in the hour danger
the same destitution resources in the access
 distress the same annihilation in defeat less
guilt more compunction a worse engineer a
better epigrammatist bonaparte gained all the
prizes in the lottery because he took all the
tickets when he had won them he squandered
them away in a winter night and went
home without a shirt on his shoulders this is
the man whom some call great and some unfortunate
 his competitor for renown would
have attained it by speedier and simpler means 
and according to the best computation from all
the documents before us at about a millionth
 the expense to humanity yet the least
craving the two monsters would have killed
the wisest man in france and the only one
in our later times fit to reign there let
the people now they have chosen him make
pericles and aspasia 
the most him with whatever blemishes it
would have been foolish to throw clean linen
had there been any at hand into a boiler 
impurities and black froth
a populous nation is one thing a great nation
is another these there have been but
two in ancient times and but one in modern
dii patrie service nepotes 
if ever we become the second nation in the
world we become the vilest that people
alone can pretend to preeminence in military
glory which hath contended with disproportionately
greater numbers not once nor twice
but repeatedly habitually and vanquished them
completely thus did sweden in the reign 
gustavus adolphus and charles the twelfth 
and thus hath england done for seven centuries
that people alone can aspire to political glory
which hath risen calmly against abuses and hath
removed them without violence without one attitude
 hostility without one cry for revenge 
which hath consolidated her power without
cannon and hath guarded her chief magistrate
in his palace without the ante mural a jail
nay all this however much is not enough
there must also be the firm resolution to fight
 pericles and aspasia
for those who have shed their blood for you
without calling on others to fight instead more
yet must there be reverence for veracity disdain
for prevarication and shame that prohibits
you from absconding from an acknowledged
debt learn this monsieur tiers and nobody
will complain that despotism has thrown
his handkerchief to the prostitutes the pressgang
and that it has fallen on no decanter a
head
with far more integrity than our neighbours we
conciliate fewer adherents with far more knowledge
and information we bring less into publick
use in those who are called diplomatists we
have been for nearly a century behind the
most barbarous nations european or asiatick
the contradiction and the wonder cease
when we ascend to the source the evil that
evil which the spartans inflicted as the cruellest
and most deadly they could inflict on athens
the oligarchy to this likewise must be assigned
our periodical wars tenderly protracted
and carefully husbanded and what is more
iniquitous than the most iniquitous war and
produces more strife and hatred our bloated
overwhelming church establishment every
rising generation requires a ten years war to
pericles and aspasia 
support the younger branches the dominant
faction and the publick must pay the servile
polishers golden tufts with deaneries and
bishopricks england is now the only country
in europe where the primeval system papacy
prevails unshorn in italy it has lost nearly
all its wealth and nothing its respectability 
in england nearly all its respectability and nothing
 its wealth that which was granted for
many purposes is now diverted into one the
only one almost for which it was not granted 
the provision sons and daughters hence
the descendants persons whose chief merit
was subserviency and whose knowledge was
confined within the covers a greek classick
raise up their heads in society above the ancient
gentlemen and heraldic nobility the land
the greek is not a more difficult language than
the welsh i had a groom who acquired the welsh
 a scullion in seven or eight months and yet
never rose by merit or interest to become a
doctor divinity in athens among the functionaries
civil military and sacerdotal there
was neither prodigality nor intolerance there
were gods enow for parties to form about but
every man was contented with his own whom
he hoped to propitiate by gratitude and goods
pericles and aspasia
nature instead that moroseness and exclusion
which the blessed founder christianitycame
upon earth expressly to remove they
danced they sang they opened their hearts to
conviviality and confidence unoppressed hy
taxation their labours were light and unbru
talked by bigotry their festivals were joyous
eternal misery was desired for none and against
none denounced and their days rest were
not set apart for the sowing dissensions one
word condescendingly used among the most
gentle and generous with us was never heard
among them there is nothing so intolerable
as toleration that is the word suppose one
man should say to another who has been fighting
in his defence or who has been helping him
to carry a burden i will tolerate your presence
 i will tolerate your opinion i will even
let you sit down in my presence nay if you
will be civil you at last may speak to me
we should think this insulting enough what
then if inviting him to dinner with us we
marked the dishes he might eat and dictated
the words in which he should thank his god for
our bounty we complain that an insolent and
mad barbarian has reduced a brave nation to
servitude he with our connivance he with
pericles and aspasia 
our cooperation has perpetrated this iniquity
but he has only brought his enemy to the same
condition as his people we refuse to the companion
 our dangers the cup out which we
have assuaged our thirst and empty it on the
ground before him we refuse him what we
have given to the scotch we refuse him that
without which there can be no union that
without which there must be and ought to be
resistance and separation we have no right
and no interest to withhold one atom what
belongs in equity as much to ireland as to
scotland or to england give that and then
proclaim it treason to devise a repeal the
union let the poor the country be educated
and maintained out the estates held by
the clergy for both those purposes religion is
neither more nor less than education it teaches
the simplest and the greatest our duties and
has abundant cause to renew perpetually its admonition
when schools and houses industry
and cottages fit for human beings to inhabit
are built and established then let the
remainder the funds be divided in just proportions
and given to the ministers religion
we are shocked at the idea domestick servitude
among so enlightened a nation as the
 pericles and aspasia
athenians but they who served in that capacity
were deprived few pleasures and enjoyments
publick opinion branded the cruel
master whenever such appeared and private
interest restricted him plenteous food leisure
festivals confidence familiarity literature itself
softened the asperity and concealed in some
measure the inequality his condition he
had always a protector and usually a friend on
the contrary he who ought to be the protector
 the irishman lives in another land
and he who is his friend must be sought in another
world it is dangerous and it has been
criminal to seek him
we read the ancients to little purpose and
the pleasure we receive from them is no better
than childish if we draw no parallels in parts
 their history and in parts ours there are
many from which we can draw none at all
here however is one sufficiently obvious to the
least inquisitive
two powerful nations have been vitally affected
by natural calamities the former 
these calamities was inevitable by human prudence
and uncontroulable by human skill the
latter was to be foreseen at any distance by the
most ignorant and to be avoided by the most
pericles and aspasia 
unwary i mean in the first the plague the
athenians in the second the starvation the
french the first happened under the administration
 a man transcendently brave a man
cautious temperate eloquent prompt sagacious
above all that ever guided the councils
and animated the energies a state the second
under a soldier fortune expert and enthusiastick
but often deficient in moral courage
not seldom in personal rude insolent rash
rapacious valuing but one human life among
the myriads at his disposal and that one far
from the worthiest in the estimation an
honest and a saner mind it is with reluctant
shame i enter on a comparison such
a person and pericles on one hand we behold
the richest cultivation the most varied
and extensive genius the confidence courage
the sedateness wisdom the stateliness integrity
on the other coarse manners rude
language violent passions continually exploding
a bottomless void on the side truth and a
rueful waste on that common honesty the
disparity is as great between the athenian
and the corsican as between the countries that
produced them or even as between the writers
in the two countries who narrate their exploits
 pericles and aspasia
the system warfare determined on by pericles
was that which by degrees must have broken
down the energy and wealth the confederates 
that which was schemed by the adventurer 
ajaccio had been proved by the testimony 
all ages to be exactly the one which must terminate
in the discomfiture and ruin the invader
before he made war on russia he
should have divided germany into its smallest
component states parcelling them out among
the members the reigning families and thus
sowing illwill and disunion he should have increased
the territories the free cities much
beyond the extent the principalities but
leaving not even to the most opulent these
a population two millions poland alone
should have possessed the whole her ancient
dominions with such addition as would compose
twenty millions subjects and extend
along two seas the road was then open to
petersburg which should have been converted
from a city into a fortress in the hands its
ancient masters the swedes moscow would
have rejoiced at seeing an upstart rival reduced
to this condition and her nobility would
have regained their power and dignity sweden
poland hungary and turkey would have
pericles and aspasia 
formed a defensive league antic and the
baltick would have brought up constant supplies
to an army marching in divisions along
the coast and the artillery as well as the stores
would have partly accompanied and partly followed
it thus forty thousand horses would
have been saved and more than half the provisions
 nor could any part the army have
been surrounded or much molested russia
could not have opposed to the invader on any
point the march a hundred and fifty thousand
men she cannot even now bring into the field
two hundred thousand to the distance twenty
days march although she has one good general
and what is better something a commissariat
she was then without both in the center
 her own country she is invincible and unassailable
and always was so to strike her with
effect you must strike her like the wolf at the
extremities the french army conducted by
gustavus adolphus or montecuculi or frederick
 prussia or the duke wellington
could have conquered the world so many
pernicious faults were not committed by xerxes
or darius whom ancient historians call feeble
princes as were committed by napoleon whom
the modern do not call feeble because he felt
 pericles and aspasia
nothing for others coerced pertinaciously promised
rashly gave indiscriminately looked tranquilly
and spoke mysteriously even in his
flight signalized by nothing but despondency
segur his panegyrist hath clearly shewn that
had he retained any presence mind any sympathy
or any shame he might have checked
and crippled his adversary one glory he shares
with trajan and with pericles and neither time
nor malice can diminish it he raised up and
rewarded all kinds merit even in those arts
to which he was a stranger in this indeed he
is more remarkable perhaps more admirable
than pericles himself for pericles was a
stranger to none them literature and the
arts however although they alone embellish
empires are insufficient to ensure them prosperity
and power even where the foundations
are less deficient in solidity the causes 
duration and decadence in governments are
interesting above all others to the philosophical
mind athens seems to be always in some
danger and yet in the next chapter to that
through which we trembled for her she springs
up and surmounts the most imminent the
secret is this every citizen was interested
alike in her preservation offices were awarded
pericles and aspasia 
by ballot which were east on the names all
citizens capable fulfilling them hence every
man might have an opportunity shewing his
desert and might ultimately attain the highest
distinction by the english constitution a
portion this is and must remain impracticable
 but a greater much greater may be conveniently
carried into effect we shall then be
less degraded in the sight foreign nations 
where one minister plenipotentiary is seen fighting
in the streets to another is offered a wager
that he cannot guess the latitude london by
twenty degrees and a third observes on his
approach to vienna through the netherlands
that this rhine is an odd river it ran behind
us hut three days ago
if any other station than the royal is permitted
to remain hereditary the royal will become
its instrument to destroy or diminish the
energy and authority the popular it has
been so but it must never be again the wealth
 the nation was voted to the peerage and its
dependents by those whom the peerage seated
in parliament for that purpose to reduce the
inordinate stipend unnecessary offices is now
denominated the spoliation their children to
support the ministers religion by melting
vol ii p
 pericles and aspasia
down her gorgeous graceless decorations is
sacrilege and atheism we do not indeed all
view the matter in this light some us who
have travelled much and lived long in other
countries have remarked that in italy and
throughout the continent the papacy has her
reformed church and that in england alone
the reformed church has her papacy we are
afraid atheism and next to atheism republicanism
 two ideas which generally go together
fear republicanism prohibited the governments
 europe from establishing it in that
country where we may almost say it was indigenous
the ministers england were unaware
that giving a king to greece was giving
greece to russia warning this was loud
enough in the imaginary conversations but in
england advice to be well received must be
dearly paid for let us hope however that no
aggression on the part russia will induce
us to become the confederates those who
basely deserted their duties when they might
have smitten her with effect leave them either
to fight their own battle or to skulk away and
call us cowards austria and france must unite
against russia and never can unite on any other
ground we may whistle to the stauncher when
pericles and aspasia 
we want her no nation can injure us no nation
dares attempt it we have stood firmly against
the united armies the world and have shaken
them off like dust how was it because
every man had confidence in himself and in his
neighbour because in short every stone in the
edifice is immovable by its own vast weight
our suspended arms have been pelted with dirt
by those who felt them sorely our more glorious
literature by those who never could feel it
agamemnon had thersites for reviler homer
had soils pericles had cleon demosthenes
had milford milton had grub street and st
rameses and that one true subject more may
serve legitimate comedy shakspeare has chateaubriand

they who would introduce into any the more
ancient european kingdoms the athenian system
 government are ignorant or wicked men the
materials are unsuitable to the work it is only
holland belgium switzerland italy germany
republican by its constitution even down to our
own days and greece that contain them
many these nations must within another
century resolve themselves into forms essentially
popular the despotic spirit russia
herself breathes the dissolution monarchy on
p
 pericles and aspasia
greece and sows dissensions between her states
perpetually hostile for almost three thousand
years perhaps her own empire may split asunder
and into fragments before the consummation
 this design the policy austria
dictates the necessity fixing the barrier while
she can while turkey and poland are convertible
into efficient auxiliaries generous
minds contemplated with rapture the regeneration
as it was announced france time
our great teacher has demonstrated that an
iron hand alone can offer her the indissoluble
ring union and shut the door against discord
like the muscovite wife she despises her lord
and master unless he exerts his authority by
kicks and stripes in our own country we
neither want nor could sustain democracy on
the contrary we must repress its first advances
nothing can do this but removing the cause 
its excitement we must correct the anomaly
 the feudal system which among interests
and institutions utterly incompatible with it has
within our memory controlled the royal authority
to a greater degree than in the reign the
weakest the plantagenet and which moreover
has augmented its potency by enlisting into
its ranks the foremost and most efficient the
pericles and aspasia 
vulgar we must also eject from our church its
baronial power and princely wealth we must
allow no longer an english bishop to outweigh
in riches a dozen or more cardinals instead
 coming to london at the beck a minister
or at the news a death at lambeth or winchester
or durham let them superintend each
his college where every young man aspiring to
orders should finish his education and take his
degrees they ought to be instructors like
their master and monitors like his apostles
many things are to be borne and honest men
will bear them reluctantly lest more waters
burst through the sluice than are good for fertilization
i would not as matters are destroy
the house lords i would not as in his
drunken democracy mr william pitt did conspire
to bring it into contempt here as everywhere
else in pohty we should avoid all possible
innovations to remove abuses is indeed to
innovate in our government but my meaning
is that we must introduce nothing which wants
analogy in practice or in principle
mr fox would have reduced the peers to a
cranmer according to burnet recommended that
young clerks should he trained up under the bishops both
in their studies and in a course devotion dr chalmers
goes farther about the universities
 pericles and aspasia
series cyphers he was unlucky in all his projects
on one occasion he said he had a peace
in his pocket when he no more had a peace in
it than he had a guinea he was however less
democratic less subversive social order and
national dignity than his rival to descend
from pericles to such as these is like descending
from the downs lufton to the streets 
bristol the better the two had an equaled
match in cleon the latter before he left us
tossed up a serpent into the air which went oif
with a fizz in canning may we never see again
such a wasteful expenditure gunpowder and
coarse paper may the present men who govern
us deserve the offices they hold and the popularity
they enjoy by wisdom and moderation by

the legislature at two epochs widely distinct
has recognised devised and framed an
elective peerage this has been done for two
parts in three the empire had it been for
only one there would have been guide and authority
enough it has been done for two and
by ministers called the most constitutional and
conservative he surely who shall bring it about
for the third cannot fairly be called otherwise
the body should be so constituted as to be the
stay and support the agricultural interest
which the invention machinery and the spirit
 speculation have depressed unless it be soit
will under any form become a byword and
be scarcely more respectable in itself than the
 pericles and aspasia
rabble lawyers and literature tricked out for
stageeffect in the millinery the palais royal
and holding courts for the trial hangdogs
and incendiaries provided our peerage never
exceed nine hundred nor the portion elected
as functionaries more than three hundred why
should not gentlemen distinguished for wealth
and abilities and possessing hereditary landed
property to the low amount only a hundred
thousand pounds be called or stand ina
situation to be called to the high councilboard
 their country they would moderate
intemperate ambition and direct the most speculative

by the speeches pericles and demosthenes
may fall deeply in love with the simplex mung
 republicanism but the roman history
and another which yet awaits the pen genius
far richer in the display worth and intellect
will shew him that it has badly suited some even
 the bravest and most energetick nations we
follow in polity the homoeopathy the physicians
we enthrone a king that we may escape
a despotism we tolerate a peerage that we may
repress an oligarchy but it is hard to tolerate
shovelled up against us in heaps from the bar
and the exchange the blackest mire both
pericles and aspasia 
as things are now constituted in europe no
government can be liberal efficient and durable
 which nearly all above the foundation is not
aristocratic al but aristocracy in our country
must renounce her close connexion with oligarchy
her drum must be beaten for recruits
in fine weather never in damp and squally
she must reject a heterogeneous accretion from
the putrescent rubbish the countinghouse 
she must never stoop to measure for admittance
the smart literary aspirants who might in small
numbers be ornamental to the house commons
 but she must invite to her ranks stout
upright responsible men from the country who
leave something there and carry something with
them
we want a terminus that shall stand fast
and firm against the aggression democracy
and the grasp commerce both are useful
both are necessary but not to rule england
little is the danger that we shall be overwhelmed
by the waters from above they may
fall heavily as they have often done but the
universal ruin can only be accomplished by the
bursting up the great deeps beneath us
p o
letter to an author
you remark and indeed complain that i have
discontinued the right spelling many words 
and you will censure me again more strongly
for the reason it is this i did not intend to
publish the letters with my name because a
great party in england and every scotchman
and halfscotchman in the world is my sworn
enemy among the rest lord brougham who
before he was lord brougham was consulted
by my publisher on the legality certain expressions
in the imaginary conversations and
returned the manuscript without an answer
had he entered into it he might have learnt
some things which he never knew and he might
have seen others which he never will attain
he has much intuition did it inform him what
i thought him certainly i never ventured
to express those sentiments for i am cautious
pericles and aspasia 
in all personal matters especially to keep within
the boundary to trpeiroy
i destined the little profit that might arise
from the letters to the necessities another as
lady b knows and when that person was found
unworthy i requested my hearty tory friend
mr james whose mary burgundy scott
himself were he envious might have envied
to bestow it on any author in want money
more than myself if any such could be found
i should have acted ill and imprudently had i
diminished it by obtruding an obnoxious name
undefended by the circumvallation clubhouses
and without a sentinel to challenge an
assailant
mr hartley coleridge who inherits the genius
 his father is incorrect in mentioning me
with a set people elphinstone and milford at
the head them who attempt to spell every
word as we pronounce it what in the name
 god is there in common between these folks
and me certainly not this folly no such
idea ever entered my head there is not a
single word in the five volumes the imaginary
conversations spelt differently from what
i have found it in some learned and judicious
author or deduced from strict analogy the
 pericles and aspasia
last deviation from vulgar use is authorized by
middleton i do not consider him an excellent
writer as many do some even call him the
purest and most elegant my objection is that
like the french tragedians he gives to antiquity
a modern cast character there are also
many gross provincialisms in him scanty as he
otherwise is in idiom and these appear the most
inopportune when they rush tumultuously into
ciceronian sentences i think he is right in
spelling the word theater as he does and highly
to be praised in grantor we might as well
vfyitqfaveur and honour as grandeur if we
desire to write well we must be careful not to
remind the reader any language but his own
we must not receive him in the narrow apartments
 town dialect but must invite him into
the country where old things are fresh and
flourishing and where languages have their
branches about them it was not so in all the
nations nor in all the ages antiquity the
rude romans seized upon the words urbanity
and politeness they were the property the
athenians for although many the wealthier
lived mostly in the country like english gentlemen
yet attica was small in extent and not
simply the interests their commonwealth on
pericles and aspasia 
which every man might come forward and declare
his sentiments called them frequently into
the city but also the noble works art in
these we have only flaxman and few know
that we have him the highest and purest genius
that sculpture has gloried in since the time 
phidias yet unable to execute his great designs
he might make not only statuaries but painters
if we had stuff to make them as rafael was
called forth by the miracle ghiberti he
could not nor could michael angelo have been
what he was without it at the baptistery he
was first enamoured with the beauty form
and invested with the graces composition
afterward as his strength increased his purity
declined and in leaving florence for rome he
left paradise for eden but i must not forget
that i am now where i shall be laughed at if i
go on
shall a word so especially english in its import
be the only one the same order left in its
french dress when the french have dropped
the s in isle shall w with milton against us
retain it their language has many consonants
and many syllables that serve only for shew like
other things about them but ours wants none such
it is strange enough that i who alone attempt to
 pericles and aspasia
blow away the gathering dust and motes innovation
should be accused innovating
those who reverence least the authority their
elders and their betters are the loudest in the
outcry so when bonaparte was if ever he
was more perfidious than usual he cried out
modern carthage perfidious albion and i
remember once to have seen an irishman a
stout fellow similar character and not a
whit more civil or wary kicking another before
him through the street and shouting indignantly
you bloody tyrant my authority is 
little or no weight but the time will come and
cannot be far distant when printers and puffers
will cease to be holden in much greater we
measure our own eighth against our own doors 
when we happen to look into the structures 
elizabeth's date and cromwell's we shall find
the marks taller men we shall see such
words as sovran wherefor until til stil hart
instead heart harte will distinguish the
animal we shall never find there eoccel repel
rebel recal appal i venture to assert that
neither the greek language nor the latin in its
last depravation affords an instance so sudden
and so senseless a change never does the
single i express the sound this final syllable
pericles and aspasia 
and why should proceed be spelt in one way
recede in another convey differently from inveigh
than which last nothing can be devised
more uncouth on the contrary explain and
complain in the final syllable should be written
differently the origin being different the same
in before and wherefore which last should no
more have an e at the than wherein should
milton writes sovran not sovereign which is
not deduced from reigning as it would seem
but from the italian soprano i have never
been able to accomplish my design uniformity
in the printing my various works in this last
you will perceive my dissent from those fashionables
who believe in their hurry for reformation
that an english word can in c we
take physic but we are not yet sic
formidable as may appear these preparations
there are not thirty words that require to be
reinstated and these instead asking for more
would some them take a little less than they
once had we remember the time when anyone
would have been thought a cockscomb who
had used in conversation or even in prose composition
 the gravest kind the word respond 
but that time was before every thing was superb
and magnificent or execrable appalling and
 pericles and aspasia
awful it was when a poet might possess entirely
to himself a small voter's freehold i
never had the courage to leap over the little
sweetbriar hedge he planted to run between us
nay although i talk my horses and dogs
rather more than is suitable to the dignity 
others yet in speaking them i do not say
the dog who c nor the horse who c
pretty as the word is breaking the sameness 
that and softening the ugliness which it is
among the manifold blessings our language
as it is the italian the best age that we
may often omit these relatives and they who doit
cautiously and unerringly give us one unquestionable
proof their discernment and elegance
but whose has acquired a larger acceptation 
and our most considerate authors and best
grammarians use it not only for whom but
likewise which which having no possessive
peculiarly its own to say continually which
or even whereof which is better would be
wearisome furthermore i must confess my
hesitation and awkwardness and unfitness for
fashionable print i dare not write wo i think
it should be prohibited in any author who has
not three rings to each finger for my part 
indulge in such luxuries when they grow com
pericles and aspasia 
mon and not before and am resolved to put on
this shortskirted smartlooking weed only
when o to and sho have joined in the procession
already we have too many anomalies 
and i would rather diminish than augment the
number where the genius the language looks
with complacency on it the verb originate
used actively startles me from my propriety
in these matters my courage is not likely to
increase with my years i was always timid in
them even when i was rash in every thing else 
and almost at every step i took i consulted
many grave and abstemious and severe authorities
if we wish to write well we must keep
our greek and latin out sight we may be
sure those vegetables are the wholesome and
most savoury which remind us least the nutriment
they have received
an apology is necessary for any thing we door
think rightly unless it be sanctioned by the
countenance the literary demos in the correction
 anomalies the vulgar eye at first is
offended but only the weak eye can be inflamed
by it cicero blames as rustick the writing and
pronunciation cives for cives which all writers
 latin wrote soon afterward until they were
corrected by fronto in the time marcus
 pericles and aspasia
aurelius antoninus who although he wrote in
greek was versed and skilful in latin efforts
were made to support the ancient institutions
 the language so far back as the days 
cicero there was a dread innovation and he
appears to find refreshment at the old well 
plautus whom he praises frequently aulis
genius tells us that even some cicero's words
had become obsolete for instance eocantlare
yet quinctilian thought him as many have
thought since when he said ille se profecisse
scat cui cicero valde placebif here indeed
his own expression is not precisely what an ancient
author would have used it wants the
logick language its true and accurate interpretation
is he may he sure he has made
much proficiency whom cicero shall greatly
please now this sounds better in english
than in latin which is rider a writer 
cicero's age would have used placuerit placet
or placet all three unexceptionable and expressing
no contingency or futurity as the other
does in strictness propriety for it says
he may now be sure that he has made
much proficiency whom cicero will hereafter
please cicero himself would have written
placuerit for the sound common writers plapericles
and aspasia 
seat the lover simplicity placet in the age
 quinctilian they did not like a natural course
and easy termination but wished to display
strength and dexterity by giving their sentences
a sudden jerk and throwing them on their
haunches hence we find perpetually the spon
dick close preceded by an anapest a dactyl
or a tribrachys quinctilian fronto and symmarius
were too ostentatious this trick
pliny and tacitus wrote like gentlemen but
tacitus got into the habit casting a squints
turn the eye at every whisper and throwing
a mysterious gloom on every puddle
we have seen that whoever has been most
eminent in scholarship and genius among the
ancients and ourselves has been most studious
to correct the imperfections his native
tongue the french have labored on a scantier
soil with equal industry and as fruit is
often best where climate is least indulgent
their labours have been crowned with success
to what a degree delicacy has that language
been brought which judging by its pronunciation
seems intended never to have been written
and out which it requires a stranger to elicit
a tone poetry in the language in which the
double li versailles c is without a definite
 pericles and aspasia
sound in which oit e oient have one indistinguishable
and in which all these are like e is it
not admirable that voltaire should have written
with a grace beyond the grace athens rousseau
with such variety and energy and bossuet
with such a fulness harmony such a depth 
intonation as was never heard in oratory since
demosthenes shook the throne philip it
would be difficult to find in bossuet such a piece
 tawdriness as this in cicero who together
with stuff graver colour and closer texture
hath many such in his wardrobe heir primum
opens illus civitatis victce comminutcb
depressceque sunt is not this enough and to
spare no he goes on in triplets again in
hoc port atheniensium nobilitatis imperii
glorice what now pretty nearly the same
as before but somewhat less than depressed absolutely
sunk and swamped naufragium factum
 is this quite certain it was so before 
but now only eocistimatur invested with its
true title existimatur is hob major to the
usual peal esse videatur now do not read this
to boys and barristers we who know what
greatness is are never irreverent but they
might be great men must have their confessors
but may choose them
pericles and aspasia 
we are little aware how much our language
hath suffered since the time goldsmith in
writing this last sentence i am reminded that
he never uses the word hath this is fastidious
and feminine i would always use it where the
next word begins with or with c having the
sound s others the present day i observe
employ it exactly in those positions is
there any ear that is better pleased with has
surely than with hath surely has seldom than
hath seldom f it has been remarked to me
and i see it that some our best writers have
become more terse more correct more varied
more harmonious by having redd my imaginary
conversations that is much they have
not houseroom at present for the opinions i
am careless how many or how few adopt these
but language is a publick concern none was
ever so much corrupted in the spelling at least
within so short a space time we write
recal impel repel dispel why should the
compound syllable have this power it would
be more reasonable however little so to write
tel because here could be no ambiguity in the
pronunciation formerly the single final
used always to indicate an unaccented sound 
so did the t is it not odious to use latin
 pericles and aspasia
words anywhere for english simile for simili 
a stimulus for a stimulant ratio for ration or
rate and again for greek names to give
latin as ephori stride mycenae when we
reject the form the diphthong in our idiom 
it is piteous when we can find no truly english
termination in that case however we may abstain
at least from groping in the latin for it
that language has done for us all it can do and
at last is beginning to corrupt us the genius
and charms goldsmith could not release our
shoulders from the heavy old man that bestrode
them we may hyphen it away as we please
but there never were and never can be such
words as cherishes refreshes c the
english language the human voice disclaims
them
analogy would release us from many our
perplexities and incongruities but in england
it is thought an act rudeness to offer anything
to one who does not ask for it to shew
the right road to him who stops and doubts
about it is only a little too officious but it is
insolent in the last degree to call back him who
is going far astray some defects analogy
are ancient date others not modern indeed
but before our times and now beyond our reach
pericles and aspasia 
the first is exemplified in the accent concord
and record differing from that accord and
sounding too like conquered we derive little
benefit from the beautiful letter r which the
old grammarians a blunteared race everywhere
called the canine yet there are few words
singularly sweet without it take the first that
offer eriphyle deianira parthenope hamadryades
amaryllis heroine ermine
and jrmida whoever takes the trouble to
count this letter and s in three pages english
poetry and three greek will find them
frequenter in the greek taking the both
into the computation for is only a graver s
the letter m is the least sonorous and the
satin poets in time began to discover its inconvenience
 so that when was received again in
full force m was the only consonant elided
how they managed it we cannot tell it must
have been in some such manner as the devil
folded up his tail in the poem that porson stole
from southey m however meets us four times
in the prettiest nonsense verse that ever boy
wrote
sylvester tenui musa meditates avena
that we may exhibit what our vigorous tongues
 pericles and aspasia
are capable performing we throw back upon
the first syllable the accent commendable
corollary contemplative c not contented
here we render one the most beautiful words
in our language the ugliest i can recollect in
any sojourn we pronounce sujjern surely it
will be necessary soon to establish an italian
opera in every town at the expense government
that we may experience what happiness
there is in the harmony a language
i had almost forgotten an ancient folly crawling
forth in another direction persevere for per
sever there is not i venture to affirm a single
one these objections which the most captious
and inconsiderate can reprehend neither is
there one example which we can hope to see
corrected we have southey and fonblanque
among us as great authorities as any who have
gone before them yet in this court appeal
i apprehend we shall find them sitting side by
side upon the bench the conservatives i
likewise am radically a conservative in everything
useful and during my stay at this inn
called human life i would trust any thing to
the chambermaids rather than my english
tongue
some dozens more similar questions start
pericles and aspasia 
up before me only to be repressed the athenian
dialect beautiful as it was and susceptible
but few alterations did however go forward
in its improvement until the age menander
this although we receive it on the testimony
 grammarians is almost incredible to us unlearned
men whose ears have been pillowed on
the roses aristophanes and plato our own
language seems varying every day under cooks
auctioneers and compositors i dare not use rouge
nor costume we have our native red and national
dress utterance is a trisyllable why not entrance
as in shakspeare synonymous anonymous
anomalous should all be spelt with an
 we write forego not forget nor forgive
our native tongue contains in the final sound 
its words a richer variety than even the greek
itself and there is more harmony in one single
 paradise lost than in all the poetry that
ever was heard upon earth since the angels sang
at its creation yet we squander all these advantages
away as we are used to do with lighter
things our letters have their attila pitt and
robespierre 
happily we likewise have a body good
writers both in prose and poetry the poetical
world had lain dormant for three whole
vol ii q
 pericles and aspasia
centuries interrupted only by a few loud breathing
from the masculine breast ennius when
lucretius sprang up like an orb fire and
awoke into life a generation poets who left
behind them no successors from the banishment
 ovid until the banishment dante
for the periods genius are to be marked by
its calamities there were the long dark ages
thirteen hundred years the only space equal
duration since the beginning the world
throughout which scarcely a glimpse poetry
burst forth anywhere in asia some artificial
lights were tost about but in europe the irregular
and incalculable dante whose magnitude
eclipsed the brightest luminaries ancient italy
was preceded only by some brief and vivid coruscations
from the rocks iceland and scandinavia
this wonderful man inferior but to
shakspeare homer and milton resembled
the poet our commonwealth in three main
points his daring genius his abomination 
sacerdotal tyranny and his ardour to establish
the laws and improve the condition his language
the latin in his time had been contaminated
by barbarians and had taken refuge
in the cloister yet fastidious as our modern
cri ticks may be lost nothing its analogies
pericles and aspasia 
nothing its orthography and little its
beauty for many centuries the greek likewise
is perspicuous and delightful in the dissertations
 dion chrysostom these however
did not obtain for him his superlatively splendid
name
ovid and tibullus seem to have written with
the most purity the poets virgil and propertius
and horace studied more to gratify the
humours and peculiarities a generous patron
whose character was essentially greek and we
shall find in them a display hellenic tropes
and figures more recondite and elaborate than
in the greeks themselves some happy verses
have escaped from under the heaviness propertius
and come forth with the sweetest effect 
as little slaves look most joyous where the master
is dozing or lying down virgil's verse all
praises are inadequate and vain never was
such harmony heard afterward but in the loftier
spheres a shakspeare and a milton we are
informed by aulis genius that he was inconstant
in the spelling certain words this
may well be we also have some which are
spelt in two manners for instance again and
in poetry agen enough and enow but in the
last the pronunciation is become more widely
 pericles and aspasia
different there is no edition virgil not
even heine's in which the spelling is carefully
observed we find in it the letter which
the romans were as ignorant as they were w
did virgil write cu and not like catullus
quod certainly he did not write cujus for c
had not taken the place q when that old word
was in use and he was the last who wrote it
i am rather too excursive on the subject
but it is one which occupied more than merely
the leisurehours cicero and caesar and
if ever we should have a writer who aspires to
the glory eloquence and who attempts to
compose with their purity he must previously
take many a turn in this vacant portico
i had much extended my remarks on this
subject in that volume the imaginary conversations
which contains the dialogue between
tooke and johnson and i thought detaching
its materials from the body the work and publishing
it apart at this time an american traveller
passed through tuscany and favored me with
a visit at my country seat he expressed a wish
to reprint in america a large selection my
imaginary conversations omitting the political
he assured me they were the most thumbed
books on his table with a smile at so ener
pericles and aspasia 
getick an expression perhaps an undesirable
distinction i offered him unreservedly and unconditionally
my only copy the five printed
volumes interlined and interleaved in most
places which i had employed several years in
improving and enlarging together with my
manuscript the sixth unpublished he wrote
to me on his arrival in england telling me that
they were already on their voyage to their destination
again he wrote informing me that a
friend a nameless one had left them at an
american merchant's in florence i inquired
there and found the man indignant at such a
charge against his punctuality he declared he
never had seen or heard them without a
question in regard to the anonymous friend i
told the american traveller in few words that
they were lost and requested him to take no
more trouble on the occasion than i myself
should do i never look for any thing lest i
should add disappointment and something 
inquietude to the loss i regret the appearance
 his more than the disappearance 
mine my letter introduction to mr r
whom he simply and unceremoniously calls a
barrister procured him at my request admittance
to c l and his sister both whom
q
t pericles and aspasia
he seems to have jidgctted my letter presentation
to lady b threw open i am afraid
too many foldingdoors some which have
been left rather uncomfortably ajar no doubt
his celebrity as a poet and his dignity as a
diplomatist would have procured him all those
distinctions in society which he allowed so
humble a person as myself the instrumentality
 conferring here and there are persons
great and small who interest me little yet i
wish the traveller had spoken in a slight degree
more respectfully my friend r the most
courageous man in existence who determined
to resign his profession when he had acquired
by it ten thousand pounds and who did then
resign it when he was gaining ground daily
we should raise a statue to every lawyer such
integrity we might do it without fear indictment
for obstructing the streets another wish
is that the ingenious and goodnatured traveller
had represented somewhat less ludicrously
c l and his sister not knowing or not minding
that he is the most exhilarating and cordial
 our writers and she the purest if amid the
accidents human life the anonymous friend
be living and if it hath pleased god by the
seavoyage or any other means to have restored
pericles and aspasia 
to him the blessing memory so that'll may
recollect where he deposited the volumes and
manuscripts and if he will consign them to my
publishers i shall be happy to remunerate him
handsomely for the salvage should we be unsuccessful
for the present i am yet confident
that either in bottle or bladder the unpublished
portion however mutilated and disfigured will
be cast upon the shores the atlantick and
reach the hands to which it was entrusted i
have always found my ink grow paler by transfusion
 and i cannot tell how it may stand in
america after an exposure so corrosive
greatly as i have been flattered by the visits
 american gentlemen i hope that for the
future no pencilled similar compositions will
deviate in my favour to the righthand the
road from florence to fiesole in case mistake
there is a charming view the two cities
and valdarno and vallombrosa from the
irongate at the entrance to my grounds i could
not point out a more advantageous position

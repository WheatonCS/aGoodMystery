mischiefs
are like the visits franciscan friars
they never come to prey upon us single
devils law case
return we now to eleanor mowbray after
she had parted from ranulph rosewood and
had watched him till he disappeared beneath
the arches the church porch her heart sank
and drawing herself back within the carriage
she became a prey to the most poignant affliction
in vain she endeavoured to shake ow
this feeling desolation by picturing to herself
the meeting with her lover in a few hours
in happiness it would not be despair had
taken possession her the magic fabric 
delight melted away or only gleamed to tantalize
at unreachable distance a presentiment
 rosewood
that ranulph would never be hers had taken
root in her imagination and overshadowed all
the rest in vain she strove to turn to
thoughts more cheering and consolatory pressed
as by a nightmare her bosom refused
to be relieved its load
while eleanor was thus plunged in affliction
mrs mowbrays speculations and in a less
degree those her son were directed towards
the same object ranulph rook wood busied
in revolving the singular though as yet unintelligible
avow al he had made a possible change
in his fortunes she exerted all her force 
mind to discover some clue to the mystery a
change in his fortunes this change had no
reference to lady rook wood that idea he had
himself refuted and indeed she was aware 
the unalienable nature her brothers property
could it relate to herself it had been in the
power her father sir reginald rosewood
who had created the entail to have disposed 
his lands as he saw fitting but he had disposed 
them so she had heard and the issue male his
rook wood 
sons were named in the succession and she
herself in her last dread interview with her
father the recollection which was graven like
the cicatrice a wound upon her memory a
wound that had its seasons throes and shooting
tortures had heard his declaration that she
herself should be for ever excluded from his
possessions from participation in his wealth 
that she should be a stranger to his name to
his house to his blood after sifting every
suggestion carefully she became satisfied that if
a new claimant had sprung up to rosewood it
was in the same character that ranulph himself
derived his title and the more closely she canvassed
her brothers early life the more fully
assured she became the correctness her
conjectures
from whatever source derived mrs mowbray
was intimately acquainted with sir pierss unfortunate
attachment to susan bradley and
aware also that there had been offspring born
to them she could not dwell upon the detail
that had been given her brothers devoted
 rosewood
love and the descriptions susans matchless
beauty without arriving at the conclusion that
in the ardour passion he had yielded to the
entreaties and blandishments this lovely and
seductive girl and secretly espoused her but
from the circumstance her lowly origin
had hesitated to avow his union when her
sudden death prevented the necessity disclosure
this hypothesis did not it is true
account for her brothers subsequent desertion
 his child but when mrs mowbray set
the weakness sir pierss character in the
balance with the resolute qualities his
wife she perceived which was likely to preponderate
and that if he had ever conceived
the intention avowing his marriage his
apprehensions the consequences as was in
reality the fact would have deterred him from
open acknowledgment this suspicion once
awakened in mrs mowbrays mind received
abundant confirmation in her opinion from
ranulphs halfexpressed hints and his sudden
and mysterious appearance at the funeral
 
and who was he who should now be heir to
rosewood this was a question she had no
means answering she knew nothing and
could conceive nothing but her curiosity
nevertheless was strongly excited on this head 
the more so inasmuch as she was unable in the
slightest degree to gratify it another consideration
from which she shrank with a sense 
extreme uneasiness for cold and haughty as
she was mrs mowbray was not utterly devoid
 sensibility was whether in case ranulph
rosewood should be supplanted in his inheritance
she would dechne his suit eleanor
she would fain at this moment have shunned
this self investigation the response she felt
would be too prompt she could not accept
him for her son
mrs mowbray it must be remembered was
the elder born sir reginald rosewood she
was also the daughter his gentle bride the
lady eleanor but she partook more the
calculating pride and vindictive sternness which
distinguished her father than her mothers
 lockwood
softer attributes the legacy vengeance
bequeathed by her dying parent which she
tacitly accepted even as a child and resolved
upon executing could not have been delegated
to a hand more capable its ministration
nothing but her own degradation and to
her a mesalliance such as she formed was the
greatest degradation that could have befallen
her both in her own esteem and in that sir
reginald could inflict the blow she wished to
strike she at once determined to immolate
herself
the story has been already told plighted
to an earl she fled with a paper no overwhelming
sentiment love influenced her in
this unworthy choice no thought save that 
heaping the bitterest mortification upon her
fathers head induced its commission but she
had studied sir reginalds character and in his
only assailable point she stabbed him the
blow went home but revenge is a twoedged
sword the blade smote either way
united to one whom she neither respected
rook wood
nor regarded unsupported in her fallen state
by love which alone could have buoyed her
up amid the stormy sea into which she had
plunged consumed by secret pride which like
the spartan youth who sustained unflinching
the fiery coal that fell off the altar she bore
without complaining tortured by all the horrors
 poverty and to the proud heart there
can scarce be greater horrors she felt that if
she had succeeded in wreaking her vengeance
upon her father the injury she had done herself
was the more lasting and irremediable
still through it all her firmness character
forsook her not fallen she might be yet it
was by her own act that she fell and she
would have died rather than utter a murmur
have endured a martyrdom sooner than
seek for a reconciliation
brighter days did indeed dawn upon her
a slight accession fortune restored her to
comparative independence and her husbands
decease shortly after liberated her from a certain
controul which she had found irksome and
b 

completed her emancipation by prudent management
and by entirely residing abroad ina
state seclusion and in a style the
most rigid economy she had greatly increased
her means but still with a sense her own
sufferings fresh in her remembrance she determined
that never with her consent should
a daughter heres wed other than a wealthy
suitor
with this disposition it may be readily conceived
mrs mowbray would view any material
change in the condition ranulph 
as an absolute bar to his union with
eleanor and that she did regard it in that light
was certain the match between the cousins
she considered as in every way desirable nay
as most eligible and the coldness with which she
received ranulphs advances upon the intimacy
arose from the haughty reluctance on her part
to be the first to make overtures peace the
differences between the father and daughter
having extended to the other children as
ranulph appeared fixed in his attachment and
rook wood 
had incurred his fathers resentment by his consistent
adherence to his election acceding only
to a temporary estrangement from the object 
his affections with the express determination 
renewing his offer at the expiration that
period probation and as eleanor herself
seemed to be equally involved in the same
tender sentiment mrs mowbray tacitly complied
with her daughters inclinations and
without making a remark on the subject suffered
her to remain unmolested up to the time
 sir pierss death and ranulphs expected
return thus when she conceived that all obstacles
were removed a more fatal one presented
itself she trembled for eleanor but the spirit
 worldliness prevailed she persuaded herself
that in the event the contingency 
which she was apprehensive it was her duty
to break off the proposed alliance little sophistication
was required to satisfy her scruples
prudence and policy formed her mental salvo
it is surprising how easily people consider
themselves guided by a sense duty when
 
interest and inclination are at hand to direct
them
and eleanor as she stole a furtive glance
at her daughter and saw her evident perturbation
some perception the cruelty such an
act towards her darling child was awakened
within her bosom but the feeling was transitory
little the softness none the
weakness her sex pertained to mrs mowbray
love was a passion which she had
often heard but which she had never felt
she could conceive it but her theoretical and
we might say likewise heretical opinion was
so wide the reality as to lead her into the
erroneous notion that the raging flame could
be restrained within certain limits and might
be extinguished altogether should circumstances
require it she felt that she was able to do so
and reasoning upon that fallacious argument
she fancied that it would be equally in the
power her daughter to exercise such contrived
over her affections nothing more she imagined
would be necessary than the expression her
 
wish to be followed by eleanor ready acquiescence
submission the meekest the gentlest
to her mothers behests formed the main
feature in eleanors affectionate character compliance
with her injunctions seemed to be the
primary law her nature as indeed it should
be ever in the child but perhaps that tyrannous
ascendancy which a strong mind is apt to
assume over one weaker constitution and
by this epithet we mean that yielding weakness
which is womans strength led sirs mowbray
to exact more obedience from her daughter than
was consistent with parental tenderness to require
and made the passive submission 
eleanor appear more in the light subjection
than duty
reared in the most perfect seclusion the whole
 her childhood had been spent immediately
under her mothers eye and to her alone was she
indebted for instruction and counsel by her
mother alone was the pliant material her
disposition modelled up to the period when
she first beheld ranulph rosewood her 
lockwood
ther her brother whom lately she had seen
little her flowers her music her books her
bark in which she skimmed the blue tide the
garonne her favourite dog her neverabsent
companion these had formed the little world 
her regard the nucleus her sympathies the
sole objects her solicitude they were her
delights her occupations her existence
her brother returned the family left
france for england she exchanged the quietude
the solitude the lonely chateau for the
giddy whirl the british metropolis the
transition was too violent to be pleasing she
was dazzled but overpowered delighted yet
bewildered and often sighed in secret for her
bark upon the garonne and her bower upon
its banks it was long ere she became reconciled
to customs to usages and to society
to which she had never been habituated she
met with ranulph rosewood new emotions
were instantly awakened her heart she felt
had hitherto been void she loved and for the
first time what a dawn delight fresh
 
and beautiful as a glimpse eden burst upon
her young imagination 
for she on honey dew had fed
and drank the milk paradise
filled with a thousand tender aspirations unknown
before inexplicable to the exquisite simplicity
 her nature her soul had now no longer
to dwell upon memory for delight the present
had happiness sufficient the impression once
received she thought not the flowers she had
cultured the river nooks she had haunted 
the large antiquated house dearer to her than a
palace and its many untenanted and unfurnished
rooms along whose sounding floors her
merry feet had skipped or whose walls had
echoed with her joyous laughter with her lightsome
song or if she thought them her
musings were now mysteriously associated with
ranulph peopling the wilderness with his image
and linking his presence with each favourite spot
bright as was its dawn the love eleanor
was scarce called into existence ere it was
crushed the sky that was filled with the
 rook wood
purple light love was suddenly overcast
 the opening flower was rudely trodden
down the chords harmony were shivered
as soon as struck ranulph departed all
that had hitherto been radiant became as
night amid which hope alone like a solitary
star and even hope was oft obscure shone
down upon her they met again it is true
after their lengthened separation with hearts
unchanged with vows unbroken the sky for
an instant was filled with rosy hue again but
not as heretofore presentiments coming
misfortune like chilly winds blighted the joy
 their reunion and clouds seemed gathering
in the horizon their happiness
while eleanor pursued this tristful train
 reflection the time insensibly wore away until
the sudden stoppage the carriage aroused the
party from their meditation major mowbray
perceived that the occasion the halt
was the rapid advance a horseman who
was nearing them at full speed the appearance
 the horseman was somewhat singular
and might have created some uneasiness as
rook wood 
to the nature his approach had not the
major immediately recognised a friend he was
nevertheless greatly surprised to see him and
turned to mrs mowbray to inform her that
father ambrose to his infinite astonishment
was coming to meet them and appeared from
his manner to be the bearer unwelcome
tidings
wrapped in a long black cloak with a broad
brimmed hat drawn closely over his brows it
was impossible to distinguish further the
priests figure and features beyond the circumstance
 his height which was remarkable
until he had reached the carriage window
when raising his hat he disclosed a head that
titian might have painted and which arising
from the dark drapery looked not unlike the
visage some grave and saturnine venetian
there was a venerable expanse forehead
thinly scattered with hair towering over black
penthousewife brows which in their turn
shadowed keen penetrating priestlike eyes 
the temples were hollow and blue veins might
be traced beneath the sallow skin the cheeks
lockwood
bones high and there was something in the
face that spoke selfmortification while the
thin livid lips closely compressed and the
austere and sinister expression his countenance
showed that his selfabasement if he
had ever practised it had scarcely prostrated
the demon pride whose dominion might
still be traced in the lines and furrows 
his haughty physiognomy the father looked
at mrs mowbray and then glanced suspiciously
at eleanor mrs mowbray appeared
to understand him
you would say a word to me in private
said mrs mowbray shall i descended
the priest bowed assent
it is not to you alone that my mission
extends said he gravely you are all in
part concerned your son had better alight
with you
instantly replied the major if you
will give your horse in charge to the postillion
we will attend you at once 
with a feeling renewed apprehension
connected she knew not why with ranulph
 
eleanor beheld her mother and brother descend
from the carriage
father ambrose was perhaps the only being
whom eleanor disliked she had felt an unaccountable
antipathy towards him which she could
neither extirpate nor controul during their long
and close intimacy it may be necessary to mention
that eleanor s religious culture had been
in accordance vith the tenets the romish
church in whose faith the faith her ancestry
her mother had continued and that father
ambrose with whom she had first become
acquainted during the residence the family
near bordeaux was her ghostly adviser and
confessor an englishman by birth he had
been appointed cure to the diocese in which
they dwelt and was consequently a frequent
visitor almost a constantinople the chateau 
yet though duty and respect would have
prompted her to regard the father with affection
eleanor could never conquer the feelings
 dislike and distrust which she had at first
entertained towards him a dislike which was
increased by the strange controul in which he

seemed to hold her mother who regarded him
with a veneration approaching to infatuation
it was therefore with satisfaction that she bade
him adieu he had however followed his friends
to england under a feigned name as being a
recusant romish priest and supposed to have
been engaged in certain jesuitical plots his return
to his own country was attendedwith considerable
risk and had now remained domesticated with
them for some months that he had been in
some way early in life connected with a branch
 the house rosewood eleanor was aware
she fancied he might have been engaged
in political intrigue with sir reginald which
would have well accorded with his ardent ambitious
temperament and the knowledge this
circumstance made her doubly apprehensive
lest the nature his present communication
should have reference to her lover towards whose
cause the father had never been favourable and
respecting whose situation he might have made
some discovery which she feared he might use
to ranulphs disadvantage
with such misgivings therefore eleanor
 
watched the motions the party narrowly in
hope to gain some clue from their gestures
to the subject their conversation from the
earnest manner the priest and the interest
which his narrative seemed to excite in his
hearers it was evident that his communication
was importance
accompanied by father ambrose mrs mowbray
returned to the carriage while the major
mounting the horse the latter after bidding
a hasty adieu to his sister adding with a look
that belied the consolation intended to be
conveyed by his words that all was well
but without staying to offer her any explanation
 the cause his sudden departure rode back
the way they had just traversed and in the
direction rosewood bereft the only
person to whom she could have applied for
information though dying with curiosity and
anxiety to know the meaning this singular
interview and the sudden change plans
which she felt so intimately concerned herself
eleanor was constrained to preserve
jsj lockwood
silence as after their entrance into the carriage
her mother again seemed lost in painful
reflection and heeded her not and the father
drawing from his pocket a small volume
appeared intently occupied in its perusal
dear mother said eleanor at length
turning to mrs mowbray my brother is
gone 
to said mrs mowbray in a
tone calculated to check further inquiry but
eleanor was too anxious to notice it
and wherefore mother said she may
i not know 
not as yet my child not as yet replied
mrs mowbray you will learn all sufficiently
early
the priest now raised his catlike eyes from
the to watch the effect this speech
but dropped them instantly as eleanor turned
towards him she had been about to appeal
to him but having witnessed this look she
relinquished her scarceformed purpose and
endeavoured to divert her tristful thoughts
 
by gazing through the glimmering medium 
her tears upon the soothing aspect external
nature that aspect which in sunshine or in
storm hath ever relief in store for a heart
embittered by the stony coldness human
nature turn to the bosom nature ye that
are sore afflicted and ye shall find the relief
ye seek the sympathy after which ye yearn 
the road meanwhile had led them through
o
a long woody valley and was now climbing the
sides a steep hill they were soon in the
vicinity the priory and the gipsies
encampment the priest leaned forward and
whispered something in mrs mowbrays ear
who looked towards the ruined shrine part
 whose mouldering walls were visible from
the road
at this moment the clatter a horses hoofs
and the sound a loud voice commanding
the postillion in a menacing tone to stop
accompanied by a volley imprecations
interrupted the conference and bespoke the
approach an unwelcome intruder and one
 
whom all too truly feared would not be readily
dismissed the postillion however did his
best to rid them the assailant perceiving a
masked horseman behind him approaching at
a furious rate he had little doubt as to his
intentions and turpin soon made his doubts
certainties he called to him to stop but the
fellow paid no attention to his command
however peremptory and disregarded even
the pistol which he saw in a casual glimpse
over his near side was presented at his
person clapping his spurs into his horses
flanks he sought succour in flight turpin
was by his side in an instant as the highwayman
endeavoured to catch his reins the lad
suddenly wheeled the carriage right upon lii
and but for the dexterity turpin and
the clever conduct his mare would inevitably
have crushed him against the roadside as
it was his left leg was slightly grazed irritated
at this turpin fired over the mans
head and with the buttend the pistol
felled him from his seat startled by the
 
sound and no longer under the governance
 their rider the horses rushed with frantic
violence towards a ditch which bounded the
other side the highway down which the
carriage was precipitated and at once overturned
turpin s first act after he had ascertained that
no mischief had been occasioned to those within
beyond the alarm incident to the shock was to
compel the postillion who had by this time
gained his legs to release the horses from their
trace this done with the best grace he could
assume and adjusting his mask he opened
the carriage and proceeded to liberate the
captives
beg pardon madam said he so soon as he
had released mrs mowbray excessively sorry
upon my soul to have been the cause so much
unnecessary alarm to you all the fault i assure
you that rascal a postillion had the fellow
only pulled up when i commanded him all this
might have been avoided you will remember
that when you pay him all his fault i assure
you maam 
vol iii c
 
receiving no reply he proceeded to extricate
eleanor with whose beauty the inflammable
highwayman was instantly smitten leaving the
father to shift for himself he turned to address
some observation coarse gallantry to her
but she eluded his grasp and flew to her mothers
side
it is useless sir said mrs mowbray as
turpin drew near them to affect ignorance 
your intentions you have already occasioned
us serious alarm much delay and inconvenience
i trust therefore that beyond our
purses which are but scantily supplied but to
which you are welcome we shall sustain no
molestation you seem to have less the
ruffian about you than the rest your lawless
race and are not i should hope destitute 
common humanity
common humanity replied turpin bless
you madam im the most humane creature
breathing would not hurt a fly much less
a lady incivility was never laid to my charge
this business may be managed in a few
lockwood 
seconds and as soon as we have settled the
matter lend your stupid jackboy a hand
to put the horses to the carriage again and get
the wheels out the ditch you have a banker
maam i suppose in town perhaps in the
country but i don t like country bankers 
besides i want a little ready cash in rumville 
beg pardon maam london i mean but my
ears have been so stunned with those romany
patterns i almost think in flash just draw mea
cheque ive pen and ink always ready a
cheque for fifty pounds maam only fifty
whats your bankers name ive blank
cheques all the best houses in my pocket 
that and a kiss from the pretty lips that
cherrycheeked maid winking to eleanor
will fully content me you see you have
neither an exorbitant nor uncivil personage to
deal with
eleanor shrank closer towards her mother
exhausted by previous agitation the night
greatly frightened by the shock which she had
just sustained and still more alarmed by the
 lockwood
words and gestures the highwayman she felt
that she was momentarily in danger fainting
and with difficulty prevented herself from falling
the priest who had succeeded in freeing himself
from the carriage now placed himself
between turpin and the ladies
be satisfied misguided man said the
father in a stern voice offering a purse which
mrs mowbray hastily extended towards him
with the crime you have already committed
and seek not to peril your soul by deeper guilt
be content with the plunder you now obtain and 
depart for by my holy calling i affirm to you
that if you advance one footstep towards the
further molestation these ladies it shall beat
the hazard your life
 bravo exclaimed turpin now this is
what i like who would have thought the old
autem bawler had so much pluck in him sir
i commend you for your courage but you are
mistaken i am the quietest man breathing and
never harm a human being in proof which
only look at your rascal a postillion whom
 
any one my friends would have sent posthaste
to the devil for half the trouble he gave me but
easy as i am i never choose to be baulked in
my humours i must have the fifty and the
buss and then fm off as soon as you like and
i may as well have the kiss while the old lady
signs the cheque and then we shall have the
seal as well as the signature pol pol no
nonsense many a pretty lass has thought it
an honour to be kissed by turpin
eleanor recoiled with deepest disgust as she
saw the highwayman thrust aside the useless
opposition the priest and approach her
he had removed his mask his face flushed with
insolent triumph was turned towards her despite
the loathing which curdled the blood within
her veins she could not avert her eyes he
drew near she uttered a shrill scream at that
moment a powerful grasp was laid upon turpins
shoulder he turned and beheld luke
save me save me cried eleanor addressing
the new comer
damnation said the highwayman what
has brought you here one would think
 lockwood
you were turned assistant to all distressed
damsels quit your hold or by the god above
us you will repent it
fool exclaimed luke talk thus to one
who heeds you and as he spoke he hurled
turpin backwards with so much force that
staggering a few yards the highwayman fell
to the ground
the priest stood like one stunned with surprise
at lukes sudden appearance and subsequent
daring action
luke meanwhile approached eleanor he
gazed upon her with curiosity mixed with admiration
for his heart told him she was very fair
a deathlike paleness had spread over her cheeks 
yet still despite the want colour she looked
exquisitely beautiful and her large blue eyes
eloquently thanked her deliverer for her rescue
the words she wanted were supplied by mrs
mowbray who thanked him in appropriate
terms when they were interrupted by turpin
who had by this time picked himself up and
was drawing near them his countenance wore
a fierce expression
 si
i tell you what said he luke bradley
or luke rosewood or whatever else you may
call yourself you have taken a damned unfair
advantage me in this matter and deserve
nothing better at my hands than that i should
call you to instant account for it and damme if
i dont too 
luke bradley interrupted mrs mowbray
are you that individual 
even so madam replied luke
father ambrose is this the person whom
you spoke eagerly asked the lady
it is returned the priest
did he not call you luke rosewood 
eagerly demanded eleanor luke is that
also your name 
rosewood is my name fair cousin replied
luke if i may venture to call you so
and ranulph rosewood is 
my brother
i never heard he had a brother cried
eleanor with some agitation how can
that be
 wood
i am his brother nevertheless replied
luke moodily his elder brother r
eleanor turned to her mother and the priest
with a look imploring anguish she saw a
confirmation the truth this statement in
their glances no contradiction was offered by
either to his statement both indeed appeared
in some mysterious manner prepared for it this
then was the dreaded secret this then was
the cause her brothers sudden departure
the truth flashed with lightning swiftness across
her brain
chagrined and mortified luke saw that glance
 inquiry his pride was hurt at the preference
thus naturally shown towards his brother
he had been struck deeply struck with her
beauty he acknowledged the truth peters
words eleanors loveliness was without parallel
he had seen nought so fair and the instant he
beheld her he felt that for her alone could he
have cancelled his vows to sybil the spirit
 rivalry and jealousy was therefore instantly
aroused by eleanors exclamations
 s
his elder brother echoed eleanor dwelling
upon his words and addressing luke
then you must be but no you are not you
cannot be it is ranulphs title it is not yours
you are not 
i am sir luke replied luke
proudly
ere the words were uttered eleanor had
fainted
assistance is at hand madam if you will
accept it and follow me said luke raising the
insensible girl in his arms and bearing her
down the hill towards the encampment whither
he was followed by mrs mowbray and the
priest between whom during the hurried dialogue
which we have detailed very significant
glances had been exchanged turpin who as
it may be supposed had not been an incurious
observer at what was passing burst into his
usual loud laugh on seeing luke bear away
his lovely burthen
cousin ha ha said he so the wench
is his cousin damme but i half suspect that
c
 
he has fallen in love with his newfound cousin 
and if so miss sybil or im mistaken will look
as yellow as a bean if that little spanish
devil gets it into her pretty jealous pate that
he is about to bring home a new mistress
we shall have a tragedy scene in the twinkling
 a bedpost however i shan t lose sight 
sir luke until i have settled my accounts
with him hark ye boy continued he addressing
the postillion remain where you are 
you wont be wanted yet awhile i imagine
theres a guinea for you to drink dick turpins
health
upon which he mounted his mare and
walked her easily down the hill
and so that be dick turpin folks talk so
much about quoth the lad looking curiously
after him well hes as civil speaking a chap
as need be blow my boots if he aint and if
id had a notion it were he id have stopped at
first call without more ado nothing like expel

 
hence i shall know better another time added
he pocketing the shiner
rushing swiftly down the hill luke tarried
at the rivers brink to sprinkle some the cool
element upon the pale brow eleanor ashe
held her in his arms thoughts which he fain
would have stifled in their birth took possession
 his heart would she were mine 
murmured he yet no the wish is unworthy
but that wish returned unbidden
eleanor opened her eyes she was still too
weak to walk without support and luke raising
her once more in his arms and motioning
mrs mowbray to follow crossed the brook by
means stepping stones and conducted his
charge along a byepath towards the priory so
as to avoid meeting with the crew assembled
upon the green
they had gained one the roofless halls
when he encountered balthazar astonished at
the sight the party the patrico was about to
address the priest as an acquaintance when his
more orthodox brother raised his finger to his
 rook wood
lips in token caution the action passed unobserved

hie thee to sybil said luke to the
patrico bid her haste hither say that this
maiden that eleanor mowbray is here and

requires her aid fly i will bear her to the
refectory
as balthazar passed the priest he pointed
with a significant glance towards a chasm in
the wall which seemed to be an opening to
some subterraneous chamber the father again
made a gesture silence and balthazar hastened
upon his mission
luke led them to the refectory he brought a
chair for eleanors support but so far from
reviving after such attention as could be afforded
her she appeared to become weaker
he was about to issue forth in search sybil
when to his surprise he found the door fastened

our orders are that you do not pass this
way said a voice which luke instantly recognized
as that the knight malta
 
not pass i echoed luke what does this
mean 
our orders are from the queen returned
the knight
at this instant the low tolling a muffled
bell was heard
the bell exclaimed luke some danger
is at hand
his heart smote him as he thought sybil
 he looked anxiously towards eleanor
balthazar rushed into the room
where is sybil cried luke will she
not come 
she will be here anon answered the
patrico
i will seek her myself then said luke
the door bv which you entered is free
 it is not free replied balthazar remain
where you are
remain here echoed luke who will
prevent my going forth 
i will said barbara lovel as she suddenly
appeared in the doorway you stir
 rook wood
not excepting at my pleasure where is the
maiden continued she looking around with
a grim smile satisfaction at the consternation
produced by her appearance ha 
i see she faints here is a cordial that shall
revive her mrs mowbray you are welcome to
the gipsies dwelling you and your daughter 
and you sir luke rosewood i congratulate
you upon your accession dignity turning
to the priest who was evidently overwhelmed
with confusion she exclaimed think you i
know not richard checkley we have met
ere this at rosewood know you not barbara
lovel ha ha it is long since my poor
dwelling has been so highly honoured but
i must not delay the remedy give her to
drink this said she giving a phial to mrs
mowbray it will instantly restore her
it is poison cried luke she shall not
drink it
poison reiterated barbara behold 
and she drank the liquid i would not
poison thy bride added she turning to luke
lockwood 
my bride echoed luke
ay thy bride repeated barbara
luke recoiled in amazement mrs mowbray
almost felt inclined to believe she was a dreamer
so visionary did the whole scene appear a dense
crowd witnesses stood at the entrance foremost
amongst them was the sexton suddenly a
shriek was heard and the crowd opening to
allow her passage sybil rushed forward

and worn out memory
shakerley marions antiquarysybils
sudden entrance filled the group that
surrounded miss mowbray with new dismay
but she saw them not her soul seemed riveted
by eleanor towards whom she rushed and
while her eye wandered over her beauty she
raised the braided hair from her brow revealing
the clear polished forehead wonder awe
devotion pity usurped the place hatred
the fierce expression that had lit up her dark
orbs was succeeded by tender commiseration
she looked an imploring appeal at barbara
ay ay returned the old gipsy extending
at the same time the phial i understand
lockwood 
here is that will bring the blood once more into
her pallid cheeks and kindle the fire within her
eyes give her this
this echoed sybil regarding the phial
with distrust
ay this retorted barbara and quickly
why dost pause do it and waste not a drop
 the precious potion tis the drink life
 life eternal perchance said sybil still
hesitating
mrs mowbray vainly endeavoured to restore
her child to animation seriously alarmed she
now called loudly for assistance
go i command thee give her the cordial
said barbara with a meaning gesture
my hand shakes or i would minister to her
aid myself
fear nothing said luke approaching
them tis as she says a cordial delay may
endanger miss mowbrays recovery
and do you likewise command me to doit
 asked sybil reproachfully luke
luke signified his assent and without further
 
remonstrance she obeyed the effect the
potion was almost instantaneous amply attesting
barbaras skill in its concoction stifled respiration
first proclaimed eleanors recovery she
opened her large and languid eyes her bosom
heaved almost to bursting her pulses throbbed
quickly and feverishly and as the stimulant
operated the wild lustre excitement blazed in
her eyes
sybil took her hand to chafe it the eyes 
the two maidens met they gazed upon each
other stedfastly and in silence eleanor knew
not whom she regarded but she could not mistake
that look sympathy she could not
mistake the tremulous pressure her hand 
she felt the silent trickling tears she returned
the sympathising glance and gazed with equal
wonder upon the ministering fairy for such she
almost seemed that knelt before her lovely
it was to see these two fair creatures together
alike in beauty yet how different in its expression
 day and night could not be more opposite
each was equally enchanted with the other

looks speak as plainly as words nay plainer
they tell what words cannot what words dare
not they talk from the heart whereas the lips
often speak the language constraint the
eyes youth seldom belie the feelings and
how much may not a glance convey in this
instance it spoke volumes on both sides
as eleanors looks wandered from the kindly
glance sybil to the withered and inauspicious
aspect the gipsy queen who in her strange
and fantastical gear looked like the baleful witch
mara and shifted thence to the dusky gnomelike
figures her gipsy gang looming in
the twilight entrance like familiars the sorceress
 as she gazed upon these wild objects
she exclaimed who are these and where am
i
you are in safety replied luke this
is the ruined priory st francis and those
strange personages are a horde gipsies you
need fear no injury from them
my deliverer murmured eleanor when all
at once the recollection that he had avowed
 
himself a rosewood and the elder brother 
ranulph flashed across her memory gipsies 
did you not say these people were gipsies your
own attire is the same as theirs you are not
cannot be the brother ranulph
i do not boast the same mother returned
luke proudly but my father was sir piers
rosewood and i am his elder bomb
he turned away dark thoughts swept across
his brain maddened by the beauty eleanor
stung by her slights and insensible to the
silent agony sybil who sought in vain to
catch his eye but who spoke not he thought
 nothing but revenge and the accomplishment
 his purposes all within was a
wild and fearful turmoil his better principles
were chained down by the onward promptings
 evil that prophecy said he but
that is nought yet barbara called her my
bride my bride oh that it were so would
that i could call her mine would that she
loved me in lieu ranulph he is my brother 
yet i have no brotherly love towards him and
rook wood 
if that prophecy should be truth and with
her he should wrest from me my newlyacquired
possessions my happiness would be wrecked
but this shall never be she is here she is
mine she shall be mine and sybil what
 her a stunning yelling demon shouts
within and drowns the cries conscience
methinks if the tempter were near at hand
to offer that maiden to me even at the peril
 my souls welfare i could not resist it
the tempter was at hand he is seldom
absent on occasions like the present the
sexton stood beside his grandson luke
started he eyed peter from head to foot
almost expecting to find the cloven foot supposed
to be proper to the fiend peter grinned
in ghastly derision
so ho thou wouldst summon hell to thine
aid and lo the devil is at thine elbow pshaw 
look not startled man i am no dealer in the
black art i am no fiend or familiar fiend
or aught unearthly in the guise earth i ama
mere creature clay like thyself but i can
 rook wood
render thee all the aid thou couldst derive from
powers darkness she is thine
miner echoed luke wildly peter
bradley grandsire man fiend be thou what
thou mayest for i can hardly think thee human
trifle not with me i am in no mood for it
i am distracted thou hast kindled wildfire
in my heart it scorches it burns
he has it muttered peter regarding him
fixedly for a moment the dark delusion
 his race is upon him he is doomed like
the rest
devil didst thou not say she should be
mines
spare thy nicknames i repeat it she
shall be thine 
make good thy words cried luke impatiently

softly softly returned peter the bird
is snared it can only flutter it cannot escape
moderate thyself and thy wishes shall be accomplished
thine own desires chime with those 
others nay with those barbara she would
 
wed thee to miss mowbray thou stares but
it is so this is but a cover for some deeper
plot no matter it shall go hard despite her
cunning if i foil her not at her oavn weapons
there is more mischief in that old womans
brain than was ever hatched within the crocodiles
egg but she shall find her match do
not thwart her leave all to me she is about
it now added he noticing barbara and jirs
mowbray in conference together be patient
i will watch her and he quitted his grandson
for the purpose scanning more closely the
manoeuvres the old gipsy
barbara meanwhile had not remained inactive
you need fear no relapse in your daughter
i will answer for that said the old gipsy to
mrs mowbray sybil will tend her quit
not the maidens side continued she addressing
her grandchild adding in a whisper be
cautious alarm her not mine eye will be upon
thee drop not a word 
so saying she shuffled to a little distance
with mrs mowbray keeping sybil in view
 rook wood
and watching every motion as the panther
might watch the gambols the fawn from out
its lair
know you who speaks to you said the
old crone in the peculiar low and confidential
tone assumed by her tribe to strangers have
you forgotten the name barbara lovel 
i have no distinct remembrance it
returned mrs mowbray
think againe said barbara and though
years are flown you may perchance recall the
black gipsy woman who when you were surrounded
by gay gallants with dancing plumes
lordlings and gentles high degree perused
your palm and whispered in your ear the
favoured suitors name bide with me a
moment madam said barbara seeing that
mrs mowbray shrank from the recollection
thus conjured up i am old very old i have
survived the shows flattery and being vested
with a power over my people am apt perchance
to take too much upon myself with others
the old gipsy paused here and then assuming
 
a more haughty manner exclaimed the
estates rook wood are ample
ha
they should have been yours lady and
would have been but for that marriage you
would have beseemed them bravely but sir
reginald was wilful and erased the daughters
name to substitute that his son pity it is
that so fair a creature as miss mowbray should
lack the dower her beauty and her birth entitle
her to expect pity that ranulph rook wood
should lose those lands and titles at the moment
when he deemed they were dropping into his
possession pity that those broad lands should
pass away from you and from your children
as they will do if ranulph and eleanor are
united
they never shall be united replied mrs
mowbray hastily surprised out her caution
twere indeed to wed thy child to beggary
said barbara
mrs mowbray sighed deeply
there is a way continued the old crone
vol iii d
 
by which the estates might still be hers and
thine
how asked mrs mowbray eagerly
sir piers rosewood had two sons
ha
the elder is here
luke sir luke he brought us hither
he loves your daughter i saw his gaze
 passion just now i am old now but i have
some skill in lovers glances why not wed
her to him i read hearts you know
but returned mrs mowbray with hesitation
 though i might wish for though i
might sanction this eleanor is betrothed to
ranulph she loves him
think not jievy if you are satisfied she
cannot judge so well for herself as you can for
her she is but a child she knows not what
she loves her affection will soon be lukes
he is a noble youth the image his grandfather
your father sir reginald and if she be
betrothed to any one twas to the heir 
rosewood why should the marriage not take
place at once and here y
 
here 
even here depart and ranulph and she
may meet your plans may be overthrown
you are within sacred walls i will take you
where even an altar stands there is no lack 
holy priest to join their hands together your
companion master richard checkley or by
whatever other name he calls himself will do
the office fittingly he has essayed his clerkly
skill already on others your house
to what do you allude mysterious woman 
asked mrs mowbray with anxiety
to sir piers and susan bradley returned
barbara
ha did he unite them he never told me
this
he dared not do so he had an oath which
bound him to concealment but death has now
absolved him the time is coming when greater
mysteries may be revealed
tis strange i should not have heard this
before said mrs mowbray musingly and
yet i might have guessed as much from his
 
obscure hints respecting ranulph i see it all
now i see the gulf into which i might have
plunged but i am warned in time father
ambrose continued she to the priest who was
pacing the chamber at some little distance from
them is it true that my brother was wedded
by you to susan bradley
ere the priest could reply the sexton presented
himself
ha the very father the girl said mrs
mowbray whom i met within our family vault
and who was so strangely moved when i spoke to
him alan rosewood is he here likewise 
alan rosewood echoed barbara upon
whom a light seemed suddenly to break ha 
what said he him 
 boding raven interposed peter fiercely 
be content with what thou knowest the
living and trouble not the repose the dead
let them rest in their infamy
the dead echoed barbara with a chuckling
laugh ha ha he is dead then and what
became his fair wife his brothers minion 
lockwood 
twas a foul deed i grant and yet there was
expiation blood flowed blood 
no blood no blood said peter tth a
dreadful look
no blood ha i forgot the rookwoods
never strike none since the first have done so 
and what alan s daughter 
silence thou night hag thundered peter
or i will have thee burned at the stake for the
sorcery thou practises beware added he ina
deep tone i am thy friend
barbaras withered countenance exhibited for
an instant the deepest indignation at the sextons
threat the malediction trembled on her
tongue she raised her staff to smite him but
she checked the action in the same tone but
with a sharp suspicious look she answered
my friend mayest thou see that it prove so
or beware me
and with a malignant scowl the gipsy queen
slowly shuffled towards her satellites who were
stationed at the door
chapter viii
no marriage i esteem it where the friends
force love upon their children where the virgin
is not so truly given as betrayed
i would not have betrothed people for
i can by no means call them lovers make
their rites no wedlock but a sacrifice
combat love and friendship
miss mowbray had witnessed her mothers
withdrawal from her side with infinite uneasiness
and was with difficulty prevented by sybil
from breaking upon her conference with the
gipsy queen barbaras dark eye was fixed
upon them during the whole the interview
and communicated an indefinite sense dread
to eleanor
who who is that old woman asked
eleanor under her breath never even in
my wildest dreams have i seen aught so terrible
why does she look so at us she terrifies me 
and yet she cannot mean me ill or my mother
we have never injured heres
 
alas sighed sybil
you sighs exclaimed eleanor in alarm
is there any real danger then help us to
avoid it quick warn my mother she seems
agitated oh let me go to her
hush whispered sybil maintaining an
unmoved demeanour under the lynxlike gaze
 barbara stir not as you value your
life you know not where you are or what may
befal you your mother is not in danger you
alone have cause for fear
 exclaimed eleanor growing pale as
death and with difficulty repressing a scream
 why should danger alight on me what have
i done what avill you gain by insuring me
not you i fear but her that terrible old woman
who glances at us like a hungry wolf tell me
tell me how am i in danger do not hold me
let me go to my mother or lead me forth
into the open air any where but here
command yourself lady i entreat you
said sybil as you value your life let not the
trembling a nerve if you can controul it
 
betray your apprehension your safety depends
upon your composure your life is not in
danger but what is dearer than life your love
is threatened with a fatal blow there is a
dark design to wed you to another
heavens ejaculated eleanor and to
whom
to sir luke rosewood
i would die sooner marry him they shall
kill me ere they force me to it 
could you not love him 
love him i loathe him i have only seen
him within this hour i knew not his existence
 he rescued me from peril i would thank
him i would love him if i could for ranulphs
sake and yet for ranulphs sake i hate him
speak not him thus to me said sybil
angrily if you love him not love him
oh forgive me lady pardon my impatience
my heart is breaking yet it has not ceased
to beat for him you say you will die sooner
than consent to this forced union here are
the means and unperceived by barbara she
 
placed the poignard within the folds eleanors
bosom
i would rather die than wed him said
eleanor shuddering but this is a dreadful
alternative take back your dagger i dare
not use it
and you love ranulph 
 i dare not die i shrink from selfdestruction
 my hand trembles even while i touch the
steel
yet keep it the moment may arrive when
you will clutch it firmly
oh no yoti may view death with indifference
 i never can not even love can disarm
it its terrors life is very dear to me
dearer than your lover said sybil with ill
disguised scorn
ranulph is true to me he loves me said
eleanor i cling to hope as to existence
true true returned sybil you are not
all desolate as i am give me the dagger goto
your mother i will protect you if there
must be a victim i will be the sacrifice god
d
 
grant i may be the only one be happy as
happy as i am wretched you shall see what
the love a gipsy can do
sybil took the poignard and burst into a flood
 passionate tears eleanor regarded her with
the deepest commiseration but the feeling
was transient for barbara now advancing
exclaimed hence to thy mother the
bridegroom is waiting to thy mother girl 
and she motioned eleanor fiercely away what
means this continued the old gipsy what
hast thou said to that girl did i not caution
thee against speech with her and thou hast
dared to disobey me thou my grandchild
the daughter my agatha with whom my
slightest wish was law i abandon thee i
curse thee 
oh curse me not r cried sybil add not
to my despair
then follow my advice implicitly know
thyself cast off this weakness all is in readiness
he shall descend into the vaulted chapel 
the ceremony shall there take place there also
lockwood 
shall she die and there again shalt thou be
wedded 
to death groaned sybil
take this phial continued barbara 
place it within the folds thy girdle when
all is over i vill tell thee when to use it be
firm be true i will remove all obstacles
thou wilt have no fear rivalry all will then
be over
it will indeed be over muttered sybil
and have you no pity for youth and
innocence 
none when they interfere with my purposes

no fear for the consequences crimes so
dreadful 
none the guilt the punishment be
mine i will brave all i will fulfil my word
thou shouldst be lady rosewood were the
title to be purchased by the blood all their
line art thou prepared shall we set out 
i am i am prepared replied sybil in
accents hollow as despair but let me speak
with luke before we go
 rook wood
 to what 
grant me this request i beseech you
mother this last request and ask me not my
motive i will obey you in all else leave us an
instant together 
be brief then each moment is precious
go to him he is yonder keep a guard upon
thy tongue i will to mrs mowbray stay
thou hast placed the phial in safety a drop
will free thee from thy troubles
tisin that hope i guard it replied sybil
as she departed in the direction luke
barbara watched her join her faithless lover
and then turned shortly towards mrs mowbray
and her daughter
luke was alone the sexton remained in
earnest converse with mrs mowbray and the
priest peter had instilled his venom he
left it to operate he had others besides luke
upon whom to practise luke meanwhile with
hasty step paced the further the apartment
from time to time he cast anxious
glances at sybil and eleanor as he regarded
the former he felt the bitterest remorse at
 
his conduct internally execrating himself for
his cruelty and hardness heart yet did
he lack the resolution to avow his penitence
and implore her forgiveness this feeling 
compunction was however short lived he
looked at eleanor and sybils image was obliterated

you are ill dear luke said sybil who had
silently approached him very ill
 echoed luke breaking into frantic
laughter ha ha upon my wedding
day no i am well well your eyes are
jaundiced by jealousy
jealousy luke luke this from you
laugh not thus it terrifies me i shall think
you insane such laughter is ghastly such
levity fiendish there you are calmer you are
more like yourself more human you looked
just now oh god that i should say it you
as if you were possessed by devils
and if i were possessed what then p
what then horrible hint not at it
you almost make me credit the dreadful tales
fm 
i have heard that on their weddingday the
rook woods are subject to the power the
evil one
upon their weddingday and i look thus 
you do you do oh cast it from you
she is mine she is mine i care not though
fiends possess me so it be my weddingday 
and thou sayst i look like a rosewood ha
ha
that wild laughter again luke i implore
thee hear me one word my last 
i will not hear reproaches
i mean not to reproach you i came to bless
you to forgive you to bid you farewell will
you not say farewell 
farewell
not so not so mercy my god compassionate
him and me my heart will break with
agony luke if you would not kill me recall
that word let not the guilt my death be
yours tis to save you from that that i
die
die
rook wood bt
for you but oh let it not be hy you
sybil you have said rightly i am not
myself i know not what demons have possession
 my soul that i can behold your agonies
without remorse that your matchless affection
should awaken no return but so it is since
the fatal moment when i beheld yon maid
i have loved her
loved her gasped sybil
 wildly desperately
no more now i can part with you 
farewell
stay stay wretch that i am stay sybil
if we must part and that it must be so i feel
let me receive your pardon if you can bestow
it let me clasp you once more within my
arms may you live to happier days may
you 
oh to die thus sobbed sybil disengaging
herself from his embrace live to
happier days saidst thou luke when have
i given thee reason to doubt for an instant the
sincerity my love that thou shouldst venture
to insult me thus 
 
then live with me live for me
live for thee echoed sybil if thou canst
love me still i will live for thee as thy slave thy
minion thy wife aught that thou wilt have me
be thou hast raised me from wretchedness
oh continued she in an altered tone have
i mistaken thy meanings saidst thou those
words in false compassion for my sufferings 
speak it is not yet too late all may be well
my fate my life is in thy hands if thou
lowest me yet if thou canst forsake eleanor
speak if not be silent
luke averted his head
enough continued sybil in a voice 
agony i understand may god forgive thee
fare thee well we shall meet no more
do we part for ever r asked luke without
daring to regard her
for ever answered sybil
before her lover could reply she shot from his
side and disappeared from his view swifter
almost than thought she plunged amidst
the dark and dense assemblage near the
door amongst the crowd she discovered the
 
face one upon whose fidelity she could depend
were it to peril life for her welfare and the
boon which sybil was about to ask might endanger
the safety any one who should
concede it that she felt but it was not a
moment for hesitation
her attendant handassah was the individual
whom she beheld in eager tremulous
whisper she breathed in her ears these words 
handassah may i trust in thee 
the faithful handmaiden instantly signified
her ready acquiescence
gone with me then behind yon projection 
the wall we are unseen give me thy cloak 
quick quick none observe us amidst this confusion
 barbara is engaged now give me thy
kerchief girl there i have bound it round my
temples do i look like thee handassah my
god i look not thou like me i would have none
other so miserable thou art my own size and
 my complexion we gipsy girls are all one
complexion and thine eyes he said they were
like mine but thou hast not my hair no 
but thou shalt have and with her poignards
od 
point the wretched maiden severed her luxuriant
and braided tresses and gave them to
handassah attach these useless bands to
thine own fasten them so keep them hereafter
for my sake he once loved them handassah 
but that is gone robe thyself within this
shawl as is the custom our race when in
affliction muffle thy face within it haply thou
mayest escape the scrutiny barbara at least
till all be over
this exchange attire though effected
with wonderful promptitude by handassah who
looked in her disguise a very counterpart her
mistress had not been altogether unperceived by
some her band luckily the proceeding was
hidden from barbaras view nor were they who
witnessed it disposed to betray the confidence she
involuntarily placed in them sybil was beloved
by all and her escape gladly connived at in
the apparel handassah she gained the door
and though in her own person her departure
would have been refused she was allowed to go
forth in her present disguise
she emerged into the open air she stood
 
within the roofless hall it was filled with
sunshine with the fresh breath morn
the ivied ruins the grassy floor the blue
vault heaven seemed to greet her with
a benignant smile all was riant and rejoicing
all save her amid such brightness her
sorrow seemed harsh and unnatural and as
she felt the glad influence day she was scarce
able to refrain from tears but she did refrain
the effort was heartbreaking it was terrible to
leave this beautiful world that blue sky that
sunshine and all she loved so young so soon
entering the low arch that yawned within
the wall to which we have before alluded she
vanished like a ghost at the approach mom
chapter ix
thou hast practised on her with foul charms 
abused her delicate youth with drugs and minerals
shakspeare othello
amongst those who had noticed sybils metamorphosis
and departure was jerry juniper
md he had remarked it not without some uneasiness
 for if truth must be told the black eyes
f the pretty brunette handassah had been the
oadstars which attracted the caper merchants
son towards the patterns romany and detained
him amongst their tents handassah
was neither a coquette nor a flirt she requited
jerrys passion and for such a fickle personage
juniper was more constant than might have
been anticipated three moons however had
only revolved over their liaison 
rook wood 
 what the devil are you about my dear said
he becoming serious though he could not under
any circumstances divest himself his slang and
swagger if s as much as your life is worth todo
what you have done i wont answer for the
consequences if barbaras hawks eye penetrates
your disguise why need you meddle in this
matter if barbara has made up her mind i
should as soon think opposing the arch queen
 beelzebub as attempt to interfere with her
hush hush be quiet returned handassah
 i am frightened enough already without your
adding to my terror but i will risk any thing
for sybil if you love me keep near and
contrive if possible to interpose your person
between me and barbara whenever she looks
in my direction
i will do my best certainly answered
jerry but it will be confoundedly awkward
and still more unpleasant if any unexpected
eclaircissement should take place for my part
i cant conceive whats to come all this
mystery and manoeuvring but never fear girl
 lockwood
ill stand by you and by sybil too should
need be added he affecting a sympathy
which we are sorry to say he did not feel
hist barbara calls for sybil thats you 
you know now keep behind me i wont
indulge her with a more particular view 
your pretty face than i can possibly help
you ask if i love you see what risks i am
prepared to run for you let my present conduct
be my answer
with fear and trembling handassah advanced
jerry hovering before her in his jaunty fashion
chuckling and spreading himself out like a
turkey guarding its chick from an adverse
brood all his dexterity and assurance were
needed to shelter her from barbaras scrutiny and
it is probable that but for the libations he had
swallowed even jerrys impudence might have
failed him at this critical conjuncture barbara
was in no mood for trifling he saw in an
instant by her eye the ticklish situation in
which he stood but he could not in honour
slink back so he floundered forward but his
lockwood 
laughter changed to somewhat that sort which
is vulgarly described as being on the wrong side
 ones mouth as he stood close beside the
gipsy queen after all what a glorious thing
is assurance it carries all before it it is the
greatest privilege genius jerry nodded
slightly not daring to make a salutation more
profound for fear betraying his mistress
i called for sybil what wouldst thou 
ha cried barbara in a tone that showed him
plainly enough that any pleasantry he might
attempt would be illtimed the joke he had
meditated died away upon his lips
it is ill playing with edged tools thought
jerry
where is sybil asked barbara
she is here replied jerry alls up
muttered he what the devil shall i do 
art thou her spokesman said barbara
stand aside
might i have a moments speech with you 
continued jerry struggling to maintain his
ground
 
not now well what isnt speak quickly
thou pertinacious knave
it concerns your self 
out with it then
this marriage
ha
the crew murmur
murmur ha 
not exactly murmur i am wrong 
but they talk you understand they talk
you know what i mean by talking they know
you are a wonderfully wise woman that you have
more in you than half your sex put together
they admit all this they are prepared like
good and faithful lieges to do whatever you
bid them and ask no questions but still they
dont exactly see how marrying sybils lover to
her rival can benefit either her or you perhaps
you will deign to give them some explanation
explanation ha dost thou chaffer with
them thus i know thee sirrah thou art not
one us thou art not gipsy born i have
marked thee a marriage saidst thou thou
 
shalt have another marriage my making besides
this to talk thou hast trifled with the
affections one the daughters my people
with handassah the wench must have
been a weak fool indeed to credit the professions
 such a one as thou art better men have
ineffectually besought her howbeit as she wishes
it she shall wed thee
wish it madam she does not wish it i
am perfectly persuaded that you could not do
handassah greater displeasure than to marry her
to me
handassah heard it all and longed to throw
herself at barbaras feet and acknowledge the
justice her sentence but that was impossible 
and the faithful handmaiden could only heave a
deep sigh and bewail her lovers inconstancy
and thou denies all intimacy with her 
all intimacy the sort you allude to
madam certainly
handassah heaved a deeper sigh it reached
the ears barbara
tis false returned the gipsy queen
vol iii e
 
handassah hath avowed her love and her fears
 thee to sybil beseeching my interference in
her behalf is it not so sybil said she
not this to thee 
her silence contradicts it there must be
some mistake were handassah here she
would readily refute the charge sybil must
have misunderstood her she tacitly acknowledges
her error it is astonishing what ill
consequences arise from misapprehensions this
sort my attentions were the most trifling
kind such as a man gallantry must pay to
every pretty girl i may have said more than
i meantwho can always command his speech 
 c jijot thou i am sure returned barbara 
thou shalt wed her or i will have thee
scourged through the camp till not an ounce
 flesh shall hang upon thy bones speak
sybil handassahs fate rests with thee
madam i assure you she cannot speak 
you only embarrass her handassah would
only be committed by any indiscretion on her
part and sybil be betrayed into difficulties
 
jerry threw as much meaning as he dared
into his speech in hopes that handassah would
take the hint the situation both parties
was it must be owned sufficiently embarrassing 
jerry however conducted himself throughout
with very considerable nonchalance
this is strange muttered barbara what
can sybils silence mean retire sirrah i will
consult with her
whatever she may say madam replied the
unblushing juniper she will sooner be able to
convict me designs against herself than 
peace come hither sybil 
faint my charmer cried jerry turning
towards her faint or we are dished entirely
perfidious wretch replied handassah i
will scratch your eyes out you vile monster on
the first seasonable opportunity
faint in the meantime or alas up with
sybil returned jerry with delectable coolness
handassah accordingly uttered one those
hysterical screams which many her sex have
ready for occasions like the present and falling

into jerrys arms buried her face in his bosom
contriving at the same time to give him a very
severe pinch which the delinquent endured vith
the resignation a martyr
poor thing she struggles shockingly cried
jerry with admirablyaffected alarm it must
be a fit how excessively unlucky
 unlucky indeed exclaimed barbara the
girls weakness will destroy my fairest plans
call handassah to her assistance
had i not better bear her into the open air
she will never recover here i am persuaded
do so thy life be answerable for thy
charge stay bear her at once to the vaulted
chapel let handassah go with thee
she shall go with me depend upon it
answered jerry bearing her off in triumph
somewhat allayed by the scene which he anticipated
in private
to return to miss mowbray in a state
 mind bordering upon distraction eleanor
rushed to her mother and flinging her arms
wildly round her neck besought her to protect
aookwood try
her mrs mowbray was deeply touched by
her daughters distress what mother could
be otherwise she was alarmed at her frantic
manner at the words she uttered and which
though incoherent were not to be mistaken
she folded eleanor to her bosom and sought
by every means in her power to restore her
to calmness eleanor became calm but her
terrors returned as she looked around
mother dear mothers said she at length
i have been a timid creature ever but i have
hitherto been spared the consciousness 
my own weakness with jou near me i
have never as yet known what it has been to be
afraid but now i fear even you will lack the
power to aid me what will your single arm
avail against yon fearful band were you to
raise it in my defence they will murder me
mother in your presence
who do you fear my child 
i know not whom and scarcely what i have
to dread said eleanor all seem to desert me
even my reason
 
mrs mowbray gazed anxiously upon the
altered countenance her daughter but a fewmoments
relieved her from much her uneasiness
the expression pain gradually subsided
and the look vacuity was succeeded by one 
frenzied excitement a film had for an instant
or two dimmed her eyes they now gleamed
with unnatural lustre she smiled the smile
was singular it was not the playful pleasurable
lighting up the face that it used to be
but it was a smile and the mothers heart was
satisfied
mrs mowbray knew not to what circumstance
she could attribute this wondrous change she
looked at the priest standing beside them she
was equally surprised but he was more apt in
divining the probable cause the sudden
alteration in eleanors manner
what if she have swallowed a love powder 
said he approaching mrs mowbray and speaking
in a whisper i have heard such abominable
mixtures indeed the holy st jerome
himself relates an instance similar sorcery in

his life hilarious and these people are said
to compound them
it may be so replied mrs mowbray in the
same tone i think that that peculiar softness
in the eye is more than natural
i will at least hazard an experiment to
attest the truth or fallacy my suppositions
returned the father i have heard that those
who have drank these philters conceive a
sudden and irresistible passion for him they
gaze upon while under the influence the
potion i will direct her attention to the
youth seest thou thy destined bridegroom
yonder continued he addressing eleanor
she followed with her eyes in the direction
which father ambrose pointed she beheld
luke we know not how to describe the
sensations which now possessed her she
thought not ranulph or if she did it was
with vague indifference wrapped in a kind 
mental trance she yielded to the pleasurable impulse
which directed her unsettled fancies
towards luke for some moments she did not
 iiookwood
take her eyes from him the priest and airs
mowbray watched her in silence
nothing passed between the party till luke
joined them eleanor continued gazing at him and
the seeming tenderness her glance emboldened
luke to advance towards her the soft fire
that dwelt in those orbs was however cold as
that which sparkles on the wing the lucia
luke approached her he took her hand she
withdrew it not he kissed it still she withdrew
it not but gazed at him with gently
glimmering eyes
my daughter is yours sir luke 
exclaimed mrs mowbray
what says the maid herself asked luke
eleanor answered not her eyes were still
fixed on him
she tvdll not refuse me her hand said luke
ha it is not eanulphs hand screamed
eleanor recoiling from his touch
ranulphs echoed luke gloomily
you are aware her attachment to your
brother said mrs mowbray
 
i am time may conquer it you give her
to me iviadam 
i do
enough returned luke again taking eleanors
hand this time the victim resisted not
benedicite exclaimed the holy hypocrite
to the subterranean shrine cried barbara 
and she gave the preconceived signal to the
band
there cried luke why should it not
take place here these walls are hallowed
within that chapel lived and died a saint
said barbara there shall it be
it must not it shall not take place there
said the priest
what do you refuse richard checkley 
said barbara with a ghastly smile dare you
refuse m i say it shall take place there or
wheresoever else i please
you give strange license to your tongue
wilt thou obey me 
nay let her have her way whispered
peter i have prepared them
e
 
are you ready asked barbara the priest
bowed reluctant assent
the signal was repeated by the gipsy
crew elevating a lighted torch over his
head the knight malta drew excalibur
from its scabbard and prepared to lead the
way to the subterranean chapel we may
here casually note that the crew had been
by no means uninterested or silent spectators 
passing events but had on the contrary indulged
themselves in a variety conjectures as
to their probable issue
make way there make way palls for the
bride and bridegroom cried the knight 
malta
the train began to move eleanor leaned
upon the arm her mother beside them stalked
barbara with an aspect triumph luke followed
with the priest one by one the assemblage
had quitted the apartment
the sexton alone lingered the moment
is at hand said he musingly when all shall
be consummated
hookwood 
a few steps brought him into the court the
crowd was there still a moments delay had
taken place the knight malta then entered
the mouth the vault he held his torch so as
to reveal a broken flight steps conducting
it would seem to regions perpetual night
so thought eleanor as she shudderingly gazed
into the abyss she hesitated she trembled
she refused but her mothers entreaties and
barbaras threatening looks induced in the 
reluctant compliance at length the place was
empty peter was about to follow when the sound
 horses hoofs broke upon his ear he tarried
for an instant and the mounted figure the
highwayman burst within the limits the court
ha ha old earthworm cried dick
my nestor the churchyard alone where
the devil are all the folks gone wheres sir
luke and his newfound cousin eh 
peter hastily explained
a wedding under ground famous the
thing all others i should like to see ill

desire to anticipate my destiny stay here you
must and will thats peremptory you will bethe
gainer by it sir luke will reward you
nobly i will answer for him you can serve
him most effectually ranulph rosewood and
major mowbray are expected here
the devil they are but how or why 
i have not time to explain in case a
surprise discharge a pistol they must not
enter the vault have you a whistle for you
must play a double part and we may need your
assistance below
sir luke may command me heres a pipe
as shrill as the devils own catcall
if it will summon you to our assistance
below tis all i need may we rely on you 
lely on me when did dick turpin
desert his friends any where on this side the
 
styx the sound that whistle will reach me
ill ride about the court and stand sentry
enough cried the sexton as he dived
under ground
take care your shins shouted dick
thats a cursed ugly turn but hes used to
the dark a surprise eh ill just give a
look to my snappers flints all safe now im
ready for them come when they like and
having made the circuit the place after the
manner the amphi theatrical ducrow he
halted near the mouth the subterranean
chapel to be within hearing peters whistle
and throwing his right leg lazily over his saddle
proceeded coolly to light a short pipe the
luxury the cigar being then unknown
humming the while snatches a ballad the
theme which was his own exploits
as was riding oer hounslow moor
i saw a lawyer trot on before 
so i rode up and asked if he was not afraid
to meet dick turpin that mischievous blade
to meet dick turpin that mischievous blade
 
thus between longdrawn whiffs did he chaunt
slapped in the smokers dreamy elysium with
short pipe ruminant his solitary song and
though apparently lost in forgetfulness and
listening to his own melody he remained with
one ear thrown back like that the hare
on the alert for every sound it was this
power abstraction which gave to our highwayman
that philosophic character which we
have heretofore remarked as distinguishing him
beyond his fellow herd when meditating his
greatest exploits he appeared the most indifferent
when surrounded by danger he seemed the
most insensible yet it was not so he was never
as he himself expressed it caught napping
he was ever ready to start to arms yet lolled
upon the cannons breech whatever his existence
might be he made the most it he understood
the savoir vivre to perfection behold
him now how negligently his hat is set on one
side his head yon bondstreet lounger could
not have more the look fatuity yet turpin
take our words for it was neither si fat nor a
lockwood 
bondstreet lounger his eyes are half closed 
but a quick glance beams beneath the eyelids
his leg equipped in that peculiarlyfashioned
boot which in his day obtained for it the name
 the turpin top and which was quite the
rage amongst the sporting characters the
period is thrown indolently and caressingly
over the neck his favourite mare yet an
instant will bring his foot to the stirrup 
he looks the picture repose reader are you
disposed to capture a highwayman now is
your moment his eyes absolutely close he
nods i feel assured he is asleep approach him
softly there now rush upon him you have
received a cursed kick from that black mare
and a voice thunders in your ear
dick turpin never sleeps
never for at this moment he resumes his song 
says i all my money ive managed to pop
where no man will find it beneath my boottop
says the lawyer dick turpin my cash neer will find
for its sewed in the folds my coatcape behind 
so i care not for turpin that mischievous blade
 
another whiff the short pipe 
i rode till i came to the powder mill
where the smell my pops made him soon stand still
my mare wants anew saddlecloth said i 
permit me the cape your coat to try
for i am dick turpin that mischievous blade
and thus for the present we leave him o

fascinate agni speranza voi chi estate
dante
cyprian de mulvertoxj fifth poor the
monastery st francis a prelate singular
sanctity being afflicted in his latter days with
a despondency so deep that neither penance nor
fasting could remove it vowed never again to
behold with earthly eyes the blessed light
 heaven nor to dwell longer with his fellowmen
 but relinquishing his spiritual dignity
the world forgetting by the world forgot to
immure himself while living within the tomb
he kept his vow out the living rock
that sustained the saintly structure beneath the
chapel the monastery was another chapel
wrought and thither after bidding a solemn
farewell to the world and bestowing his benediction
upon his flock whom he committed to
lockwood
the care his successor did the holy man
retire
never save at midnight and then only during
the performance masses for his souls repose
did he ascend from his cell and as the sole
light allowed within the dismal dungeon his
choice was that a dim sepulchral lamp as
none spake with him when in his silent retreat
save in muttered syllables what effect must the
flash lustre emanating from a thousand tapers
the warm and pungent odours the incensebreathing
shrine contrasted with the chilly
vapours his prisonhouse and the solemn
swell the sanctus have had upon his excited
senses surely they must have seemed like a
foretaste the heaven he sought to gain 
ascetic to the severest point to which natures
endurance could be stretched he even denied
himself repose he sought not sleep and knew
it only when it stole on him unawares his
couch was the flinty rock and long afterwards
when the zealous resorted to the sainted priors
cell and were shown those sharp and jagged
 
stones they marvelled how one like unto themselves
could rest or even recline upon their
points without anguish until it was explained to
them that doubtless he who temperate the wind
to the shorn lamb had made that flinty couch
soft to the holy sufferer as a bed down his
limbs were clothed in a garb horsehair the
coarsest fabric his drink the dank drops that
oozed from the porous walls his cell and his
sustenance such morsels as were bestowed upon
him by the poor the only strangers suffered to
approach him no fire was suffered where perpetual
winter reigned none were admitted to
his nightly vigils none witnessed any act 
penance nor were any groans heard to issue
from that dreary cave but the knotted bloodstained
thong discovered near his couch too
plainly betrayed in what manner those long lone
nights were spent thus did a year roll on
traces his sufferings were visible in his
failing strength he could scarcely crawl but
he meekly declined assistance he appeared
not as had been his wont at the midnight
 rook wood
mass but the door his cell was thrown open
at that hour the light streamed down like a
glory upon his reverend head he heard the
distant reverberations the deep miserere 
and breathed odours as if wafted from paradise
one morn it chanced that they who sought
his cell found him with his head upon his
bosom kneeling before the benign image the
virgin patroness his shrine fearing to disturb
his devotions they stood reverently looking
on and thus silently did they tarry for an hour 
but as in that space he had shown no signs 
motion fearing the worst they ventured to approach
him he was cold as the marble before
which he knelt in the act humblest intercession
 it may be in the hope grace had his
spirit fled
blessed are they who die in the lord exclaimed
his brethren regarding his remains with
deepest awe on being touched the body fell
to the ground it was little more than a
skeleton
under the cloisters the holy pile were his
 s
bones interred with a degree pomp and ostentation
which but little accorded with the lowliness
and selfabasement this man many sorrows
this chapel at the time which we treat
was pretty much in the same condition as it
existed in the days its holy inmate hewn
out the entrails the rock the roof the
vaults the floor were solid granite three
huge cylindrical pillars carved out the native
rock rough as the stems gnarled oaktrees
lent support to the ceiling support however
was unneeded an earthquake would scarce
have shaken down those solid rafters only
in one corner where the water welled through
a crevice the rock in drops that fell like
tears was decay manifest here the stone
worn by the constant dripping had in some
places given way in shape the vault was circular
the interval between each massive pillar
formed a pointed arch again from each pillar
sprang other arches which crossed by diagonal
give branches weaving one into the other and
radiating from the centre formed those beauties


fully intricate combinations upon which the eye
 the enthusiast loves to linger within the
ring formed by these triple columns in which
again the pillars had their own web arches
was placed an altar stone and beside it a
great crucifix the same rude material here
also stood the sainted image her who had filled
the prior with holy aspirations now a shapeless
stone the dim lamp that like a star
struggling with the thick gloom the wintry
cell had shed its slender radiance over the brow
 the virgin thecla was gone but around
the key stone the central arches whence a
chain had once depended might be traced in
ancient characters half effaced by time

one outlet only was there from the chapel 
that which led by winding steps to the monastery
 one only recess the priors cell the
former faced the altar the latter yawned like
the mouth a tomb at its back altogether it
was a dreary place dumb were its walls as
lockwood 
when they refused to return murmured orisons
 the anchorite one uniform sad colouring
prevailed throughout the grey granite was
grown hoar with age and had a ghostly
look but the columns were ponderous
and projected heavy shadows sorrow and
superstition had their tale and a moral
gloom deepened the darkness the spot
despair which had inspired its construction
seemed to brood therein hope shunned its
inexorable recesses
alone within the dismal sanctuary with hands
outstretched towards the desecrated image its
tutelar saint knelt sybil all was darkness
neither the heavy vapours that surrounded her
nor the shrine before which she bent were
visible but familiar with the dreary spot
she knew that she had placed herself aright
her touch had satisfied her that she bowed
before the altar stone that her benighted
vision was turned towards the broken image 
the saint though now involved in gloom the
most profound

gipsy as she was infidel as she might be
supposed sybil possessed notwithstanding a
zeal and fervour in her faith that might have
found favour in the eyes the most orthodox
professor catholicism and if her fiery
spanish blood flowing too swiftly in her veins
sometimes impelled her to actions inconsistent
it might be with the principles that faith
the blame them rested not so much with her
want proper religious bias as with her sanguine
and uncontrollable temperament any
aberrations this sort were succeeded by fits
 severe repentance and upon those occasions
would she resort alone to st cyprians cell
pouring forth at its altar her penitential prayers
her sins indeed were light and venial and she
speedily left the shrine with a heart lightened
 its load the most grievous offence she
had committed was her betrothment to luke
offence we say because her mother with her
dying lips had interdicted it and yet she
had dared to act in opposition to the last injunctions
 her parent at this very altar was
rook wood 
she plighted to him much as she loved him she
shuddered as her hand was clasped in his she
faltered as she pronounced the binding oath 
an illomen she deemed it then that she thought
 her dying mother whose figure seemed to arise
between her and her lover but those thoughts
were speedily banished often afterwards at
that altar had she implored her mothers forgiveness
and she trusted that she had obtained
it now she saw the vanity that hope the
realization that dark foreboding as she
knelt before the altar the voice prayer was
stifled
in her agony she cried out and the sullen
walls returned her wail with a response hollow
as the mockery a fiend sorrow for uncommitted
sin availed nothing with conceptions
hideous as those which pressed upon her soul 
with premeditated guilt clogging her heart and
choking her utterance she could not pray and
she resigned herself consciencestricken and selfabased
remorse shrieked in her ears away
despair with scorpion lash impelled her
onwards she could neither advance nor retreat
vol iii f
 
then in that dark hour did a phantasm
such as is said to haunt the couches the
dying and to predict immediate dissolution
appear before her and who shall say in what
enchanting colours the retrospect may not then
array itself contrasted as it must be with the
near approach death and the utter darkness
in which he cometh enveloped clear and distinct
as the reality did the events her past
existence retrace themselves before sybils mental
vision and without losing the sense her
present misery she endured the agonizing
consciousness past happiness fled for ever
her eyes filled with tears she could see no
longer her very brain was blinded no
more visions past blissfulness turning her
present woe to more intense wretchedness distracted
her all was blank despair but even
despair has its limits and beyond them yawned
the wide gulph madness sybils senses reeled
she laughed in her agony she tottered towards
the brink this terrible precipice she was
upon the very verge actual insanity when by
almost superhuman effort she saved herself
 
 mother mercy cried she whither was
i going what crouching fiend was that about
to seize me avhat pit was that which opened
beneath me to engulph me in its depth forever
 but i am rescued a saving arm hath
been stretched out towards me a ray comfort
shines out from above i can pray now my
hardness heart hath passed away i can weep
as heretofore and my heart will feel refreshed
and with clasped hands and streaming eyes
in low and mournful tones she addressed herself
in the following hymn to the tutelar saint
 the spot 
hymn to st thecla
in my trouble in my anguish
in the depths my despair
as in grief and pain i languish
unto thee i raise my prayer
sainted virgin martyr d maiden
let thy countenance incline
upon one with woes oerladen
kneeling lowly at thy shrine 
that in agony in terror
in her blind perplexity
wandering weak in doubt and error
calleth feebly upon thee
 lockwood
sinful thoughts sweet saint oppress me
thoughts that will not be dismissed 
temptations dark possess me
which my strength may not resist
i am full pain and weary
 my life i fain would die 
unto me the world is dreary 
to the grave for rest i fly
for rest oh could i borrow
thy bright wings celestial dove
they should waft me from my sorrow
where peace dwells in bowers above
upon one with woes oerladen
kneeling lowly at thy shrine 
sainted virgin martyrd maiden 
let thy countenance incline
mei miserere virgo
requiem eternal dona 
by thy loveliness thy purity
unpolluted undefiled
that in serene security
upon earths temptations smiled 
by the fetters that constrained thee
by thy flameattested faith 
by the fervour that sustained thee
by thine angelushered death 
by thy souls divine elation
mid thine agonies assuring
 thy sanctified translation
to beatitude enduring 
by the mystic interfusion
 thy spirit with the rays
that in everbright profusion
round the throne eternal blaze 
aookwooi 
by thy portion now partaken
with the painperfected just 
look on one hope forsaken
from the gates mercy thrust 
upon one with woes oerladen
kneeling lowly at thy shrine
sainted virgin martyr d maiden
let thy countenance incline

sancta virgo oro te 
kyrie ellison 
the sweet sad voice the singer died faintly
away the sharpness her sorrow was assuaged
seldom indeed is it that fervent
supplication fails to call down solace to the
afflicted sybil became more composed she
still however trembled at the thoughts what
remained for her to do
they will be here ere my prayer be
finished murmured she ere the be accomplished
for which i came hither alone let
me oh let me make my peace with my creator
ere i surrender my being to his hands and then
let them deal with me as they will and she
bowed her head in lowly prayer
again raising her hands and casting her eyes
 
upwards towards the black ceiling she implored
in song the intercession the saintly man who
had bequeathed his name to the cell
hymn to st cyprian
hear oh hear me sufferer holy
who didst make thine habitation
mid these rocks devoting wholly
life to one long expiation
 thy guiltiness and solely
by severe mortification
didst deliver thee oh hear me
in my dying moments cheer me
by thy penance selfdenial 
aid me in the hour trial
may through thee my prayers prevailing
on the majesty heaven
oer the hosts hell assailing
my soul in this dark hour be driven 
so my spirit when exhaling
may sinfulness be shriven 
and his gift unto the giver
may be rendered pure as ever
by thy own dark dread possession
aid me with thine intercession
scarcely had she concluded this hymn when
whispered accents and stealthy footsteps caught
her ear she arose at once challenging the
intruders in a firm tone
 
 who approaches asked she
a friend replied the voice handassah
you are not alone returned sybil
tis i replied the peculiarlyconceited
tones jerry juniper your friend madam
if you will allow me to call myself such
i have ventured into this dungeonlooking place
at handassahs special request and now i am
here i beg to say that if i can be the
slightest use you have only to command me
infernally dark to be sure what the devil 
added he stumbling forwards a stone pillar
eh sdeath ive nearly cracked my head against
it give me your hand handassah you know
the way about this cursed place and jerry
groaned dismally from the effects the concussion

it serves you right said the relentless
handassah i hope it will do you good
jerry answered not but would in all probability
had the darkness permitted have given
her a look such as byron says he bestowed
when a similar benison was passed upon his
 rook wood
broken tooth do me good jerry mentally
e j aculatecl may the devil fly away with you
if thats all the sympathy my broken pate is
likely to meet with my own opinion is that
the sex was only created to be a perpetual
plague to the better species the sooner i
clear myself my present incumbrance the
better
follow me said handassah
whither demanded jerry sulkily i
cant possibly tell where to follow unless you
lead the way
i am just before you returned she step
on boldly
jerry obeyed he marched angrily forwards 
but while essaying to grasp the hand his
mistress which he fondly imagined was stretched
out to guide him upon his way his shins encountered
the sharp edges what appeared to
be a huge box laid upon the floor and his
equilibrium being thus destroyed he was pitched
forward his head coming once more into contact
with a hard stone pillar
 
smothered laughter from handassah explained
to jerry if he wanted explanation the trick
which his treacherous mistress had played him
how troublesome cried she in a tone 
mock commiseration in people to leave their
lumber here im afraid your shins must
have suffered severely jerry your head
too i fear has not altogether escaped luckily
its none the softest but im sincerely sorry
i assure you for your accident besides a blow
on the shins is so painful
accident echoed jerry springing to his
feet do you call that an accident vm lamed
i fear for life and thats the greatest misfortune
that could happen to a man my figure and
dexterity accident to the devil with you
whimpering hussy its an accident with a
spice design in it its odds but ill be even
with you before long for my own part
i cant tell what this big lumbering chest is
doing here at all except it be to occasion
accidents let me feel whether its open here
take care your own shins my darling
f
 
saying which he pushed the chest angrily
in the direction where he thought handassah
stood jerry missed his mark but the box
being struck forcibly against the stone altar
upset its contents upon the floor
what have you done asked handassah
in alarm what does that box contain 
how the devil should i know replied
jerry you who placed it there ought to
be acquainted with its contents
 placed it there retorted handassah i
never saw it in the course my life and
what can you be thinking about to suppose i
could carry such a box as that but do feel
what it contains im sure i heard a groan
not i returned juniper no more
tricks upon travellers if you please hark i
hear their voices in the court they come
they come echoed sybil aroused from
her abstraction is the hour then arrived 
see the torchlight gleams down the staircase
cried handassah they are here
 not a moment is to be lost exclaimed sybil
 
addressing juniper here is a jewel be it
thy portion vith handassah wed her and
oh be happy
jerry hemmed slightly but he took the
jewel
you hear the conditions p said handassah
i do replied he
what am i to do for you asked he 
sybil command me as you think proper
my life is at your disposal
sybil whispered in his ear
it shall be done replied he i will not
fail you
remain within yon cell until the appointed
moment said sybil give me your hand i
will guide you thither
jerry extended his hand
scarcely was he concealed when the torch 
the knight malta in part dissipated the
gloom that hung around the chapel

slowly did the train descend solemnly and
in silence as if the rites at which they were
about to assist had been those funereal
and not nuptial solemnization indeed to
look upon those wild and fierce faces by the
ruddilyflashing torchlight which lent to each
a stern and savage expression to look at
those scowling visages surrounding a bride
from whose pallid cheeks every vestige 
colour and almost animation had fled 
and a bridegroom with countenance yet
more haggard and demeanour yet more
distracted the beholder must have imagined
that the spectacle was some horrible cererosewood

menial practised by daemons rather tian
human beings the arched vault the pillars
the torchlight and the wild figures formed a
picture worthy callot or salvator
is sybil within the chapel asked barbara
i am here returned a deep voice from the
altar it was so uttered that barbara scarcely
recognized in its tones those her grandchild
why do we tarry said the gipsy queen
we are all assembled to the altar
to the altar shrieked eleanor oh 
no noremember
my threat and obey muttered
barbara thou art in my power now
a convulsive sob was all the answer eleanor
could make
our number is not complete said the
priest who had looked in vain for the sexton 
peter bradley is not with us
ha exclaimed barbara let him besought
for instantly
their search need not extend beyond this
spot said peter stepping forward
 rook wood
the knight malta advanced towards the
altar the torchlight reddened upon the huge
stone pillars it fell upon the shrine and upon
the ghastly countenance sybil who stood
beside suddenly as the light approached her
an object hitherto hidden from view was revealed
sybil uttered a prolonged and fearful shriek the
knight recoiled likewise in horror and a simultaneous
cry astonishment burst from the lips
 the foremost the group all crowded
forwards and universal consternation prevailed
amongst the assemblage each one gazed at his
neighbour anxious to learn the occasion this
tumult and vague fears were communicated to
those behind from the terrified glances which
were the only answers returned by their comrades
in front
who has dared to bring that body heres
demanded barbara in a tone in which anger
struggled with apprehension pointing at the
same time to the ghastly corse a female
with streaming hair at the altars feet who
has dared to do this i say my curse light on
lockwood ill
him whosoever he be quick remove it i say
what do you stare at craven is this the
first time you have looked upon a corse that
you shrink aghast that you tremble before it 
it is a clod ay less than a clod away with
it away i say 
touch it not cried luke lifting a cloud
 black hair from off the features it is my
mother
my daughter exclaimed the sexton
what vociferated barbara is that thy
daughter is that lady rosewood are the
dead arisen to do honour to these nuptials
speak thou canst perchance explain how she
came hither
i know not returned peter glancing
fiercely at barbara i may anon demand
that question thee how came this body
here
ask richard checkley said barbara
turning to the priest he can perchance
inform thee priest added she in a low voice
this is thy handiwork
 
checkley replied not
will none remove the body ejaculated
barbara once more i ask you do you fear
the dead
a murmur arose balthazar alone ventured
to approach the corse
luke started to his feet as he advanced his
eyes glaring with tiger fury
back old man cried he and dare not
any you lay a sacrilegious finger on her corse
or i will stretch him that advanced as lowly
as lies my mothers head when or how it
came hither matters not here at the altar
hath it been placed and none shall move it
hence the dead shall witness my nuptials
fate hath ordained it my fate oer which the
dead preside her ring shall link me to my
bride i knew not when i snatched it from
her deathcold finger to what i preserved
it i learn it now it is here and he held
forth a ring
tis a fatal boon that twiceused ring
cried sybil such a ring my mother on her
 
deathbed said should be mine own such a
ring she said should wed me 
unto whom fiercely demanded luke
 unto death she solemnly rejoined
lukes countenance fell he turned aside
deeply abashed unable further to brook her gaze 
while in accents such wildly touching pathos
as sank into the hearts each who heard her 
hearts few them framed lightly penetrable
stuff the despairing maiden burst into the
following strain 
the twiceused ring
beware thy bridal day
on her deathbed sighed my mother
beware beware i say
death shall wed thee and no other
cold the hand shall grasp thee
cold the arms shall clasp thee
colder lips thy kiss shall smother 
beware thy bridal kiss
thy wedding ring shall be
from a claycold finger taken 
from one that like to thee
was by her love forsaken
 lockwood
for a twiceused ring
is a fatal thing 
her griefs who wore it are partaken
beware that fatal ring
the altar and the grave
many steps are not asunder
bright banners oer thee wave
shrouded horror lieth under
blithe may sound the bell
vet twill toll thy knell 
scathed thy chaplet by the thunder 
beware that blighted wreath
beware my bridal day 
dying lips my doom have spoken 
deep tones call me away 
from the grave is sent a token
cold cold fingers bring
that ill omen d ring
soon will a second heart be broken 
this is my bridal day
there was a deep profound silence as the
last melancholy cadence the song died away
and many a rugged heart was melted even to
tears what a vacancy is left in the bosom
when sweet sounds which have held it in
their thrall fade and are heard no more 
for a moment all was hushed all eyes were
directed towards sybil during her song there
lockwood 
had been something in her rapt looks which
communicated to them that pathetic and sublime
expression often conferred by the painter upon
the features the sainted cecilia more 
pain perhaps might dwell in the countenance 
sybil than would be proper to the lineaments 
the divine lyrist but there was combined even
with the anguish an ecstatic elevation soul
which lent to her dark dilated eyes turned
heavenwards and fraught with unutterable
passion no inapt resemblance the virgin
martyr about to immolate herself at the shrine
 pure and holy affection eleanor remained
in a state passive stupefaction vacantly
gazing at sybil upon whom alone her eyes
were fixed and appearing but indistinctly to
apprehend the meaning her song
this is my bridal days murmured she in a
low tone when sybil had finished said not
that sweet voice so i know tis my bridal day
i am to wed him yet he was buried yesternight
i know it i saw him in his coffin cold and dead
my love my ranulph and would you wed me
 rookwooir
to him there well as you like better a dead
bridegroom than none at all better ah better
than wed me to another what a chapel you
have chosen mother a tomb a sepulchre 
but tis meet for such nuptials as mine and
what wedding guests was that pale woman
in her shroudlike dress invited here by you 
tell me that mother
my god her senses are gone cried
mrs mowbray why did i venture into
this horrible place 
ask not why now madam rejoined the
priest the hour for consideration is past 
we must act let the marriage proceed at
all hazards we will then take means to extricate
ourselves from this accursed place
spoken aright father said the sexton who
was near them the time for action is arrived
proceed with the marriage you shall depart
in safety that i pledge myself
remove that horrible object said mrs
mowbray it fascinates the vision my
child
 
 lend me thine hand father said peter
staring fixedly at the priest
no no replied the priest shuddering
i will not cannot touch it do thou alone
remove it
peter approached luke the latter now
offered no further opposition and the body was
taken away the eyes eleanor followed it
into the dark recesses the vault and when
she could no longer distinguish the white flutter
 the serecloths her labouring bosom seemed
torn asunder with the profound sigh that burst
from it and her head declined upon her
shoulder
give me to see that ring said the priest
addressing luke who still held the wedding
ring between his fingers
i am not naturally superstitious said
mrs mowbray whether my mind be affected
with the horrors this place i know not 
but i have dread that ring she shall not
wear it
where no other can be found said the priest
with a significant and peculiar look at sirs
 lockwood
mowbray i see no reason why this should be
objected to i should not have suspected you
madam such weakness but grant there were
evil spell or charm attached to it which trust
me there is not as how should there be to a
harmless piece gold my benediction and
aspersion with holy lymph hath sufficient power
to exorcise and expel it to remove your fears
it shall be done at once
a cup containing water was brought him
together with a plate salt which condiment
the devil is said to abhor and which is held to
be a symbol immortality and eternity in
that being itself incorruptible it preserves all
else from corruption and with the customary
formula prayer and exorcism the priest thrice
mingled the crystal particles with the pure
fluid after which taking the ring in his hand
with much solemnity he besprinkled it with a
few drops the water which he had blessed 
made the sign the cross upon the golden
circlet uttered another and more potent exorcism
to eradicate and expel every device 
satan and delivered it back to luke
 
she may wear it now in safety said the
sexton with strong contempt were the snake
himself coiled round that consecrated bauble
thy prayers would unclasp his lithest folds
but wherefore do we tarry now naught lies
between us and the altar the path is clear
the bridegroom grows impatiently
and the bride asked barbara
is ready replied the priest madam
delay not longer daughter your hand
eleanor gave her hand it was clammy and
cold supported by her mother she moved
slowly towards the altar which was but a few
steps from where they stood she offered no
resistance but did not raise her head luke
was by her side then for the first time did the
enormity the barbarous dishonourable act he
was about to commit strike him with its full
force he saw it in its darkest colours it was
one those terrible moments when the headlong
wheel passion stands suddenly still
there is yet time groaned he oh let
me not damn myself perpetually let me save
her save sybil save myself
 
they were at the altar that wild wedding
train high over head the torch was raised
the red light flashed on bridegroom and on
bride giving to the pale features each an
almost livid look it fell upon the gaunt
aspect the sexton and lit up the smile 
triumphant malice that played upon his face 
it fell upon the fantastical habiliments 
barbara and upon the haughty but perturbed
physiognomy mrs mowbray it fell upon
the salient points the gothic arches upon
one moulded pillar upon the marble image 
the virgin thecla and on the scarcely less
marble countenance sybil who stood behind
the altar silent statuelike immovable the
effect light and shade on other parts 
the scene upon the wild drapery and harsh
lineaments many the group was also
eminently striking
just as the priest was about to commence the
marriage service a yelling chorus which the
gipsies were accustomed to sing at the celebration
 the nuptials one their own tribe
 
confidential tone you are aware that my
errand to tol is accomplished i have smashed
lawyer coatess screen pocketed the hammock
here tis continued he parenthetically slapping
his pockets and done tother trick in prime
twig for tom king with a cool thousand
in hand i might if i chose rest awhile on my
oars but a quiet life dont suit me i must be
moving so i shall start to yorkshire tonight

indeed said the soidisant count in a
languid tone so soon 
i have nothing to detain me replied dick
and to tell you the truth i want to see how
matters stand with sir luke rosewood i
should be sorry if he went to the wall for want
 any assistance i can render him
true returned the count one would
regret such an occurrence certainly but i fear
your assistance may arrive a little too late he
is pretty well done up i should imagine by this
time
that remains to be seen said turpin
 lockwood
his case is a bad one to be sure d d bad 
but i trust not utterly hopeless with all his
impetuosity and pride i like the fellow and
will help lii if i can it will be a difficult
game to set him on his legs but i think it maybe
done that underground marriage was
sheer madness and turned out as ill as such a
scheme might have been expected to do poor
sybil if i could pipe an eye for any thing it
should be for her i wouldnt have her death
at my door for a trifle but thats neither here
nor there it was her own act and no one is
answerable for it in any court below stairs
whatever they may be at that above i dont
know how it is jerry im not much given to
thinking those things but that girls looks
have been running in my noddle ever since i
saw her by torchlight at the altar just before her
death i never saw any thing that moved me so
much i cant get her out my head give
me a pinch snuff such thoughts unman one
as to the priest thats a totally different affair
if he strangled his daughter old alan did
 
right to take the law into his own hands and
squeeze his throttle for him id have done the
same thing myself and being a proscribed
jesuit returned as i understand without the
kings licence for so doing why father checkleys
murder if it mus be so called i cant abide
hard terms wont lie very heavy at alans door
that however has nothing to do with sir luke
he was neither accessory nor principal still he
will be in danger at least from lady rosewoods
machinations the whole county york
i make no doubt is up in arms by this time
then why venture thither said the count
somewhat ironically for my part ive a strange
fancy for keeping out harms way as long as
possible
every man to his taste returned turpin 
i like a row my craft sails latest when the
breeze is brisk for then there is always most to
be picked up i love to confront danger runaway
 pshaw always meet your foe half way
true replied the count half way i but
 
you go the whole distance what prudent man 
would beard the lion in his den 
i never was a prudent mans rejoined dick
smiling i have no superfluous caution about
me come what will i shall try to find out this
luke rosewood and offer him my purse such
as it is and it is now better lined than usual 
a hand free to act as he lists and a head which
imprudent though it be can often think better
for others than for its own master
vastly fine exclaimed the count with an
illdisguised sneer but i hope you dont forget
that the marriage certificate which you hold is
perfectly valueless now the estates you are
aware 
are no longer sir lukes i see what you
are driving at counts returned dick coldly 
but he will need it to establish his claim to the
title and he shall have it while he was sir
luke with ayear i drove a hard bargain
and would have stood out for the last
stiver i demanded but now that he is one 
 
us a simple chevalier industria he shall
have it and welcome
perhaps lady rook wood or mrs mowbray
might be inclined to treat maliciously insinuated
the count the title may be worth
something to ranulph
it is worth more to luke and if it were
not he gets it are you satisfied 
perfectly replied the count with affected
honhommie and i will now let you into a
secret respecting miss mowbray from which
you may gather something for your guidance in
this matter and if the word woman be at all
to be trusted though individually i cannot
say that i have much faith in it sir lakes
planetary hour is not yet completely overcast
thats exactly what i wish to know my
dear fellow said turpin eagerly you have
already told me that you were witness to a
singular interview between miss mowbray and
sir luke after my departure from the priory
if i mistook you not the whole business will
hinge upon that what occurred let me
l 

have every particular the whole history and
mystery
you shall with pleasure said the count 
and i hope it may tend to your benefit 
as i have just observed the fabric rests on a
sandy foundation but before i begin i must
clear my whistle for its a long tale heres to
their speedy union ha ha though an old
catch that ive heard says 
no mate ever brook would
a rook the rosewood
i wonder how it will turn out in sir lukes
case
pol pol cried dick impatiently the
interviewthe interview
well said the count you shall have it
without nitre delay after i had quitted the
scene action at the priory and at your desire
left the rosewood party masters the field i
fled with the rest the crew towards the
rocks there we held council war for a
short time some were for returning to the
 
fight but this was negatived entirely and in
the it was agreed that those who had wives
daughters and sisters should join them as
speedily as possible at their retreat in the
grange but as i happened to have none 
these attractive ties and had only a troublesome
mistress who i thought could take care 
herself i did not care to follow them but
struck deeper into the wood and made my
way guided by destiny i suppose towards the
cave
the cave cried dick rubbing his hands 
i delight in a cave tom king and i once
had a cave our own at epping and ill have
another one these fine days a cave is as
proper to a high tobyman as a castle to a
baron but go on
the cave i speak continued the count
was seldom used except upon great emergencies
by any the stop hole abbey crew it
was a sort retiring den our old lioness
barbara and like all belonging to her respected
by her dupes however the cave is a good cave
 lockwood
for all that is well concealed by brushwood
and comfortably lighted from a crevice in the
rock above it lies near the brink the stream
amongst the woods just above the waterfall and
is somewhat difficult approach 
i know something the situation said
turpin
well returned the count not to lose
time into this den i crept and expecting
to find it vacant you may imagine my surprise
on discovering that it was already occupied and
that sir luke rosewood his granddad miss
mowbray and worst all the very person i
wished most to avoid my old flame handassah
constituted the partys
a disagreeable rencontre truly said
turpin
fortunately they did not perceive my
entrance continued jerry and i took
especial care not to introduce myself retreat
however was for the moment impracticable and
i was compelled to be a listener i cannot te
what had passed between the parties before my
jiookwood 
arrival but i heard miss mowbray implore sir
luke to conduct her to her mother he seemed
half inclined to comply with her piteous
entreaties but old alan shook his head it
was then handassah put in a word the minx
was ever ready at that fear not said she
that she will wed sir ranulph deliver her
to her friends i beseech you sir luke and woo
her honourably she will accept you sir
luke stared incredulously and grim old alan
smiled she has sworn to be your s continued
handassah sworn it by every hope heaven
and the oath has been sealed by blood by
sybils blood speaks she true asked sir
luke trembling with agitation miss mowbray
answered not you will not deny it
lady said handassah i heard that oath
proposed i heard it uttered i saw it registered
you cannot you will not dare not deny it
i do not replied miss mowbray with much
anguish manner if he claim me i am his
and he will claim thee said alan 
triumphantly he has thy oath no matter
 lockwood
how extorted thou must fulfil thy vow i
am prepared to do so said eleanor but if
you would not utterly destroy me let this maid
conduct me to my mother to my friends
to ranulph asked sir luke bitterly no
no returned miss mowbray in accents 
deepest despair to my mother i wish not to
behold him again be it so cried sir luke 
but remember in love or hate thou art mine 
i shall claim the fulfilment thy oath farewell
handassah will lead thee to thy mother
miss mowbray bowed her head but returned no
answer while followed by old alan sir luke
departed from the cavern
whither went they demanded turpin 
that i know not replied jerry i was
about to follow when i was prevented
how asked dick by the abrupt
entrance another party scarcely i think
could the two rookwoods have made good their
retreat when shouts were heard without and
young ranulph and major mowbray forced
their way sword in hand into the cave here
 
was a situation for me mean to the young
lady i make no doubt it was pleasant enough
but my neck was in jeopardy however you
know that i am not deficient in strength and
upon the present occasion i made the best use
 the agility with which boon nature has
endowed me amidst the joyous confusion 
the sobbing and embracing and congratulations
that ensued i contrived like a wild cat to
climb the rocky sides the cave and concealed
myself behind a jutting fragment stone it
was well i did so for scarcely was i hidden
when in came old barbara followed by mrs
mowbray and a dozen others
barbara ejaculated dick was she a
prisoner 
a prisoner repeated jerry smiling significantly
 no the old hell cat is too deep for that
she had nosed upon sir luke and hoped they
would grab him and his granddad but the
birds were flown
i m glad she was baulked said dick
was any search made after them 
 rook wood
cant say replied jerry i could only
indistinctly catch the sounds their voices
from my lofty hiding place before they left
the cavern i made out that mrs mowbray
resolved to go to rosewood and to take her
daughter thither a proceeding to which the
latter strongly objected
to said dick musingly
will she keep her oath i wonder p
thats more than i can say said jerry
dipping his punch tis a deceitful sex
a deceitful sex indeed echoed dick
tossing off a tumbler for one sybil we meet
with twenty manassas eh count
twenty a hundred to one replied
jerry tis a vile sex

i should live and die like yonder glorious orb it was a
boyish thought

king aroused from his toothpick reverie by these
aspersions the best part creation peace
i say none shall dare to abuse that dear
devoted sex in the hearing her champion
without pricking a lance with me in her behalf
what do you either you who abuse woman
in that wholesale style know her nothing 
less than nothing and yet you venture upon
your paltry experience to lift up your voices
and decry the sex now i do know her and
upon my own experience i avouch that as a
 rookavood
sex woman compared with man is as an angel
to a devil as a sex woman is faithful 
loving selfsacrificing we tis that make her
otherwise zve selfish exacting neglectful men 
we teach her indifference and then blame her
apt scholarship we spoil our own hand and
then blame the cards no abuse women in
my hearing give me a glass grog dick 
the sex three times three and heres a song
for you into the bargain saying which ina
mellow plaintive tone tom gave the following
 
pledge or the highwayman
come fill up a bumper to eves fairest daughters
who have lavished their smiles on the brave and the free 
toast the sweethearts dudley hind wilmot and waters
whateer their attractions whateer their degree

who stood by the gallows with sorrow oerladen
bemoaning the fate the gallant du vals

while that one other kiss has bought off a repeater 
and a bead as a favour the favourite string

our toast boys embraces each woman merit
and for fear omission well toast the whole sex 
have spoken at some length in our first volume but they who
desire to hear more him will do well if they are not already
acquainted with it to turn to a delightful essay on the subject
 thieves ancient and modern in mr leigh hunts indicator
in which there is a sparkling sketch the gallant claude
our only regret is that mr hunt did not expatiate more
upon the highwaymen but we trust he will repair this error
in the london journal and give us a brilliant page or two
on the denizens the empire high toby apropos the
london journal let us even in a hasty note wish mr hunt all
the success in his new undertaking which he so richly merits 
and counsel all our readers who love the cordial the kindly
the amiable the poetical the fanciful and the reasonable in
every sense at once to become subscribers to this pleasantness
 pleasant hebdomadabs he who can turn even stones
to gems must possess a subtle alchemy
 
well replied dick replenishing kings
rummer while he laughed heartily at his ditty
i shant refuse your toast though my heart
dont respond to your sentiments ah tom 
the sex you praise so much may i fear prove
your undoing do as you please but curse me
if ever i pin my life to a petticoat id as
soon think neglecting the four cautions
the four cautions said king what are
they
did you never hear them replied dick
attend then and be edified
the four cautions
pay attention to these cautions four
and through life you will need little more
should you dole out your days to three score 
beware a pistol before
before before
beware a pistol before
and when backwards his ears are inclined
and his tail with his ham is combined
caution two you will bear in your mind 
beware a prancer behind

beware a prancer behind
kooxwood 
thirdly when in the park you may ride
on your best bit blood sir astride
chatting gay to your old friends young bride
beware a coach at the side

 beware a coach at the side
lastly whether in puqle or grey
canter ranter grave solemn or gay
whateer he may do or may say
beware a priest every way
every way every way
beware a priest every way
 methinks exclaimed jerry i have
heard something like that before but there
was a trifling variation in the reading the first
stanza
very possibly returned dick my
version is intended for the family library
well said tom king all you can sing
or say dont alter my good opinion the women
not a secret have i from the girl my heart
this is no anachronism though it would appear to be one
turpin alluded to the records the rigging fraternity all
wbo live upon the cross being included amongst themselves in
the affectionate designation the family

she could have sold me over and over again if
she had chosen but my sweet sue is not the
wench to do that
it is not too late said dick your
allah may yet hand you over to the
philistines
then i shall die in a good cause said
king but
the tyburn tree
has no terrors for me
let better men swing im at liberty
i shall never come to the scragging post unless
you turn osman dick turpin my nativity
has been cast and the stars have declared that
i am to die by the hand my best friend and
thats youeh dick 
it sounds like it replied turpin but i
advise you not to become too intimate with jack
ketch he may prove your best friend after all
why faith thats true replied king
hangman
rook wood 
laughing and if i must ride backwards up
holbom hill fu do the thing in style and
honest jack shall never want his regulars a
man should always die game we none us
know how soon our turn may come but come
when it will shall never flinch from it and
now to change the subject you are off i
understand to yorkshire tonight dick pon
my soul you are a wonderful fellow an alibi
personified here and there and every where atone
and the same time no wonder you are called
the flying highwayman today in town tomorrow
at york the day after at chester the
devil only knows where you will pitch your
quarters a week hence neither beak nor trap
can have a chance guessing there are
rumours you in all counties at the same
moment this man swears you robbed him at
hounslow that on salisbury plain while
another swears you monopolize cheshire and
yorkshire and that it isnt safe even to
hunt without pops in your pocket i heard
 
some devilish good stories you at dosyndars
tether day the fellow who told them to me
little thought that i was a brother blade
you flatter me said dick smiling complacently
 but its no merit mine black
bess alone enables me to do it and hers be the
credit talking being every where at the
same time you shall hear what she once did forme
in cheshire meantime a glass to the best
mare in england you wont refuse that toast
tom ah if your mistress was only as true to
you as my nag to me you might set at nought
the tightest hempen cravat that was ever twisted
and defy your best friend to hurt you black
bess and god bless her and now for the
song saying which with much emotion he
chaunted the following rhymes
black bess
let the lover his mistresss beauty rehearse
and laud her attractions in languishing verse 
be it mine in rude strains but with truth to express
the love that i bear to my bonny black bess
rook wood 
from the west was her dam from the east was her sire
from the one came her swiftness the other her fire 
no peer the realm better blood can possess
than flows in the veins my bonny black bess
look look i how that eyeball glows bright as a brand 
that neck proudly arches those nostrils expand 
mark that tideflowing mane which each silky tress
might adorn prouder beauties though none like black bess
mark that skin sleek as velvet and dusky as night
with its jet disfigured by one lock white 
that throat branched with veins prompt to charge or caress
now is she not beautiful bonny black bess 
over highway and byway in rough and smooth weather
some thousands miles have we journey together 
our couch the same straw and our meal the same mess
no couple more constant than i and black bess
by moonlight in darkness by night or by day
her headlong career there is nothing can stay
she cares not for distance she knows not distress 
can you show me a courser to match with black bess 
egad i should think not exclaimed
king you are as sentimental on the subject
 your mare as i am when i think my
darling susan but i beg pardon for my
interruption pray proceed
let me first clear my throat returned
dick and now to resume 
vol iii m
 
once it happened in cheshire near dunham i popped
on a horseman alone whom i speedily stopped 
that lightened his pockets youll readily guess 
quick work makes dick turpin when mounted on bess
now it seems the man knew me dick turpin said he
you shall swing for this job as you live dye see
i laughed at his threats and his vows redress
i was sure an alibi then with black bess
the road was a hollow a sunken ravine
overshadowed completely by wood like a screen 
i clambered the bank and i needs must confess
that one touch the spur grazed the side black bess
brake brook meadow and ploughd field bess fleetly
bestrode
as the crow wings her flight we selected our road
we arrived at hough green in five minutes or less
my neck it was saved by the speed black bess
the exact spot where turpin committed this wellknown
robbery and which has often been pointed out to us lies in
what is now a woody hollow though once the old road from
nottingham to knutsford skirting the rich and sylvan domains
 dunham and descending tlie hill which brings you to the
bridge crossing the river bollin with some little difficulty
we penetrated this ravine it is just the locality for such an
adventure a small brook wells through it and the steep banks
are overhung with every description timber and were the
other day a perfect nest primroses and wild flowers hough
pronounced hoo green lies we believe at about three miles
distance across the country the way turpin rode the old
bowling green is one the pleasantness inns in cheshire
 
stepping carelessly forward i lounge on the green
taking excellent care that by all i am seen
some remarks on times flight to the squires i address
but i say not a word the flight black bess
i mention the hour it was just about four 
play a rubber at bowls think the danger is oer
when athwart my next game like a checkmate at chess
comes the horseman in search the rider bess
what matter details os with triumph i came
he swears to the hour and the squires swear the same
i had robbed him at four while at four they profess
i was quietly bowling all thanks to black bess
then one halloo boys one loud cheering halloo 
to the swiftest coursers the gallant the true 
for the sportsman unborn shall the memory bless
 the horse the highwayman bonny black bess 
loud acclamations rewarded dicks performance
awakened from his doze zoroaster
beat time to the melody the only thing jerry
said he was capable heating in his present
shattered condition after some little persuasion
the magus was prevailed upon to
enliven the company with a strain which he
trolled forth after a maudlin manner it was as
follows 
s 
the double cross
though all us have heard o crost fights
and certain gains by certain lost fights 
i rather fancies that its news
how in a mill both men should loses
for vere the odds are thus made even
it plays the dickens with the steven 
besides against all rule theyre sinning
a ere neither has no chance winning
ri tollol c
two milling coves each vide awake
vere backed to fight for heavy stake 
but in the meantime so it vos
both kids agreed to play a cross 
bold came each buffer f to the scratch
to make it look a tights match 
they peeled x in style and bets vere making
twas six to four but few were taking
ri tollol c
quite cautiously the mill began
for neither knew the others plan 
each cull completely in the dark
 wot might be his neighbours mark 
resolved his jibbing not to mind
nor yet to pay him back in kind 
so on each other kept they tout 
and sparred a bit and dodged about
ri tollol c
money f man j stripped fellow
ii a particular kind pugilistic punishment
 kept each an eye upon the other
lockwood 
with males raised tom bent his back
as if to plant a heavy thwack
vile jem with neat lefthanded stopper
straight threatened tommy with a topper
tis all my eye no claret flows
no facers sound no smashing blows 
five minutes pass yet not a hit
how can it palls wait a bit
ri tollol c
each cove vos teazed with double duty
to please his backers yet play booty f 
even luckily for jem a teller
vos planted right upon his smeller 
down dropped he stunned even time was called
seconds in vain the seconds bawled 
the mill is oer the crosser crost
the losers von the winner lost
ri tollol c 
the party assumed once more a lively air
and the glass was circulated so freely that at
last a final charge drained the ample bowl 
its contents
the best friends must part said dick
and willingly would i order another whiff 
punch but that i think we have all had enough
to satisfy us as you milling coves have it
tory your one eye has got a drop in it already
hands f deceive them
 
old fellow and to speak the truth i must begetting
into the saddle without more delay for
i have a long ride before me and now friend
jerry before i start suppose you tip us one 
your merry staves we havent heard your pipe
today and never a cross cove us all be he
high or low toby cracksman spicegloak or

magus

said jerry modestly taking a pinch snuff i
am sure i shall be most happy my chaunts are
all a sort you must make all due allowances

i have mine may each us meet with the

egad i hope not said king im afraid
in that case the chances would be against us
avell then the success we anticipate if you
like it better rejoined dick i have only to
observe one thing more namely that i must
insist upon standing squire upon the present
occasion not a word i wont hear a syllable
 
landlord i say what ho i continued dick
stepping out the arbour here my old
admiral the white whats the reckoning 
whats to pay i say 
let ye know directly sir said mine host
 the falstaff
order my horse the black mare added
dick
and mine said king the sorrel colt
ril ride with you a mile or two on the road dick
perhaps we may stumble upon something
very likely
we meet at twelve at dosyndars jerry
said king if nothing happens
agreed said jerry
what say you to a rubber at bowls in the
meantime said the magus taking his pipe
from his lips
jerry nodded acquiescence and while they
went in search the implements the game
turpinand king sauntered gently on the green
it was a delicious evening the sun was
slowly declining and glowed like a ball fire
lockwood 
amid the thick foliage a neighbouring elm
whether like the robber moor tom king
was touched by this glorious sunset we pretend
not to determine but certain it was that a shade
 inexpressible melancholy passed across his
handsome countenance as he gazed in the
direction harrowonthehill which lying to
the west the green upon which they walked
stood out with its pointed spire and lofty college
against the ruddy sky he spoke not but
dick noticed the passing emotion
what ails you tom said he with much
kindness manner are you not well lad 
yes i am well enough said king i
know not what came over me but looking at
harrow i thought my school days and what
i was then and that bright prospect reminded
me my boyish hopes
tut tut said dick this is idle you
are a man now
i know i am replied tom but i have
been a boy had i any faith in presentiments
s 
i should say this is the last sunset i shall
ever see
here comes our host said dick smiling
ive no presentiment that that is the last bill
i shall ever pay
the bill was brought and settled as turpin
paid it the mans conduct altogether was singular
and awakened turpins suspicions
are pur horses ready asked dick quickly
they are sir said the landlord
let us begone whispered dick to king
 i dont like this fellows manner i thought
i heard a carriage draw up at the inn door just
now there may be danger be fly added he
to jerry and the magus now sir said he
to the landlord lead the way keep on the
alert tom dicks hint was not lost upon the
two bowlers they watched their comrades 
and listened intently for any manifestation 
alain
chapter iii
was this well done jenny 
captain macbeth
while turpin and king are walking across
the bowlinggreen we shall see what has been
passing outside the inn toms presentiments
 danger were not it appeared without foundation
scarcely had the ostler brought forti
our two highwaymens steeds when a post
chaise escorted by two or three horsemen drove
furiously up to the door the sole occupant 
the carriage was a lady whose slight and pretty
figure was all that could be distinguished 
her her face being closely veiled the landlord
who was busied in casting up turpins account
rushed forth at the summons a word or two
passed between him and the horsemen upon
 
which the formers countenance fell he
posted in the direction the garden and the
horsemen instantly dismounted
we have him now sure enough said one
 them a very small man who looked in his
boots like buckle equipped for the oaks
by the powers i begin to think so replied
the other horseman but dont spile all
mr coates by being too precipitate
never fear that titus said coates for it
was the gallant attorney hes sure to come
for his mare thats a trap certain to catch
him eh mr paterson with the chief constable
 westminster to back us the devils
in it if we are not a match for him
and for tom king too replied the chief
constable since his womans peached the
games up with him too weve long had an
eye upon him and now well have a finger
hes one your dashing trouts that we always
give a long line to but well land him this
time anyhow if youll look after dick turpin
penmen ill make sure tom
hookwood 
vd rather you would have helped us mr
paterson said coates never mind tom king
another time will do for him
no such thing said paterson one weighs
just as much for that matter as tother ill
take tom to myself and surely you two with
the landlord and ostler can manage turpin
amongst you
i dont know that said coates doubtfully
hes a devil a fellow to deal with
take him quietly said paterson draw
the chaise out the way lad take our tits to
one side and place their nags near the door
ostler shall you be able to see him maam
where you are asked the chief constable
walking to the carriage and touching his hat
to the lady within and having received a satisfactory
nod from the bonnet and veil returned
to his companions and now penmen added
he lets step aside a little dont use your
firearms too soon
as if conscious what was passing around her
and the danger that awaited her master
black bess exhibited so much impatience and
 
plunged so violently that it was with difficulty
the ostler could hold her the devils in
the mare said he whats the matter with
her she was quiet enough a few minutes since
so ho lass stand
turpin and king meanwhile walked quickly
through the house preceded by the host who
conducted them not without some inward fear
and trembling towards the door arrived there
each man rushed swiftly to his horse dick
was in the saddle in an instant and stamping her
foot upon the ostlers leg black bess compelled
the man yelling with pain to quit his hold the
bridle tom king was not equally fortunate
before he could mount his horse a loud shout
was raised which startled the animal and caused
him to swerve so that tom lost his footing in the
stirrup and fell to the ground he was instantly
seized by paterson and a struggle commenced
king endeavouring but in vain to draw a
pistol
flip him dick fire or im taken cried
shoot him
iiookwood 
king fire damn you why dont you fire 
shouted he in desperation still struggling vehemently
with paterson who was a strong man
and more than a match for such a light weight
as king
i cant cried dick i shall hit you if i
fire
take your chance shouted king is
this your friendship 
thus urged turpin fired the ball ripped
up the sleeve patersons coat but did not
wound him
again cried king d n your blood
dick why dont you hear me fire again
pressed as he was by foes on every side
himself their mark for both coates and
tyrconnel had fired upon him and were now
mounting their steeds to give chase it was impossible
that turpin could take sure aim add to
which in the struggle paterson and king were
each moment changing their relative positions he
however would no longer hesitate but again at
his friends request fired the ball lodged itself
 
in kings breast he fell at once at this instant
a shriek was heard from the chaise the window
was thrown open and her thick veil being drawn
aside the features a very pretty female now
impressed with terror and contrition were suddenly
exhibited
king fixed his glazing eyes upon her
susan sighed he is it you that i behold 
yes eyes tis she sure enough said paterson
 you see maam what you and such like
have brought him to however youll lose
your reward for hes going fast enough
reward gasped king reward did she
betray me 
ay ay sir said paterson she blowed
the gaff if its any consolation to you to know it
consolation repeated the dying man 
perfidious oh the prophecy my best friend 
turpin i die by his hand and vainly
striving to raise himself he fell backwards and
expired alas poor tom 
mr paterson mr paterson cried coates
leave the landlord to look after the body that
rook wood 
dying ruffian and mount with us in pursuit 
the living rascal come sir quick mount 
dispatch you see he is yonder he seems to
hesitate we shall have him now
well penmen im ready said paterson
but how the devil came you to let him
escape you 
st patrick only knows said titus hes
as slippery as an eel and like a cat turn him
which way you will he is always sure to alight
upon his legs i shouldnt wonder but we lose
him now after all though he has such a small
start that mare flies like the wind
he shall have a tight run for it at all
events said paterson putting spurs into his
horse ive a good nag under me and you are
neither you badly mounted he is only three
hundred yards before us and the devils in it if
we cant run him down its a three hundred
pound job mr coates and well worth a race
you shall have another hundred from me
sir if you take him said coates urging his
steed forward


thank you sir thank you follow my
directions and well make sure him said the
constable gently gently not so fast up
the hill you see hes breathing his horse all in
good time mr coates all in good time sire
and maintaining an equal distance both
parties cantered leisurely up what we believe is
now called the windmill hill we shall now
return to turpin
aghast at the deed he had accidentally committed
dick remained for a few moments
irresolute he perceived that king was mortally
wounded and that all attempts at rescue would
be fruitless he perceived likewise that jerry
and the magus had effected their escape from
the bowling green as he could detect their
figures stealing along the hedgeside he hesitated
no longer sauve qui pent was the order
 the day he turned his horse and galloped
slowly off little heeding the pursuit with which
he was threatened
every bullet has its billet said dick 
but little did i think that i really should
 
turn poor toms executioner to the devil
with this rascally snapper cried he throwing
the pistol over the hedge i could never have
used it again tis strange too that he should
have foretold his oavn fate devilish strange
and then that he should have been betrayed by
the very bio wen he trusted thats a lesson if i
wanted any but trust a woman not i the
length my little finger
arrived at the brow the hill whence
such a beautiful view the country surrounding
the metropolis is obtained turpin
turned for an instant to reconnoitre his
pursuers coates and titus he utterly disregarded
 but paterson was a more formidable foe
and he well knew that he had to deal with a
man experience and resolution it was then
for the first time that the thoughts executing
his extraordinary ride to york first flashed
across him this bosom throbbed high with rapture
and he involuntarily exclaimed aloud ashe
raised himself in the saddle by
i will do it
 
he took one last look at the great babel that
lay buried in a world trees beneath him and
as his quick eye ranged over the magnificent
prospect lit up by that gorgeous sunset he
could not help thinking tom kings last
words poor fellow thought dick he
said truly he should never see another sunset 
aroused by the approaching clatter his
pursuers but little behind him dick struck
into a lane which lies on the right the road
now called shootuphill lane and set off at a
good pace in the direction hampstead
now cried paterson put your tits to it
my boys we must not lose sight him for a
second in these lanes
and accordingly as turpin was by no means
desirous inconveniencing his mare in this
early stage the business and as the ground
was still upon an ascent the parties still
preserved their relative distances
at length after various twisting and turnings
in that deep and devious lane after scaring one
or two farmers and riding over a brood or
 
two ducks dipping into the verdant valley
 west and ascending another hill turpin
burst upon the gorsy sandy and beautiful
heath hampstead still shaping his course
to the left dick made for the lower part 
the heath and skirted a path which leads
towards northend passing the furzecrowned
summit which is at present crested by a clump
 lofty pines
it was here that the chase first assumed a
character interest being open ground the
pursued and pursuers were in full view each
other and as dick rode swiftly across the heath
with the shouting trio hard at his heels the
scene had a very animated appearance he
crossed the hill the tendon road passed
crackskuu common and dashed along the
crossroad to highgate
hitherto no advantage had been gained by
the pursuers they had not lost ground but
still they had not gained an inch and much
spurring was required to maintain their position
but as they approached highgate dick slacked
lockwood
ened his pace and the other party redoubled
their efforts to avoid the town dick struck
into a narrow path at the right and rode
easily down the hill
his pursuers were now within a hundred
yards and shouted to him to stand pointing
to a gate which seemed to bar their farther progress
dick unhesitatingly charged it clearing
it in beautiful style not so with coatess
party and the time they lost in unfastening
the gate which none them liked to leap
enabled dick sto put additional space betwixt
them it did not however appear to be his
intention altogether to outstrip his pursuers 
the chase seemed to give him excitement
which he was willing to prolong as much
as was consistent with his safety scudding
rapidly past highgate like a swiftsailing
schooner with three lumbering indiamen in
her wake dick now took the lead along a
narrow lane that threads the fields in the
direction hornsey the shouts his folio w
hers had brought others to join them and as he
 g
neared crouch traversing the lane which
takes its name from du val and in which a
house frequented by him stands or stood ulmjtc
lockwood 
not i said the man sturdily unless i gets
my dues ive been done once already but
strike me stupid if im done a second time
dont you perceive thats a highwayman
dont you know that im chief constable 
westminster said paterson showing his staff
how dare you oppose me in the discharge 
my duty 
that may be or it may not be said the man
doggedly but you dont pass unless i gets the
blunt and thats the long and short ont
amidst a storm oaths coates flung down
a crown piece and the gate was thrown open
turpin took advantage this delay to
breathe his mare and striking into a bye lane
at buckets green cantered easily along in the
direction tottenham little repose was
however allowed him yelling like a pack 
hounds in full cry his pursuers were again at
his heels he had now to run the gauntlet 
the long straggling town tottenham and
various were the devices the populace to
entrap him the whole place was up in arms
 kdokwoodi
shouting screaming running dancing and
hurling every possible description missile at
the horse and her rider dick merrily responded
to their clamour as he flew past and laughed
at the brick bats that were showered thick as
hail and quite as harmlessly around him
a few more miles hard riding tired the
volunteers and before the chase reached edmonton
most them were no where here
however fresh relays were gathered and a strong
field again mustered john gilpin himself could
not have excited more astonishment amongst
the good folks edmonton than did our
highwayman as he galloped through their
town unlike the men tottenham the mob
received him with acclamations thinking no
doubt that like the citizen famous london
town he rode for a wager presently however
borne on the wings the blast came the
cries turpin dick turpin and the
hurrahs were changed to hooting but such
was the pate at which our highwayman rode
that na serious opposition could be offered to
jctjf the stream and speedily regained
the road i shall do it yet shouted dick
that stream has saved her hark away lass 
hark away 
bess heard the cheering cry and she answered
to the call she roused all her energies she
strained every sinew she put forth all her
remaining strength once more on wings 
swiftness she bore him away from his pursuers
and major mowbray who had now scrambled
on the shore and made certain securing him
beheld him spring like a wounded hare from
beneath his very hand it cannot hold out
said the major it is but an expiring flash 
that horse must soon drop
she be regularly booked thats certain said
the postboy we shall find her on the road
 
contrary to all expectation however bess
held on and set pursuit at defiance her pace
was swift as when she started but it was unconscious
and mechanical action it wanted the
ease the lightness the life her former riding
she seemed screwed up to a task which she must
execute there was no flogging no goryheel
 but the heart was throbbing tugging at
the sides within and her spirit spurred her
onwards her eye was glazing her chest
heaving lier flank quivering her crest again
fallen yet she held on she is dying by
god said dick i feel it r no she
held on
belford is past the towers and pinnacles
 york burst upon him in all the freshness
the beauty and the glory a bright clear
autumnal morn the ancient city seemed to
smile a welcome a greeting the noble
minster and its serene and massive pinnacles
crocketed lanternlike and beautiful st
marys lofty spire all hallows tower
the massive mouldering walls the adjacent
postern the grim castle and cliffords weighs

pouring keep all beamed upon him like a
brighteyed face that laughs out openly it
is done it is won cried dick hurrahhurrah
and the sunny air was cleft with his
shouts
bess was not insensible to her masters exultation
she neighed feebly and reeled forwards
it was a piteous sight to see her to mark
her staring protruding eyeballs her shaking
flanks but while life and limb held together
holds she on another mile is past york
is near
hurrah shouted dick but his voice was
hushed
bess tottered fell there was a dreadful
gasp a parting moan a snort her eye gazed
for an instant upon her master with a dying
glare then grew glassy rayless fixed a shiver
ran through her frame her heart had burst
dicks eyes were blinded as with rain his
triumph though achieved was forgotten his
present safety unthought he stood weeping
and swearing like one beside himself
and art thou gone bess cried he in a
crttulsluvvvk
 
despairing voice lifting up his coursers head
and kissing her lips covered with bloodflecked
foam gone gone and i have killed the
best steed that was ever crossed 
at that moment the deep bell the
minster clock tolled out the hour six
i am answered said dick it was to hear
those strokes
turpin was roused from the state stupefaction
into which he had fallen by a smart slap on
the shoulder recalled to himself by the blow
he started at once to his feet while his hands
sought his pistols but he was spared the necessity
 using them by discovering in the intruder
the bearded visage the gipsy balthazar
the patrico was habited in mendicant weeds
and sustained a large wallet upon his shoulders
so its all over with the best mare in england
i see said balthazar but i can guess
how it has happened you are pursued
i am said dick roughly
your pursuers are at hand 
within a few hundred yards
then why stay here fly while you can 
 
never never cried turpin ill fight it
out here by besss side poor lass ive killed
her but she has done it ha ha we have won
what and his utterance was again choked
hark i hear the tramp horse and
shouts cried the patrico take this wallet 
you will find a change dress within it dart
into that thick copse save yourself
but bess i cannot leave her exclaimed
dick with an agonizing look at his horse
and what died bess for but to save you 
rejoined the patrico
 true true said dick but take care 
her dont let those dogs hell meddle 
 away cried the patrico leave her to me
possessing himself the wallet dick disappeared
in the adjoining copse
he had not been gone many seconds when
major mowbray rode up
who is this exclaimed the major
flinging himself from his horse and seizing
the patrico this is not turpin
certainly not replied balthazar coolly i
am not exactly the figure for a highwayman
 sphere
is he what has become him 
asked coates in despair as he and paterson
joined the major
escaped i fear replied the major have
you seen any one fellow p added he addressing
the patrico
i have seen no one replied balthazar i
am but this instant arrived this dead horse
lying in the road attracted my attention
ha exclaimed paterson leaping from
his steed this may be turpin after all he
has as many disguises as the devil himself and
may have carried that goats hair in his pocket
saying which he seized the patrico by the beard
and shook it with as little reverence as the gaul
handled the chin the roman senator
the devil hands ois roared balthazar
by salmon but i shant stand such usage
do you think a beard like mine is the growth
 a few minutes hands off i say
regularly done said paterson removing
his hold the patricos chin and looking as
blank as a cartridge
 lockwood
ay exclaimed coates all owing to this
worthless piece carrion if it were not that i
hope to see him dangling from those walls
pointing towards the castle i should wish her
master were by her side now to the dogs with
her c and he was about to spurn the breathless
carcase poor bess when a sudden blow dealt
by the patricos staff felled him to the ground
ill teach you to molest me said balthazar
about to attack paterson
come come said the discomfited chief
constable no more this its plain were
in the wrong box every bone in my body
aches sufficiently without the aid your cudgel
old fellow come mr coates take my arm
and lets be moving weve had an infernal
long ride for nothing
not so replied coates ive paid pretty
dearly for it however let us see if we can
get any breakfast at the bowlinggreen yonder 
though ive already had my morning draught
added the facetious man law looking at his
dripping apparel
lockwood s
to the bowlinggreen the party proceeded
leaving the patrico in undisturbed possession 
the lifeless body black bess major mowbray
ordered a substantial repast to be prepared
with all possible expedition
a countryman in a smock was busily engaged
at his mornings meal
to see that fellow bolt down his breakfast
one would think he had fasted for a
month said coates see the wholesome
effects an honest industrious life paterson
i envy him his appetite i should fall to with
more zest were dick turpin in his place
the countryman looked up he was an oddlooking
fellow with a terrible squint and a
strange contorted countenance
an ugly dog exclaimed paterson
 what a devil a twist he has got 
whats that you says about dick turpin 
asked the countryman with his mouth halffull
 bread
have you seen aught him asked
coates
 
 not i mumbled the rustic but i hears
aw the folk hereabouts talk on him they say
he sets all the lawyers and constables at defiance
and laughs in his sleeve at their efforts to catch
him ha ha he gets over more ground ina
day than they do in a week ho ho
thats all over now said coates peevishly
he has cut his own throat ridden his famous
mare to death
the countryman almost choked himself 
the attempt to bolt a huge mouthful ay 
indeed how happened that asked he so
soon as he recovered speech
the fool rode her from london to york
last night returned coates such a feat was
never performed before what horse could be
expected to live through such work as that 
ah he were a fool to attempt that
observed the countryman but you followed
belike
we did
 and took him after all asked the rustic
squinting more horribly than ever
 
no returned coates i cant say we
did but well have him yet im pretty sure
he cant be far off we may be nearer him
than we imagine
may be so sir returned the countryman
 but might i be so bold as to ask how
many horses you used i the chase some half
dozen perhaps 
half dozen grow led paterson we had
twenty at the least
and i one mentally ejaculated turpin
for he was the countryman

hind are all our horses and our arms in safety 
fur bo they feed like plutos palfreys under ground 
our pistols swords and other furniture
are safely locked up at our rendezvous
prince prigs revels
the hut on thorne waste to which we have
before incidentally alluded and whither we are
now about to repair was a low lone hovel situate
on the banks the deep and oozy don at the
eastern extremity that extensive moor
ostensibly its owner fulfilled the duties ferryman
to that part the river but as the road
which skirted his tenement was but little frequented
his craft was for the most part allowed
to sleep undisturbed in her moorings
 
in reality however he was the inland agent
 a horde smugglers who infested the neighbouring
coast his cabin was their rendezvous
and not unfrequently it was said the depository
 their contraband goods conkey jem so
was he called by his associates on account 
the slawkenbergian promontory which decorated
his countenance had been an old hand at the
same trade but having returned from a seven
years leave absence from his own country
procured by his lawless life now managed matters
with more circumspection and prudence and
had never since been detected in his former illicit
traffic nor though so marvellously gifted in
that particular himself was he ever known to nose
upon any his accomplices or in other words
to betray them on the contrary his hut was
a sort asylum for all fugitives from justice 
and although the sanctity his walls would
in all probability have been but little regarded
had any one been detected within them yet
strange to say even if a robber had been
tracked as it often chanced to jems imme
 
date neighbourhood all traces him were
sure to be lost at the ferrymans hut and further
search rendered useless
within the hut presented such an appearance
as might be expected from its owners pursuits
and its own unpromising exterior consisting
 little more than a couple rooms the rude
whitewashed mud walls exhibited in lieu 
prints more pretension a gallery choicelyillustrated
ballads celebrating the exploits 
various highwaymen renowned in song amongst
which our friend dick turpin figured conspicuously
upon his sable steed bess being
represented by a huge rampant black patch
and dick with a pistol considerably longer
than the arm that sustained it next to
this curious collection was a drum net a
fishing rod a landing net an eel spear and other
piscatorial apparatus with a couple sculls
and a boat hook indicative jems ferrymans
office suspended by various hooks the whole
blackened and begrimed by peat smoke there
being no legitimate means exit permitted to

the vapour which was generated by the turfcovered
hearthstone the only window indeed
in the hut was to the front the back apartment
which served jem for dormitory had no aperture
whatever for the admission light except
such as was afforded through the door communication
between the rooms a few broken
rushbottomed chairs with a couple dirty
tables formed the sum total the ferrymans
furniture
notwithstanding the grotesque effect his
exaggerated nasal organ jems aspect was at
once savage and repulsive his lank black hair
hung about his inflamed visage in wild elf locks
the animal predominating throughout his eyes
were small red and wolfish and glared suspiciously
from beneath his scarred and tufted
eyebrows while certain his teeth projected
like the tusks a boar from out his coarsetipped
sensual mouth dwarfish in stature and
deformed in person jem was built for strength 
and what with his width shoulder and shortness
 neck his figure looked as square and solid
lockwood
as a cube his throat and hirsute chest constantly
exposed to the weather had acquired a
glowing tan while his arms uncovered to the
shoulders and clothed with fur like a bears
hide down almost to the tips his fingers 
presented a knot folded muscles the concentrated
force which few would have
desired to encounter in action
it was now on the stroke midnight
and jem who had been lying extended
upon the floor his hovel suddenly aroused
by that warning impulse which never fails to
awaken one his calling at the exact
moment when they require to be upon the
alert now set about fanning into flame the
expiring fuel upon his hearth having succeeded
in igniting further portions turf jem
proceeded to examine the security his door
and window and satisfied that lock and bolt
were shot and that the shutter was carefully
closed he kindled a light at his fire and walked
towards his bedroom but it was not to retire
for the night that the ferryman entered his
dormitory beside his crazy couch stood a litter
 
 empty bottles and a beer cask crowding the
chamber the latter he rolled aside and pressing
his foot upon the plank beneath it the
board gave way and a trapdoor opening discovered
a ladder conducting apparently into
the bowels the earth jem leaned over the
abyss and called in hoarse accents to some one
below
an answer was immediately returned and a
light became soon afterwards visible at the foot
 the ladder two figures next ascended the
first who set foot within the ferrymans chamber
was alan rook wood the other as the reader
may perhaps conjecture was his grandson
is it the hour asked luke as he sprang
from out the trapdoor
ay replied jem with a coarse laugh 
or i had not disturbed myself to call you
but may be added he softening his manner a
little youll like some refreshment before you
start a stoup nantes will put you in cue for
the job ha ha 
not i replied luke who could ill tolerate
his companions familiarity
i
 
 give me to drink said alan walking
feebly towards the fire and extending
his skinny fingers before it i am chilled by
the damps that swampy cave the natural
heat within me is nigh extinguished
here is that shall put fresh marrow into
your old bones returned jem handing him
a tumbler brandy never stint it ill be
sworn you be the better ont for you look desperate
queer man about the mazzard
alan was in sooth a ghastly spectacle since
the reader last heard him he was fearfully
changed his countenance was almost exanimate
and when with shaking hand and trembling lips
he had drained the fiery potion to the dregs a
terrible grimace was excited upon his features
such as is produced upon the corpse by the
action the galvanic machine even jem regarded
him with a sort apprehension after
he had taken breath for a moment alan broke
out into a fit wild and immoderate laughter
why ay said he this is indeed to grow
young again and to feel fresh fire within ones
 
veins who would have thought so much life
and energy could reside in this little vessel i
am myself once more and not the same soulless
pulseless lump clay i was a moment
or two back the damps that den had
destroyed me and the solitude the waking
dreams ive had the visions horrible but i
will not think those i am better now ready
to execute my plans thy plans i should say
grandson luke are our horses in readiness 
why do we tarry the hour is arrived and
i would not that my newblown courage should
evaporate ere the great work for which i live
be accomplished that done i ask no further
stimulant let us away
we tarry but for turpin said luke i
am as impatient as yourself i fear some mischance
must have befallen him or he would
have been true to his appointment do you
not think so v added he addressing the
ferryman
why replied jem reluctantly since you
put it home to me and i cant conceal it no longer
 
ril tell you what i didnt tell afore for fear you
should be down in the mouth about it dick
turpin can do nothing for you hes grabbed t
turpin apprehended ejaculated luke
ay returned jem i learnt from a farmer
who crossed the ferry at nightfall that he were
crabbed this morning at york after having
ridden his famous cherrycoloured pray to
death thats what hurts me more nor all the
rest though i fear dick will scarce cheat the
gallows this go his times up i reckon
will you supply his place and accompany
us asked luke the ferryman
no no replied jem shaking his head 
 theres too much risk and too little profit in
the business for me it wont pay
and what might tempt you to undertake
the enterprise asked alan
 more than you have to offer master peter
replied jem who had not been enlightened upon
the subject alans real name or condition
how know you that demanded alan
name your demand 
 lockwood
well then ill not say but a hundred
pounds if you had it might bribe me 
 to part with your soul to the devil i doubt
not said luke fiercely stamping the ground
let us begone we need not his mercenary
aid we will do without him
stay said alan you shall have the
hundred provided you will assure us 
your services
cut no more blarneyfied whigs master
sexton replied jem in a gruff tone if
im to go i must have the chink down and
thats more nor either you can do im
thinking
give me thy purse whispered alan to
his grandson pshaw continued he dost
hesitate this man can do much for us think
upon eleanor and be prudent thou canst
not accomplish thy task unaided taking the
amount from the purse he gave it to the ferryman
adding if we succeed the sum shall
be doubled and now let us set out
during alans speech jems sharp eyes had
lockwood 
been fastened upon the purse while he mechanically
clutched the bank notes which were
given to him he could not remove his gaze
but continued staring at the treasure before
him as if he would willingly by force have
made it all his own
alan saw the error he had committed
in exposing the contents the purse
to the avaricious ferryman and was about to
restore it to luke when the bag was suddenly
snatched from his grasp and himself levelled by
a blow upon the floor conkey jem had found
the temptation irresistible knowing himself to
be a match for both his companions and
imagining himself secure from interruption he
conceived the idea making away with them
and possessing himself their wealth no
sooner had he disposed alan than he
assaulted luke who met his charge half way
with the vigour and alacrity the latter
the reader is already acquainted but he was
no match for the herculean strength the
doublejointed ferryman who with the ferocity
r
 
 the boar he so much resembled thus furiously
attacked him nevertheless as may be imagined
he was not disposed to yield up his life tamely
he saw at once the villains murderous intentions
and well aware his prodigious power
would not have risked a close struggle could he
have avoided it but it was inevitable snatching
the eel spear from the wall he had hurled it at
the head his adversary but without effect in
the next instant he was locked in a clasp terrible
as that a polar bear in spite all his struggles
luke was speedily hurled to the ground 
and jem who had thrown himself upon him
was apparently searching about for some weapon
to put a bloody termination to the conflict when
a horse was heard at the door three taps
repeated slowly one after the other and a call
from a whistle
damnation ejaculated jem gruffly
interrupted and he seemed irresolute
slightly altering his position on lukes body
the moment was fortunate for luke and in
all probability saved his life he extricated
 
himself from the ferrymans grasp regained his
feet and what was more importance the
weapon he had thrown away
villain cried he about to plunge the spear
with all his force into his enemys side you
shall 
the whistle was again heard without
dont you mark that cried jem tis
turpins call
turpin echoed luke dropping the point
 his weapon unbar the door thou
treacherous rascal and admit him
well say no more about it sir luke
said jem fawningly i knows i owes you my
life and i thank you for it take back the
wr he should not have shown it me it was
that as did all the mischief
unbar the door and parley not said
luke contemptuously
jem complied with pretended alacrity but
with real reluctance casting suspicious glances
 money
 
at luke as he withdrew the bolts the door
at length being opened haggard exhausted
and covered with dust dick turpin staggered
into the hut
well i am here said he with a hollow
laugh fve kept my word ha ha ive
been damnably put to it but here i am ha 
ha r and he sank upon one the stools
we heard you were apprehended said
luke i am glad to find the information
was false added he glancing angrily at the
ferryman
false echoed dick whoever told you
that told you a lie sir luke but what are you
scowling at old charon and you sir luke 
why do you glower at each other make
fast the door bolt it cerberus right now
give me a glass brandy and then ill talk a
bumper so another whats that i see a
dead man old peter alan i mean has anything
happened to him that he has taken his
measure there so quietly 
nothing i trust said luke stooping to
 
raise up his grandsire the blow has stunned
him
the blow repeated turpin what 
there has been a quarrel then i thought
as much from your agreeable looks at each
other come come we must have no differences
give the old earthworm a taste this
ill engage it will bring him too fast enough 
ay rub his temples with it if youd rather but
its a better remedy down the gullet the natural
course and hark ye jem search your crib
quickly and see if you have any grub within it
and any more huh in the cellar im as hungry
as a hunter and as thirsty as a camel
while the ferryman went in search such
provisions as his hovel afforded turpin lent
his assistance towards the revival alan 
and it was not long before his efforts
united with those luke were successful and
alan restored to consciousness he was greatly
surprised to find the highwayman had joined
them and expressed an earnest desire to quit
the hut as speedily as possible
that shall be done forthwith my dear
 rook wood
fellow said dick but if you had fasted as
long as i have done and gone through a few 
my fatigues into the bargain you would perceive
without difficulty the propriety supping before
you started in the mean time here comes
jem with a flitch bacon and a loaf egad
t can scarce wait for the toasting in my present
mood i could almost devour a grunter in
the sty whereupon he applied himself to
the loaf and to a bottle stout march ale
which jem placed upon the table quaffing
copious draughts the latter while the ferryman
employed himself in toasting certain rashers
 the flitch upon the hissing embers
luke meanwhile stalked impatiently about
the room he had laid aside his oriental spear
having first however placed a pistol within his
breast to be ready for instant service should
occasion demand it as he could now put little
reliance upon the ferrymans fidelity he
glanced with impatience at turpin who pursued
his meal with a steady voracity worthy 
a halffamished soldier but the highwayman
returned no answer to his looks except such as
 
was conveyed by the incessant clatter his
masticating jaws during the progress his
apparently interminable repast
ready for you in a second sir luke said
dick all right now capital ale charon 
strong as styx ha ha one other rasher and
ive done sorry to keep you cant conceive
how clever i put the winkers upon em at york
in the dress a countryman all owing to old
bait the patrico an old pall ha ha my
old palls never nose upon me eh jem always
help one out the water always staunch 
heres health to you old crony 
jem returned a sulky response as he placed
the last rasher on the table which was speedily
discussed
poor bess muttered dick as he quaffed
off the final glass ale poor wench we
buried her by the road side beneath the trees 
deep deep her remains shall never be disturbed
alas alas my bonny black bess 
but no matter her name is yet alive her
deeds will survive her the trial is over and
 
now continued he rising from his seat fm
with you where are the tits 
in the stable underground growled
jem
alan rosewood in the meantime had joined
his grandson and they conversed an instant or
two apart
my strength will not bear me through the
night said he that fellow has thoroughly
disabled me you must now go without me
to the hall here is the key the secret passage
you know the entrance i will await you in the
tomb
 the tomb echoed luke
ay our family vault returned alan with
a ghastly grin it is the only place 
security for me now but let me see her there
let me know that my vengeance is complete 
that i triumph in my death over him the accursed
brother through thee my grandson thou
hast a rival brother a successful one thou
knowest now what hatred is
i do returned luke fiercely
 
but not such hate as mine which through
a life a long life hath endured intense as when
twas first engendered in my bosom which from
one hath spread oer all my race oer all save
thee and which even now when death stares mein
the face when the spirit pants to fly from its
prisonhouse burns fierce as ever thou canst
not know what hate like that may be thou
must have wrongs such wrongs as mine first
my hate to ranulph is bitter as thine own
name him not shrieked alan but oh 
to think upon the bride he robbed me the
young the beautiful whom i loved to madness
whose memory is a barbed shaft yet rankling
keen as ever at my heart god justice how
is it that i have thus long survived but some
men die by inches my dying lips shall name
him once again and then twill be but to blend
his name with curses
i speak him no more said luke i
will meet you in the vault
 and if thou fairest 
 
i return not
remember tomorrow is her weddingday
with ranulph
thinkst thou i forget it
bear it constantly in mind tomorrows
dawn must see her thine or his thou hast her
oath to thee or to death she is affianced if
she should hesitate in her election do not thou
hesitate womans will is fickle her scruples 
conscience will be readily overcome she will
not heed her vows but let her not escape
thee cast off all thy weakness thou
art young and not as i am ageenfeebled
be firm and added he with a look terrible
meaning if all else should fail if thou art
surrounded if thou canst not bear her off use
this and he placed a short dagger in lukes
hands it hath avenged me ere now on a perjured
wife it will avenge thee a forsworn
mistress and remove all obstacle to rosewood
luke took the weapon wouldst thou
have me kill her demanded he
sooner than she should be his
rook wood 
ay aught sooner than that but i would
not murder both
both echoed alan i understand thee
not
sybil and eleanor replied luke for as
surely as i live will sybils death lie at my door
how so asked alan the poison was
selfministered
true replied luke with terrible emphasis
but i spoke daggers hearken to me
said he hollowly whispering in his grandsires
ear methinks i am not long for this world
i have seen her since her death 
 tut tut replied alan tis not for
thee to talk thus a truce to these womanish
fancies
womanish or not returned luke either
my fancy has deceived me or i beheld her
distinctly as i now behold thee within yon cave
while thou wert sleeping by my side
art sure that said alan slightly
shivering and regarding his grandson with a
look inquisitive horror was she alone 
 
no there was another with her
it is disordered fancy cried alan 
 thou shalt live live to inherit 
 live to see them fall crushed beneath
thy feet for myself if i but see thee master
 elinors hand or know that she no longer
lives to bless thy rival or to mar thy prospects
i care not how soon i brave my threatened
doom
 one or other thou shalt be resolved tonight
said luke placing the dagger within
his vest
at this moment a trampling a horse was
heard before the hovel and in another instant
a loud knocking resounded from the door the
ferryman instantly extinguished the light motioning
his companions to remain silent
what ho shouted a voice ferry
wanted
gad zooks exclaimed dick as i live
tis major mowbray
major mowbray echoed alan in amazement
 what doth he here 
lockwood 
hes on his way from york to rosewood i
conclude said dick if hes here ill engage
the others are not far off
scarcely were the words out dicks mouth
when further clatter was heard at the door and
the tones coates were heard in altissimo key
demanding admittance
let us retire into the next room whispered
turpin and then admit them by all means
jem and hark ye manage to detain em a few
seconds
ill do it said jem theres a bit a
hole you can peep through
another loud rattat was heard at the door
threatening to burst it off its hinges
well i be coming said jem seeing the
coast was clear in a drowsy yawning tone as if
just awakened from sleep youll cross the
river none the faster for making so much noise
saying which he unbarred the door and coates
and paterson who it appeared were proceeding
to rosewood with the major entered the hovel
 
major mowbray remained on horseback at the
door
can you find us a glass brandy to keep
out the fog said coates who knew something
 our ferrymans vocations i know you area
lad amazing spirited
may be i can master if i choose but
wont the other german walk in doors likewise 
no no said coates major mowbray
dont choose to dismount
well as you please said jem but it will
take me a minute or two to get the punt in order
for all them prads
the brandy in the first place said coates
whats here added the loquacious attorney
noticing the remnants turpins repast but
that were hurried i should like a little frizzled
bacon myself
jem opened the door his dormitory with
the greatest caution but apparent indifference
and almost instantly returned with the brandy
coates filled a glass for paterson and then
 
another for himself the ferryman left the
house apparently to prepare his boat half
closing the door after him
by my faith but this is the right thing
paterson said the attorney we may be
sure that the strength this was never tested
by a gangers proof take another thimblefull
weve twelve miles and a heavy pull to go
through ere we reach rosewood after all we
made but a poor nights work it paterson 
cursed stupid in us to let him escape i only
wish we had such another chance ah if we
had him within reach now how ve would
spring upon him secure him in an instant i
should glory in the encounter i tell you what
paterson if ever he is taken i shall make a
point attending his execution and see whether
he dies game ha ha you think hes sure to
swing paterson eh 
why yes replied the chief constable i
wish i was as certain my reward as that turpin
will eventually figure at the scragging post
your rewarded replied coates make
 
yourself easy on that score my boy you shall
have your dues depend upon it nay for the
matter that give you the money now if
you think properest
nothing like time present said paterson 
well make all square at once
well then said coates taking out a pocketbook
 you shall have the hundred i promised
 you wont get turpins reward the
three hundred pounds but that can be helped
you shall have mine always a man my
word paterson continued the attorney
counting out the money
so i perceive said the chief constable i
shall always be happy to serve you
and then theres that other affair said the
attorney mysteriously still occupied in doling
out his bank notes that luke bradleys case 
the fellow i mean who calls himself sir luke
rosewood ha ha a rank imposter two
fives that makes fifty you want another
fifty paterson but as i was saying we may
make a good job that we must ferret him
 
out i know who will come down properly
for that paterson and if we could only tuck
him up with his brother blade why it would
be worth double hes all along been a thorn
in my lady rosewoods side hes an artful
scoundrel
 leave him to me said paterson ill
have him in less than a week but whats your
charge against him 
felony burglary murder every description
 crime under the heavens said coates hes
a very devil incarnate dick turpin is as mild
as milk compared with him by the bye now i
think it this jem conkey jem as folks call
him may know something about bradley hes
a keen file ill sound him thirty forty fifty
theres the exact amount so much for dick
turpin
dick turpin thanks you for it in person
said dick suddenly snatching the whole sum
from patersons hands and felling the chief
constable with a blow one his pistols
r wish i was as sure escaping the gallows
vol iii s
 rook wood
as i am certain that paterson has got his reward
you stare sir you are once more in the hands
 the philistines see who is at your elbow
coates who was terrified almost out his
senses at the sight turpin scarcely ventured
to turn his head but when he did so he was
perfectly horror stricken at the threateningaspect
 luke who held a cutlass in his hand
which he had picked up in the ferrymans bedroom

so you would condemn me for crimes which
i have never committed said luke i am
tempted i own to add the destruction your
worthless existence to their number
mercy for gods sake mercy cried coates
throwing himself at lukes feet i meant not
what i said
hence reptile said luke pushing him
aside i leave thee to be dealt upon by
others
at this juncture the door the hut was flung
open and in rushed major mowbray sword in
hand followed by conkev jem
lockwood 
there he stands sir cried the latter 
upon him
what conkey jem turned snitch upon
his palls cried dick i scarce believe my
own ears
make yourself scarce dick scowled jem 
the jiggers open and the boat loose leave
luke to his fate hes sold
never vile traitor shouted dick tis
thou art sold not he and almost ere the words
were spoken a ball was lodged in the brain 
the treacherous ferryman
major mowbray meanwhile had rushed
furiously upon luke who met his assault with
determined calmness the strife was sharp
and threatened a speedy and fatal issue on the
majors side it was a desperate attack cut and
thrust which luke had some difficulty in parrying
but as yet no wounds were inflicted
soldier as was the major luke was not a whit
door
 
inferior to him in his knowledge the science
 defence and in the exercise the broadsword
he was perhaps the more skilful the
two upon the present occasion his coolness
stood him in admirable stead seeing him
hard pressed turpin would have come to his
assistance but luke shouted to him to stand
aside and all that dick could do amid the
terrific clash steel was to kick the tables out
 the way the combatants lukes arm was
now slightly grazed by a pass made by the
major which he had parried the smart 
the wound roused his ire he attacked the
major in his turn with so much vigour and
good will that driven backwards by the irresistible
assault major mowbray stumbled over
the ferrymans body which happened to lie in
his way and his sword being struck out his
grasp his life became at once at his adversarys
disposal
luke sheathed his sword major mowbray
said he sternly your life is in my
 
power i spare it for the blood that is between
us for your sisters sake i would not raise my
hand against her brother
i disclaim your kindred with me villain 
wrathfully exclaimed the major i hold you
no otherwise than as a wretched imposter who
has set up claims you cannot justify and as
to my sister if you but dare to couple lier
name and the major made an ineffectual
attempt to raise himself and to regain his sword
which turpin however removed
dare echoed luke scornfully hereafter
you may learn to fear my threats and acknowledge
the extent my daring and in that confidence i
give you life listen to me sir i am now bound
for rook wood i have private access to the
house to your sisters chamber her chamber
marked you that i shall go anne attended
this night she shall be mine from you from
ranulph from lady rosewood from all will i
bear her off she shall be mine and you before
the dawn my brother or and luke paused
 
what further villainy remains untold
inquired the major fiercely
you shall bewail her memorys replied luke
gloomily
i embrace the latter alternative with raptures
replied the major god grant her
firmness to resist thee but i tremble for her 
and the stern soldier groaned aloud in his
agony
here is a cord to bind him said turpin 
he must remain a prisoner heres
right said alan rosewood unless 
bit enough blood has been shed already
ay marry has it said dick and i had
rather not have given conkey jem a taste 
blue plumb had there been any other mode 
silencing the snatching scoundrel which there was
not but as to the major hes a gallant enemy
and shall have fair play as long as dick turpin
stands by come sir added he to the
major as he bound him hand and foot with the
rope ill do it as gently as i can but you
 
had better submit with a good grace theres no
help for it and now for my friend paterson
who was so anxious to furnish me with a hempen
cravat before my neck was in order he shall have
an extra twist the rope himself to teach him
the inconvenience a tight neckcloth when he
recovers saying which he bound paterson in
such manner that any attempt at liberation on the
chief constables part would infallibly strangle
him as to you mr coates said he addressing
the trembling man law you shall to 
with us you may yet be useful and ill
accommodate you with a seat behind my own
saddle a distinction i never yet conferred upon
any your tribe recollect the countryman
at the bowlinggreen at york ha ha come
along sir and having kicked out the turf
fire dick prepared to depart
it would be vain to describe the feelings
 rage and despair which agitated the majors
bosom as he saw the party quit the
hovel accompanied by coates aware as he was
 their destination after one or two desperate
 lockwood
but ineffectual attempts to liberate himself by
which he only increased the painful constriction
 his bond without in the slightest degree
ameliorating his condition he resigned himself
with bitterest forebodings to his fate there
was no one even to sympathize with his sufferings
 beside him lay the gory corpse the ferryman
and at a little distance the scarcely more
animate frame the chief constable and here
we must leave him to follow for a short space
the course luke and his companions
concerning themselves little about their own
steeds the party took those which first offered
and embarking man and horse in the boat soon
pushed across the waters the flatulent don
arrived at the opposite banks the river
they mounted and guided by luke after half
an hours sharp riding arrived at the skirts
 rook wood park entering this beautiful
sylvan domain they rode for sometime
silently among the trees till they
arrived at the knoll whence luke had beheld
the hall on the eventful night his dislockwood

cover his mothers wedding ring 
a few days only had passed over his head 
but during that brief space what storms
had swept over his bosom what ravages had
they not made he was then all ardour all
impetuosity all independence the future
presented a bright unclouded prospect wealth
honours and happiness apparently awaited him
it was still the same exquisite scene hushed
holy tranquil even solemn as upon that
glorious night the moon was out silvering
wood and water and shining on the white walls
 the tranquil mansion nature was calm serene
peaceful as ever beneath the trees he saw the
bounding deer upon the water the misty
wreaths vapour all all was dreamy delightful
soothing all save his heart there was the
convict there the change was it a troubled
dream with whose dark oppression he was
struggling or was it stern waking actual
life that moments review his wild career
was terrible he saw to what extremes his
s
s 
ungovernable passions had hurried him he
saw their inevitable consequences he saw also
his own fate but he rushed madly on
he swept round the park keeping under the
covert the wood till he arrived at the avenue
leading to the mansion the stems the aged
limes gleamed silvery white in the moonshine
luke drew in his rein beneath one the
largest the trees 
a branch has fallen said he as his grandsire
joined him
 ha exclaimed alan a branch from
that tree
it bodes ill to ranulph whispered luke
doth it not 
perchance muttered alan tis a vast
bough
we meet within an hour said luke
abruptly
at the tomb replied alan i will await
thee there
chapter ii
you have heard it rumoured for these many years
none our family dies but there is seen
the shape an old woman which is given
by tradition to us to have been murthered
by her nephews for her riches such a figure
one night as the prince sat up late ats 
appeared to him when crying out for help
the gentlemen his chamber found his grace
all in a cold sweat altered much in face
and language since which apparition
he hath grown worse and worse and much i fear
he cannot live
duchess malay
we shall now revisit rosewood place from
which we have so long necessity absented
ourselves
in one those large antique rooms which
the reader may perchance remember belonged to
the suite apartments constituting the eastern
wing the mansion upon the same night as
that in which the events just detailed took place
and it might be about the same time sat
 lockwood
eleanor and her now attendant the gipsy
handassah the eyes the former were
fixed with a mixture tenderness and pity
upon the lineaments another lovely female
countenance bearing a striking resemblance
to her own though evidently from its attire
and bygone costume not intended for her
depicted upon a tablet placed upon a raised
frame before her it was nigh the witching
hour night the room was sombre and
dusky partially dismantled its once flowing
arras and the lights which were set upon the
table but feebly illumined its dreary extent
tradition marked it out as the chamber in
which many the hapless dames rosewood
had expired and hence had superstition claimed
it as her peculiar domain the room was reputed
to be haunted and had for a long space shared
the fate haunted rooms complete desertion
it was now tenanted by one too young too pure
to fear aught unearthly eleanor seemed nevertheless
affected by the profound melancholy 
the picture upon which she gazed at length
rook wood 
handassah observed her start and avert her
eyes shudderingly from the picture
take it hence exclaimed eleanor i have
looked at that image my ancestress till it
has seemed endowed with life till its eyes have
appeared to return my gaze and weep remove
it handassah
handassah silently withdrew the tablet
placing it against the wall the chamber
not there not there cried eleanor turn
it with its face to the wall i cannot bear those
eyes and now come hither girl approach me
nearer for i know not what sudden dread
has crossed me this was her room handassah 
the chamber my ancestress all the ladies
rook wood where they say ha didst thou
not hear a noise h a rustle in the tapestry a
footstep near the wall why thou lookst
frightened as i look wench stay by me i will
not have thee stir from my side twas mere
fancy
no doubt lady said handassah with her
eyes fixed upon the arras
 
hist exclaimed eleanor there tis
again
tis nothing replied handassah but her
looks belied her words
well i will command myself said eleanor
endeavouring to regain her calmness but the
thoughts the lady eleanor for she was an
eleanor like to me handassah and ah even
more illfated and unhappy have brought a
whole train melancholy fancies into my mind
i cannot banish them nay though painful
to me i recur to these images dread with a
species fascination as if in their fate i
contemplated mine own not one who hath
wedded a rosewood but hath rued it
yet you will wed one said handassah
he is not like the rest said eleanor
how know you that lady asked hanvassal
 his time may not yet be come see
what tomorrow will bring forth
thou art averse to my marriage with
ranulph handassah
i was sybifs handmaid ere i was yours
lockwood 
lady i bear in memory a solemn compact with
the dead which this marriage will violate you
are plighted by oath to another if he demand
your hand
but he has not demanded it
would you accept him were he to do so 
asked handassah suddenly
i meant not that replied eleanor my
oath is annulled 
say not so lady cried handassah twas
not for this that sybil spared your life i love
you but i loved sybil and i would see her
dying behests complied with
it may not be handassah replied eleanor
 why from a phantom sense honour am i to
sacrifice my whole existence to one who neither
can love me nor whom i myself could love am
i to wed this man because in her blind idolatry
 him she enforced an oath upon me which i had
no power to resist but which was mentally
cancelled while taken recal not the horrors 
that dreadful cell urge not the subject more
tis in the hope that i may be freed for ever
 
from this persecution that i have consented thus
early to wed with ranulph this will set
lukes fancied claims at rest for ever
handassah answered not but bent her head
as if in acquiescence
steps were now heard near the door and a
servant ushered in our old acquaintance doctor
small and mrs mowbray
i came to take my leave you for the
night my dear young lady said the doctor 
 but before i start for the vicarage i have justa
word or two more to say in addition to the
advice which you were so good as to receive
from me this morning suppose you allow
your attendant to retire for a few minutes
what i have got to say concerns yourself solely
your mother will bear us company there
continued the doctor a handassah was dismissed
 i am glad that darkfaced gipsy has
taken her departure i cant say that i like
her sharp suspicious manner and the first
exercise i should make my powers were i
to be your husband should be to discharge the
 
souhrette but to the point my visit weare
alone i think but this is a queer house
miss mowbray and this is the queerest part 
it walls have ears they say and there are so
many holes and comers in this mansion that
one ought never to talk secrets above ones
breath
but i am yet to learn sirs said eleanor
that there is any secret to be told
why not much i own replied the doctor 
at least what has occurred is not a secret in
the house by this time what do you think has
happened 
it is impossible for me to conjecture
nothing to ranulph i hope
nothing consequence i trust though he
is in part concerned with it
what is it asked eleanor
pray satisfy her curiosity doctor interposed
mrs mowbray
well then said small rather more gravely
the fact the matter stands thus lady
rosewood who as you know was not the
 rook wood
meekest wife in the worlds now turns out by no
means the gentlest mother and has within this
hour found out that she has some objection to
your union with her son
you alarm me doctor
dont alarm yourself at all it will be all
got over without difficulty and only requires a
little management ranulph is with her now
and i doubt not will arrange all to her satisfactions

but what was her objection asked eleanor
was it any one founded upon my obligation
to luke my oath 
tut tut dismiss that subject from your
mind entirely said the doctor that oath is
no more binding on your conscience than would
have been the ties marriage had you been
wedded by yon recusant romish priest father
checkley upon whom however the lord be
merciful bestow not a thought upon that
my anxiety together with that your mother is
to see you now as speedily as may be wedded to
ranulph and then that idle question is set at rest
pwookwood 
for ever and therefore even if such a thing
were to occur as that lady rook wood should
not yield her consent to your marriage why as
that consent is totally unnecessary we must go
through the ceremonial without it
the grounds lady rosewoods objections
said mrs mowbray
ay the grounds her ladyships objections
interposed small who liked nobody to
talk but himself are simply these and exactly
the sort objections one would expect her to
raise she cannot bear the idea abandoning
the control the house and estates to other
hands she cannot and will not relinquish her
station as head the establishment which
ranulph has insisted upon as your right i
thought when i conversed with her on this
subject that she was changed but
naturam expelled furc tamen usque recurred
i beg your pardon she is and always will bethe
same
but why did not ranulph concede the point
 
to her i wish not to dwell here i care not
for these domains for this mansion they
have no charms for me i could he happy with
ranulph any where but happier any where than
here
the kindhearted doctor squeezed her hand
in reply brushing a tear from his eyes
why did he not concede it said mrs
mowbray proudly because the choice remained
not with him it was not his to concede
this house these lands all all are thine 
and it were meet requital indeed that after they
have so long been wrongfully withheld from
thee thou shouldst be a dependant lady
rook wood
without going quite so far as that
madam said the doctor it is but justice
to your daughter that she should be put in
full possession her rights nor should i
for one instant advise or even consent to her
inhabiting the same house with lady rosewood
her ladyships peculiarities temper are such
as to preclude all possibility happiness but
 
at the same time i trust that by management 
always by management madam her ladyships
quick departure may be ensured i understand
that all such legal arrangements in the way 
settlements as could be entered into between
your daughter and her future husband are completed
i have only to regret the absence my
friend mr coates in this momentous occurrence
it vill be a loss to him but hark i hear
ranulphs step in the gallery he will tell us
the result his final interview i came to give
you advice my dear added the doctor in a low
tone to eleanor but i find you heed it not
whoso humble himself shall be exalted i
am glad you do not split upon that rock which
has broken the shins half your generation
at this moment ranulph rosewood entered
the room his cheeks were flushed and his
manner agitated
the whole party were startled by his looks
what has happened asked doctor small
and mrs mowbray in the same breath
ranulph hesitated for a moment in his
p eookwoodi
answer during which space he regarded eleanor
with the deepest anxiety and seemed
revolving within himself how he could frame
his reply in such way as should be least painful
to her feelings while with instinctive apprehension
 coming misfortune miss mowbray
eagerly seconded the inquiries her friends
it is with great pain said he at length ina
tone despondency not unmingled with displeasure
 that i am obliged to descant upon
the infirmities a parent and to censure her
conduct as severely as i may do now i feel the
impropriety such a step and i would willingly
avoid it could i do so in justice to my own
feelings and especially at a moment like the
present when every hope my life is fixed
upon uniting you dear eleanor by ties almost
as near as my own to that parent but the
interview which i have just had with lady
rosewood the bitter heartbreaking interview
compels me to reprobate her conduct in the
strongest terms as harsh unjust and dishonourable
 and if i could wholly throw off the son
 t
as she avows she has thrown off the mother i
should unhesitatingly pronounce it as little short
 
dear ranulph said eleanor palpitating
with apprehension i never saw you so much
moved
nor with so much reason rejoined
ranulph for myself i could endure anything
 but for you 
and does your dispute relate to me asked
eleanor and is it for my sake that you
have braved your mothers displeasure is it
because lady rosewood is unwilling to resign
the control this house and those lands to
trie that you have parted in anger with your
mother was this the cause your quarrel 
it was the origin it replied ranulph
mother said eleanor firmly to mrs mowbray
 go with me to lady rosewoods
chamber
wherefore demanded jvirs mowbray 
question me not dear mother or let me
go alone
 
daughter i guess your meanings said
mrs mowbray sternly you would relinquish
your claims in favour lady 
 is it not so 
since you oblige me to answer you mother
said eleanor blushing i must admit that
you have guessed my meaning to lady
rosewood as to yourself i would be a daughter
as far as is consistent with my duty added she
blushing still more deeply but my first consideration
shall be my husband and if lady
rosewood can be content but pray question
me not further accompany me to her chamber
eleanor interposed ranulph dearest
eleanor the sacrifice you would make is
necessary uncalled for you do not know my
mother she would not i grieve to say it
appreciate the generosity your motives she
would not give you credit for your feelings
she would only resent your visit as an
intrusion
my daughter comprehends you sir said
mrs mowbray haughtily i will take care
 
that in her own house my daughter shall remain
free from insult
mother dear mother said eleanor do
not wilfully misunderstand him
you can be little aware madam said
ranulph calmly but sadly how much i
have recently endured how much parental
anger how much parental malediction i
have incurred to save you and your daughter
from the indignity you apprehend as i
before said you do not know my mother nor
could it enter into any wellregulated imagination
to conceive the extremities to which the
violence her passion will when her schemes
are thwarted hurry her the terms upon
which you met together will not escape your
recollection nor shall i need to call to your
mind her haughtiness her coldness that
coldness has since ripened into distrust and the
match which she was at first all anxiety to
promote she would now utterly set aside were
it in her power to do so whence this alteration
in her views has arisen i have no means 
vol iii t
 
ascertaining it is not my mothers custom to give
a reason for her actions or her wishes it is
all sufficient to express them but i have
perceived that as the time has drawn nigh for
the fulfilment my dearest hopes her unwillingness
has increased until today what had
hitherto been confined to hints has been openly
expressed and absolute objections raised such
however is the peculiarity her temper that i
trusted even at the eleventh hour i should be
able to work a change but no our last
meeting was decisive she commanded me to
break off the match at once and peremptorily
i refused pardon me madam pardon me
dearest eleanor if i thus enter into particulars 
but it is absolutely necessary now that i should
be explicit enraged at my opposition to her
wishes her fury became ungovernable with
appalling imprecations upon the memory 
my poor father and upon your father madam
whose chief offence in her eyes was it seems
the disposition his property to eleanor she
bade me begone and take her curses as my wedrosewood

ding portion beneath this roof beneath ner
roof she added no marriage mine should eer
take place i might go hence or might stay
as i thought fitting but you and your daughter
whom she characterized as intruders should
not remain another hour within her house to
this wild raving i answered with as much
composure as i could command that she
entirely mistook her own position and that
so far from the odium intrusion resting
with you if applicable to any one the term
must necessarily affix itself on those who
through ignorance had for years unjustly
deprived the rightful owners this place 
their inheritance upon this her wrath was
boundless she disowned me as her son 
disclaimed all maternal regard and heaped upon
my head a frightful malediction at the recollection
 which i still tremble but i will
spare you further details this dreadful scene
to me it is most distressing for however firmly
resolved i may be to pursue a line conduct
which every sound principle within me dictates
 
as the correct one yet i cannot be insensible to
the awful responsibility which i shall incur in
bringing down a mothers curse upon my head
nor to the jeopardy in which her own excessive
violence may place hers
mrs mowbray listened to ranulphs explanation
in haughty displeasure eleanor with
throbbing tearful interest doctor small with
mixed feelings anger and astonishment
lady rosewoods conduct said the doctor
is you must forgive me my dear ranulph for
using strong expressions outrageous beyond all
precedent and only excusable on the ground 
insanity to which i wish it were possible we
could attribute it there is however too much
method in her madness to allow us to indulge
any such notion she is shrewd dangerous and
designing and since she has resolved to oppose
this match she will leave no means untried todo
so i scarcely know how to advise you under
the circumstances that is if my advice were
asked
which i scarcely think it is likely to be sir
 
said mrs mowbray coldly after what has
occurred shall think it my duty to break off
this alliance which i have never considered to
be so desirable that its rupture will occasion mean
instants uneasiness
a plague on all these rookwoods muttered
small one would think all the pride
 lucifer were centered in their bosoms but
madam continued the benevolent doctor
have you no consideration for the feelings 
your daughter or for those one who is no
distant relation to you your nephew your son
major mowbray is if i mistake not most eager
for this union to take place between his sister
and his friend
my children have been accustomed to yield
implicit obedience to my wishes said mrs
mowbray and major mowbray i am sure will
see the propriety the step i am about to take
i am content at least to abide by his opinion
snubbed again mentally ejaculated the doctor
with a shrug despair it is useless
attempting to work upon such impracticable
material
 
ranulph remained mute in an attitude 
profound melancholy an eloquent interchange
 glances had passed between him and eleanor
communicating to each the anxious state the
others feelings
it was at this crisis that the door was suddenly
opened and old agnes lady rosewoods aged
attendant rushed into the room and sank upon
her knees on the floor her limbs shaking her
teeth chattering and every feature expressive 
intense terror ranulph went instantly towards
her to demand the cause her alarm
no let me pray cried agnes as he took
her hand in the attempt to raise her let me
pray while there is yet time let the worthy
doctor pray beside me pray for an overladen
soul sir pray heartily as you would hope for
mercy yourself ah little know the righteous 
the terrors those that are beyond the pale 
mercy the lord pardon me my iniquities and
absolve her
her whom do you mean asked ranulph
in agitation you do not allude to my
mother
 
you have no longer a mother young man
said agnes solemnly
what exclaimed ranulph terror stricken 
is she dead
she is gone
gone how exclaimed all their amazement
increasing each instant at the terror
 the old woman and the apparently terrible
occasion it
speak exclaimed ranulph but why
do i loiter my mother perchance is dying let
me go but the old woman maintained her
clutching grasp which was strong and convulsive
as that one struggling betwixt life and
death its no use i tell you its all over
said she the dead are come the dead are
come and she is gone 
gonelwhither
to the grave to the tomb said agnes ina
deep and hollow tone and with a look that
froze ranulphs soul listen to me ranulph
my child my nurseling listen while i can speak
we were alone your mother and i after that scene
 
between you after the dark denunciations
she had heaped upon the dead when i
heard a low and gasping kind sob and
there i saw your mother staring wildly upon
the vacancy as if she saw that which i dare
not think 
what think you she beheld asked
ranulph quaking with apprehension
 that which had been your fathers returned
agnes in a hollow tone dont doubt
me sir youll find the truth what i say
anon i am sure he was there there was a
thrilling speechless horror in the very sight 
her countenance that froze my old blood to ice
to the ice in which tis now ough ough
well at length she rose with her eyes still fixed
and passed through the panelled door without
a word she is gone 
what madness is this cried ranulph
let me go woman
go then cried agnes if you will not
believe my words search for her and satisfy
yourself she is gone i tell you the room
tlookwood 
was empty all the rooms were empty the
passage void through the door she went 
silently silently slow but come let us search
for her throughout the house come come 
and she rushed out the chamber followed
by ranulph mrs mowbray and doctor small
who were all eager to have some explanation 
the distracted story agnes
handassah followed ranulph to the door
closed it after him and then locked it within
side this done she walked back hastily
towards eleanor exclaiming in a tone exultation
 you have parted with him for ever
t 
chapter iii
card now art thou come thou lookst ghastly 
there sits in thy face some great determination
mixed with some fear
bos thus it lightens into action 
i am come to kill thee
duchess malay
what mean you girl cried eleanor
alarmed at her manner why have you
fastened the door open it i command you 
command me v laughed handassah scornfully
 what if i refuse your mandate what
if in my turn i bid you to obey me i never
owned but one mistress if i have bowed my
neck to you for a time twas to fulfil her dying
wishes if i have submitted to your control it
was to accomplish what i have now accomplished
your oath remember your oath the hour is
come for its fulfilment
lockwood 
saying which handassah clapped her hands
a panel in the wall opened and luke stood
suddenly before them silently and with stern
deliberation he strode towards eleanor and
seizing one her hands drew her forcibly
towards him eleanor resisted not she had not
the power neither did she scream for so
extreme was her terror that for the moment it
took away all power utterance luke neither
stirred nor spoke but still maintaining his
hold gazed searchingly upon her features while
eleanor as if spellbound could not withdraw
her eyes from his nothing more terribly impressive
could be conceived than lukes whole
appearance harassed and exhausted by the
life he had recently led deprived almost 
natural rest goaded by remorse his frame
was almost worn to the bone while his countenance
once dark and swarthy was now
blanched and colourless as whitest marble
this pallid and deathlike hue was in all
probability owing to the loss blood which he
had sustained from the wound inflicted by the
 rookwoofi
major with the stains which his apparel
was dyed for though staunched the effusion
had been sufficient to cause great faintness
his dark eyes blazed with their wonted fire nay
they looked darker and larger from his exceeding
paleness and so much intense mental and
bodily suffering was imprinted upon his whole
countenance that despite its fierceness and
desperation few could have regarded him
without sympathy real desperation has so
much agony in its character that few can
witness it unmoved his garb was not that in
which the reader first beheld him but a dark
simple suit corresponding more with his real
rank in life than his former peasants attire 
but it was disordered by his recent conflict
and stained with bloody testimonials the
recent fray while his long sable curls once his
pride and ornament now hung in intertangled
elf locks like a coil wreathed water snakes
even in her terror as she dwelt upon his noble
features eleanor could not help admitting
that she beheld the undoubted descendant and
 
the living likeness the handsomest and most
distinguished her house the profligate and
criminal sir reginald as her eye mechanically
following this train thought wandered for
an instant to the haughty portraiture sir
reginald which formed part the family
pictures and thence to those his unfortunate
lady she was struck yiih the fancy
that by some terrible fatality the tragic
horrors byegone days were to be again
enacted in their persons and that they were
in some way strangely identified wth their
unfortunate progenitors so forcibly was this
idea impressed upon her countenance that
luke who had followed the direction her
glances became instantly aware it drawing
her nearer to the portrait the lady eleanor
he traced the resemblance in mute wonder 
thence turning towards that sir reginald
he proudly exclaimed you doubted once
my lineage maiden can you gaze on those
features which would almost seem to bea
reflexion mine own and longer hesitate
whose descendant i am i glory in my likes

ness there is a wild delight in setting human
emotions at nought which he was said to feel 
which i feel now within these halls i seem to
breathe an atmosphere congenial to me i visit
what i oft have visited in my dreams or as in a
state preexistence methinks as i gaze on
thee i could almost deem myself sir reginald
and thou his bride the lady eleanor our
fates were parallel she was united to her
lord by ties hatred by an oath a bridal
oath i so art thou to me and she could
neer escape him could neer throw off her
bondage nor shalt thou i claim the fulfilment
 thy oath thou art miner
never never shrieked eleanor struggling
to disengage herself but luke laughed
at her feeble efforts handassah stood by a
passive spectatress the scene with her arms
folded upon her bosom
you refuse compliance said luke scornfully
 have you no hopes heaven no
fears perdition that you dare to violate your
vow bethink you the awful nature that
obligation the life which was laid dovn to

purchase it the blood which will cry out for
vengeance gainst the murderess should you
hesitate by that bloodcemented sacrament 
i claim you as my own you are mine and
he dragged her towards the opening eleanor
uttered a prolonged and terrific scream
be silent on your life added he searching
for the dagger given to him by alan rosewood
 when as his hand sought the weapon eleanor
escaped from his grasp and fled towards the door
but handassah had anticipated her intention
the key was withdrawn from the lock and the
wretched maiden vainly tried to open it
at this instant turpin appeared at the sliding
panel
quick quick cried he impatiently 
dispatch in the devils name the house is
alarmed i hear young ranulphs voice in the
gallery
ranulph shrieked eleanor then i am
saved and she redoubled lier outcries for
assistance
luke again seized his victim her hands
 
clutched so convulsively fast in her despairing
energy against the handle the door that he
could not tear her thence by this time ranulph
rosewood who had caught her reiterated screams
for help was at the entrance he heard her
struggles he heard lukes threats his mockery
liis derisive laughter but vainly vainly
did he attempt to force it open it was the
strongest oak and the bolts resisted all his
efforts a board alone divided him from his
mistress he could hear her sobs and gasps 
he saw from the action the handle with what
tenacity she clung to it and stung to frenzy
by the sight he hurled himself against the
sturdy plank but all in vain at length the
handle was still there was a heavy fall upon
the floor a stifled scream and a sound as 
a body being dragged along the thought was
madness
to the panel to the panels cried a voice
it was that turpin from within
the panel ha echoed ranulph with a
sudden gleam hope i may yet save her
 
and he darted along the corridor with the swiftness
 thought
luke meanwhile had for some minutes fruitlessly
exhausted all his force to drag eleanor
from the door despair gave her strength 
she clutched at the door but she felt her
strength failing her her grasp was relaxing
and then the maddening thought that she would
be shortly his that he would slay her while
the idea that ranulph was so near and yet
unable to protect her added gall even to her
bitterness with savage delight luke exulted
in the lovers tortures he heard ranulphs
ineffectual attempts he heard his groans he
heard their mutual cries inflamed by jealousy
he triumphed in his power vengeance and
even prolonged the torture which accident had
given him the means inflicting he stood
like the inquisitor who marks his victims anguish
on the rack and calculates his powers 
further endurance but he could no longer
dally even with this horrible gratification his
companion grew impatient eleanors fair long
 rook wood
tresses had escaped from their confinement in
the struggle and fell down her neck in disorder
twining his fingers amidst its folds luke
dragged her from her hold backwards and
incapable further resistance her strength
completely exhausted the wretched girl fell to
the ground
luke now raised her almost inanimate form
in his arms and had nigh reached the aperture
when a crash was heard in the panel opposite to
that by which he was about to escape and communicating
with a further apartment it was
thrown open and ranulph rosewood presented
himself at the narrow partition an exclamation
 joy that he was yet in time escaped his
lips and he was about to clear the partition at
a bound and to precipitate himself upon luke
when as suddenly as his own action was the
person the unfortunate mr coates wedged
into the apaperture
traitor cried ranulph regarding coates
with concentrated fury dare you to oppose
me hence or by heaven i will cut you down
lockwood 
tis impossible ejaculated the attorney
for your own sake sir ranulph for my
sake i beg i implore you not to attempt
to pass this way try the other door
ranulph said no more he passed his sword
through the body the miserable attorney
who with a deep groan fell the only obstacle
to his passage being thus removed he at once
leaped into the room
the brothers were now confronted together
but little brotherly love mingled with the
glances which they threw upon each other
ranulphs gentle but withal enthusiastic temperament
had kindled under his present excitement
like flax at the sudden approach flame
he was wild with frenzy luke was calmer but
his fury was deadly and inextinguishable the
meeting was terrible on both sides
with one arm luke enfolded eleanor with
the other he uplifted the dagger its point was
towards her bosom scowling grim defiance
at ranulph he exclaimed in a determined
 
tone advance a footstep and my dagger
descends into her heart
ranulph hesitated uncertain how to act
foaming with rage and yet trembling with
apprehension
ranulph gasped eleanor life without
thee were valueless advance avenge me
but ranulph still hesitated he could not
by any act his own compromise eleanors
safety
luke saw his advantage and was not slow to
profit by it you seal her destruction if you
stir said he
villain returned ranulph between his
ground teeth and with difficulty commanding
sufficient coolness to speak with deliberation
you perceive your power but injure her and
nothing earthly shall protect you free her and
take your life and liberty nay reward if you
will you cannot otherwise escape me
escape you laughed luke disdainfully
stand aside and let me pass beware added
rook wood 
he sternly how you oppose me i would not
have a brothers blood upon my soul
nor i cried ranulph but you pass
not and he placed himself full in lukes
path
luke however steadily moved forward
holding eleanor between himself and ranulph
so as to shield his own person but fancying he
saw an opportunity dealing a blow athout
injury to his mistress the latter was about
to hazard the thrust when his arms were seized
behind and he was rendered powerless
lost lost groaned he she is lost to me
for ever 
 i fear thats but too true replied turpin
for it was the highwayman whose grasp confined
ranulph
must i see her borne away before my eyes 
cried ranulph release me set me free
quite impossible at present returned dick
mount and away sir luke continued he
 never mind me leave me to shift for
myself
 
eleanor j cried ranulph as she passed close
by his side
ranulph shrieked eleanor with a loud
scream recalled to consciousness by his voice
 farewell for ever
ay for ever responded luke triumphantly
 you meet no more on earth
he was about to pass through the panel when
eleanor exerted all her remaining strength ina
last futile attempt at liberation in the struggle
a packet fell from his bosom
handassah stooped to pick it up
from sybil exclaimed she glancing at the
superscription
remember my promise to old barbara
roared dick who had some curiosity as the
reader knows to learn what the package contained
 the time is arrived eleanor is in
your power in your presence
give me the packet said luke and
added he resigning eleanor for the instant to
handassahs custody take the steel and grasp
her firmly
lockwood 
handassah who though slight figure was
 singular personal strength twined her arms
about miss mowbray in such manner as to
preclude all possibility motion
luke tore open the package it was a box
carefully enclosed in several folds linen and
lastly within a sheet paper on which was
inscribed these words 
the dower sybil
hastily and with much curiosity luke raised
the lid the box it contained one long silken
tress blackest hair curiously braided it was
sybips his first impulse was to cast it from
him his next reproachfully to raise it to his
lips he started as if a snake had stung him
at this moment a loud clamour was heard in
the gallery in the next the door was assailed
by violent strokes evidently proceeding from
some weighty instrument impelled by the
united strength several assailants
the voice turpin rose above the deafening
din a bullet for the first who enters
 rook wood
shouted he quick sir luke and the prize is
safe away and 
but as he seconded his exhortation with a
glance at luke he broke off the halfuttered
sentence and started with horror and amazement
ere the cause could be expressed the
door was burst open and a crowd domestics
headed by major mowbray and titus tyrone
rushed into the room
nay then the games up exclaimed dick
i have done with and springing
through the panel he was seen no more
when the new comers first looked round
they could perceive only two figures besides
themselves those the two lovers eleanor
having sunk pale exhausted and almost senseless
into the arms ranulph presently
however a ghastly object attracted their attention
all rushed towards it all recoiled as
soon as they discovered that it was the lifeless
body luke rosewood his limbs were stiff
like those a corpse which has for hours been
such this eyes protruded from their sockets 
 
his face was livid and blotched all bespoke
with terrible certainty the efficacy the poison
and the full accomplishment barbaras
revenge
handassah was gone probably she had
escaped ere turpin fled at all events she
was heard no more at rosewood
it required but little to recall the senses 
eleanor shortly she revived and as she gazed
around and became conscious her escape
she uttered exclamations thanksgiving and
sank into the embraces her brother
meanwhile mrs mowbray and doctor small
had joined the assemblage
the worthy doctor had been full alarm
but his meditated condolences were now
changed to congratulations as he heard the particulars
 the terrible scene that had occurred
and eleanors singular and almost providential
deliverance
after what has befallen madam said the
doctor to mrs mowbray slightly coughing
vol iii u
 
you can no longer raise any objections to a
certain union eh
i will answer for my mother in that
particular said major mowbray stepping
forward
she will answer for herself my son
said mrs mowbray the match has her full
and entire consent but to what am i to
attribute the unexpected happiness your
return 
to a chain singular circumstances
replied the major which i will hereafter
detail to you suffice it to say that but for
this gentlemans fortunate arrival i might
have been detained a prisoner without parole
in a lone hut perhaps for days and to add to
my distress fully acquainted with the meditated
abduction my sister it was excessively
lucky for me mr tyrconnel that you happened
to pass that way and for poor pater son
likewise
array by my soul major and you may
 
say that with safety and it was particularly
fortunate that we stumbled upon the tits in the
cellar or wed never have been here just in the
nick it i begin to think weve lost all
chance taking dick turpin this time hes
got clane away
i am not sorry for his escape said the
major hes a brave fellow and i respect
courage wherever i find it even sir in a
highwayman
we shall not pause to describe the affectionate
meeting which now ensued between the
brother and sister the congratulations upon
eleanors escape from peril intermingled with
the tenderest embraces and the warmest thanks
offered to ranulph for his gallant service
she is yours my dear boy said the major 
and though you are a rook wood and she
bears the illfated name eleanor i predict
that contrary to the usual custom our families
in such cases all your misfortunes have occurred
before marriage
there is only one thing said small
 rook wood
with a very peculiar expression which might
almost be construed into seriocomic could we
suspect the benevolent doctor any such waggery
 which can possibly throw a shade over
our present felicity lady rosewood is not
to be heard 
my poor mothers said ranulph starting
make yourself easy said the doctor i
doubt not we shall hear her tomorrow my
only fear added he half aside is that she
may return before
 one other circumstance afflicts me said
ranulph poor mr coates
whats that you say mr coates 
sir ranulph exclaimed titus
i fear he is killed said ranulph let
some one search for the body
kilt echoed titus is it kilt he is
ah ullagone and is it over with him entirely
bring me to his remains
he will bring them to you himself said the
attorney stepping forward luckily sir
ranulph said the incurable punster it was
 
merely the outer coats that your sword passed
through the inner remains uninjured so that
you did not act as my conveyancer to eternity 
fve as many lives as a cat ha ha 
ranulph welcomed the facetious man law
with no little satisfaction
we think it unnecessary to enter into much
further detail another chamber was prepared
for eleanors reception to which she was almost
immediately transported the remains the
once fierce and haughty luke now stiff and
stark but still wearing even in death their
proud character were placed upon the selfsame
bier and covered with the selfsame pall which
but a week ago had furnished forth his fathers
funeral and as the domestics crowded round
the corpse there was not one them but commented
upon his startling resemblance to his
grandsire sir reginald nor amongst the
superstitious was the falling the fatal bough
forgotten
tranquillity was at length restored at the
hall throughout the night and during the
 lockwood
next day ranulph made every search for his
mother but no tidings could be learned her
seriously alarmed he then caused more strict
and general inquiry to be instituted but with
like unsuccessful effect it was not indeed
till some years afterwards that her fate was
ascertained
her old handmaiden agnes died raving in
the course the following day declaring upon
her deathbed that she was certain sir piers
had fetched away her mistress a notion which
prevailed pretty generally amongst the credulous
 whom there were not few to bo met
with at the hall
chapter iv
so now tis ended like an old wifes story
webster
notwithstanding the obscurity which hung
over the fate lady rook wood the celebration
 the nuptials sir ranulph and eleanor
was not long delayed the ceremony took place
at the parish church and the worthy vicar
officiated upon the occasion it was a joyous
sight to all who witnessed it and not few were
they who did so for the whole neighbourhood
was bidden to the festival the old avenue
was thronged with bright and beaming faces
rustic maidens deckd out in ribbons manycoloured
splendour and stout youths in their
best holiday trim nor was the lusty yeoman
 
and his buxom spouse nor yet the patriarch 
the village nor prattling child wanting even
the ancestral rooks seemed to participate in the
universal merriment and returned from their
eyries a hoarse greeting like a lusty chorus
 laughter to the frolic train the churchyard
path was strewn with flowers the
church itself a complete garland never was
there seen a blither wedding the sun smiled
upon the bride accounted a fortunate omen
as dark lowering skies and stormy weather
had within the memory the oldest 
the tenantry inauspiciously ushered in all
former espousals the bride had recovered her
bloom and beauty while the melancholy which
had seemingly settled for ever upon the open
brow the bridegroom had now given place
to a pensive shade which only added interest to
his expressive features and as in simple state
after the completion the sacred rites the
youthful pair walked arm in arm amongst their
thronging and admiring tenants towards the
hall many a fervent prayer was breathed that
rook wood 
the curse the house rosewood might be
averted from their heads and not to leave the
reader in doubt upon the subject we can add
that these aspirations were not in vain but that
the day which dawned so brightly was one 
serene and unclouded beauty to its close
after the ceremonial the day was devoted
to festivity crowded with company from its
ample hall to its kitchen ingle the old mansion
could scarce contain its numerous guests
while its walls resounded with hearty peals 
laughter to which they had been long unaccustomed
the tables groaned beneath the
lordly baron beef the weighty chine the
castled pasty flanked on the one hand with
neats tongue and on the other defended by
a mountainous ham an excellent piece de
resistance and every other substantia appliance
 ancient hospitality barrels 
mighty ale were broached and their nutbrown
contents widely distributed and the health the
bride and bridegroom was enthusiastically drunk
in the brimming wassail cup spicy wine with
u
 
floating toast titus tyrconnel acted as master
 the ceremonies and was mr coates said
quite in his element so much was he
elated that he ventured to cut some his old
jokes upon the vicar and strange to say without
incurring the resentment small
to retrace the darker course our narrative
we must state that some weeks before this
happy event had the remains the unfortunate
sir luke rosewood been gathered to
those his fathers the document which
attested his birth being found upon his person
the claims which were denied to him in life
were conceded in death and he was interred
with all the pomp and peculiar solemnity proper
to one the house within the tomb his
ancestry
it was then that a discovery was made respecting
alan rosewood in order to explain
which we must again revert to the night 
the meditated engagement eleanor
after quitting his grandson in the avenue
alan shaped his course among the fields in the
lockwood 
direction to the church he sought his own
humble but now deserted dwelling the door
had been forced some its meagre furniture
was removed and the dog his sole companion
had fled poor mole said he thou
hast found i trust a better master and having
possessed himself what he came in search
namely a bunch keys and his lantern
deposited in an outoftheway cupboard which
had escaped notice he quickly departed
he was once more within the churchyard 
once more upon that awful stage thereon he
had chosen to enact for a long season his late
fantastical character and he gazed upon the
church tower glistening in the moonshine the
green and undulating hillocks the chequered
crosssticks the clustered headstones and the
black and portentous yew trees as upon old
familiar faces he mused for a few moments
upon the scene apparently with deep interest
he then walked beneath the shadow one 
the yews chaunting an odd stanza or so one
 his vild melodies wrapped the while it
rook wood
would seem in affectionate contemplation the
subject matter his song 
the yew
a noxious tree is the churchyard yew
as if from the dead its sap it drew 
dark are its branches and dismal to see
like plumes at deaths latest solemnity
spectral and jagged and black as the wings
which some spirit ill oer a sepulchre flings 
oh a terrible tree is the churchyard yew 
like it is nothing so ghastly to view
yet this baleful tree hath a core so sound
can nought so tough in the grove be found 
from it were fashioned brave english bows
the boast our isle and the dread its foes
for our sturdy sires cut their stoutest staves
from the branch that hung oer their fathers graves
and though it be dreary and dismal to view
staunch at the heart is the churchyard yew
his ditty concluded alan entered the
churchyard taking care to leave the door
slightly ajar in order to facilitate his grandsons
entrance for an instant he lingered in the
metuenda que stucco
taxus
statius
 
chancel the full moonlight fell upon the
monuments his race and directed by the fell
instinct hate alans eye rested upon the
gilded entablature his perfidious brother
reginald and muttering curses not loud but
deeps he passed on having lighted his
lantern in no tranquil mood he descended
into the vault observing a similar caution with
respect to the portal the cemetery which he
left partially unclosed with the key in the lock
here he resolved to abide lukes coming the
reader knows what probability there was his
expectations being realized
for awhile he paced the tomb wrapped in
gloomy meditation and pondering it might
be upon the result lukes expedition and the
fulfilment his own dark schemes scowling
from time to time beneath his bent eyebrows
counting the grim array coffins and noticing
with something like satisfaction that the shell
which contained the remains his daughter
had been restored to its former position he
then bethought him father checkleys 

night intrusion upon his conference with luke
and their apprehension a supernatural visitation
and his curiosity was stimulated to
ascertain by what means the priest had gained
admission to the spot unperceived and unheard
he resolved to sound the floor and see whether
any secret entrance existed and hollowly and
dully did the hard flagging return the stroke
 his heel as he pursued his scrutiny at
length the metallic ringing an iron plate
immediately behind the marble effigy sir
ranulph resolved the point there it was
that the priest had found access to the vault
but alans disappointment was excessive when
he discovered that this plate was fastened on the
underside and all communication thence with
the churchyard or to wherever else it might
conduct him cut off but the present was not
the season for further investigation and tolerably
pleased with the discovery he had already
made he returned to his silent march around
the sepulchre
at length a sound like the sudden shutting
lockwood 
 the church door broke upon the profound
stillness the holy edifice in the
hush that succeeded a footstep was distinctly
heard threading the aisle
he comes he comes r exclaimed alan
joyfully adding an instant after in an altered
voice but he comes alone
the footstep drew near to the mouth the
vault it was upon the stairs alan stepped
forward to greet as he supposed his
grandson but started back in astonishment
and dismay as he encountered in his stead
lady rosewood alan retreated while the
lady advanced swinging the iron door after
her which closed with a tremendous clang
approaching the statue the first sir
ranulph she paused and alan then remarked
the singular and terrible expression 
her eyes which appeared to be fixed upon the
statue or upon some invisible object near it
there was something in her whole attitude and
manner calculated to impress the deepest terror
on the beholder and alan gazed upon her with
 rook wood
an awe which momently increased lady rookwoods
bearing was as proud and erect as we
have formerly described it to have been her
brow was as haughtily bent her chiselled lip as
disdainfully curled but the staring changeless
eye and the deepheaved sob which occasionally
escaped her betrayed how much she was under
the influence mortal terror alan watched her
in amazement he knew not how the scene was
likely to terminate nor what could have induced
her to visit this ghostly spot at such an hour
and alone but he resolved to abide the issue in
silence profound as her own after a time
however his impatience got the better his
fears and scruples and he spoke
what doth lady rook wood in the abode 
the dead asked he at length
she started at the sound his voice but still
kept her eye fixed upon the vacancy
hast thou not beckoned me hither and
am i not comes returned she in a hollow
tone and now thou ask est wherefore i am
here i am here because as in thy life i feared
 
thee not neither in death do i fear thee i am
here because 
what seest thou interrupted peter with
illsuppressed terror
 what see i ha ha shouted lady
rook wood amidst discordant laughter that
which might appal a heart less stout than
mine a figure anguish writhen with veins that
glow as with a subtle and consuming flame
a substance yet a shadow in thy living
likeness ha frown if thou wilt i can return
thy glances 
where dost thou see this vision demanded
alan
where echoed lady rosewood becoming
for the first time sensible the
presence a stranger ha who art thou
that questions me what art thou 
speak 
no matter who or what i am returned
alan i ask thee what thou dost behold
canst thou see nothing 
nothing replied alan
 
thou didst know sir piers rosewood 
is it he asked alan drawing near
her
it is he replied lady rosewood i have
followed him hither and i will follow him
whithersoever he leads me were it to 
what doth he now asked alan seest
thou him still
the figure points to that sarcophagus
returned lady rosewood canst raise up
the lid
no replied alan my strength will not
avail to lift it
yet let the trial be made said lady 
 the figure points there still my own
arm shall aid thee
alan watched her in dumb wonder she
advanced towards the marble monument and
beckoned him to follow reluctantly did he
comply without any expectation being
able to move the ponderous lid the sarcophagus
at lady rook woods renewed request he
applied himself to raise it what was his
 
surprise when beneath their united efforts
he found the ponderous slab slowly revolve
upon its vast hinges and with little further
difficulty it was completely elevated though
it still required the exertion all alans
strength to prop it open and prevent its falling
back
what doth it contain asked lady
rook wood
a warriors ashes returned alan
there is a rusty dagger upon a fold 
faded linen cried lady rosewood holding
down the light
it is the weapon with which the first dame
 the house rosewood was stabbed said
alan with a grim smile
which whoso graspcth in the tomb
shall clutch until the hour doom
so saith the rhyme have you seen enough 
no said lady rosewood precipitating
herself into the marble coffin that weapon
shall be mine
 
come forth come forth cried alan
my arm trembles i cannot support the lid
i will have it though i grasp it to
eternity shrieked lady rosewood vainly
endeavouring to wrest away the dagger which
was fastened together with the linen upon which
it lay by some adhesive substance to the bottom
 the shell
at this moment alan rosewood happened
to cast his eye upward and he then beheld
what filled him with new terror the axe
 the sable statue was poised above its head
as in the act to strike him some secret machinery
it was evident existed between the
sarcophagus lid and this mysterious image butin
the first impulse his alarm alan abandoned
his hold the slab and it sunk slowly downwards
he uttered a loud cry as it moved
lady rosewood heard this cry she raised
herself at the same moment the dagger was in
her hand she pressed against the lid but its
downward force was too great to be withstood 
rook wood 
the light was within the sarcophagus and alan
could discern her features the expression was
terrible she uttered one shriek and the lid
closed for ever 
alan was in total darkness the light had
been enclosed with lady rook wood there was
something so horrible in her probable fate that
even he shuddered as he thought upon it exerting
all his remaining strength he essayed to
raise the lid but now it was more firmly closed
than ever it defied all his power once for
an instant he fancied that it yielded to his
straining sinews but it was only his hand
that sliced upon the surface the marble it
was fixed immovable the sides and lid rang
with the strokes which the unfortunate lady
bestowed upon them with the daggers point
but these were not long heard presently all
was still the marble ceased to vibrate with her
blows alan struck the lid with his knuckles
but no response was returned all was
silent
he now turned his attention to his own
 
situation which had become sufficiently alarming
an hour must have elapsed yet luke
had not arrived the door the vault was
closed the key was in the lock and on the
outside he was himself a prisoner within the
tomb what if luke should not return
what if he were slain as it might chance in the
enterprise that thought flashed across his
brain like an electric shock none knew 
his retreat but his grandson he might perish
 famine within this desolate vault
but he checked this notion as soon as it was
formed it was too dreadful to be indulged in
a thousand circumstances might conspire to
detain luke he was sure to come yet the
solitude the darkness was awful almost intolerable
 the dying and the dead around him
he dared not stir
another hour an age it seemed to him had
passed still luke came not horrible forebodings
crossed him but he would not surrender
himself to them he rose and crawled in
the direction as he supposed the door fearful
tyz sruzkijvojc
lockwood 
even the stealthy sound his own footsteps
he reached it and his heart once more
throbbed with hope he bent his ear to the
key he drew in his breath he listened for
any sound but nothing was to be heard a
ffroan had been almost music in his ears
another hour was gone he was now a
prey to the most frightful apprehensions
agitated in turns by the wildest emotions 
rage and terror he at one moment imagined
that luke had abandoned him and heaped
curses upon his head at the next convinced
that he had fallen he bewailed with equal bitterness
his grandsons fate and his own he
paced the tomb like one distracted he
stamped upon the iron plate he smote with
his hands upon the door he shouted and
the vault hollowly echoed his lamentations
but times sand ran on and luke had not
arrived
alan now abandoned himself wholly to despair
no longer could he anticipate his grandsons
coming no longer hope for deliverance his
 
fate was sealed death awaited he must
anticipate his slow but inevitable stroke 
enduring all the grinding horrors starvation
the contemplation such an was madness
but he was forced to contemplate it now and
so appalling did it appear to his imagination
that he half resolved to dash out his brains
against the walls the sepulchre and put an
 at once to his tortures and nothing buta
doubt whether he might not by imperfectly
accomplishing his purpose increase his own
suffering prevented him fiom putting this
dreadful idea into execution his dagger was
gone and he had no other weapon terrors
 a new kind now assailed him the dead he
fancied were bursting from their coffins and he
peopled the darkness with grisly phantoms they
were around about him on each side whirling
and rustling gibbering groaning shrieking 
laughing and lamenting he was stunned 
stifled the air seemed to grow suffocating 
pestilential the wild laughter was redoubled 
the horrible troop assailed him they dragged
 
him along the tomb and amid their howls he
fell and became insensible
when he returned to himself it was sometime
before he could collect his scattered faculties
and when the agonizing consciousness 
his terrible situation forced itself upon his mind
he had nigh relapsed into oblivion he arose 
he rushed towards the door he knocked against
it with his knuckles till the blood streamed from
them he scratched against it with his nails till
they where torn off by the roots with immense
fury he hurled himself against the iron frame 
it was in vain again he had recourse to the
trap door he searched for it he found it
he laid himself upon the ground there was
no interval space in which he could even introduce
a fingers point he beat it with his
clenched hand she tore it with his teeth he
jumped upon it he smote it with his heel the
iron returned a sullen sound
he again essayed the lid the sarcophagus
despair nerved his strength he raised the
slab a few inches he shouted screamed but
no answer was returned and again the lid fell
vol iii x
 
she is dead cried alan why have
not shared her fate but mine is to come 
and such a death ah ah and frenzied at
the thought he again hurried to the door and
renewed his fruitless attempts to escape till
nature gave way and he sank upon the floor
groaning and exhausted
physical suffering now began to take the
place his mental tortures parched and consumed
as by a fierce internal fever he was
tormented by unappeasable thirst all human
ills the most unendurable his tongue was dry
and dusty his throat inflamed his lips had
lost all moisture he licked the humid floor 
he sought to imbibe the nitrous drops from the
walls but instead allaying his thirst they
increased it he would have given the world
had he possessed it for a draught cold spring
water oh to have died with his lips upon
some bubbling fountains marge but to perish
thus 
nor were the pangs hunger wanting he
had to endure all the horrors famine as well
as the agonies quenchless thirst
 
in this dreadful state did three days and
nights pass over alans fated head nor night
nor day had he time with him was only
measured by its duration and that seemed
interminable each hour added only to his
suffering and brought with it no relief during
this period prolonged misery reason often
tottered on her throne sometimes he was
under the influence the wildest passions
he dragged coffins from their recesses hurled
them upon the ground striving to break them
open and drag forth their loathsome contents
upon other occasions he would weep bitterly
and wildly and once once only did he
attempt to pray but he started from his knees
with an echo infernal laughter as he deemed
ringing in his ears then again wovdd he call
down imprecations upon himself and his whole
line trampling upon the pile coffins he had
reared and lastly more subdued would he
creep to the boards that contained the body 
his child kissing them with a frantic outbreak
 affection
 rookwoou
at length he became sensible his approaching
dissolution to him the thought death
might well be terrible but he quailed not before
it or rather seemed in his latest moments to
resume all his wonted firmness character
gathering together his remaining strength he
dragged himself towards the niche wherein his
brother was deposited and placing his hand upon
the coffin solemnly exclaimed my curse 
my dying curse be upon thee evermore 
falling with his face upon the coffin alan
instantly expired in this attitude were his
remains discovered
our tale is told yet perhaps we may be
allowed to add a few words respecting two 
the subordinate characters our drama melodrama
we ought to say namely jerry juniper
and the knight malta what became the
caper merchants son after his flight from
tilbury wells we have never been able distinctly
to ascertain juniper however would
seem to be a sort wandering jew for certain
it is that somebody very like him is extant still
 
and to be met with at jerrys old haunts indeed
we have no doubt encountering him at the
ensuing meetings ascot and hampton
as regards the knight malta knight 
roads rhodes he should have been we are
sorry to state that the career the ruffler was
terminated in a madhouse and thus the poor
knight became in reality a hospitaller 
according to the custom observed in those
establishments the knight was deprived his
luxuriant locks and the loss his beard
rendered his case incurable but in the meantime
the barber the place made his fortune
by retailing the material all the
black wigs he could collect to the impostors
dupes
such was the latest piece intelligence that
has reached us the arclihoaxer canterbury

turpin why disguise it was hanged at
york in his firmness deserted him not
at the last when he mounted the ladder his
left leg trembled he stamped it impatiently
 
down and after a brief chat with the hangman
threw himself suddenly and resolutely from the
steps his sufferings would appear to have
been slight the remains the vagrant highwayman
found a final resting place in the
desecrated churchyard st george without
the fisherman postern a green and grassy
cemetery but withal a melancholy one a few
recent tombs mark ovit the spots where some 
the victims the late pestilence have been
interred but we have made vain search for
turpins grave
the gyves by which he was fettered are still
shown at york castle and are prodigious
weight and strength and though the herculean
robber is said to have moved in them with ease
the present turnkey was scarce able to lift the
ponderous irons an old woman the same
city has a lock hair said to have been
turpins which she avouches her grandfather
cut off from the body after the execution
and which the believers look upon with great
reverence o rare dick turpin 
 wood 
we shall perhaps be accused dilating too
much upon the character the highwayman
and we plead guilty to the charge but we
found it impossible to avoid running a little into
extremes the subject as leigh hunt would
say has run away with us our earliest
associations are connected with sunny scenes
in cheshire said to have been haunted by
turpin and with one very dear to us from
whose lips now alas silent we have listened
to many stories his exploits he was a
sort hero we have had a singular delight
in recounting his feats and hairbreadth escapes 
and if the reader derives only half so much
pleasure from the perusal his adventures as
we have had in narrating them our satisfaction
will be complete perhaps we may have placed
him in too favourable a point view and yet
we know not as upon those more important
 
personages many doubts rest upon his history
such as we conceive him to have been have we
drawn him hoping that the benevolent reader
upon finishing our work will arrive at the same
conclusion and in the words the quaint
old prologue to the prince prigs revels
thank that man
can make each thief a complete russian

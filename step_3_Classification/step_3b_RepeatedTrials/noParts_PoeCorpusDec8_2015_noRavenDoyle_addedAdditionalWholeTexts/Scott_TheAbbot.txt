i admit that my retrenchments have been
numerous and leave gaps in the story
which in your original manuscript would
have run well nigh to a fourth volume as
my printer assures me i am sensible besides
that in consequence the liberty 
curtailment you have allowed m e some parts
 the story have been huddled up without
the necessary details but after all it is
better that the travellers should have to step
over a drain than to wade through a morass
 that the reader should have to suppose
what may easily be inferred than be
obliged to creep through pages dull explanation
i have struck out for example
the whole machinery the white lady
and the poetry by which it is so ably supported
in the original manuscript but
you must allow that the public taste gives
little encouragement to those legendary superstitions
which formed the delight alternately
and the terror our predecessors
in like manner much is omitted illustrative
 the impulse enthusiasm in favour
introductory epistle ill
 the ancient religion in mother magdalen
and the abbot but we do not feel deep
sympathy at this period with what was
once the most powerful and animating principle
in europe with the exception that
 the reformation by which it was successfully
opposed
you rightly observe that these retrenchments
have rendered the title no longer applicable
to the subject and that some other
would have been more suitable to the work
in its present state than that the abbot
who made so much greater figure in the
original and for whom your friend the benedictine
seems to have inspired you with
a sympathetic respect i must plead guilty
to this accusation observing at the same
time in manner extenuation that though
the objection might have been easily removed
by giving a new title to the work
yet in doing so i should have destroyed
the necessary cohesion between the present
history and its predecessor the ivio
mastery which i was unwilling to do as
 introductory epistle
the period and several the personages
were the same
after all my good friend it is little
consequence what the work is called or on
what interest it tmns providing it catches
the public attention for the quality the
wine could we but ensure it may according
to the old proverb render the bush unnecessary
or little consequence
 congratulate you upon your having

x he time which passes over our heads so
imperceptibly makes the same gradual
change in habits manners and character
as in personal appearance at the revolution
 every five years we find ourselves
another and yet the same there is a
change views and no less the light in
 the abbot
which we regard them a change motives
as well as actions nearly twice that
space had glided away over the head 
halbert glendinning and his lady betwixt
the conclusion that narrative in which
they played a distinguished part and the
commencement the present
two circumstances only had embittered
their union which was otherwise as happy
as mutual affection could render it the
first these was indeed the common calamity
 scotland being the distracted state
 that unhappy country where every man's
sword was directed against his neighbour's
bosom glendinning had proved what murray
expected him a steady friend strong
in battle and wise in counsel adhering to
him from motives gratitude in situations
where by his own unblessed will he would
either have stood neuter or have joined
the opposite party hence when danger
was near and it was seldom far distant sir
halbert glendinning for he now bore the
rank knighthood was perpetually sumthe
abbot 
money to attend his patron on distant expeditions
or on perilous enterprizes or to
assist him with his counsel in the doubtful
intrigues a half barbarous court he was
thus frequently and for a long space absent
from his castle and from his lady and to
this ground regret we must add that
their union had produced no children to
occupy the attention the lady 
while she was thus deprived her
husband's domestic society
on such occasions she lived almost entirely
secluded from the world within the
walls her paternal mansion visiting
amongst neighbours was a matter entirely
out the question unless on occasion 
solemn festival and then it was chiefly
confined to near kindred these the
lady avenel had none who survived
and the dames the neighbouring barons
affected to regard her less as the heiress 
the house avenel than as the wife a
peasant the son a churchvassal raised
 the abbot
up to mushroom eminence by the capricious
favour murray
this pride ancestry which rankled in
the bosom the more ancient gentry was
more openly expressed by their ladies and
was moreover embittered not a little by
the political feuds the time for most 
the southron chiefs were friends to the authority
 the queen and very jealous 
the power murray the castle 
was therefore on all these accounts as
melancholy and solitary a residence for its
lady as could well be imagined still it
had the essential recommendation great
security the reader knows that the fortress
was built upon an islet in a small
lake and was only accessible by a causeway
intersected by a double ditch defended
by two drawbridges so that without artillery
it might in these days be considered
as impregnable it was only necessary
therefore to secure against surprise and
the service six able men within the casthe
abbot 
tie was sufficient for that purpose if
more serious danger threatened an ample
garrison was supplied by the male inhabitants
 a little hamlet which under the
auspices halbert glendinning had arisen
on a small piece level ground betwixt
the lake and the hill nearly adjoining
to the spot where the causeway joined the
mainland the lord avenel had found
it an easy matter to get inhabitants as he
was not only a kind and beneficent overlord
but well qualified both by his experience
in armes his high character for wisdom
and integrity and his favour with the powerful
earl murray to protect and defend
those who dwelt under his banner in leaving
his castle for any length time he
had therefore the consolation to reflect
that this village afforded on the slightest
notice a band thirty stout men which
was more than sufficient for its defence 
while the families the villagers as was
usual on such occasions fled to the recesses
 the mountains drove their cattle to the
 the abbot
same places shelter and left the enemy
to work their will on their miserable cottages

one guest only resided generally if not
constantly at the castle avenel this
was henry warden who now felt himself
less able to the stormy task imposed on the
reforming clergy and having by his zeal
given personal offence to many the leading
nobles and chiefs did not consider himself
as perfectly safe unless when within
the walls the strong mansion some assured
friend he ceased not however to
serve his cause as eagerly with his pen ashe
had formerly done with his tongue and
had engaged in a furious and acrimonious
contest concerning the sacrifice the
mass as it was termed with the abbot
eustatius formerly the subprior 
answers replies duchies trophies
quadruple followed thick upon each
other and displayed as is not unusual in
controversy fully as much zeal as christian
charity the disputation very soon bethe
abbot 
came as celebrated as that john knox
and the abbot corseraguel raged nearly
as fiercely and fraught i know the pieces
to which it gave rise may be as precious in
the eyes bibliographers but the engrossing
nature his occupation rendered
the theologian not the most interesting
companion for a solitary female and his
grave stern and absorbed deportment
which seldom shewed any interest except
in that which concerned his religious profession
made his presence rather add to
than diminish the gloom which hung over
the castle avenel to superintend the
tasks her numerous female domestics
was the principal part the lady's daily
employment her spindle and distaff her
bible and a solitary walk upon the battlements
 the castle or upon the causeway
or occasionally but more seldom upon the
banks the little lake consumed the rest
 th day but so great was the insecurity
 the period that when she ventured
a 
 the abbot
to extend her walk beyond the hamlet the
warder on the watchtower was directed to
keep a sharp outlook in every direction
and four or five men held themselves in
readiness to mount and sally forth from
the village at the slightest appearance 
alarm
thus stood affairs at the castle when
after an absence several weeks the
knight avenel which was now the title
most frequently given to sir halbert glendining
was daily expected to return home
day after day however passed away and
he returned not letters in those days were
rarely written and the knight must have
resorted to a secretary to express his intentions
in that manner besides intercourse
 all kinds was precarious and unsafe and
no man cared to give any public intimation
 the time and direction a journey since
it was always likely he might in that case
meet with more enemies than friends upon
the road the precise day therefore 
the abbot 
sir halbert's return was not fixed but that
which his lady's fond expectation had calculated
upon in her own mind was long
since passed and hope delayed began to
make the heart sick
it was upon the evening a sultry summer's
day when the sun was half sunk behind
the distant western mountains lauderdale
that the lady took her solitary
walk on the battlements a range 
buildings which formed the front the
castle where a flat roof flagstones presented
a broad and convenient promenade
the level surface the lake undisturbed
except by the occasional dipping a tealduck
or coot was gilded with the beams
 the setting luminary and reflected as if
in a golden mirror the hills amongst which
it lay embosomed the scene otherwise
so lonely was occasionally enlivened by
the voices the children in the village
which softened by distance reached the
ear the lady in her solitary walk or by
the distant call the herdsman as he
 the abbot
guided his cattle from the glen in which
they had pastured all day to place them
in greater security for the night in the
immediate vicinity the village the
deep lowing the cows seemed to demand
the attendance the milkmaidens
who singing shrilly and merrily strolled
forth each with her pail on her head to attend
to the duty the evening the lady
 avenel looked and listened the sounds
which she heard reminded her former
days when her most important employment
as well as her greatest delight was
to assist dame glendinning and tibi racket
in milking the cows at glendearg the
thought was fraught with melancholy
c why was i not she said the peasant
girl which in all men's eyes i seemed
to be halbert and i had then spent our
life peacefully in his native glen undisturbed
by the phantoms either fear or
 ambition his greatest pride had then
been to shew the fairest herd in the hali
dome his greatest danger to repel some
the abbot 
pilfering snatcher from the border and
the utmost distance which would have divided
us would have been the chase 
some outlying deer but alas what avails
the blood which halbert has shed and the
dangers which he encounters to support a
name and rank dear to him because he has
it from me but which we shall never transmit
to our posterity with me the name
 avenel must expire
she sighed as these reflections arose and
looking towards the shore the lake her
eye was attracted by a groupe children
 various ages assembled to see a little
ship constructed by some village artist perform
its first voyage on the water it was
launched amid the shouts tiny voices and
the clapping little hands and shot bravely
forth on its voyage with a favouring
wind which promised to carry it to the
other side the lake some the bigger
boys ran round to receive and secure it on
the farther shore trying their speed against
each other as they sprang like young fawns
j
 the abbot
along the shingly verge the lake the
rest for whom such a journey seemed too
arduous remained watching the motions 
the fairy vessel from the spot where it had
been launched the sight their sports
pressed on the mind the childless lady
 avenel
 why are none these prattlers mine 
she continued pursuing the tenor her
melancholy reflections their parents can
scarce find them in the coarsest food and
i who could nurse them in plenty i am
doomed never to hear a child call me mother

the thought sunk on her heart with a
bitterness which resembled envy so deeply
is the desire offspring implanted in the
female breast she pressed her hands together
as if she was wringing them in the
extremity her desolate feeling as one
whom heaven had written childless a
large staghound the greyhound species
approached at this moment and attracted
perhaps by the gesture licked her hands
the abbot 
and pressed his large head against them
he obtained the desired caress in return
but still the sad impression remained
wolf she said as if the animal could
have understood her complaints thou art
a noble and beautiful animal but alas i the
love and affection that i long to bestow is
 a quality higher than can fall to thy
share though i love thee much
and as if she were apologizing to wolf
for withholding from him any part her
regard she caressed his proud head and
crest while looking in her eyes he seemed
to ask her what she wanted or what he
could do to shew his attachment at this
moment a shriek distress was heard on
the shore from the playful groupe which
had been lately so jovial the lady looked
and saw the cause with great agony
the little ship the object the children's
delighted attention had stuck among
some tufts the plant which bears the laterally
that marked a little shoal in the
lake about an arrowflight from the shore
 the abbot
a hardy little boy who had taken the
lead in the race round the margin the
lake did not hesitate a moment to strip off
his wyliecoats plunge into the water and
swim towards the object their common
solicitude the first movement the lady
was to call for help but she observed that
the boy swam strongly and fearlessly and
as she saw that one or two villagers who
were distant spectators the incident
seemed to give themselves no uneasiness
on his account she supposed that he was
accustomed to the exercise and that there
was no danger but whether in swimming
the boy had struck his breast against a
sunken rock or whether he was suddenly
taken with the cramp or whether he had
overcalculated his own strength it so happened
that when he had disembarrassed
the little plaything from the flags in which
it was entangled and sent it forward on its
course he had scarce swam a few yards in
his way to the shore than he raised himself
suddenly from the water and screamed
the abbot 
aloud clapping his hands at the same time
with an expression fear and pain
the lady avenel instantly taking
the alarm called hastily to the attendants
to get the boat ready but this was an
affair some time the only boat permitted
to be used on the lake was moored
within the second cut which intersected the
canal and it was several minutes ere it could
be unmoored and got under way meantime
the lady avenel with agonizing
anxiety saw that the efforts which the poor
boy made to keep himself afloat were now
exchanged for a faint struggling which
would soon have been over but for aid
equally prompt and unhoped for wolf
who like some that large species 
a practised waterdog had marked
the object her anxiety and quitting
his mistress's side had sought the nearest
point from which he could with safety plunge
into the lake with the wonderful instinct
which these noble animals have so often displayed
in the like circumstances he swam
straight to the spot where his assistance was
 the abbot
so much wanted and seizing the child's 
in his mouth he not only kept him
afloat but towed him towards the causeway
the boat having put off with a couple
 men met the dog halfway and relieved
him his burthen they landed on the
causeway close by the entrance to the castle
with their yet lifeless burthen and were
met at the entrance the gate by the lady
 avenel attended by one or two her
maidens eagerly waiting to administer assistance
to the sufferer
he was borne into the castle deposited
upon a bed and every mode recovery resorted
to which the knowledge the times
and the skill henry warden who professed
some medical knowledge could dictate
for some time it was all in vain
and the lady watched with unspeakable
earnestness the pallid countenance the
beautiful child he seemed about ten years
old his dress was the meanest sort but
his long curled hair and the noble cast 
his features partook not that poverty
the abbor 
 appearance the proudest noble in scotland
might have been yet prouder could he
have called that child his heir while with
breathless anxiety the lady avenel gazed
on his wellformed and expressive features
a slight shade colour returned gradually
to the cheek suspended animation
became restored by degrees the child sighdeeply
opened his eyes which to the human
countenance produces the effect 
light upon the natural landscape stretched
his arms towards the lady and muttered
the word mother that epithet all
others which is dearest to the female ear
god madam said the preacher has
restored the child to your wishes it must
be yours so to bring him up that he may
not one day wish that he had perished in his
innocence
it shall be my charge said the lady 
and again throwing her arms around the
boy she overwhelmed him with kisses and
caresses so much was she agitated by the
terror arising from the danger in which he
 the abbot
had been just placed and by joy at his unexpected
deliverance
 eut you are not my mother said the
boy collecting his recollection and endeavouring
though faintly to escape from the
caresses the lady avenel you are
not my mother alas i have no mother 
only i have dreamt that i had one
i will read the dream for you my love
answered the lady avenel j and i will
be myself your mother surely god has
heard my wishes and in his own marvellous
manner hath sent me an object on which
my affections may expand themselves she
looked towards warden as she spoke the
preacher hesitated what he should reply
to a burst passionate feeling which perhaps
seemed to him more enthusiastic than
the occasion demanded in the meanwhile
the large staghound wolf which dropping
wet as he was had followed his mistress
into the apartment and had sate by
the bedside a patient and quiet spectator
 all the means used for resuscitation 
the abbot 
the being whom he had preserved now became
impatient remaining any longer
unnoticed and began to whine and fawn
upon the lady with his great rough paws
 yes she said good wolf and you
shall be remembered also for your day's
work and i will think the more you for
having preserved the life a creature so
beautiful
but wolf was not quite satisfied with the
share attention which he thus attracted 
he persisted in whining and pawing upon
his mistress his caresses being rendered still
more troublesome by his long shaggy hair
being so much and thoroughly wetted till
she desired one the domestics with whom
he was familiar to call the animal out the
apartment wolf resisted every invitation
to this purpose until his mistress positively
commanded him to begone in an angry
tone whenturningtowardsthebedon which
the boy still lay half awake to sensation
half drowned in the meanders a fluctuating
delirium he uttered a deep and savage
 the abbot
growl curled up his nose and lips shewing
his full range white and sharpened teeth
which might have matched those an actual
wolf and then turning round sullenly
followed the domestic out the apartment

sit is singular said the lady addressing
warden the animal is not only so goodnatured
to all but so particularly fond 
children what can ail him at the little fellow
whose life he has saved 
dogs replied the preacher are but
too like the human race in their foibles
though their instinct be less erring than the
reason poor mortal man when relying
upon his own unassisted powers jealousy
my good lady is a passion not unknown to
them and they often evince it not only
with respect to the preferences which they
see given by their masters to individuals 
their own species but even when their rivals
are children you have caressed that
child much and eagerly and the dog considers
himself as a discarded favourite
the abbot 
it is a strange instinct j said the lady
 and from the gravity with which you
mention it my reverend friend i would
almost say that you supposed this singular
jealousy my favourite wolf was not only
wellfounded but justifiable but perhaps
you speak in jest
 i seldom jest answered the preacher
 life was not lent to us to be expended in
that idle mirth which resembles the crackling
 thorns under the pot i would only
have you derive if it so please you this
lesson from what i have said that the best
 our feelings when indulged to excess
may give pain to others there is but one
in which we may indulge to the utmost
limit vehemence which our bosom is
capable secure that excess cannot exist
in the greatest intensity to which it can be
excited i mean the love our maker
 surely said the lady avenel weare
commanded by the same authority to
love our neighbour 
 the abbot
 ay madam said warden but our
love to god is to be unbounded we are to
love him with our whole heart our whole
soul and our whole strength the love
which the precept commands us to bear to
our neighbour has affixed to it a direct limit
and qualification we are to love our
neighbour as ourself as it is elsewhere explained
by the great commandment that
we do unto him as we would that he did
unto us here there is a limit and a bound
even to the most praiseworthy our affections
so far as they are turned upon
sublunary and terrestrial objects we are
to render to our neighbour whatever be
his rank or degree that corresponding portion
 affection with which we could rationally
expect we should ourselves be regarded
by those standing in the same degree
 relation to us hence neither
husband nor wife neither son nor daughter
neither friend nor relation are lawfully to
be made the objects our idolatry the
the abbot 
lord our god is a jealous god and will
not endure that we bestow on the creature
that extremity devotion which he who
made us demands as his own share i say
to you lady that even in the fairest and
purest and most honourable feelings our
nature there is that original taint sin
which ought to make us pause and hesitate
ere we indulge them to excess 
i understand not this reverend sir
said the lady nor do i guess what i can
have now said or done to draw down on
me an admonition which has something a
taste reproof
lady said warden i crave your
pardon if i have urged aught beyond the
limits my duty but consider whether
in the sacred promise to be not only a protectress
but a mother to this poor child
your purpose may meet the wishes the
noble knight your husband the fondness
which you have lavished on the unfortunate
and i own most lovely child
vol i b
 the abbot
has met something like a reproof in the
bearing your household dog displease
not your noble husband men as well as
animals are jealous the affections those
they love
this is too much reverend sir said
theladyof avenel greatly offended you
have been long our guest and have received
from the knight avenel and myself
that honour and regard which your character
and profession so justly demand
eut i am yet to learn that i have at anytime
authorized your interference in our
family arrangements or placed you as a
judge our conduct towards each other
i pray this may be forborne in future
 lady replied the preacher with the
boldness peculiar to the clergy his persuasion
at that time when you weary 
my admonitions when i see that my services
are no longer acceptable to you and
the noble knight your husband i shall
know that my master wills me no longer
to abide here j and praying for a continuthe

ance his best blessings on your family i
will then were the season the depth 
winter and the hour midnight walk out on

waste mountains as lonely and unaided
though far more helpless than when first
met your husband in the valley glendear
but while i remain here i will not
see you err from the true path no not an
hair'sbreadth without making the old man's
voice and remonstrance heard
 nay but said the lady who both
loved and respected the good man though
sometimes a little offended at what she
conceived to be an exuberant degree 
zeal we will not part this way my good
friend women are quick and hasty in
their feelings but believe me my wishes
and my purposes towards this child are
such as both my husband and you will approve
 the clergyman bowed and retreated
to his own apartment

when warden had left the apartment the
lady avenel gave way to the feelings 
tenderness which the sight the boy his
sudden danger and his recent escape had
inspired and no longer awed by the sternness
as she deemed it the preacher heaped
with caresses the lovely and interesting
child he was now in some measure recovered
from the consequences his accident
and received passively though not
without wonder the tokens kindness
with which he was thus loaded the face
the abbot 
 the lady was strange to him and her
dress different and far more sumptuous than
any he remembered but the boy was naturally
 an undaunted temper and indeed
children are generally acute physiognomists
and not only pleased by that which is
beautiful in itself but peculiarly acute in
distinguishing and replying to the attentions
 those who really love them if
they see a person in company though a
perfect stranger who is by nature fond 
children the little imps seem to discover it
by a sort freemasonry while the awkward
attempts those who make advances
to them for the purpose recommending
themselves to the parents usually fail in
attracting their reciprocal attention the
little boy therefore appeared in some degree
sensible the lady's caresses and it
was with difficulty she withdrew herself
from his pillow to afford him leisure for
necessary repose
to whom belongs our little rescued varro
the abbot
let was the first question which the lady
 avenel put to her handmaiden liiias
when they had retired to the hall
to an old woman in the hamlet said
liiias who is even now come so far as
the porter's lodge to enquire concerning
his safety is it your pleasure that she be
admitted 
is it my pleasure said the lady 
avenel echoing the question with a strong
accent displeasure and surprise can
you make any doubt it what woman
but must pity the agony the mother
whose heart is throbbing for the safety 
a child so lovely
 nay but madam said liiias this
woman is too old to be the mother the
child i rather think she must be his grand
mother or some more distant relation
be she who she will liiias replied
the lady she must have a sore heart
while the safety a creature so lovely is
uncertain go instantly and bring her hithe
abbot 
ther besides i would willingly learn something
concerning his birth
lilias left the hall and presently afterwards
returned ushering in a tall female
very poorly dressed yet with more pretension
to decency and cleanliness than was
usually combined with such coarse garments
the lady avenel knew her figure
the instant she presented herself it
was the fashion the family that upon
every sabbath and on two evenings in the
week besides henry warden preached or
lectured in the chapel the castle the
extension the protestant faith was upon
principle as well as in good policy a primary
object with the knight avenel
the inhabitants the village were therefore
invited to attend upon the instructions
 henry warden and many them were
speedily won to the doctrine which their
master and protector approved these sermons
homilies and lectures had made a
great impression on the mind the abbot
 the abbot
eustace or eustatius and were a sufficient
spur to the severity and sharpness his
controversy with his old fellow collegiate 
and he more than once threatened to levy
his vassals and assail and level with the earth
that strong hold heresy the castle 
but notwithstanding his impotent resentment
and notwithstanding also the disinclination
 the country to favour the new
religion henry warden proceeded without
remission in his labours and made weekly
converts from the faith rome to that 
the reformed church amongst those who
gave most earnest and constant attendance
on his ministry was the aged woman whose
form too tall and otherwise too remarkable
to be forgotten the lady had late remarked
frequently as being conspicuous
amongst the little audience she had indeed
more than once desired to know who
that tall statelylooking woman was whose
appearance was so much above the poverty
 her vestments but the reply had althe
abbot 
ways been that she was an english woman
who was tarrying for a season at the hamlet
and that no one knew more concerning
her she now asked her after her name
and birth
magdalen graeme is my name said the
woman i come the grammes head
in nicolforest a people ancient
blood
and what make you continued the
lady so far distant from your home 
i have no home said magdalen grime
it was burnt by your borderriders my
husband and my son were slain there is
not a drop's blood left in the veins anyone
which is kin to mine
 that is no uncommon fate in these wild
times and in this unsettled land said the
lady the english hands have been as
deeply dyed in our blood as ever those 
scotsmen have been in yours
you have right to say it lady answered
magdalen graeme for men tell
 a time when this castle was not strong
b 
 the abbot
enough to save your father's life or to afford
your mother and her infant a place 
refuge and why ask ye me then wherefore
i dwell not in mine own home and
with my own people 
it was indeed an idle question where
misery so often makes wanderers butchered
take refuge in a hostile country 
my neighbours were popish and massinger
said the old woman it has
pleased heaven to give me a clearer sight
 the gospel and i have tarried here to
enjoy the ministry that worthy man henry
warden who to the praise and comfort
 many teacheth the evangel in truth and
in sincerity
 are you poor again demanded the
lady avenel
you hear me ask alms no one answered
the englishwoman
here there was a pause the manner 
the woman was if not disrespectful at least
much less than gracious and she appeared
to give no encouragement to farther comthe
abbot s
medication the lady avenel renewed
the conversation on a different topic
you have heard the danger in which
your boy has been placed 
 i have lady and how by an especial
providence he was rescued from death may
heaven make him thankful and me 
 what relation do you bear to him 
 i am his grandmother lady if it so
please you the only relation he hath left
upon earth to take charge him
the burthen his maintenance must
necessarily be grievous to you in your deserted
situation pursued the lady
i have complained it to no one
said magdalen graeme with the same unmoved
dry and unconcerned tone voice
in which she had answered all the former
questions
 if said the lady avenel your
grandchild could be received into a noble
family would it not advantage both him
and you 
 the abbot
 received into a noble family said
the old woman drawing herself up and
bending her brows until her forehead
was wrinkled into a frown unusual severity
 and for what purpose i pray
you to be my lady's page or my lord's
jackman to eat broken victuals and contend
with other menials for the remnants
 the master's meal would you have
him to fan the flies from my lady's face
while she sleeps to carry her train while
she walks to hand her trencher when she
feeds to ride before her on horseback to
valk after her on foot to sing when she
lists and to be silent when she bids a very
weathercock which though furnished in
appearance with wings and plumage cannot
soar into the air cannot fly from the
spot where it is perched but receives all its
impulses and performs all its revolutions
obedient to the changeful breath a vain
woman when the eagle helvellyn
perches on the tower lanercost and
turns and changes to shew how the wind
the abbor 
sits roland grasme shall be what you would
make him
the woman spoke with a rapidity and
vehemence which seemed to have in it a
touch insanity and a sudden sense the
danger to which the child must necessarily
be exposed in the charge such a keeper
increased the lady's desire to keep him in
the castle if possible
 you mistake me dame she said addressing
the old woman in a soothing manner
 i do not wish your boy to be in attendance
on myself but upon the good
knight my husband were he himself the
son a belted earl he could not better
be trained to arms and all that befits a gentleman
than by the instructions and discipline
 sir halbert glendinning
 ay answered the old woman in the
same style bitter irony i know the
wages that service a curse when the
corslet is not sufficiently brightened a
blow when the girth is not tightly drawn
to be beaten because the hounds are at fault
 the abbot
to be reviled because the foray is unsuccessful
 to stain his hands for the master's
bidding in the blood alike beast and
 man to be a butcher harmless deer
a murderer and deface god's own image
not at his own pleasure but at that his
lord to live a brawling ruffian and a common
stabber exposed to heat to cold to
want food to all the privations an anchoret
not for the love god but for
the service satan to die by the gibbet
or in some obscure skirmish to sleep out
his life in carnal security and to awake in
the eternal fire which is never quenched
nay said the lady avenel but
to such unhallowed course life your
grandson will not be here exposed my
husband is just and kind to those who live
under his banner and you yourself well
know that youth have here a strict as well
as a good preceptor in the person our
chaplain
the old woman appeared to pause
you have named she said the onthe
abbot 
ly circumstance which can move me i
must soon onward the vision has said it 
i must not tarry in the same spot i must
on i must on it is my weird swear then
that you will protect the boy as if he were
your own until i return hither and claim
him and i will consent for a space to part
with him but especially swear he shall
not lack the instruction the godly man
who hath placed the gospeltruth high
above these idolatrous shavings the
monks and friars
be satisfied dame said the lady 
avenel j the boy shall have as much care
as if he were born my own blood will
you see him now 
no answered the old woman sternly
 to part is enough i go forth on
my own mission i will not soften my
heart by useless tears and failings as one
that is not called to a duty
will you not accept something to
aid you in your pilgrimage said the lady
 avenel putting into her hand two
 the abbot
crowns the sun the old woman flung
them down on the table
 am i the race cain she said
 proud lady that you offer me gold in
exchange for my own flesh and blood 
 i had no such meaning said the lady
gently nor am i the proud woman you
term me alas my own fortunes might
have taught me humility even had it not
been born with me
the old woman seemed somewhat to
relax her tone severity
you are gentle blood she said
 else we had not parleyed thus long together
 you are gentle blood and to
such she added drawing up her tall form
as she spoke pride is as graceful as is
the plume upon the bonnet but for these
pieces gold lady you must needs resume
them i need not money i am
well provided and i may not care for myself
nor think how or by whom i shall be
sustained farewell and keep your word
the abbot 
cause your gates to be opened and your
bridges to be lowered i will set forward
this very night when i come again i
will demand from you a strict account for
 have left with you the jewel my life i
sleep will visit me but in snatches food
will not refresh me rest will not restore my
strength until i see roland grseme once
more farewell
make your obeisance dame said
lilias to magdalen graeme as she retired
make your obeisance to her ladyship
and thank her for her goodness as is but
fitting and right
the old woman turned short round on
the officious waitingmaid let her make
her obeisance to me then and i will return
it why should i bend to her is it
because her kirtle is silk and mine 
blue lockers go to my lady's waitingwoman
know that the rank the man
rates that the wife and that she who
marries a churl's son were she a king's
daughter is but a peasant's bride
 the abbot
lilias was about to reply in great indignation
but her mistress imposed silence on
her and commanded that the old woman
should be safely conducted to the mainland

 conduct her safe exclaimed the incensed
waitingwoman while magdalen
graeme left the apartment i say duck
her in the loch and then we will see
whether she is witch or not as every body in
the village lochside will say and swear
i marvel your ladyship could bear so long
with her insolence but the commands
 the lady were obeyed and the old dame
dismissed from the castle was committed
to her fortune she kept her word and
did not long abide in that place leaving
the hamlet on the very night succeeding
the interview and wandering no one
asked whither the lady avenel enquired
under what circumstances she had
appeared among them but could only learn
that she was believed to be the widow
 some man consequence among the
the abbot 
grammes who then inhabited the debateable
land a name given to a certain portion
 territory which was the frequent
subject dispute betwixt scotland and
england that she had suffered great wrong
in some the frequent forays by which
that unfortunate district was wasted and
had been driven from her dwelling place
she had arrived in the hamlet no one knew
for what purpose and was held by some to
be a witch by others a catholic devotee
her language was mysterious and her
manners repulsive and all that could be
collected from her conversation seemed to
imply that she was under the influence
either a spell or a vow there was
no saying which since she talked as one
who acted under a powerful and external
agency
such were the particulars which the
lady's enquiries were able to collect concerning
magdalen graeme being far too
meagre to authorise any satisfactory deduction
in truth the miseries the time
 the abbot
and the various turns fate incidental to
a frontier country were perpetually chasing
from their habitations those who had not
the means defence or protection these
wanderers in the land were too often seen
to excite much attention or sympathy
they received the cold relief which was
extorted by general feelings humanity j a
little excited in some breasts and perhaps
rather chilled in others by the recollection
that they who gave the charity today might
themselves want it tomorrow magdalen
graeme therefore came and departed like
a shadow from the neighbourhood 
castle
the boy whom providence as she thought
had thus strangely placed under her care
was at once established a favourite with
the lady the castle how could it be
otherwise he became the object those
affectionate feelings which finding formerly
no object on which to expand themselves
had encreased the gloom the
the abbot 
castle and embittered the solitude its
mistress to teach him as far as her skill
went to attend to his childish comforts to
watch his boyish sports became the lady's
favourite amusement in her circumstances
where the ear only heard the lowing
 the cattle from the distant hills or
the heavy step the warder as he walked
upon his post or the half envied laugh
 her maiden as she turned her wheel the
appearance the blooming and beautiful
boy gave an interest which can hardly be
conceived by those who live amid gayer
or busier scenes young roland was to
the lady avenel what the flower which
occupies the window some solitary captive
is to the poor wight by whom it is
nursed and cultivated something which
at once excited and repaid her care and in
giving the boy her affection she felt as it
were grateful to him for releasing her from
the state dull apathy in which she had
usually found herself during the absence 
sir halbert glendinning
 the abbot
but even the charms this blooming
favourite were unable to chase the recurring
apprehensions which arose from her
husband's delayed return soon after roland
graeme became a resident at the
castle a groom dispatched by sir albert
brought tidings that business importance
still delayed the knight at the
court holyrood the more distant period
which the messenger had assigned for
his master's arrival at length glided away
summer melted into autumn and autumn
was about to give place to winter and yet
he came not
the abbot 
chapter iii
the waning harvestmoon shone broad and bright
the warder's horn was heard at dead night
and while the folding portals wide were flung
with tramping hoofs the rocky pavement rung
leyden
and you too would be a soldier roland
said the lady avenel to her
young charge while seated on a stone
chair at one the battlements she
saw the boy attempt with a long stick to
mimic the motions the warder as he alternately
shouldered or ported or sloped
pike
yes lady said the boy for he was
now familiar and replied to her questions
with readiness and alacrity a soldier will
i be for there ne'er was gentleman but
who belled him with the brand
 the abbot
 thou a gentleman said lilias who
as usual was in attendance such a
gentleman as i would make a bean cod
with a rusty knife
nay chide him not lilias said the
lady avenel for beshrew me but i
think he comes gentle blood see how
it musters in his face at your injurious reproofs

had i my will madam answered lilies
 a good birchen wand should make
his colour muster to better purpose still
on my word lilias said the lady
one would think you had received harm
from the poor boy or is he so far on the
frosty side your favour because he enjoys
the sunny side mine 
over heavens forbode my lady answered
lilias i have lived too long
with gentles i praise my stars for it to
fight with either follies or fantasies whether
they elate to beast bird or boy
lilias was a favourite in her own class
a spoiled domestic who was often accusthe
abbot 
toned to take more license than her mistress
was at all times willing to encourage
but what did not please the lady 
she did not chuse to hear and thus it
was on the present occasion she resolved
to look more close and sharply after the boy
who had hitherto been committed chiefly
to the management lilias he must she
thought be born gentle blood it were
shame to think otherwise a form so noble
and features so fair the very wildness
in which he occasionally indulged his contempt
 danger and impatience restraint
had in them something noble assuredly
the child was born high rank such
was her conclusion and she acted upon it
accordingly the domestics around her
less jealous or less scrupulous than lilias
acted as servants usually do following the
bias and flattering for their own purposes
the humour the lady and the boy soon
took on him those airs superiority which
the sight habitual deference seldom fails
vol i c
 the abbot
to inspire it seemed in truth as if to
command were his natural sphere so easily
did he use himself to exact and receive
compliance with his humours the chaplain
indeed might have interposed to
check the air superiority which roland
greene so readily indulged and most probably
would have willingly rendered him
that favour but the necessity adjusting
with his brethren some disputed points 
church discipline had withdrawn him for
some time from the castle and detained
him in a distant part the kingdom
matters stood thus in the castle 
when a winded bugle sent its shrill
and prolonged notes from the shore the
lake and was replied to cheerily by the
signal the warder the lady 
knew the sounds her husband and
rushed to the window the apartment in
which she was sitting a band about
thirty spearmen with a pennon displayed
before them winded along the indented
shores the lake and approached the
the abbot 
causeway a single horseman rode at the
head the party his bright arms catching
a glance the october sun as he moved
steadily along even at that distance the
lady recognized the lofty plume bearing
the mingled colours her own liveries
blended with the hollybranch and the
firm seat and dignified demeanour the
rider joined to the stately motion the
darkbrown steed sufficiently announced
halbert glendinning
the lady's first thought was that rapturous
joy at her husband's return her second
was connected with a fear which had
sometimes intruded itself that he might
not altogether approve the peculiar distinction
with which she had treated her orphan
ward in this fear there was implied
a consciousness that the favour she had
shewn him was excessive for halbert glendining
was at least as gentle and indulgent
as he was firm and rational in the intercourse
 his household and to her in
 the abbot
particular his conduct had ever been most
affectionately tender
yet she did fear that on the present occasion
her conduct might incur sir albert's
censure and hastily resolving that
she would not mention the anecdote the
boy until the next day she ordered him to
be withdrawn from the apartment by lilies

 i will not go with lilias madam answered
the spoiled child who had more
than once carried his point by perseverance
and who like his betters delighted in the
exercise such authority i will not
go to lilias's gouty room i will stay and
see that brave warrior who comes riding so
gallantly along the drawbridge
 you must not stay roland said the
lady more positively than she usually spoke
to her little favourite
 i will reiterated the boy who had
already felt his consequence and the probable
chance success
the abbot 
you will roland answered the lady
what manner word is that i tell you
you must go
wil answered the forward boy is
a word for a man and must is no word fora
lady
you are saucy sirrah said the lady 
lilias take him with you instantly
i always thought said lilias smiling
as she seized the reluctant boy by the arm
that my young master must give place to
my old one
and you too are malapert mistress
said the lady j hath the moon changed
that ye all you thus forget yourselves 
lilias made no reply but led off the boy
who too proud to offer unavailing resistance
darted at his benefactress a glance
which intimated plainly how willingly he
would have defied her authority had he possessed
the power to make good his point
the lady avenel was vexed to find
how much this trifling circumstance had
discomposed her at the moment when she
 the abbot
ought naturally to have been entirely engrossed
by her husband's return but we
do not recover composure by the mere
feeling that agitation is mistimed the
glow displeasure had not left the lady's
cheek her ruffled deportment was not yet
entirely composed when her husband unhelmet
but still wearing the rest his
arms entered the apartment his appearance
banished the thoughts every thing
else she rushed to him clasped his ironsheathed
frame in her arms and kissed his
martial and manly face with an affection
which was at once evident and sincere
the warrior returned her embrace and her
caress with the same fondness for the time
which had passed since their union had diminished
its romantic ardour perhaps but
had rather increased its rational tenderness
and sir halbert glendinning's long and frequent
absences from his castle had prevented
affection from degenerating into indifference

when the first eager greetings were paid
the abbot 
and received the lady gazed fondly on her
husband's face as she remarked
 you are altered halbert you have ridden
hard and far today or you have been
ill
 i have been well mary answered the
knight passing well have i been and a
long ride is to me thou well knowest but a
thing constant custom those who are
born noble may slumber out their lives within
the walls their castles and manorhouses 
but he who hath achieved nobility by his
own deeds must ever be in the saddle to
shew that he merits his advancement
while he spoke thus the lady gazed fondly
on him as if endeavouring to read his
inmost soul for the tone in which he spoke
was that melancholy depression
sir halbert glendinning was the same
yet a different person from what he had appeared
in his early years the fiery freedom
 the aspiring youth had given place
to the steady and stern composure the
approved soldier and skilful politician
 ihe abbot
there were deep traces care on those
noble features over which each emotion
used formerly lo pass like light clouds
across a summer sky that sky was now
not perhaps clouded but still and grave
like that the sober autumn evening the
forehead was higher and more bare than in
early youth and the locks which still clustered
thick and dark on the warrior's head
were worn away at the temples not by age
but by the constant pressure the steel
cap or helmet his beard according to
the fashion the times grew short and
thick and was turned into mustachios on
the upper lip and peaked at the extremity
the cheek weatherbeaten and embroiled
had lost the glow youth but shewed
the vigorous complexion active and confirmed
manhood halbert glendinning was
in a word a knight to ride at a king's
right hand to bear his banner in war and
to be his counsellor in time peace for
his looks expressed the considerate firmness
which can resolve wisely and dare boldly
the abbot 
still over these noble features there now
spread an air dejection which perhaps
the owner was not conscious but
which did not escape the observation his
anxious and affectionate partner
 something has happened or is about
to happen said the lady avenel this
sadness sits not on your brow without cause
misfortune national or particular must
needs be at hand
 there is nothing new that i wot 
said halbert glendinning j but there is
little evil which can befall a kingdom
which may not be apprehended in this unhappy
and divided realm
 nay then said the lady i see there
hath really been some fatal work on foot
my lord murray has not so long detained
you at holyrood save that he wanted
your help in some weighty purpose
i have not been at holyrood mary
answered the knight j i have been several
weeks abroad
c 
 the abbot
abroad and sent me no word replied
the lady
what would the knowledge have availed
but to have rendered you unhappy my
love replied the knight your thoughts
would have converted the slightest breeze
that curled your own lake into a tempest
raging in the german ocean
and have you then really crossed the
sea said the lady to whom that idea
conveyed notions terror and wonder j
really left your own native land and
trodden distant shores where the scottish
tongue is unheard and unknown 
really and really said the knight
taking her hand in affectionate playfulness
i have done this marvellous deed have
rolled on the ocean for three days and
three nights with the deep green waves
dashing by the side my pillow and buta
thin plank to divide me from it
indeed my halbert said the lady
 that was a tempting divine province
abbot 
hence i never bade you unbuckle the
sword from your side or lay the lance from
your hand i never bade you sit when
your honour called to rise but are not
blade and spear dangerous enough to one
man's life and why would you trust rough
waves and raging seas 
we have in germany and in the low
countries as they are called answered
glendinning men who are united with
us in faith and with whom it is fitting we
should unite in alliance to some these
i was dispatched on business as important
as it was secret went in safety and i
returned in security there is more danger
to a man's life betwixt this and holyrood
than are in all the seas that wash the lowlands
 holland
and the country my halbert and
the people said the lady are they like
our kindly scots or what bearing have they
to strangers 
 they are a people mary strong in
their wealth which renders all other nato
the abbot
tions weak and weak in those arts war
by which other nations are strong
 i do not understand you said the
lady
the hollander and the fleming mary
pour forth their spirit in trade and not in
war their wealth purchases them the arms
 foreign soldiers by whose aid they defend
it they erect dykes on the sea shore
to protect the land which they have won
and they levy regiments the stubborn
sitters and hardy germans to protect the
treasures which they have amassed and
thus they are strong in their weakness for
the very wealth which tempts their masters
to despoil them arms strangers in their
behalf
the slothful hinds exclaimed mary
thinking and feeling like a scotswoman 
the period have they hands and fight
not for the land which bore them they
should be notched off at the elbow
nay that were but hard justice answered
her husband for their hands
the abbot 
serve their country though not in battle
like ours look at these barren hills mary
and at that deep winding vale by which the
cattle are even now returning from their
scanty browse the hand the industrious
fleming would cover these mountains
with wood and raise corn where we now
see a starved and scanty sward heath
and ling it grieves me mary when i
look on that land and think what benefit
it might receive from such men as i have
lately seen men who seek not the idle
fame derived from dead ancestors or the
bloody renown won in modern broils but
tread along the land as preservers and improvers
not as tyrants and destroyers
 these amendments would be but a
vain fancy my halbert answered the lady
 avenel the trees would be burned
by the english foemen ere they ceased to
be shrubs and the grain that you raised
would be gathered in by the first neighbour
that possessed more riders than follow your
train why should you repine at this the
 the abbot
fate that made you scotsman by birth gave
you head and heart and hand to uphold
the name as it must needs be upheld
 it gave ene no name to uphold said
halbert pacing the floor slowly my arm
has been foremost in every strife my voice
has been heard in every council nor have
the wisest rebuked me the crafty lexington
the deep and dark morton have
held secret council with me and grange
and lindsay have owned that in the field i
did the devoir a gallant knight but let
the emergence be passed when they need
my head and hand and they only know meas
son the obscure portioner glendear

this was a theme which the lady always
dreaded for the rank conferred on her husband
the favour in which he was held by
the powerful earl murray and the high
talents by which he vindicated his right to
that rank and that favour were qualities
which rather encreased than diminished the
envy which was harboured against sir halthe
abbot 
bert glendinning as a person originally 
inferior and obscure birth who had risen to
his present eminence solely by his personal
merit the natural firmness his mind
did not enable him to despise the ideal advantages
 a high pedigree which were
held in such universal esteem by all with
whom he conversed and so open are the
noblest minds to jealous inconsistencies
that there were moments in which he felt
mortified that his lady should possess those
advantages birth and high descent which
he himself did not enjoy and regretted that
his importance as the proprietor avenel
was qualified by his possessing it only as
the husband the heiress he was not so
unjust as to permit any unworthy feelings
to retain permanent possession his mind
but yet they recurred from time to time
and did not escape his lady's anxious observation

 had we been blessed with children
she was wont on such occasions to say to
herself had our blood been united in a
f the abbot

son who might have joined my advantages
 descent with my husband's personal
worth these painful and irksome reflections
had not disturbed our union even fora
moment but the existence such an
heir in idiom our affections as well as our
pretensions might have centered has been
denied to us
with such mutual feelings it cannot be
wondered at that the lady heard her husband
with pain verging towards this topic
 mutual discontent on the present as
on other similar occasions she endeavoured
to divert her husband's thoughts from
this painful channel
 how can you she said suffer yourself
to dwell upon thoughts which profit nothing
 have you indeed no name to uphold
 you the good and the brave the
wise in council and the strong in battle
have you not to support the reputation your
own deeds have won a reputation more honourable
than mere ancestry can supply 
good men love and honour you the wickthe
abbot 
ed fear and the turbulent obey you and is
it not necessary you should exert yourself
to ensure the endurance that love that
honour that wholesome fear and that necessary
obedience 
as she thus spoke the eye her husband
caught from her's courage and comfort
and it lightened as he took her hand
and replied 
the abbot 
grasme the prejudices wolf were easily
overcome and in process time the dog
slept with bran loath and the celebrated
hounds ancient days but mr warden
the chaplain lived and retained his dislike
to the youth that good man singleminded
and benevolent as he really was entertained
rather more than a reasonable idea 
the respect due to him as a minister and
exacted from the inhabitants the castle
more deference than the haughty young
page proud his mistress's favour and
petulant from youth and situation was at
all times willing to pay his bold and free
demeanour his attachment to rich dress
and decoration his inaptitude to receive
instruction and his hardening himself
against rebuke were circumstances which
induced the good old man with more
haste than charity to set the forward page
down as a vessel wrath and to presage
that the youth nursed that pride and
haughtiness spirit which goes before
ruin and destruction most the attends
the abbot
ants and followers sir halbert glendining
entertained the same charitable
thought but while roland was favoured
by their lady and endured by their lord
they saw no policy in making their opinions
public
koland grasme was sufficiently sensible
 the unpleasant situation in which he
stood but in the haughtiness his heart
he retorted upon the other domestics the
distant cold and sarcastic manner in which
they treated him assumed an air superiority
which compelled the most obstinate
to obedience and had the satisfaction to
be dreaded at least if he was heartily hated

the chaplain's marked dislike had the
effect recommending him to the attention
 sir halbert's brother edward who
now under the conventual appellation 
father ambrose continued to be one 
the few monks who with the abbot eustathius
were still permitted to linger in the
cloisters at kennaquhair respect to sir
the abbot 
halbert had prevented their being altogether
driven out the abbey though their
order was now in a great measure suppressed
and they were interdicted the public
exercise their ritual and only allowed
for their support a small pension out
 their once splendid revenues father
ambrose thus situated was an occasional
though very rare visitant at the castle 
avenel and was at such times observed to
pay particular attention to roland graeme
who seemed to return it with more depth
 feeling than consisted with his usual habits

thus situated years glided on during
which the knight avenel continued to
act a frequent and important part in the
convulsions his distracted country while
young graeme anticipated both in wishes
and in personal accomplishments the age
which should enable him to emerge from
the obscurity his present situation
d 
 the abbot
chapter 
amid their cups that freely flow'd
their revelry and mirth
a youthful lord taxed valentine
with hase and doubtful birth
valentine and arson
when roland greene was a youth about
seventeen years age he chanced one
summer morning to descend to the mew in
which sir halbert glendinning kept his
hawks in order to superintend the training
 an eyass or young hawk which he himself
at the imminent risk neck and
limbs had taken from a celebrated eyrie
in the neighbourhood called gledscraig
as he was by no means satisfied with the
attention which had been bestowed on his
favourite bird he was not slack in testifythe
abbot 
ing his displeasure to the falconer's lad
whose duty it was to have attended upon
it
what ho sir knave exclaimed roland
 is it thus you feed the eyasse with
unwashed meat as if you were gorging the
foul branches a worthless hodie crow
by the mass and thou hast neglected its
castings also for these two days thinks
thou i ventured my neck to bring the bird
down from the craig that thou shouldst
spoil him by thy neglect and to add
force to his remonstrances he conferred a
cuff or two on the negligent attendant 
the hawks who shouting rather louder than
was necessary under all the circumstances
brought the master falconer to his assistance

adam woodcock the falconer avenet
was an englishman by birth but so
long in the service glendinning that he
had lost his national attachment in that 
which he had formed to his master he
 the abbot
was a favourite in his department jealous
and conceited his skill as masters the
game usually are for the rest his character
he was a jester and a parcel poet qualities
which by no means abated his natural
conceit a jolly fellow who loved a flagon
 ale better than a long sermon a stout
man his hands when need required true
to his master and a little presuming on his
interest with him
adam woodcock such as we have described
him by no means relished the freedom
used by young grime in chastising
his assistant hey hey my lady's page
said he stepping between his own boy and
roland fair and softly an it like your
gilt jacket hands off is fair play if my
boy has done amiss i can beat him myself
and then you may keep your hands soft
 i will beat him and thee too answered
roland without hesitation an you
look not better after your business see
how the bird is cast away between you
the abbot 
i found the careless lurdane feeding him
with unwashed flesh and she an eyass
 go to said the falconer thou art
but an eyass thyself child roland what
knowest thou feeding i say that the
eyass should have her meat unwashed until
she becomes a branches twere the ready
way to give her the trounce to wash her
meat sooner and so knows every one who
knows a gled from a falcon
it is thine own laziness thou false
english blood that doest nothing but drink
and sleep retorted the page and leaves
that lither lad to do the work that he minds
as little as thou
 and am i so idle then said the falconer
 that have three cast hawks to
look after at perch and mew and to fly
them in the field to boot and is my lady's
page so busy a man that he must take me
up short and am i a false english blood 
there is a difference amongst authorities how long the
nesting hawk should he fed with flesh which has previously
been washed
 the abbot
i marvel what blood thou art neither
englander nor scot fish nor flesh a bastard
from the debateable land without
either kith kin or ally marry out upon
thee foul kite that would fain be a tercel
gentle
the reply to this sarcasm was a box on
the ear so well applied that it overthrew
the falconer into the cistern in which water
was kept for the benefit the hawks up
started adam woodcock and seizing on a
truncheon which stood by would have soon
requited the injury he had received had not
roland laid his hand on his poniard and
sworn by all that was sacred that if he
offered a stroke towards him he would
sheath it in his bowels the noise was now
so great that more than one the houscr j
hold came in and amongst others the 
a grave personage already mentioned
whose gold chain and white wand
intimated his authority at the appearance
 this dignitary the strife was for the
present appeased he embraced however
the abbot 
so favourable an opportunity to read roland
grseme a shrewd lecture on the impropriety
 his deportment to his fellowmenials
and to assure him that should he
communicate this fray to his master who
though now on one his frequent expeditions
was speedily expected to return
which but for respect to his lady he would
most certainly do the residence the
culprit in the castle avenel would be
but brief duration but however
added the prudent master the household
 i will report the matter first to my lady
very just very right master wingate
exclaimed several voices together my
lady will consider if daggers are to be
drawn on us for every idle word and whether
we are to live in a wellordered household
where there is the fear god or
amongst drawn dirks and sharp knives
the object this general resentment
darted an angry glance around him and
suppressing with difficulty the desire which
urged him to reply in furious or in cons
the abbot
temp tous language returned his dagger into
the scabbard looked disdainfully around
upon the assembled menials turned short
upon his heel and pushing aside those who
stood betwixt him and the door left the
apartment
 this will be no tree for my nest said
the falconer if this cocksparrow is to
crow over us as he seems to do
he struck me with his switch yesterday
said one the grooms because
the tail his worship's gelding was not
trimmed altogether so as suited his humour

 and i promise you said the laundress
 my young master will stick nothing
to call you slut and quean if there
be but a speck soot upon his bandcollar

 if master wingate do not his errand
to my lady was the general result there
will be no tarrying in the same house with
koland graeme
the master the household heard them
the abbot 
all for some time and then motioning for
universal silence he addressed them with all
the dignity malvolio himself my masters
 not forgetting you my mistresses
do not think the worse me that i proceed
with as much care as haste in this
matter our master is a gallant knight
and will have his sway at home and abroad
in wood and field in hall and bower as the
saying is our lady my benison upon her
is also a noble person long descent and
rightful heir this place and barony and
she also loves her will as for that matter
shew me the woman who doth not now
she hath favoured doth favour and will favour
thisjackanape for what good part
about him i know not save that as one
noble lady will love a messan dog and another
a screaming popinjay and a third a
barbary ape so doth it please our noble
dame to set her affections upon this stray
elf a page for nought that i can think
off save that she was the cause his being
 the abbot
saved the more's the pity from drowning
and here master wingate made a
pause
i would have been his caution for a
grey groat against salt water or fresh said
his adversary the falconer marry if he
crack not a rope for stabbing or for snatching
i will be content never to hood hawk
again
peace adam woodcock said wingate
waving his hand i prithee peace
man snow my lady liking this springald
as aforesaid differs therein from my lord
whp likes never a bone in his skin now
is it for me to stir up strife betwixt them
and put as twere my finger betwixt the
bark and the tree on account a pragmatical
youngster whom nevertheless i
would willingly see whipped forth the
barony have patience and this boil will
break without our meddling i have been
in service since i wore a beard on my chin
till now that that beard is turned grey
and i have seldom known any one better
the abbot 
themselves even by taking the lady's part
against the lord's but never one who did
not dirk himself if he took the lord's
against the lady's
 and so said lilias we are to be
crowed over every one us men and
women cock and hen by this little upstart
 i will try titles with him first i promise
you i fancy master wingate for
as wise as you look you will be pleased to
tell what you have seen today if my lady
commands you
 to speak the truth when my lady
commands me answered the prudential
majordomo is in some measure my
duty mistress lilias always providing for
and excepting those cases in which it cannot
be spoken without breeding mischief
and inconvenience to myself or my fellowservants
 for the tongue a talebearer
breaketh bones as well as a jeddart staif
but this imp satan is none your
friends or fellowservants said lilias
 the abbor
 and i trust you mean not to stand up for
him against the whole family besides 
 credit me mrs lilias replied the
senior should i see the time fitting i
would with right good will give him a lick
with the rough side my tongue
 enough said master wingate answered
lilias then trust me his song
shall soon be laid if my mistress does not
ask me what is the matter below stairs before
she be ten minutes time older she
is no born woman and my name is not
lilias bradbourne
in pursuance her plan mistress lilies
failed not to present herself before her
mistress with all the exterior one who
is possessed an important secret that
is she had the corner her mouth turned
down her eyes raised up her lips pressed
as fast together as if they had been sewed
up to prevent her blabbing and an air 
prim mystical importance diffused over her
whole person and demeanour which seemthe
abbot 
ed to intimate i know something which
 am resolved not to tell you 
lilias had rightly read her mistress's temper
who wise and good as she was was yet
a daughter grandame eve and could not
witness this mysterious bearing on the part
 her waitingwoman without longing to ascertain
the secret cause for a space mrs
lilias was obdurate to all enquiries sighed
turned her eyes up higher yet to heaven
hoped for the best but had nothing particular
to communicate all this as was most
natural and proper only stimulated the lady's
curiosity neither was her importunity
to be parried with thank god i am no
makebate no talebearer thank god i
never envied any one's favour or was anxious
to people their misdemeanour only
thank god there has been no bloodshed
and murder in the house that is all
bloodshed and murder exclaimed the
lady what does the quean mean if you
speak not plain out you shall have something
you will scarce be thankful for
w
 the abbot
 nay my lady answered lilias eager
to disburse her mind or in chaucer's
phrase to unbuckle her mail if you bid
me speak out the truth you must not be
moved with what might displease you 
roland graeme has tired adam woodcock
 that is all
 good heaven said the lady turning
pale as ashes is the man slain 
 no madam replied lilias but slahi
he would have been if there had not been
ready help but may be it is your ladyship's
pleasure that this young esquire shall
poniard the servants as well as switch and
barton them
 go to minion said the lady you
are saucytell the master the household
to attend me instantly
lilias hastened to seek out mr wingate
and hurry him to his lady's presence speaking
as a word in season to him on the way
i have set the stone strolling look that
you do not let it stand still
the steward too prudential a person to
the abbot 
commit himself otherwise answered by a
sly look and a nod intelligence and presently
after stood in the presence the
lady avenel with a look great respect
for his lady partly real partly affected
and an air great sagacity which inferred
no ordinary conceit himself
how is this wingate said the lady
and what rule do you keep in the castle
that the domestics sir halbert blending
draw the dagger on each other as ina
cavern thieves and murtherers is the
wounded man much hurt and what what
hath become the unhappy boy 
there is no one wounded as yet madam
replied he the golden chain it
passes my poor skill to say how many maybe
wounded before pasche if some rule be
not taken with this youth not but the
youth is a fair youth he added corrective
himself and able at his exercise but
easter
 the abbor
somewhat too ready with the ends his
fingers the butt his riding switch and
the point his dagger
 and whose fault is that said the lady
 but yours who should have taught him
better discipline than to brawl or to draw
his dagger 
if it please your ladyship so to impose
the blame on me answered the steward
it is my part doubtless to bear it only i
submit to your consideration that unless i
nailed his weapon to the scabbard i could
no more keep it still than i could fix quicksilver
which defied even the skill raymond
nullius
tell me not raymond nullius said
the lady losing patience but send me the
chaplain hither you grow all you too
wise for me during your lord's long and
repeated absences i would to god his affairs
would permit him to remain at home
and rule his own household for it passes my
wit and skill 
 god forbid my lady said the old dothe
abbot 
mystic that you should sincerely think
what you are now pleased to say your old
servants might well hope that after so many
years duty you would do their service more
justice than to distrust their grey hairs because
they cannot rule the peevish humour
 a green head which the owner carries
it may be a brace inches higher than
becomes him
 leave me said the lady j sir albert's
return must now be expected daily
and he will look into these matters himself
leave me i say wingate without saying
more it i know you are honest and i
believe the boy is petulant and yet i think
it is my favour which hath set all you
against him
the steward bowed and retired after
having been silenced in a second attempt
to explain the motives on which he acted
the chaplain arrived but neither from
him did the lady receive much comfort
on the contrary she found him disposed
in plain terms to lay to the door her invol
i e
 tae abbot
dulgence all the disturbances which the
fiery temper roland graeme had already
occasioned or might hereafter occasion in
the family i would he said honoured
lady that you had deigned to be ruled by
me in the outset this matter sith it is
easy to stem evil in the fountain but hard
to struggle against it in the stream you
honoured madam a word which i do not
use according to the vain forms this
world bit because i have ever loved and
honoured you as an honourable and an
elect lady you i say madam have been
pleased contrary to my poor but earnest
counsel to raise this boy from his station
into one approaching to your own
 what mean you reverend sir said
the lady i have made this youth a page
is there aught in my doing so that does
not become my character and quality 
i dispute not madam said the pertinacious
preacher your benevolent purpose
in taking charge this youth or your
title to give him this idle character page
the abbor 
if such was your pleasure though what the
education a boy in the train a female
can tend to save to engraft foppery and
effeminacy on conceit and arrogance it
passes my knowledge to discover but i
blame you more directly for having taken
little care to guard him against the perils 
his condition or to tame and humble a spirit
naturally haughty overbearing and impatient
you have brought into your bower
a lion's cub delighted with the beauty 
his fur and the grace his gambols you
have bound him with no fetters befitting
the fierceness his disposition you have
let him grow up as unawed as if he had
been still a tenant the forest and now
you are surprised and call out for assistance
when he begins to ramp rend and
tear according to his proper nature
 mr warden said the lady considerably
offended you are my husband's ancient
friend and i believe your love sincere
to him and to his household yet let me
say that when i asked you for counsel i
 the abbot
expected not this asperity rebuke if i
have done wrong in loving this poor orphan
lad more than others his class i scarce
think the error merited such severe censure
 and if stricter discipline were required
to keep his fiery temper in order it
ought i think to be considered that i ama
woman and that if i have erred in this
matter it becomes a friend's part rather to
aid than to rebuke me i would these evils
were taken order with before my lord's return
he loves not domestic discord or
domestic brawls and i would not willingly
that he thought such could arise from
one whom i have favoured what do you
counsel me to do 
dismiss this youth from your service
madam replied the preacher
you cannot bid me do so said the
lady you cannot as a christian and a
man humanity bid me turn away an unprotected
creature against whom my favour
my injudicious favour if you will has
reared up so many enemies
i
the abbot 
it is not necessary you should altogether
abandon him though you dismiss him
to another service or to a calling better
suiting his station and character said the
preacher elsewhere he may be an useful
and profitable member the commonweal
 here he is but a makebate and a
stumblingblock offence the youth
has snatches sense and intelligence
though he lacks industry i will myself
give him letters commendatory to olearius
schinderhausen a learned professor at leyden
where they lack an underjanitor
where besides gratis instruction if god
give him the grace to seek it he will enjoy
five marks by the year and the professor's
castoff suit which he departs with
biennially
 this will never do good mr warden
said the lady scarce able to suppress a
smile we will think more at large upon
this matter in the meanwhile trust to
your remonstrances with the family for restraining
these violent and unseemly jean
the abbot
houses and bursts passion and i entreat
you to press on them their duty in
this respect towards god and towards
their master
 you shall be obeyed madam said
warden on the next thursday i exhort
the family and will with god's blessing
so wrestle with the daemon wrath
and violence which hath entered into my
little flock that i trust to hound the wolf
out the fold as if he were chased away
with bandogs
this was the part the conference from
which mr warden derived the greatest pleasure
the pulpit was at that time the same
powerful engine for affecting popular feel
ing which the press has since become and
he had been no unsuccessful preacher as
we have already seen it followed as a natural
consequence that he rather overestimated
the powers his own oratory and
like some his brethren about the period
was glad an opportunity to handle any
matters importance whether public or
thr abbor 
private the discussion which could be
dragged into his discourse in that rude age
the delicacy was unknown which prescribed
time and place to personal exhortations 
and as the courtpreacher often addressed
the king personally and dictated to him
the conduct he ought to observe in matters
 state so the nobleman himself or any 
his retainers were in the chapel the feudal
castle often incensed or appalled as the
case might be by the discussion their
private faults and by spiritual censures
directed against them specifically personally
and by name
the sermon by means which henry
warden proposed to restore concord and
good order to the castle avenel bore
for text the wellknown words he ivlio
strike with the sword shall perish by the
swyrdj and was a singular mixture good
sense and powerful oratory with pedantry
and bad taste he enlarged a good deal
on the word strike which he assured his
hearers comprehended blows given with
 the abbot
the point as well as with the edge and
more generally shooting with handgun
crossbow or longbow thrusting with a
lance or doing any thing whatsoever by
which death might be occasioned to the
adversary in the same manner he proved
satisfactorily that the word sword comprehended
all descriptions whether backsword
or baskethilt cutandthrust or rapier
falchion or scimitar but if he
continued with still greater animation
the text included in its anathema those
who strike with any those weapons
which man hath devised for the exercise 
his open hostility still more doth it comprehend
such as from their form and size
are devised rather for the gratification 
privy malice by treachery than for the destruction
 an enemy prepared and standing
upon his defence such he continued
looking sternly at the place where
the page was seated on a cushion at the
feet his mistress and wearing in his
crimson belt a gay dagger with a gilded
the abbot 
hit such more especially i hold to be
those implements death which in our
modern and fantastic times are worn not
only by thieves and cutthroats to whom
they most properly belong but even by
those who attend upon women and wait
in the chambers honourable ladies yes
my friends this unhappy weapon framed
for all evil and for no good is comprehended
under this deadly denunciation
whether it be a stile which we have bo
rowed from the treacherous italian 
dirk which is borne by the savage i 
landmen or a linger which is carried your
own borderthieves and cutthrow 
a dudgeondagger which was invented by
the devil himself for a ready implement 
deadly wrath sudden to execute and difficult
to be parried even the common
sword andbuckler brawler despises the
use such a treacherous and malignant
instrument which is therefore fit to be
used not by men or soldiers but by those
who trained under female discipline bee

 the abbot
come themselves effeminate hermaphrodites
having female spite and female cowardice
added to the infirmities and evil
passions their masculine nature
the effect which this oration produced
upon the assembled congregation 
cannot very easily be described the
lady seemed at once embarrassed and offended
 the menials could hardly contain
under an affectation deep attention the
joy with which they heard the chaplain
launch his thunders at the head the unpopular
favourite mrs lilias crested and
drew up her head with all the deepfelt
pride gratified resentment while the
steward observing a strict neutrality aspect
fixed his eyes upon an old scutcheon
on the opposite side the wall which he
seemed to examine with the most minute
accuracy more willing perhaps to incur
the censure being inattentive to the sermon
than that seeming to listen with
marked approbation to what appeared so
distasteful to his mistress
the abbot 
the unfortunate subject the harangue
whom nature had endowed with passions
which had hitherto found no effectual restraint
could not disguise the resentment
which he felt at being thus directly held
up to the scorn as well as the censure 
the assembled inhabitants the little world
in which he lived his brow grew red his
lip grew pale he set his teeth he clenched
his hand and then with mechanical readiness
grasped the weapon which the clergyman
had given so hideous a character 
and at length as the preacher heightened
the colouring his invective he felt his
rage become so ungovernable that fearful
 being hurried into some deed desperate
violence he rose up traversed the
chapel with hasty steps and left the congregation

the preacher was surprised into a sudden
pause while the fiery youth shot across
him like a flash lightning eyeing him ashe
passed as if he had wished to dart
from his eyes the same power blighting
 the abbot
and consuming but no sooner had he
crossed the chapel and shut with violence
behind him the door the vaulted entrance
by which it communicated with the
castle than the impropriety his conduct
supplied warden with one those
happier subjects for eloquence which
he knew how to take advantage for making
a suitable impression on his hearers
he paused for an instant and then pronounced
in a slow and solemn voice the deep
anathema he hath gone out from us because
he was not us the sick man hath
been offended at the wholesome bitter the
medicine the wounded patient hath flinched
from the friendly knife the surgeon
the sheep hath fled from the sheepfold
and delivered himself to the wolf because
he could not assume the quiet and humble
conduct demanded us by the great shepherd
 ah my brethren beware wrath 
beware pride beware the deadly and
destroying sin which so often shews itself
to our frail eyes in the garments light
the abbot 
what is our earthly honour pride and
pride only what our earthly gifts and
graces pride and vanity voyagers speak
 indian men who deck themselves with
shells and anoint themselves with pigments
and boast their attire as we do
 our miserable carnal advantages pride
could draw down the morning star from
heaven even to the verge the pit 
pride and self opinion kindled the flaming
sword which waves us off from paradise 
pride made adam mortal and a weary
wanderer on the face the earth which
he had else been lord pride brought
amongst us sin and doubles every sin it
has brought it is the outpost which the
devil and the flesh most stubbornly maintain
against the assaults grace and until
it be subdued and its barriers levelled
with the very earth there is more hope 
a fool than the sinner rend then from
your bosoms this accursed shoot the fatal
apple tear it up by the roots though
it be twisted with the cords your life
 the abbot
profit by the example the miserable sinner
that has passed from us and embrace
the means grace while it is called today
 ere your conscience is seared as with
a firebrand and your ears deafened like
those the adder and your heart hardened
like the nether millstone up then
and be doing wrestle and overcome resist
and the enemy shall flee from you 
watch and pray lest ye fall into temptation
and let the stumbling others be
your warning and your example above
all rely not on yourselves for such selfconfidence
is even the worst symptom 
the disorder itself the pharisee perhaps
deemed himself humble while he stooped
in the temple and thanked god that he
was not as other men and even as the
publican but while his knees touched
the marble pavement his head was as high
as the topmost pinnacle the temple
do not therefore deceive yourselves and
offer false coin where the purest you can
present is but as dross think not that
the abbot ill
such will pass the assay omnipotent wisdom
yet shrink not from the task because
as is my bounden duty i do not
disguise from you its difficulties selfsearching
can do much meditation can
do much grace can do all
and he concluded with a touching and
animating exhortation to his hearers to
seek divine grace which is perfected inhuman
weakness
the audience did not listen to this address
without being considerably affected 
though it might be doubted whether the
feelings triumph received from the disgraceful
retreat the favourite page did
not greatly qualify in the minds many
the exhortations the preacher to charity
and to humility and in fact the expression
 their countenances much resembled
the satisfied triumphant air a
set children who having just seen a
companion punished for a fault in which
they had no share con their task with
double glee both because they themselves
 the abbot
are out the scrape and because the culprit
is in it
with very different feelings did the lady
 avenel seek her own apartment she
felt angry at warden having made a domestic
matter in which she took a personal
interest the subject such public discussion
but this she knew the good man
claimed as a branch his christian liberty
as a preacher and also that it was vindicated
by the universal custom his brethren
but the selfwilled conduct her
protege afforded her yet deeper concern
that he had broken through in so remarkable
a degree not only the respect due to
her presence but that which was paid in
those days with such peculiar reverence
argued a spirit as untameable as his enemies
had represented him to possess and
yet so far as he had been under her own
eye she had seen no more that fiery
spirit than appeared to her to become his
years and his vivacity this opinion might
be founded in some degree on partiality j
the abbot 
in some degree too it might be owing to
the kindness and indulgence which she
had always extended to him but still she
thought it impossible that she could be totally
mistaken in the estimate she had
formed his character the extreme 
violence is scarce consistent with a course
 continued hypocrisy although lilias
charitably hinted that in some instances
they were happily united and therefore
she could not exactly trust the report 
others against her own experience and observation
the thoughts this orphan
boy clung to her heartstrings with a fondness
for which she herself was unable to
account he seemed to have been sent to
her by heaven to fill up those intervals 
languor and vacuity which deprived her 
so much enjoyment perhaps he was not
less dear to her because she well saw that
he was a favourite with no one else and
because she felt that to give him up was
to afford the judgment her husband and
others a triumph over her own j a circuit
the abbot
stance not quite indifferent to the best 
spouses either sex
in short the lady avenel formed the
internal resolution that she would not desert
her page while her page could be rationally
protected and with the view 
ascertaining how far this might be done
she caused him to be summoned to her
presence

old play
it was some time ere roland graeme appeared
the messenger his old friend
lilias had at first attempted to open the
door his little apartment with the charitable
purpose doubtless enjoying the
confusion and marking the demeanour 
the culprit but a square bit iron
ycleped a bolt was passed across the door
on the inside and prevented her charitable
purpose lilias knocked and called at intervals
 roland roland graeme 
roland graeme an emphasis on the
 the abbot
word master will you be pleased to do
up the door what ails you are you
at your prayers in private to complete the
devotion which you left unfinished in public
 surely we must have a screened seat
for you in the chapel that your gentility
may be free from the eyes common
folks still no whisper was heard in reply
 well master roland said the
waiting maid i must tell my mistress
that if she would have an answer she must
send those on errand to you who can beat
the door down
 what says your lady answered the
page from within
 marry open the door and you shall
hear answered the waitingmaid i trow
it becomes her message to be listened to
face to face and i will not for your idle
pleasure whistle it through a keyhole
your mistress's name said the page
opening the door is too fair a cover for
your impertinence what says my lady 
 that you will be pleased to come to
the abbot 
her directly in the withdrawing room
answered lilias i presume she has
some directions for you concerning the
forms to be observed in leaving chapel in
future
 say to my lady that i will directly
wait on her answered the page and returning
into his own apartment he once
more locked the door in the face the
waitingmaid
 rare courtesy muttered lilias and
returning to her mistress acquainted her
that roland graeme would wait on her
when it suited his convenience
 what is that his addition or your own
phrase lilias said the lady coolly
 nay madam replied the attendant
not directly answering the question he
looked as if he could have said much more
impertinent things than that if i had been
willing to hear them but here he comes
to answer for himself
roland graeme entered the apartment
with a loftier mien and somewhat a higher
 the abbot
colour than his wont there was embarrassment
in his manner but it was neither
that fear nor penitence
 young man said the lady what
trow you am i to think your conduct
this day 
 if it has offended you madam i am
deeply grieved replied the youth
 to have offended me alone replied
the lady were but little you have been
guilty conduct which will highly offend
your master violence to your fellowservants
and disrespect to god himself
in the person his ambassador
permit me again to reply said the
page that if i have offended my only
mistress friend and benefactress it includes
the sum my guilt and deserves
the sum my penitence sir halbert
glendinning calls me not servant nor do i
call him master he is not entitled to blame
me for chastising an insolent groom nor
do i fear the wrath heaven for treating
the abbot il
with scorn the unauthorized interference
 a meddling preacher
the lady avenel had before this seen
symptoms in her favourite boyish petulance
and impatience censure or reproof
but his present demeanour was 
a graver and more determined character
and she was for a moment at a loss how she
should treat the youth who seemed to have
at once assumed the character not only 
a man but a bold and determined one
she paused an instant and then assuming
the dignity which was natural to her she
said is it to me roland that you hold
this language is it for the purpose making
me repent the favour i have shewn
you that you declare yourself independent
both an earthly and a heavenly master 
have you forgotten what you were and
to what the loss my protection would
speedily again reduce you
 lady said the page i have forgot
nothing i remember but too much i
know that but for you i should have pes
the abbot
wished in yon blue waves pointing as he
spoke to the lake which was seen through
the window agitated by the western wind
your goodness has gone farther adam
you have protected me against the malice
 others and against my own folly you are
free if you are willing to abandon the orphan
you have reared you have left nothing
undone by him and he complains 
nothing and yet lady do not think i have
been ungrateful i have endured something
on my part which i would have borne for
the sake no one but my benefactress
 for my sake said the lady and
what is it that i can have subjected you to
endure which can be remembered with
other feelings than those thanks and gratitude

you are too just madam to require
me to be thankful for the cold neglect with
which your husband has uniformly treated
me neglect not unmingled with fixed aversion
you are too just madam to require
me to be grateful for the constant and un
the abbot 
ceasing marks scorn and malevolence
with which i have been treated by others
or for such a homily as that with which
your reverend chaplain has at my expence
this very day regaled the assembled householders

 heard mortal ears the like this 
said the waiting maid with her hands expanded
and her eyes turned up to heaven 
he speaks as if he were son an earl or
 a belted knight the least penny
the page glanced on her a look supreme
contempt but vouchsafed no other
answer his mistress who began to feel
herself seriously offended and yet sorry for
the youth's folly took up the same tone
 indeed roland you forget yourself so
strangely said she that you will tempt
me to take serious measures to lower you
in your own opinion by reducing you to
your proper station in society
 and that added lihas would be
best done by turning him out the same beggar's
brat that your ladyship took him in

 the abbot
lilias speaks too rudely continued the
lady but she has spoken the truth young
man nor do i think i ought to spare that
pride which hath so completely turned your
bead you have been tricked up with fine
garments and treated like the son a gentleman
until you have forgot the fountain
 your churlish blood
craving your pardon most honourable
madam lias hath spoken truth nor
does your ladyship know aught my descents
which should entitle you to treat it
with such decided scorn i am no beggar's
brat my grandmother begged from no
one here nor elsewhere she would have
perished sooner on the bare moor we
were harried out and driven from our
home a chance which has lapped elsewhere
and to others avenel castle with
its lake and its towers was not at all times
able to protect its inhabitants from want
and desolation
 hear but his assurance said lilias
 he upbraids my lady with the distresses
 her family 
the abbot 
it had indeed been a theme more gratefully
spared said the lady affected nevertheless
with the allusion
it was necessary madam for my vindication
said the page or i had not even
hinted at a word that might give you pain
but believe honoured lady i am no
churl's blood my proper descent i know
not but my only relation has said and my
heart has echoed it back and attested the
truth that i am sprung gentle blood
and deserve gentle usage
 and upon an assurance so vague as
this said the lady do you propose to expect
all the regard all the privileges due
to high rank and to distinguished birth
and become a contender for privileges
which are only due to the noble go to sir
know yourself or the master the household
shall make you know you are liable to
the scourge as a malapert boy you have
tasted too little the discipline fit for your age
and station
the master the household shall taste
 the abbot
 my dagger ere i taste his discipline
said the page giving way to his restrained
passion lady i have been too long the
vassal a pantoufle and the slave a
silver whistle you must find some other
to answer your call and let him be birth
and spirit mean enough to brook the scorn
 your menials and to call a church vassal
his master
 i have deserved this insult said the
lady colouring deeply for so long enduring
and fostering your petulance begone
sir leave this castle tonight i
will send you the means subsisting yourself
till you find some honest mode support
though i fear your imaginary grandeur
will be above all others save those 
rapine and violence begone sir and see
my face no more 
the page threw himself at her feet in
an agony sorrow my dear and honoured
mistress he said but was unable
to bring out another syllable
 arise sir said the lady and let go

the abbot 
my mantle hypocrisy is a poor cloak for
ingratitude
i am incapable either madam said
the page springing up with the exchange
 passion which belonged to his rapid and
impetuous temper think not i meant
to implore permission to reside here it
has been long my determination to leave
avenel and i will never forgive myself for
having permitted you to say the word hegone
j ere i said i leave you i did but
kneel to ask your forgiveness for an illconsidered
word used in the height displeasure
but which ill became my mouth as
addressed to you other grace i asked
not you have done much for me but i
repeat that you better know what you
yourself have done than what i have suffered

 roland said the lady somewhat appeased
and relenting towards her favourite
you had me to appeal to when you were
aggrieved you were neither called upon
 the abbot
to suffer wrong nor entitled to resent it
when you were under my protection
 and what said the youth if i sustained
wrong from those you loved and favoured
was i to disturb your peace with
idle talebearings and eternal complaints
no madam i have borne my own burthen
in silence and without disturbing you
with murmurs and the respect which you
accuse me wanting furnishes the only
reason why i have neither appealed to you
nor taken vengeance at my own hand in a
manner far more effectual it is well however
that we part i vas not born to be a
stipendiary favoured by his mistress until
ruined by the calumnies others may
heaven multiply its choicest blessings on
your honoured head and for your sake
upon all that are dear to you 
he was about to leave the apartment
when the lady called on him to return he
stood still while she thus addressed him 
 it was not my intention nor would it be
the abbot 
just even in the height my displeasure
to dismiss you without the means su
port take this purse gold
forgive me lady said the boy and
let me go hence with the consciousness
that i have not been degraded to the point
 accepting alms if my poor services
can be placed against the expense my
apparel and my maintenance i only remain
debtor to you for my life and that
alone is a debt which i can never repay 
put up then that purse and only say iiu
stead that you do not part from me m
anger
 no not in anger said the lady in
sorrow rather for your wilfulness but take
the gold you cannot but need it
may god evermore bless you for the
kind tone and the kind word but the oid
i cannot take i am able body and do
not lack friends so wholly as you may think 
for the time may come that i may yet shew
myself more thankful than by mere words
he threw himself on his knees kissed the
 the abbot
hand which she did not withdraw and
then hastily left the apartment
lilias for a moment or two kept her
eye fixed on her mistress who looked so
unusually pale that she seemed about to
faint but the lady instantly recovered herself
and declining the assistance which her
attendant offered her walked to her own
apartment
the abbot 
chapter 
lliou hast each secret the household francis
i dare be sworn thou hast been in the buttery
steeping thy curious humour in fat ale
and in the butler's tattle ay or chatting
with the glib waitingwoman o'er her comfits 
these bear the key to each domestic mystery
old play
upon the morrow succeeding the scene
we have described the disgraced favourite
left the castle and at breakfasttime the
cautious old steward and mrs lilias sate
in the apartment the latter personage
holding grave converse on the important
event the day sweetened by a small treat
 sweetmeats to which the providence 
mr wingate had added a little flask racy
canary
f
 the abbas
 he is gone at last said the abigail
sipping her glass and here is to his
good journey
amen answered the steward gravely
 i wish the poor deserted lad no ill
 and he is gone like a wildduck as he
came continued mrs lilias no lowering
 drawbridges or pacing along causeways
for him my master has pushed off
in the boat which they call the little herod
more shame to them for giving the name
 a christian to wood and iron and has
rowed himself by himself to the further side
 the loch and off and away with himself
and left all his finery strewed about his
room i wonder who is to clean his trumpery
out after him though the things are
worth lifting too
 doubtless mrs lilias answered the
master the household in the which
case i am free to think they will not long
cumber the floor
 and now tell me mr wingate continued
the damsel do not the very
the abbot 
cockles your heart rejoice at the house
being rid this upstart whelp that flung
us all into shadow 
why mrs lilias replied wingate
 as to rejoicing those who have lived as
long in great families as has been my lot
will be in no hurry to rejoice at any thing
and for roland grajtiie though he maybe
a good riddance in the main yet what
says the very sooth proverb seldom comes
a better 
seldom comes a better indeed echoed
mrs lilias i say never can come
a worse or one half so bad he might
have been the ruin our poor dear mistress
here she used her kerchief body
and soul and estate too for she spent more
coin on his apparel than on any four servants
about the house
 mrs lilias said the sage steward
 i do opine that our mistress requireth
not this pity at our hands being in all respects
competent to take care her own
body soul and estate into the bargain
 the abbot
you would not mayhap have said so
answered the waitingwoman had you
seen how like lot's wife she looked when
young master took his leave my mistress
is a good lady and a virtuous and a welldoing
lady and a wellspoken but i
would not sir halbert had seen her this
morning for two and a place
oh foy foy foy reiterated the
steward servants should hear and see
and say nothing besides that my lady is
utterly devoted to sir halbert as well she
may being as he is the most renowned
knight in these parts
 well well said the abigail i mean
no more harm but they that seek least renown
abroad are most apt to find quiet at
home that's all and my lady's lonesome
situation is to be considered that made her
fain to take up with the first beggar's brat
that a dog brought her out the loch
 and therefore said the steward i
say rejoice not too much or too hastily
mrs lilias for if your lady wished a favour
the abbot 
ite to pass away the time depend upon it
the time will not pass lighter now that he
is gone since she will have another favourite
to chuse for herself and be assured
she will not lack one
 and where should she chuse one but
among her own tried and faithful servants
said mrs lilias who have broken her
bread and drank her drink for so many
years i have known many a lady as high
as she that never thought either a friend
or favourite beyond their own waitingwoman
 always having a proper respect at
the same time for their old and faithful
master the household mr wingate
truly mrs lilias replied the steward
 i do partly see the mark at which
you shoot but i doubt your bolt will fall
short matters being with our lady as it
likes you to suppose it will neither be your
crimped pinners mrs lilias speaking 
them with due respect nor my silver hair
or golden chain that will fill up the void
which roland grme must needs leave in
 the abbot
our lady's leisure there will be a learned
young divine with some new doctrine a
learned leech with some new drug a bold
cavalier who will not be refused the favour
 wearing her colours at a running at the
ring a cunning harper that could harp the
heart out woman's breast as they say
signor david rizzio did to our poor queen
these are the sort folks who supply the
loss a wellfavoured favourite and not
an old steward or a middleaged waitingwoman

 well said lilias you have experience
master wingate and truly i would
my master would leave off his pricking hither
and thither and look better after the
affairs his household there will be a
papistrie among us next for what should
i see among master's clothes but a string 
gold beads i promise you aves and credos
both i seized on them like a falcon
 i doubt it not i doubt it not said the
steward sagaciously nodding his head i
have often noticed that the boy had strange
observances which savoured popery and
the abbot 
that he was very jealous to conceal them
but you will find the catholic under the
presbyterian cloak as often as the knave
under the friar's hood vhat then we are
all mortal right proper beads they are
he added looking attentively at them and
may weigh four ounces fine gold
 and i will have them melted down presently
she said before they be the misguiding
 some poor blinded soul
very cautious indeed mrs lilias said
the steward nodding his head in assent
i will have them made said mrs lilias
into a pair shoebuckles i would not
wear the pope's trinkets or whatever has
once borne the shape them one inch
above my instep were they diamonds instead
 gold but this is what has come
 father ambrose coming about the castle
as demure as a cat that is about to steal
cream
father ambrose is our master's brother
said the steward gravely
 very true master yvingate answered
 the abbot
the dame but is that a good reason why
he should pervert the king's liege subjects
to papistrie 
heaven forbid mrs lilias answered
the sententious majordomo but yet
there are worse folks than the papists
 i wonder where they are to be found
said the waitingwoman with some asperity
 but i believe mr wingate if one
were to speak to you about the devil himself
you would say there were worse people
than satan
 assuredly i might say so replied the
steward supposing that i saw satan standing
at my elbow
the waitingwoman started and having
exclaimed god bless us added i wonder
mr wingate you can take pleasure in
frightening one thus
nay mrs lilian i had no such purpose
was the reply but look you here
the papists are but put down for the present
but who knows how long this word
present will last there are two great pos

the abbot 
pish earls in the north england that
abominate the very word reformation i
mean the northumberland and westmoreland
earls men power enough to shake
any throne in christendom then though
our scottish king be god bless him a true
protestant yet here is his mother that was
our queen i trust there is no harm to say
god bless her too and she is a catholic 
and many begin to think she has had but
hard measure such as the hamiltons in the
west and some our border clans here
and the gordon in the north who are all
wishing to see a new world and if such a
new world should chance to come up it is
like that the queen will take back her own
crown and that the mass and the cross will
come up and then down go pulpits genevagowns
and black silk scullcaps
and have you mr jasper wingate
who have heard the word and listened unto
pure and precious mr henry warden have
you i say the patience to speak or but to
think popery coming down on us like a
 the abbot
storm or the woman mary again making
the royal seat scotland a throne abomination
 no marvel that you are so civil
to the cowled monk father ambrose when
he comes hither with his downcast eyes that
he never raises to my lady's face and with
his low sweettoned voice and his benedictines
and his bennisons and who so ready
to take them kindly as mr wingate 
mrs lilias replied the butler with an
air which was intended to close the debate
there are reasons for all things if i received
father ambrose debonair and suffered
him to steal a word now and then with
this same roland gramme it was not that i
cared a brass boodle for his benson or malison
either but only because i respected my
master's blood and who can answer if
mary come in again whether he may not be
as stout a tree to lean to as ever his brother
hath proved to us for down goes the earl
 murray when the queen comes by her
own again and good is his luck if he can
keep the head on his own shoulders and
down goes our knight with the earl his
the abbot 
patron j and who so like to mount into his
empty saddle as this same father ambrose 
the pope rome can soon dispense with
his vows and then we should have sir edward
the soldier instead ambrose the
priest
resentment and astonishment kept mrs
lilias silent while her old friend in his
self complacent manner was making known
to her his political speculations at length
her resentment found utterance in words
 great ire and scorn what master
wingate have you eaten my mistresses
bread to say nothing my master's so
many years that you could live to think 
her being dispossessed her own castle 
avenel by a wretched monk who is not a
drop's blood to her in the way relation 
i that am but a woman would try first
whether my rock or his covet were the better
metal shame on you master wingate
 if i had not held you as so old an acquaintance
this should have gone to my
lady's ears though i had been called 
the abbot
thank and taleyet for my pains as when
i told roland grseme shooting the wild
swan
master wingate was somewhat dismayed
at perceiving that the detail which he had
given his farsighted political views had
produced on his hearer rather suspicion 
his fidelity than admiration his wisdom
and endeavoured as hastily as possible to
apologize and to explain although internally
extremely offended at the unreasonable
view as he deemed it which it had
pleased mistress lilias bradbury to take
 his expressions and mentally convinced
that her disapprobation his sentiments
arose solely out the consideration
that though father ambrose supposing
him to become the master the castle
would certainly require the services a
steward yet those a waitingwoman
would in the supposed circumstances be
altogether superfluous
after his explanation had been received
as explanations usually are the two friends
the abbot 
separated lilias to attend the silver whistle
which called her to her mistress's chamber
and the sapient majordomo to the
duties his own department they parted
with less than their usual degree reverence
and regard for the steward felt that
his worldly wisdom was rebuked by the
more disinterested attachment the 
and mistress lilias bradbury
was compelled to consider her old friend
as something little if any thing better thana
timeserver

old sot
while the departure the page afforded
subject for the conversation which we
have detailed in our last chapter the late
favourite was far advanced on his solitary
journey without well knowing what was
its object or what was likely to be its 
he had rowed the skiff in which he left the
castle to the side the lake most distant
from the village vvith the desire escaping
the notice the inhabitants his pride
whispered that he would be in his discarded
state only the subject their wonder
the abbot 
and compassion and his generosity told
him that any mark sympathy which his
situation should excite might be unfavourably
reported at the castle a trifling incident
convinced him he had little to fear
for his friends on the latter score he was
met by a young man some years older than
himself who had on former occasions been
but too happy to be permitted to share in
his sports in the subordinate character his
assistant ralph fisher approached to greet
him with all the alacrity an humble friend
 what master roland abroad on this
side and without either hawk or hound 
 hawk or hound said roland i will
never perhaps hollo to again i have been
dismissed that is i have left the castle
ralph was surprised what you are
to pass into the knight's service and take
the blackjack and the lance 
indeed replied roland graeme i
am not i am now leaving the service 
avenel for ever
 the abbot
 and whither are you going then said
the young peasant
 nay that is a question which it craves
time to answer i have that matter to determine
yet replied the disgraced favourite

 nay nay said ralph i warrant you
it is the same to you which way you go 
my lady would not dismiss you till she had
put some lining into the pouches your
doublet
sordid slave said roland graeme
doest thou think i would have accepted
a boon from one who was giving me over
a prey to detraction and to ruin at the instigation
 a canting priest and a meddling
serving woman the bread that i had
bought with such an alms would have choked
me at the first mouthful
ralph looked at his quondam friend with
an air wonder not unmixed with contempt
 well he said at length no
occasion for passion each man knows his
the abbot 
own stomach best but were i on a black
moor at this time day not knowing whither
i was going i would be glad to have
a broad piece or two in my pouch come
by them as i could but perhaps you will
go with me to my father's that is for a
night for tomorrow we expect my uncle
menelaus and all his folk but as i said for
one night 
the coldblooded limitation the offered
shelter to one night only and that tendered
most unwillingly offended the pride
 the discarded favourite
 i would rather sleep on the fresh heather
as i have done many a night on less
occasion said roland graeme than in
that smoky garret your father's that
smells peat smoke and usquebaugh like a
highlander's plaid
 you may chuse my master if you are
so nice replied ralph fisher you maybe
glad to smell a peatfire and usquebaugh
too if you journey long in the fashion you
propose you might have said godamercy
vol i g
 the abbot
for your proffer though it is not every one
will put themselves in the way illwill by
harbouring a discarded serving man
 ralph said roland graeme i would
pray you to remember that i have switched
you before now and this is the same
riding wand which you have tasted
ralph who was a thickset clownish figure
arrived at his full strength and conscious
 the most complete personal superiority
laughed contemptuously at the threats 
the slight made stripling
it may be the same wand he said
but not the same hand and that is as
good rhyme as if it were in a ballad look
you my lady's page that was when your
switch was up it was no fear you but
 your betters that kept mine down and
i wot not what hinders me from clearing
old scores with this hazel rung and shewing
you it was your lady's livery coat which
i spared and not your flesh and blood
master roland
in the midst his rage roland graeme
the abbot 
was just wise enough to see that by continuing
this altercation he would subject
himself to very rude treatment from the
boor who was so much older and stronger
than himself and while his antagonist with
a sort jeering laugh defiance seemed
to provoke the contest he felt the full bitterness
 his own degraded condition and
burst into a passion tears which he in
vain endeavoured to conceal with both his
hands
even the rough churl was moved with
the distress his quondam companion
 nay master roland he said i did
but as twere jest with thee i would not
harm thee man were it but for old acquaintance
sake but ever look to a man's
inches ere you talk switching why
thine arm man is but like a spindle compared
to mine but hark i hear old adam
woodcock hollowing to his hawk come
along man we will have a merry afternoon
and go jolly to my father's in spite the
peatsmoke and usquebaugh to boot maybe
we may put you into some honest way
 the abbot
 winning your bread though it's hard to
come by in these broken times
the unfortunate page made no answer
nor did he withdraw his hands from his face
and fisher continued in what he imagined
a suitable tone comfort
 why man when you were my lady's
minions men held you proud and some
thought you a papist and i wot not what
and so now that you have no one to bear
you out you must be companionable and
hearty and wait on the minister's examinations
and put these things out folk's
head and if he says you are in fault you
must jour your head to the stream and if
a gentleman or a gentleman's gentleman
gives you a rough word or a light blow
you must only say thank you for dusting
my doublet or the like as i have done
by you but hark to woodcock's whistle
again come and i will teach you all the
trick on't as we go on
 i thank you said roland graeme endeavouring
to assume an air indifference
and superiority j but i have another
the abbot 
path before me and were it otherwise 
could not tread in yours
 very true master roland replied the
clown and every man knows his own
matters best and so i will not keep you
from the path as you say give us a grip
 your hand man for auld lang syne 
what not clap palms ere we part well
so be it a wilful man will have his way 
and so farewell and the blessing the
morning to you
 goodmorrow goodmorrow said
roland hastily and the clown walked
lightly off whistling as he went and glad
apparently to be rid an acquaintance
whose claims might be troublesome and
who had no longer the means to be serviceable
to him
roland graeme compelled himself to walk
on while they were within sight each
other that his former inmate might not augur
any vacillation purpose or uncertainty
 object from his remaining on the
same spot j but the effort was a painful one
 the abbot
he seemed stunned as it were and giddy 
the earth on which he stood felt as if unsound
and quaking under his feet like
the surface a bog and he had once or
twice nearly fallen though the path he trod
was firm greensward he kept resolutely
moving forward in spite the internal
agitation to which these symptoms belonged
until the distant form his acquaintance
disappeared behind the slope 
a hill when his heart gave way at once 
and sitting down on the turf remote from
human ken he gave way to the natural expressions
 wounded pride grief and fear
and wept with unrestrained profusion and
unqualified bitterness
when the first violent paroxysm his
feelings had subsided the deserted and
friendless youth felt that mental relief which
usually follows such discharges sorrow
the tears continued to chase each other
down his cheeks but they were no longer
accompanied by the same sense desolation
j an afflicting yet milder sentiment was
the abbot 
awakened in his mind by the recollection
 his benefactress the unwearied kindness
which had attached her to him in spite
 many acts provoking petulance now
recollected as offences a deep dye which
had protected him against the machinations
 others as well as against the consequences
 his own folly and would have
continued to do so had not the excess 
his presumption compelled her to withdraw
her protection
whatever indignity i have borne he
said has been the just reward my own
ingratitude and have i done well to accept
the hospitality the more than maternal
kindness my protectress yet to detain
from her the knowledge my religion 
but she shall know that a catholic has as
much gratitude as a puritan that i have
been thoughtless but not wicked that in
my wildest moments i have loved respected
and honoured her and that the orphan
boy might indeed be heedless but was never
ungrateful
 the abbot
he turned as these thoughts passed
through his mind and began hastily to retread
his footsteps towards the castle but
he checked the first eagerness his repentant
haste when he reflected on the
scorn and contempt with which the family
were likely to see the return the fugitive
humbled as they must necessarily suppose
him into a supplicant who requested
pardon for his fault and permission to return
to his service he slackened his pace
but he stood not still
i care not he resolutely determined 
let them wink point nod sneer speak
 the conceit which is humbled the
pride which has had a fall i care not it
is a penance due to my folly and i will
endure it with patience but if she also
my benefactress if she also should think
me sordid and weakspirited enough to beg
not for her pardon alone but for a renewal
 the advantages which i derived from her
favour r suspicion my meanness i
cannot i will not brook
the abbot 
he stood still and his pride rallying with
constitutional obstinacy against his more
just feeling urged that he would incur the
scorn the lady avenel rather than
obtain her favour by following the course
which the first ardour his repentant feelings
had dictated to him
if i had but some plausible pretext
he thought some ostensible reason for
my return some reason to allege which
might shew i came not as a degraded supplicant
or a discarded menial i might go
thither but as i am i cannot my heart
would leap from its place and burst
as these thoughts passed through his
mind something passed in the air so near
him as to dazzle his eyes and almost to
brush the plume in his cap he looked up
it was the favourite falcon sir halbert
which flying around his head seemed to
claim his attention as that a wellknown
friend roland extended his arm and gave
the wellknown whoop and the falcon 

 the abbot
scanty settled on his wrist and began to
prune itself glancing at the youth from
time to time an acute and brilliant glance
 its hazel eye which seemed to ask why
he caressed it not with his usual fondness
ah diamond he said as if the bird
understood him thou and i must be strangers
henceforward many a gallant stoop
have i seen thee make and many a brave
heron strike down but that is all over and
there is no hawking more for me
 and why not master roland said
adam woodcock the falconer who came
at that instant from behind a few alder
bushes which had concealed him from view
why should there be no more hawking
for you why man what were our life
without our sports thou know'st the jolly
old song
and rather would allan in dungeon lie
than live at large where the falcon cannot fly 
and allan would rather lie in sexton's pound
than live where he follow'd not the merry hawk and
hound
the abbot 
the voice the honest falconer was
hearty and friendly and the tone in which
he half sung half recited his rude ballad
implied honest frankness and cordiality
but remembrance their quarrel and its
consequences embarrassed roland and prevented
his reply the falconer saw his hesitation
and guessed the cause
what now said he master roland 
do you who are half an englishman think
that i who am a whole one would keep up
anger at you and you in distress that
were like some the scots my master's
reverence always excepted who can be
fair and false and wait their time and keep
their mind as they say to themselves and
touch pot and flagon with you and hunt
and hawk with you and after all when time
serves pay off some old feud with the point
 the dagger canny yorkshire has no
memory for such old sores why man an
you had hit me a rough blow maybe i
would rather have taken it from you thana
rough word from another j for you have a
 the abbot
good notion falconry though you stand
up for washing the meat for the classes
so give us your hand man and bear no
malice
roland though he felt his proud blood
rebel at the familiarity honest adam's
address could not resist its downright frankness
covering his face with the one hand
he held out the other to the falconer and
returned with readiness his friendly grasp
why this is hearty now said woodcock
 i always said you had a kind heart
though you have a spice the devil in
your disposition that is certain i came
this way with the falcon on purpose to find
you and yon halfbred hubbard told me
which way you took flight you ever
thought too much that kestrelkite master
roland and he knows nought sport
after all but what he caught from you i
saw how it had been betwixt you and i
sent him out my company with a wanton
i would rather have a rifler on my perch
than a false knave at my elbow and now
the abbot 
master roland tell me what way wing
ye 
 that is as god pleases replied the
page with a sigh which he could not suppress

 nay man never droop a feather for
being cast off said the falconer who
knows but you may soar the better and
fairer flight for all this yet look at diamond
there tis a noble bird and shews
gallantly with his hood and bells and jesses 
but there is many a wild falcon in norway
that would not change properties with him
 and that is what i would say you
you are no longer my lady's page and you
will not clothe so fair or feed so well or
sleep so soft or shew so gallant what 
all that if you are not her page you are
your own man and may go where you will
without minding whoop or whistle the
worst is the loss the sport but who knows
what you may come to they say that sir
halbert himself i speak with reverence
was once glad to be the abbot's forester
 the abbot
and now he has hounds and hawks his
own and adam woodcock for a falconer
to the boot
 you are right and say well adam
answered the youth the blood mantling in
his cheeks the falcon will soar higher
without his bells than with them though
the bells be made silver
that is cheerily spoken answered the
falconer and whither now 
 i thought going to the abbey 
kennaquhair answered roland grme
 to ask the counsel father ambrose
 and joy go with you said the falconer
 though it is like you may find the
old monks in some sorrow they say the
commons are threatening to turn them out
 their cells and make a devil's mass it
in the old church thinking they have forborne
that sport too long and troth i am
clear the same opinion
 then will father ambrose be the better
 having a friend beside him said the
page manfully
ay but my young fearnought rethe
abbot 
plied the falconer the friend will scarce
be the better being beside father ambrose
 he may come by the redder's lick
and that is ever the worst the battle
i care not for that said the page the
dread a lick should not hold me back 
but i fear i may bring trouble between the
brothers by visiting father ambrose i
will tarry tonight at saint cuthbert's cell
where the old priest will give me a night's
shelter and i will send to father ambrose
to ask his advice before i go down to the
convent
 by our lady said the falconer and
that is a likely plan and now he continued
exchanging his frankness manner
for a sort awkward embarrassment as if
he had somewhat to say that he had no
ready means to bring out and now you
wot well that i wear a pouch for my hawks
 meat and so forth but wot you what it is
lined with master roland 
with leather to be sure replied roland
somewhat surprised at the hesitation
 the abbot
with which adam woodcock asked a question
so simple
with leather lad said woodcock 
 ay and with silver to the boot that
see here he said shewing a secret slit in
the lining his bag office here they
are thirty good harry groats as ever were
struck in bluff old hall's time and ten 
them are right heartily at your service and
now the murder is out
roland's first idea was to refuse this assistance
 but he recollected the vows humility
which he had just taken upon him
and it occurred that this was the opportunity
to put his newformed resolution to
the test assuming a strong command 
himself he answered adam woodcock with
as much frankness as his nature permitted
him to wear in doing what was so contrary
to his inclinations that he accepted
thankfully his kind offer while to sooth
his own reviving pride he could not help
adding he hoped soon to requite the
obligation
the abbot ll
 that as you list that as you list
young man said the falconer with glee
counting out and delivering to his young
friend the supply he had so generously offered
and then adding with great chearfulness
 now you may go through the
world for he that can back a horse wind a
horn hollow a greyhound fly a hawk and
play at sword and buckler with a whole
pair shoes a green jacket and ten lilywhite
groats in his pouch may bid father
care hang himself in his own jesses farewell
and god be with you
so saying and as if desirous to avoid the
thanks his companion he turned hastily
round and left roland greene to pursue
his journey alone

chapter viii
the sacred tapers lights are gone
grey moss has clad the altar stone
the holy image is o'erthrown
the bell has ceased to toll
the long ribb'd aisles are burst and sunk
the holy shrines to ruin sunk
departed is the pious monk
god's blessing on his soul
rediviva
the cell saint cuthbert as it was
called marked or was supposed to mark
one those restingplaces which that venerable
saint was pleased to assign to his
monks when his convent being driven
from lindisfarne by the danes became a
peripatetic society religionists and bearing
their patron's body on their shoulders
transported him from place to place through
scotland and the borders england until
he was pleased at length to spare them
the abbot 
the pain bearing him farther and to
chuse his ultimate place rest in the lordly
towers durham the odour his
sanctity remained behind him at each place
where he had granted the monks a transient
respite from their labours and proud
were those who could assign as his temporary
restingplace any spot within their vicinity
few were more celebrated and honoured
than the wellknown cell saint
cuthbert to which roland graeme now
bent his way situated considerably to the
northwest the great abbey kenna
quhair on which it was dependent in the
neighbourhood were some those recommendations
which weighed with the experienced
priesthood rome in chusing
their sites for places religion
there was a well possessed some medicinal
qualities which course claimed
the saint for its guardian and patron and
occasionally produced some advantage to
the recluse who inhabited his cell since
 the abbot
none could reasonably be expected to be
benefited by the fountain who did not extend
their bounty to the saint's chaplain
a few roods fertile land afforded the
monk his plot garden ground an eminence
well clothed with trees rose behind
the cell and sheltered it from the north
and the east while the front opening to
the southwest looked up a wild but pleasant
valley down which wandered a lively
brook which battled with every stone
that interrupted its passage
the cell itself was rather plainly that
rudely built a low gothic building with
two small apartments one which served
the priest for his dwellingplace the other
for his chapel as there were few the
secular clergy who durst venture to reside
so near the border the assistance this
monk in spiritual affairs had not been useless
to the community while the catholic
religion retained the ascendancy as he
could marry christen and administer the
the abbot 
other sacraments the roman church 
late however as the protestant doctrines
gained ground he had found it convenient
to live in close retirement and to avoid as
much as possible drawing upon himself
observation or animadversion the appearance
 his habitation however when roland
graeme came before it in the close 
the evening plainly shewed that his caution
had been finally ineffectual
the page's first movement was to knock
at the door when he observed to his surprise
that it was open not from being left
unlatched but because beat off its upper
hinge it was only fastened to the doorpost
by the lower and could therefore no longer
perform its functions somewhat alarmed
at this and receiving no answer when
he knocked and called roland began to
look more at leisure upon the exterior 
the little dwellings before he ventured to
enter it the flowers which had been
trained with care against the walls seemed
to have been recently torn down and 
the abbot
ed their dishonoured garlands on the earth 
the latticed window was broken and dashed
in the garden which the monk had
maintained by his constant labour in the
highest order and beauty bore marks 
having been lately trod down and destroyed
by the hoofs animals and the feet 
men
the sainted spring had not escaped it
was wont to arise beneath a canopy ribbed
arches with which the devotion elder
times had secured and protected its healing
waters these arches were now almost
entirely demolished and the stones
 which they were built were tumbled into
the well as if with the purpose choking
up and destroying the fountain which as it
had shared in other days the honour the
saint was in the present doomed to partake
his unpopularity part the roof had
been pulled down from the house itself
and an attempt had been made with crows
and levers upon one the angles by
which several large cornerstones had been
the abbot 
forced out their place but the solidity
 ancient masonwork had proved too
great for the time or patience the assailants
and they had relinquished their task
 destruction such dilapidated buildings
after the lapse years during which nature
has gradually covered the effects violence
with creeping plants and with weather
stains exhibit amid their decay a melancholy
beauty but when the visible effects
 violence appear raw and recent
there is no feeling to mitigate the sense 
devastation with which they impress the
spectators and such was now the scene
on which the youthful page gazed with the
painful feelings it was qualified to excite
when his first momentary surprise was
over roland grseme was at no loss to conjecture
the cause these ravages the
destruction the popish edifices did not
take place at once throughout scotland but
at different times and according to the spirit
which actuated the reformed clergy 
some whom instigated their hearers to
s the abbot
these acts demolition and others with
better taste and feeling endeavoured to protect
the ancient shrines while they desired
to see them purified from the objects which
had attracted idolatrous devotion from
time to time therefore the populace the
scottish towns and villages when instigated
either by their own feelings abhorrence
for popish superstition or by the zealous
doctrines the more zealous preachers
resumed the work destruction and exercised
it upon some sequestered church
chapel or cell which had escaped the
first burst their indignation against the
religion rome in many places the vices
 the catholic clergy arising out the
wealth and the corruption that tremendous
hierarchy furnished too good an apology
for wreaking vengeance upon the
splendid edifices which they inhabited and
 this an old scottish historian gives a remarkable
instance
 t i u 
 the abbot
lady avenel said the page as thy
look and words seem to imply i have eaten
her bread i have experienced her favour
i will neither injure nor betray her
 that hereafter my son said she 
but learn this that it is not for thee to
capitulate in thy duty and to say this will
i do and that will i leave undone no
roland god and man vill no longer abide
the wickedness this generation seest
thou these fragments knowest thou what
they represent and canst thou think it is
for thee to make distinctions amongst a
race so cursed by heaven that they renounce
violate blaspheme and destroy
whatsoever we are commanded to believe
in whatsoever we are commanded to reverence

asshe spoke she bent her head towards
the broken image with a countenance in
which strong resentment and zeal were
mingled with an expression ecstatic devotion
 she raised her left hand aloft as in
the act making a vow and thus proceedthe
abbot 
ed bear witness for me holy saint within
whose violated temple we stand that as
it is not for vengeance my own that my
hate pursues these people so neither for
any favour or earthly affection towards any
amongst them will i withdraw my hand
from the plough when it shall pass over
the devoted furrow bear witness holy
saint once thyself a wanderer and fugitive
as we are now bear witness mother 
mercy queen heaven bear witness
saints and angels 
in this high strain enthusiasm she
stood raising her eyes through the fractured
roof the vault to the stars which
now began to twinkle through the pale twilight
while the long grey tresses which
hung down over her shoulders waved in the
jaightbreeze which the chasm and fractured
windows admitted freely
roland graeme was too much awed by
early habits as well as by the mysterious
import her words to ask for further explanation
 the purpose she obscurely hint
h 
 the abbot
ed at nor did she farther press him on the
subject j for having concluded her prayer
or obtestation by clasping her hands together
with solemnity and then signing
herself with the cross she again addressed
her grandson in a tone more adapted to
the ordinary business life
 thou must hence she said roland
thou must hence lout not till morning 
and now how wilt thou shift for thy night's
quarters thou hast been more softly bred
than when we were companions in the
misty hills cumberland and lauderdale

 i have at least preserved my good mother
the habits which i then learned can
lie hard and think it no hardship since
 have been a wanderer i have been a hunter
and fisher and fowler and each these
is accustomed to sleep freely in a worse shelter
than sacrilege has left us here
 than sacrilege has left us here said
the matron repeating his words and pausing
on them most true my son and
the abbot 
god's faithful children are now worst sheltered
when they lodge in god's own house
and the demesne his blessed saints we
shall sleep cold here under the night wind
which whistles through the breaches which
heresy has made they shall lie warmer
who made them ay and through a long
hereafter
notwithstanding the wild and singular
expressions this female she seemed to
retain towards roland graeme in a strong
degree that affectionate and sedulous love
which women bear to their nurslings and
the children dependent on their care it
seemed as if she would not permit him todo
aught for himself which in former days
her attention had been used to do for him
and that she considered the tall stripling
before her as being equally dependent on
her careful attention as when he was the
orphan child who had owed all to her affectionate
solicitude
what hast thou to eat now she said
as leaving the chapel they went into the
 the abbot
deserted habitation the priest or what
means kindling a fire to defend thee
from this raw and inclement air poor
child thou hast made slight provision fora
long journey nor hast thou skill to help
thyself by wit when means are scanty but
our lady has placed by thy side one to
whom want in all its forms is as familiar as
plenty and splendour have formerly been
and with want roland come the arts 
which she is the inventor
with an active and officious diligence
which strangely contrasted with her late
abstracted and high tone catholic devotion
she set about her domestic arrangements
for the evening a pouch which
was hidden under her garment produced
a flint and steel and from the scattered
fragments around those pertaining to the
image saint cuthbert scrupulously excepted
she obtained splinters sufficient to
raise a sparkling and cheerful fire on the
hearth the deserted cell
and now she said for needful food
the abbot 
think not it mother said roland
 unless you yourself feel hunger it is a
little thing for me to endure a night's abstinence
and a small atonement for the necessary
transgression the rules the
church upon which i was compelled during
my stay in the castle
hunger for myself answered the matron
 know youth that a mother knows
not hunger till that her child is satisfied
and with affectionate inconsistence totally
different from her usual manner she added
 roland you must not fast you have
dispensation you are young and to youth
food and sleep are necessaries not to be
dispensed with husband your strength
my child your sovereign your religion
your country require it let age macerate
by fast and vigil a body which can only
suffer j let youth in these active times
nourish the limbs and the strength which
action requires
while she thus spoke the scrip which
had produced the means striking fire
 the abbot
furnished provision for a meal which she
herself scarce partook but anxiously watched
her charge taking a pleasure resembling
that an epicure in each morsel
which he swallowed with a youthful appetite
which abstinence had rendered unusually
sharp roland readily obeyed her
recommendations and eat the food which
she so affectionately and earnestly placed
before him but she shook her head when
invited by him in return to partake the
refreshment her own cares had furnished 
and when his solicitude became more pressing
she refused him in a loftier tone rejection

young man she said you know
not to whom or what you speak they
to whom heaven declares its purpose must
merit its communication by mortifying the
senses they have that within which requires
not the superfluity earthly nutriment
which is necessary to those who
are without the sphere the vision to
them the watch spent in prayer is a rethe
abbot 
pressing slumber and the sense doing
the will heaven is a richer banquet than
the tables monarchs can spread before
them but do thou sleep soft my son
she said relapsing from the tone fanaticism
into that maternal affection and
tenderness j do thou sleep sound while
life is but young with thee and the cares
 the day can be drowned in the slumbers
 the evening different is thy duty and
mine and as different the means by which
we must qualify and strengthen ourselves
to perform it from thee is demanded
strength body from me strength 
soul
when she thus spoke she prepared with
ready address a palletcouch composed
partly the dried leaves which had once
furnished a bed to the solitary and the
guests who occasionally received his hospitality
and which neglected by the destroyers
 his humble cell had remained
little disturbed in the corner allotted for
them to these her care added some 
n
 the abbot
the vestures which lay torn and scattered
on the floor with a zealous hand she selected
all such as appeared to have made
any part the sacerdotal vestments laying
them aside as sacred from ordinary purposes
and with the rest she made with
dexterous promptness such a bed as a
weary man might willingly stretch himself
on j and during the time she was preparing
it rejected even with acrimony any attempt
which the youth made to assist her
or any entreaty which he urged that she
would accept the place rest for her
own use sleep thou said she roland
graeme sleep thou the persecuted
the disinherited orphan the son an illfated
mother sleep thou i go to pray in
the chapel beside thee
the manner was too enthusiastically earnest
too obstinately firm to permit roland
graeme to dispute her will any further yet
he felt some shame in giving way to it it
seemed as if she had forgotten the years
that had passed away since their meeting j
 
the abbot 
and expected to meet in the tall indulged
and wilful youth whom she had recovered
the passive obedience the child whom
she had left in the castle avenel this
did not fail to hurt her grandson's characteristic
and constitutional pride he obeyed
indeed awed into submission by the
sudden recurrence former subordination
and by feelings affection and gratitude
still however he felt the yoke
 have i relinquished the hawk and the
hound he said to become the pupil 
her pleasure as if i were still a child i
whom even my envious mates allowed to
be superior in those exercises which they
took most pains to acquire and which came
to me naturally as if a knowledge them
had been my birthright this may not and
must not be i will be no reclaimed 
who is carried hooded on a woman's
wrist and has his quarry only shewn
to him when his eyes are uncovered for his
flight i will know her purpose ere it is
proposed to me to aid it
 the abbot
these and other thoughts streamed
through the mind roland graeme and
although wearied with the fatigues the
day it was long ere he could compose himself
to rest
the abbot 
chapter 
kneel with me swear it tis not in words i trust
save when they're fenced with an appeal to heaven
old flay
after passing the night in that sound
sleep for which agitation and fatigue had
prepared him roland was awakened by
the fresh morning air and by the beams
 the rising sun his first feeling was
that surprise for instead looking
forth from a turret window on the waters
 the lake avenel which was the prospect
his former apartment afforded an
latticed aperture gave him the view 
the demolished garden the banished
anchorite he sate up on his couch 
leaves and arranged in his memory not
 the abbot
without surprise the singular events the
preceding day which appeared the more surprising
the more he considered them he
had lost the protectress his youth and
in the same day he had recovered the
guide and guardian his childhood the
former deprivation he felt ought to be matter
 unceasing regret and it seemed as if
the latter could hardly be the subject 
unmixed self congratulation he remembered
this person who had stood to him in
the relation a mother as equally affectionate
in her attention and absolute in
her authority a singular mixture love
and fear attended upon his early remembrances
as they were connected with her 
and the fear that she might desire to resume
the same absolute controul over his
motions a fear which her conduct yesterday
did not tend much to dissipate
weighed heavily against the joy this second
meeting
 she cannot mean said his rising pride
to lead and direct me as a pupil when i
the abbot 
am at the age judging my own actions
 this she cannot mean or meaning
it will feel herself strangely deceived
a sense gratitude towards the person
against whom his heart thus rebelled checked
his course feeling he resisted the
thoughts which involuntarily arose in his
mind as he would have resisted an actual
instigation the foul fiend and to aid
him in his struggles he felt for his beads
but in his hasty departure from the castle
 avenel he had forgotten and left them
behind him
 this is yet worse he said but two
things i learned her under the most
deadly charge secrecy to tell my beads
and to conceal that i did so and i have
kept my word till now and when she shall
ask me for the rosary i must say i have
forgotten it do i deserve she should believe
me when i say i have kept the secret
 my faith when i set so light by its symbol

 the abbot
he paced the floor in anxious agitation
in fact his attachment to his faith was 
a nature very different from that which animated
the enthusiastic matron but which
notwithstanding it would have been his last
thought to relinquish
the early charges impressed on him by
his grandmother had been instilled into a
mind and memory a character peculiarly
tenacious child as he was he was proud
 the confidence reposed in his discretion
and resolved to shew that it had not been
rashly entrusted to him at the same time
his resolution was no more than that a
child and must necessarily have gradually
faded away under the operation both
 precept and example during his residence
at the castle avenel but for the
exhortations father ambrose who in
his lay state had been called edward glendining
this zealous monk had been apprized
by an unsigned letter placed in his
hand by a pilgrim that a child educated in
the abbot 
the catholic faith was now in the castle 
avenel perilously situated so was the
scroll expressed as ever the three children
who were cast into the fiery furnace persecution
the letter threw upon father
ambrose the fault should this solitary
lamb unwillingly left within the demesnes
 the prowling wolf become his final prey
there needed no farther exhortation to
the monk than the idea that a soul might
be endangered and that a catholic might
become an apostate and he made his visits
more frequent than usual to the castle
 avenel lest through want the private
encouragement and instruction which
he always found some opportunity dispensing
the church should lose a proselyte
and according to the romish creed
the devil acquire a soul
still these interviews were rare and
though they encouraged the solitary boy
to keep his secret and hold fast his religion
they were neither frequent nor long enough
to inspire him with any thing beyond a
 the abbot
blind attachment to the observances which
the priest recommended he adhered to
the forms his religion rather because he
felt it would be dishonourable to change
that his fathers than from any rational
or sincere belief its mysterious doctrines
it was a principal part the distinction
which in his own opinion singled him out
from those with whom he lived and gave
him an additional though an internal and
concealed reason for contemning those 
the household who shewed an undisguised
dislike him and for hardening himself
against the instructions the chaplain
henry warden
the fanatic preacher he thought
within himself during some one the
chaplain's frequent discourses against the
church rome he little knows whose
ears are receiving his profane doctrine and
with what contempt and abhorrence they
hear his blasphemies against the holy religion
by which kings have been crowned
and for which martyrs have died
the abbot 
but in such proud feelings defiance
 heresy as it was termed and its professors
which associated the catholic religion
with a sense generous independence
and that the protestants with the
subjugation his mind and temper to the
direction mr warden began and ended
the faith roland gramme who independently
 the pride singularity
sought not to understand and had no one
to expound to him the peculiarities the
tenets which he professed his regret
therefore at missing the rosary which had
been conveyed to him through the hands
 father ambrose was rather the shame
 a soldier who has dropped his cockade
or badge service than that a religionist
who had forgotten a visible symbol 
his religion
his thoughts on the subject however
were mortifying and the more so from apprehension
that his negligence must reach
the ears his relative he felt it could
vol i i
f the abbor
be no one but her who had secretly transmitted
these beads to father ambrose for
his use and that his carelessness was but
an indifferent requital her kindness
nor will she omit to ask me about them
said he to himself for her's is a zeal which
age cannot quell and if she has not quitted
her wont my answer will not fail to incense
her
while he thus communed with himself
magdalen graeme entered the apartment
the blessing the morning on your
youthful head my son she said with a
solemnity expression which thrilled the
youth to the heart so sad and earnest did
the benediction flow from her lips in a tone
where devotion was blended with affection
and thou hast started thus early from thy
couch to catch the first breath the dawn
but it is not well my roland enjoy slumber
while thou canst the time is not far
behind when the waking eye must be thy
portion as well as mine
the abbot 
she littered these words with an affectionate
and anxious tone which shewed
that devotional as were the habitual exercises
 her minds the thoughts her nursling
yet bound her to earth with the cords
 human affection and passion
but she abode not long in a mood which
she probably regarded as a momentary dereliction
 her imaginary high calling 
 come she said youth up and be doing
 it is time that we leave this place
and whither do we go said the young
man or what is the object our journey
r
the matron stepped back and gazed on
him with surprise not unmingled with displeasure

to what purpose such a question she
said is it not enough that i lead the
way hast thou lived with heretics till
thou hast learned to instal the vanity 
thine own private judgment in place 
due honour and obedience 
 the abbot
the time thought roland graeme within
himself is already come when i must
establish my freedom or be a willing thrall
for ever i feel that i must speedily look
to it
she instantly fulfilled his foreboding by
recurring to the theme by which her
thoughts seemed most constantly engrossed
although when she pleased no one
could so perfectly disguise her religion
thy beads my son hast thou told thy
beads 
koland graeme coloured high he felt
the storm was approaching but scorned to
avert it by a falsehood
i have forgot my rosary at the castle
 avenel
 forgot thy rosary exclaimed she 
false both to religion and to natural duty
hast thou lost what was sent so far and at
such risk a token the truest affection
that should have been every bead it as
dear to thee as thine eyebails i
i
the abbot 
 i am grieved it should have so chanced
mother said the youth and much did i
value the token as coming from you for
what remains i trust to win gold enough
when i push my way in the world and till
then beads black oak or a rosary nuts
must serve the turn
 hear him said his grandmother 
 young as he is he hath learned already
the lessons the devil's school the rosary
consecrated by the holy father himself
and sanctified by his blessings is buta
few knobs gold whose value may be
replaced by the wages his profane labour
and whose virtue may be supplied by a
string hazel nuts this is heresy so
henry warden the wolf who ravages the
flock the shepherd hath taught thee to
speak and to think
 mother said roland graeme am
no heretic i believe and i pray according
to the rules our church this misfortune
i regret but i cannot amend it
 the abbot
 thou canst repent it though replied
his spiritual directress repent it in dust
and ashes atone for it by fasting prayer
and penance instead looking on me with
a countenance as light as if thou hadst lost
but a button from thy cap
 mother said roland be appeased 
i will remember my fault in the next 
confession which i have space and oppor 
tunitv to make and will do whatsoever the
priest requires me in atonement for
the heaviest fault i can do no more but
mother he added after a moment's pause
 let me not incur your farther displeasure
if i ask whither our journey is bound and
what is its object i am no longer a child
but a man and at my own disposal with 
down upon my chin and a sword by my
side i will go to the the world with
you to do your pleasure but i owe it to
myself to enquire the purpose and direction
 our travels
you owe it to yourself ungrateful boy 
the abbot 
replied his relative passion rapidly supplying
the colour which age had long chased
from her features to yourself you owe
nothing you can owe nothing to me you
owe every thing your life when an infant
your support while a child the means
 instruction and the hopes honour 
and sooner than thou shouldst abandon the
noble cause to which i have devoted thee
would i see thee lie a corpse at my feet
roland was alarmed at the vehement agitation
with which she spoke and which
threatened to overpower her aged frame 
and he hastened to reply i forget nothing
 what owe to you my dearest
mother shew me how my blood can testify
my gratitude and you shall judge if i
spare it but blindfold obedience has in it
as little merit as reason
 saints and angels replied magdalen
and do i hear these words from the child
 my hopes the nursling by whose bed i
have kneeled and for whose weal i have
wearied every saint in heaven with prayers 
 the abbot
roland by obedience only canst thou shew
thy affection and thy gratitude what avails
itthatyoumight perchance adopt recourse
i propose to thee were it to be fully explained
 thou wouldst not then follow
my command but thine own judgment 
thou wouldst not do the will heaven
communicated through thy best friend to
whom thou west thine all but thou wouldst
observe the blinded dictates thine own
imperfect reason hear me roland a lot
calls thee solicits thee demands thee 
the proudest to which man can be destined
and it uses the voice thine earliest thy
best thy only friend wilt thou resist it 
then go thy way leave me here my hopes
on earth are gone and withered i will
kneel me down before yonder profaned altar
and when the raging heretics return
they shall dye it with the blood a martyr

but my dearest mother said roland
grseme whose early recollections her
violence were formidably renewed by these
the abbot 
wild expressions reckless passion i
will not forsake you i will abide with you
worlds shall not force me from your side
i will protect i will defend you i will
live with you and die for you
 one word my son were worth all these
say only i will obey you
doubt it not mother replied the
youth i will and that with all my heart 
only
nay i receive no qualifications thy
promise said magdalen graeme catching
at the word the obedience which i require
is absolute and blessing on thee thou
darling memory my beloved child that
thou hast power to make a promise so hard
to human pride trust me well that in
the design in which thou doest embark
thou hast for thy partners the mighty and
the valiant the power the church and
the pride the noble succeed or fail
live or die thy name shall be among those
with whom success or failure is alike glow

 the abbot
rioiis death or life alike desirous forward
then forward ife is short and our plan
is laborious angels saints and the whole
blessed host heaven have their eyes even
now on this barren and blighted land 
scotland what say i on scotland their
eye is on isj roland on the frail woman
on the inexperienced youth who amidst
the ruins which sacrilege hath made in the
holy place devote themselves to god's
cause and that their lawful sovereign
amen so be it the blessed eyes saints
and martyrs vhich see our resolve shall
witness the execution or their ears which
hear our vow shall hear our deathgroan
drawn in the sacred cause
while thus speaking she held roland
greene firmly ith one hand while she
pointed upward with the other to leave
him as it were no means protest against
the obtestation to which he vas thus made
a party alien she had finished her appeal
to heaven she left him no leisure for farther
hesitation or for asking any explana
the abbot 
tion her purpose but passing with the
same ready transition as formerly to the solicitous
attentions an anxious parent
overwhelmed him with questions concerning
his residence in the castel avenel
and the qualities and accomplishments he
had acquired
 it is well she said when she had exhausted
her enquiries my gay goeshawk
hath been well trained and will soar high 
but those who bred him will have cause
to fear as well as to wonder at his flight let
us now she said to our morning meal
and care not though it be a scanty one a
few hours walk will bring us to more friendly
quarters
they broke their fast accordingly on
such fragments as remained their yesterday's
provision and immediately set out on
their farther journey magdalen gramme led
the way with a firm and active step much
beyond her years and roland grahame followed
pensive and anxious and far from
 the abbot
satisfied with the state dependence to
which he seemed again to be reduced
am i for ever he said to himself to be
devoured with the desire independence
and free agency and yet to be for ever led
on by circumstances to follow the will

she dwelt unnoticed and alone
 beside the springs dove 
a maid whom there was none to praise
and very few to love
wordsworth
in the course their journey the travellers
spoke little to each other magdalen
graeme chaunted from time to time ina
low voice a part some one those
beautiful old latin hymns which belong to
the catholic service muttered an ave or a
credo and so passed on lost in devotional
contemplation the meditations her
grandson were more bent on mundane matters
 and many a time as a moorfovvl arose
from the heath and shot along the moor uttering
his bold crow defiance he thought

where the low trees and bushes were intermingled
with tall fern furze and broom so
as to form a thick and intricate cover his
dreams were a roebuck and a brace 
gazehounds but frequently his mind returned
to the benevolent and kind mistress
whom he had left behind him offended justly
and unreconciled by any effort his
my step would be lighter he thought
and so would my heart could i but have
returned to see her for one instant and to
say lady the orphanboy was wild but not
ungrateful
traveling in these divers moods about
the hour noon they reached a small
straggling village in which as usual were
seen one or two those predominating
towers or peelhouses which for reasons
 defence elsewhere detailed were at that
time to be found in every border hamlet
a brook flowed beside the village and watered
the valley in which it stood there
was also a mansion at the the village
the abbot 
and a little way separated from it much
dilapidated and in very bad order but appearing
to have been the abode persons
 some consideration the situation was
agreeable being an angle formed by the
stream bearing three or four large sycamore
trees which being in full leaf served
to relieve the dark appearance the mansion
which was built a deep red stone
the house itself had been a large one but
was now obviously too big for the inmates 
several windows were built up especially
those which opened from the lower storey 
others were blockaded in a less substantial
manner the court before the door which
had once been defended with a species 
low outer wall now ruinous was paved
but the stones were completely covered
with long grey nettles thistles and other
weeds which shooting up betwixt the flags
had displaced many them from their
level even matters demanding more peremptory
attention had been left neglected
 the abbot
in a manner vhich argued sloth or poverty
in the extreme the stream undermining
a part the bank near an angle the ruinous
wall had brought it down with a corner
turret the ruins which lay in the bed
 the river the current interrupted by
the ruins which it had overthrown and
turned yet nearer to the site the tower
had greatly enlarged the breach it had
made and was in the process undermining
the ground on which the house itself
stood unless it were speedily protected by
sufficient bulwarks
all this attracted roland graeme's observation
as they approached the dwelling by
a winding path which gave them at intervals
a view it from different points
if we go to yonder house he said to
his mother i trust it is but for a short visit
it looks as if two rainy days from the
northwest would send the whole into the
brook
you see but with the eyes the body
the abbot 
said the old woman god will defend
his own though it be forsaken and despised
 men better to dwell on the sand
under his law than fly to the rock human
trust
as she thus spoke they entered the
court before the old mansion and roland
could observe that the front it had formerly
been considerably ornamented with
carved work in the same darkcoloured
freestone which it was built but all
these ornaments had been broken down
and destroyed and only the shattered vestiges
 niches and entablatures now strewed
the place which they had once occupied
the larger entrance in front was walled up
but a little footpath which from its appearance
seemed to be rarely trodden led
to a small wicket defended by a door well
clenched with ironheaded nails at which
magdalen grme knocked three times
pausing betwixt each knock until she heard
an answering tap from within at the last
knock the wicket was opened by a pale
 the abbor
thin female who said benedicite qui ver i
nient in nomine domini they entered
and the portress hastily shut behind them
the wicket and made fast the massive fastenings
by which it was secured
the female led the way through a narrow
entrance into a vestibule some extent
paved with stone and having benches
 the same solid material ranged around
at the upper was an oriel window but
part the intervals formed by the stone
shafts and mullions was blocked up so that
the apartment was very gloomy
here they stopped and the mistress 
the mansion for such she was embraced
magdalen graeme and greeting her by the
title sister kissed her with much solemnity
on either side the face
the blessing our lady be upon you
my sister were her next words and they
left no doubt upon roland's mind respecting
the religion their hostess even if
he could have suspected his venerable and
zealous guide resting elsewhere than in
the abbot f
the habitation an orthodox catholic
they spoke together a few words in private
during which he had leisure to remark
more particularly the appearance 
his grandmother's friend
her age might be betwixt fifty and sixty 
her looks had a mixture melancholy and
unhappiness that bordered on discontent
and obscured the remains beauty which
age had still left on her features her
dress was the plainest and most ordinary
sort a dark colour and like magdalen
greene's something approaching to a religious
habit strict neatness and cleanliness
 person seemed to intimate that if poor
she was not reduced to squalid or heartbroken
distress and that she was still sufficiently
attached to life to retain a taste for its
decencies if not its elegancies her manner
as well as her features and appearance argued
an original condition and education
far above the meanness her present appearance
la short the whole figure was
such as to excite the idea that female
 the abbot
must have had a history worth knowing
while roland grasme was making this very
reflection the whispers the two females
ceased and the mistress the mansion
approaching him looked on his face and
person with much attention and as it seemed
some interest
 this then she said addressing his
relative is the child thine unhappy
daughter magdalen and him the only
shoot from your ancient tree you are willing
to devote to the good cause
yes by the rood answered magdalen
graeme in her usual tone resolved determination
 to the good cause i devote him
flesh and fell sinew and limb body and
soul
 thou art a happy woman sister magdalen
answered her companion that
lifted so high above human affection and
human feeling thou canst bind such a victim
to the horns the altar had i been
called to make such sacrifice to plunge a
youth so young and fair into the plots and
the abbot 
bloodthirsty dealings the time not the
patriarch abraham when he led isaac up
the mountain would have rendered more
melancholy obedience
she then continued to look at roland
with a mournful aspect compassion
until the intentness her gaze occasioned
his colour to rise and he was about to move
out its influence when he was stopped
by his grandmother with one hand while
with the other she divided the hair upon
his forehead which was now crimson with
bashfulness while she added with a mixture
 proud affection and firm resolution
 ay look at him well my sister for on
a fairer face thine eye never rested i too
when first i saw him felt as the worldly
feel and was half shaken in my purpose
but no wind can tear a leaf from the withered
tree which has long been stripped
 its foliage and no mere human casualty
can awaken the mortal feelings which have
long slept in the calm devotion
while the old woman thus spokes her
 the abbot
manner gave the lie to her assertions for
the tears rose to lier eyes while she added
but the fairer and the more spotless the
victim is it not my sister the more worthy
 acceptance she seemed glad to escape
from the sensations which agitated her and
instantly added he will escape my sister
 there will be a ram caught in the
thicket and the hand our revolted brethren
shall not be on the youthful joseph
heaven can defend its own rights even by
means babes and sucklings women
and beardless boys
heaven hath left us said the other
female for our sins and our fathers the
succours the blessed saints have abandoned
this accursed land we may win
the crown martyrdom but not that 
earthly triumph one too whose prudence
was at this deep crisis so indispensable has
been called to a better world the abbot
eustatius is no more
may his soul have mercy said magdalen
graeme and may heaven too have
the abbot 
mercy upon us who linger behind in this
bloody land his loss is indeed a perilous
blow to our enterprize for who remains behind
possessing his farfetched experience
his self devoted zeal his consummate wisdom
and his undaunted courage he hath
fallen with the church's standard in his
hand but god will raise up another to lift
the blessed banner whom have the chapter
elected in his room 
it is rumoured no one the few remaining
brethren dare accept the office
the heretics have sworn that they will permit
no future election and will heavily punish
any attempt to create a new abbot 
saint mary's coiijuiavermit inter se 
dictates projiciamus jaques ejus
quotisquejdomine answered magdalen
 this my sister were indeed a perilous
and fatal breach in our band but i am
firm in my belief that another will arise
in the place him so untimely removed
where is thy daughter catherine
 the abbot
 in the parlour answered the matron
 but she looked at roland graeme
and muttered something in the ear her
friend
fear it not answered magdalen graeme
it is both lawful and necessary fear nothing
from him i would he were as well
grounded in the faith by which alone comes
safety as he is free from thought deed or
speech villainy therein is the heretics
discipline to be commended my sister
that they train up their youth in strong morality
and choak up every inlet to youthful
folly
 it is but a cleansing the outside 
the cup answered her friend a whitening
 the sepulchre but he shall see catherine
since you sister judge it safe and
meet follow us youth she added and
led the way from the apartment with her
friend these were the only words which
the matron had addressed to roland graeme
who obeyed them in silence as they paced
the abbot 
through several winding passaigesafifi wafe
apartments with a very slow step the young
page had leisure to make some reflections on
his situation reflections a nature which
his ardent temper considered as specially
disagreeable it seemed he had now got
two mistresses or buttresses instead one
both elderly women and both it would
seem in league to direct his motions according
to their own pleasure and for the
accomplishment plans to which he was
no party this he thought was too much 
arguing reasonably enough that whatever
right his grandmother and benefactress had
to guide his motions she was neither entitled
to transfer her authority or to divide
it with another who seemed to assume
without ceremony the same tone absolute
command over him
but it shall not long continue thus
thought roland i will not be all my life
the slave a woman's whistle to live
upon her exhibition go when she bids and
vol i k
 the abbot
come when she calls no by saint andrew
 the hand that can hold the lance is
above the controul the distaff i will
leave them the slip'd collar in their hands
on the first opportunity and let them execute
their own devices by their own proper
force it may save them both from a peril
for i guess what they meditate is not like
to prove either safe or easy the earl 
murray and his heresy are too well rooted
to be grubbed up by two old women
as he spoke thus they entered a low
room in which a third female was seated
this apartment was the first he had observed
in the mansion which was furnished
with moveable seats and with a wooden
table over which was laid a piece tapestry
a carpet was spread on the floor
there was a firegrate in the chimney and
in brief the apartment had the air being
habitable and inhabited
but roland's eyes found better employment
than to make observations on the acthe
abbot 
commendations the chamber for this
second female inhabitant the mansion
seemed something very different from anything
he had yet seen there at his first
entry she had greeted with a silent and
low obeisance the two aged matrons then
glancing her eyes towards roland she adjusted
a veil which hung back over her
shoulders so as to bring it over her face 
an operation which she performed with
much modesty but without either affected
haste or embarrassed timidity
during this manoeuvre roland had time
to observe that the face was that a girl
not much past sixteen apparently and that
the eyes were at once soft and brilliant
to these very favourable observations was
added the certainty that the fair object to
whom they referred possessed an excellent
shape bordering perhaps on evibonpointy
and therefore rather that a hebe than 
a sylph but beautifully formed and shewn
to great advantage by the close jacket and
 the abbot
petticoat which she wore after a foreign
fashion the last not quite long enough absolutely
to conceal a very pretty foot which
rested on a bar the table at which she
sate her round arms and taper fingers very
busily employed in repairing the piece 
tapestry which was spread on it which exhibited
several deplorable fissures enough to
demand the utmost skill the most expert
seamstress
it is to be remarked that it was by stolen
glances that roland grasme contrived to
ascertain these interesting particulars and
he thought he could once or twice notwithstanding
the texture the veil detect
the damsel in the act taking similar cognizance
 his own person the matrons
in the meanwhile continued their separate
conversation eyeing from time to time the
young people in a manner which left roland
in no doubt that they were the subject
 their conversation at length he distinctly
heard magdalen graeme say these
the abbot 
words nay my sister we must give them
opportunity to speak together and to become
acquainted they must be personally
known to each other or how shall they
be able to execute what they are entrusted
with 
it seemed as if the matron not fully satisfied
with her friend's reasoning continued
to offer some objections but they
were borne down by her more dictatorial
friend
 it must be so she said my dear
sister let us therefore go forth on the
balcony to finish our conversation and
do you she said addressing roland and
the girl become acquainted with each
other
with this she stepped up to the young
woman and raising her veil discovered
features which whatever might be their
ordinary complexion were now covered
with a universal blush
libitum sit said magdalen looking at
the other matron
 the abbor
 viw licittun replied the other with reluctant
and hesitating acquiescence and
again adjusting the veil the blushing girl
she dropped it so as to shade though not
to conceal her countenance and whispered
to her in a tone loud enough for the page
to hear remember catherine who thou
art and for what destined
the matron then retreated with magdalen
greene through one the casements
 the apartment that opened on a large
broad balcony which with its ponderous
balustrade had once run along the whole
south front the building which faced to
the brook and formed a pleasant and commodious
walk in the open air it was now
in some places deprived the balustrade
in others broken and narrowed but ruinous
as it was could still be used as a pleasant
promenade here then walked the
two ancient dames busied in their private
conversation yet not so much so but what
roland could observe the matrons as their
the abbor 
thin forms darkened the casement in passing
or repassing before it dart a glance into
the apartment to see how matters were
going on there
 the ajbbpt
chapter xi
life hath its may and all is mirthful then 
the woods are vocal and the flowers all odour 
its very blast has mirth isn't and the maidens
the while they don their cloaks to skreen their kirtles
laugh at the rain that wets them
old flay
catherine was at the happy age innocence
and buoyancy spirit when after
the first moment embarrassment was over
a situation awkwardness like that in which
she was suddenly left to make acquaintance
with a handsome youth not even known to
her by name struck her in spite herself
in a ludicrous point view she bent her
beautiful eyes upon the work with which
she was busied and with infinite gravity
sate out the two first turns the matrons
upon the balcony j but then glancing her
the abbot 
deep blue eye a little towards roland and
observing the embarrassment under which
he laboured now shifting on his chair and
now dangling his cap the whole man evincing
that he was perfectly at a loss how
to open the conversation she could keep
her composure no longer but after a vain
struggle broke out into a sincere though
a very involuntary fit laughing so richly
accompanied by the laughter her merry
eyes which actually glanced through the
tears which the effort filled them with
and by the waving her rich tresses
that the goddess smiles herself never
looked more lovely than catherine at that
moment a court page would not have
left her long alone in her mirth but roland
was countrybred and besides having
some conceit as well as bashfulness
he took it into his head that he was himself
the object her inextinguishable laughter
his endeavours to sympathize with catherine
therefore could carry him no further
than into a forced giggle which had more
k 
 the abbot
 displeasure than mirth in it and which
so much enhanced that the girl that it
seemed to render it impossible for her ever
to bring her laughter to an with whatever
anxious pains she laboured to do so
for every one has felt that when a paroxysm
 laughter has seized him at a misbecoming
time and place the efforts which
he makes to suppress it nay the very sense
 the impropriety giving way to it tends
only to augment and prolong the irresistible
impulse
it was undoubtedly lucky for catherine
as well as for roland that the latter did
not share in the excessive mirth the former
for seated as she was with her back
to the casement catherine could easily
escape the observation the two matrons
during the course their promenade 
whereas graeme was so placed with his
side to the window that his mirth had he
shared that his companion would have
been instantly visible and could not have
failed to give offence to the personages in
the abbot 
question he sate however with some impatience
until catherine had exhausted
either her power or her desire laughing
and was returning with good grace to the
exercise her needle and then he observed
with some dryness that there seemed no
great occasion to recommend to them to
improve their acquaintance it seemed that
they were already tolerably familiar
catherine had an extreme desire to set
off upon a fresh score but she repressed it
strongly and fixing her eyes on her work
replied by asking his pardon and promising
to avoid future offence
roland had sense enough to feel that
an air offended dignity was very much
misplaced and that it was with a very different
bearing he ought to meet the deep
blue eyes which had borne such a hearty
burthen in the laughing scene he tried
therefore to extricate himself as well as he
could from his blunder by assuming a tone
 correspondent gaiety and requesting to
know the nymph how it was her pleads
the abbot
sure that they should proceed in improving
the acquaintance which had commenced so
merrily
that she said you must yourself
discover perhaps i have gone a step too far
in opening our interview
 suppose said roland graeme we
should begin as in a talebook by asking
each others names and histories
 it is right well imagined said catherine
 and shews an argue judgment do
you begin and i will listen and only put
in a question or two at the dark parts the
story come unfold then your name and
history my new acquaintance
i am called roland graeme and that
tall old woman is my grandmother
 and your tutoress good who are
your parents 
 they are both dead replied roland
 ay but who were they you had parents
i presume 
 i suppose so said roland but i
have never been able to learn much their
the abbot 
history my father was a scottish knight
who died gallantly in his stirrups my mother
was a grseme heather gill in the
debateable land most her family were
killed when the debateable country was
burned by lord maxwell and berries 
caerlaverock
 is it long ago said the damsel
 before i was born answered the page
that must be a terrible while since
said she shaking her head gravely look
you i cannot weep for them
 it needs not said the youth they
fell with honour
 so much for your lineage fair sir replied
his companion whom i like the
living specimen a glance at the casement
far more than those that are dead your
much honoured grandmother looks as if she
could make one weep in sad earnest and
now fair sir for your own person if you
tell not the tale faster it will be cut short
in the middle mother bridget pauses longi
er and longer every time she passes the
 the abbot
window and with her there is as little mirth
as in the grave your ancestors
my tale is soon told i was introduced
into the castle avenel to be page to the
lady the mansion
she is a strict huguenot is she not 
said the little maiden
as strict as calvin himself but my
grandmother can play the puritan when it
suits her purpose and she had some plan
 her own for quartering me in the castle
it would have failed however after we
had remained several weeks at the hamlet
but for an unexpected master ceremonies

and who was that said the girl
 a large black dog wolf by name who
brought me into the castle one day in his
mouth like a hurt wildduck and presented
me to the lady
a most respectable introduction truly
said catherine and what might you learn
at this same castle i love dearly to know
what my acquaintances can do at need
the abbot 
to fly a hawk hollow to a hound back
a horse and wield lance bow and brand
 and to boast all this when you have
learned it said catherine which in
france at least is the surest accomplishment
 a page but proceed fair sir how
came your huguenot lord and your no less
huguenot lady to receive and keep in the
family so perilous a person as a catholic
page 
 because they knew not that part 
my history which from a child i had been
taught to keep secret and because my
granddame's former zealous attendance on
their heretic chaplain had laid all this suspicion
to sleep most fair callipolis said
the page and in so saying edged his chair
towards the seat the fair querist
 nay but keep your distance most gallant
sir answered the blueeyed maiden
 for unless i greatly mistake these reverend
ladies will soon interrupt our amicable
conference if the acquaintance they recommend
shall seem to proceed beyond a certain
point so fair sir be pleased to abide
 the abbot
by your station and reply to my questions
by what achievements did you prove the
qualities a page which you had thus
happily acquired 
roland who began to enter into the tone
and spirit the damsel's conversation replied
to her with becoming spirit
in no feat fair gentlewoman was i
found inexpert wherein there was mischief
implied i shot swans hunted cats frightened
servingwomen chased the deer and
robbed the orchard i say nothing tormenting
the chaplain in various ways for
that was my duty as a good catholic
 now as i am a gentlewoman said catherine
 i think these heretics have done
catholic penance in entertaining so allaccomplished
a servingman and what fair
sir might have been the unhappy event
which deprived them an inmate so altogether
estimable 
 truly fair gentlewoman answered the
youth your real proverb says that the
longest lane will have a turning and mine
was more it was in fine a turning off
the abbot 
 good said the merry young maiden
 it is an apt play on the word and what
occasion was taken for so important a catastrophe
 nay start not for my learning
i do know the schools in plain phrase
why were you sent from service 
the page shrugged his shoulders while
jft replied
 a short tale is soon told and a short
horse soon curried i made the falconers
boy taste my switch the falconer threatened
to make me brook his cudgel he is s
kindly clown as well as a stout and i would
rather have been cudgelled by him than
any man in christendom to chuse but i
knew not his qualities as then so i threatened
to make him brook the stab and my
lady made me brook the begone so
adieu to the page's office and the fair castle
 avenel i had not travelled far before i
met my venerable parent and so tell your
tale fair gentlewoman for mine is done
a happy grandmother said the maiden
 who had the luck to find the stray
 the abbot
page just when his mistress had slipped his
leash and a most lucky page that has jumped
at once from a page to a gentlemanusher

 all this is nothing your history answered
roland grseme who began to be
much interested in the congenial vivacity 
this facetious young gentle woman tale
for tale is fellowtraveller's justice
 wait till we are fellowtravellers then
replied catherine
 nay you escape me not so said the
page if you deal not justly by me i will
call out to dame bridget or whatever your
dame be called and proclaim you for a
cheat
 you shall not need answered the
maiden my history is the counterpart
 your own the same words might almost
serve change but dress and name i am
called catherine seyton and i am an orphan

 have your parents been long dead 
 that is the only question said she
throwing down her fine eyes with a sudden
the abbot 
expression sorrow that is the only question
i cannot laugh at
and dame bridget is your grandmother

the sudden cloud passed away like that
which crosses for an instant the summer
sun and she answered with her usual lively
expression worse by twenty degrees
dame bridget is my maiden aunt
over gods forebode said roland 
alas that you have such a tale to tell 
and what horror comes next 
 your own history exactly i was taken
upon trial for service
 and turned off for pinching the duenna
or affronting my lady's waitingwoman

nay our history varies there said the
damsel our mistress broke up house or
had her house broke up which is the same
thing and i am a free woman the forest
and i am as glad it as if any one
had lined my doublet with cloth gold
said the youth
 the abbot
i thank you for your mirth said she
but the matter is not like to concern
you
nay but say on said the page for
you will be presently interrupted the two
good dames have been soaring yonder on
the balcony like two old hooded crows
and their croak grows hoarser as night
comes on they will wing to roost presently
 this mistress yours fair gentlewoman
who was she in god's name 
 o hp has a fair name in the world
replied catherine seyton few ladies
kept a fairer house or held more gentlewomen
in her household my aunt bridget
was one her housekeepers we never
saw her blessed face to be sure but we
heard enough her were up early and
down late and were kept to long prayers
and light food
 out upon the penurious beldame 
said the page
 for heaven's sake blaspheme not
said the girl with an expression fear
the abbot 
god pardon us both i meant no harm
i speak our blessed saint catherine 
sienna may god forgive me that i spoke
so lightly and made you do a great sin and
a great blasphemy this was her nunnery
in which there were twelve nuns and an
abbess my aunt was the abbess till the heretics
turned all adrift
and where are your companions
asked the youth
 with the last year's snow answered
the maiden east north south and west
some to france some to flanders some
i fear into the world and its pleasures
we have got permission to remain or rather
our remaining has been connived at
for my aunt has great relations among the
kerr and they have threatened a deathbed
if any one touches us and bow and
spear are the best warrant in these times
nay then you sit under a sure shadow
said the youth and i suppose you
wept yourself blind when saint catherine
broke up housekeeping before you had taken
arles in her service 
ifflicleiirnestmnney
 the abbot
 hush for heaven's sake said the
damsel crossing herself no more that j
but i have not quite cried my eyes out
said she turning them upon him and instantly
again bending them upon her work
it was one those glances which would
require the threefold plate brass around
the heart more than it is needed by the
mariners to whom horace recommends it
our youthful page had no defence whatever
to offer
what say you catherine he said if
we two thus strangely turned out service
at the same time should give our two
most venerable duennas the torch to hold
while we walk a merry measure with each
other over the floor this weary world 
 a goodly proposal truly said catherine
 and worthy the madcap brain a
discarded page and what shifts does your
worship propose we should live by by
singing ballads cutting purses or swaggering
on the highway for there i think
you would find your most productive exchequer

the abbot 
 chuse you proud peat said the page
drawing off in huge disdain at the calm and
unembarrassed ridicule with which his wild
proposal was received and as he spoke
the words the casement was again darkened
by the forms the matrons it opened
and admitted magdalen grme and the
mother abbess so we must now style her
into the apartment
 the abbot
chapter xii
nay hear me brother i am elder wiser
and homer than thou and age and wisdom
and holiness have peremptory claims
and will be listened to
old play
when the matrons reentered and put
an to the conversation which we have
detailed in the last chapter dame magdalen
graeme thus addressed her grandson
and his pretty companion have you
spoke together my children have you
become known to each other as fellowtravellers
on the same dark and dubious road
whom chance hath brought together and
who study to learn the tempers and dispositions
 those by whom their perils are to
be shared 
the abbot 
it was seldom the lighthearted catherine
could suppress a jest so that she often
spoke when she would have acted more
wisely in holding her peace
your grandson admires the journey
which you propose so very greatly that he
was even now preparing for setting out
upon it instantly
 this is to be too forward roland
said the dame addressing him as yesterday
you were over slack the just mean
lies in obedience which both waits for the
signal to start and obeys it when given 
but once again my children have you so
perused each other's countenances that
when you meet in whatever disguise the
times may impose upon you you may recognize
each in the other the secret agent
 the mighty work in which you are to
be leagued look at each other know
each line and lineament each other's
countenance learn to distinguish by the
step by the sound the voice by the movol
i l
 the abbot
tionof the hand by the glaticeof the eye
the partner whom heaven hath sent to aidin
working its will wilt thou know that
maiden whensoever or wheresoever you
shall again meet her my roland graeme 
as readily as truly did roland answer
in the affirmative and thou my daughter
wilt thou again remember the features
 this youth 
 truly mother replied catherine seyton
 i have not seen so many men late
that i should immediately forget your grandson
though i mark not much about him that
is deserving special remembrance
 join hands then my children said
magdalen graeme but in saying so was
interrupted by her companion whose conventual
prejudices had been gradually giving
her more and more uneasiness and
who could remain acquiescent no longer
nay my good sister you forget said
she to magdalen catherine is the betrothed
bride heaven these intimacies cannot
be 
the abbot 
it is in the cause heaven that i command
them to embrace said magdalen
with the full force her powerful voice j
the sister sanctifies the means we
must use
 they call me lady abbess or mother
at the least who address me said dame
bridget drawing herself up as if offended
at her friend's authoritative manner the
lady heathergill forgets that she speaks
to the abbess saint catherine
when i was what you call me said
magdalen you indeed were the abbess
 saint catherine but both names are now
gone with all the rank that the world and
that the church gave to them and we are
now to the eye human judgment two
poor despised oppressed women dragging
our dishonoured old age to a humble grave
but what are we in the eye heaven 
ministers sent forth to work his will in
whose weakness the strength the church
shall be manifested before whom shall be
humbled the wisdom murray and the
 the abbot
dark strength morton and to such
wouldst thou apply the narrow rules thy
cloistered seclusion or hast thou forgotten
the order which i shewed thee from thy
superior subjecting thee to me in these matters

on thy head then be the scandal and
the sin said the abbess sullenly
on mine be they both said magdalen
 i say embrace each other my children

but catherine aware perhaps how the
dispute was likely to terminate had escaped
from the apartment and so disappointed
the grandson at least as much as the old
matron
she is gone said the abbess to provide
some little refreshment but it will
have little savour to those who dwell in the
world for i at least cannot dispense with
the rules to which i am vowed because it
is the will wicked men to break down the
sanctuary in which they wont to be observed

the abbot 
it is well my sister replied magdalen
 to pay each even the smallest tythes
 mint and cummin which the church demands
and i blame not thy scrupulous observance
 the rules thine order but
they were established by the church and
for the church's benefit and reason it is
that they should give way when the salvation
 the church herself is at stake
the abbess made no reply
one more acquainted with human nature
than the inexperienced page might have
found amusement in comparing the different
kinds fanaticism which these two females
exhibited the abbess timid narrowminded
and discontented clung to ancient
usages and pretensions which were ended
by the reformation and was in adversity
as she had been in prosperity scrupulous
weakspirited and bigotted while the fiery
and more lofty spirit her companion suggested
a wider field effort and would not
be limited by ordinary rules in the extraordinary
schemes which were suggested by her
 the abbot
bold and irregular imagination but roland
graeme instead tracing these peculiarities
 character in the two old dames
only waited with great anxiety for the return
 catherine expecting probably that
the proposal the fraternal embrace would
be renewed as his grandmother seemed disposed
to carry matters with a high hand
his expectations or hopes if we may
call them so were however disappointed
 for when catherine reentered on the
summons the abbess and placed on the
table an earthen pitcher water and four
wooden platters with cups the same materials
the dame heathergill satisfied
with the arbitrary mode in which she had
borne down the opposition the abbess
pursued her victory no farther a moderation
for which her grandson in his heart
returned her but slender thanks
in the meanwhile catherine continued to
place upon the table the slender preparations
for the meal a recluse which consisted
almost entirely cole wort boiled
the abbot 
and served up in an earthen platter having
no better seasoning than a little salt and no
better accompaniment than some coarse
barleybread in very moderate quantity
the waterpitcher already mentioned furnished
the only beverage after a latin
grace delivered by the abbess the guests
sat down to their spare entertainment the
simplicity the fare appeared to produce
no distaste in the females who ate it moderately
but with the usual appearance 
appetite but roland grseme had been
used to better cheer sir halbert glendining
who affected even an unusual degree
 nobleness in his housekeeping maintained
it in a style genial hospitality
which rivalled that the northern barons
 england he might think perhaps that
by doing so he acted yet more completely
the part for which he was not born 
that a great baron and a leader two
bullocks and six sheep weekly were the
allowance when the baron was at home
and did not greatly diminish during his ab
 the abbot
sence a boll malt was weekly brewed
into ale which was used by the household
at discretion bread was baked in proportion
for the consumption his domestics
and retainers and in this scene plenty
had roland graeme now lived for several
years it formed a bad introduction to lukewarm
greens and spring water and probably
his countenance indicated some sense
 the difference for the abbess observed
 it would seem my son that the tables
 the heretic baron whom you have so
long followed are more daintily furnished
than those the suffering daughters the
church and yet not upon the roost solemn
nights festival when the nuns were permitted
to eat their portion at mine own table
did i consider the cates which were
then served up as half so delicious as these
vegetables and this water on which i prefer
to feed rather than do aught which may
derogate from the strictness my vow it
shall never be said that the mistress this
house made it a house feasting when days
the abbot 
 darkness and affliction were hanging
over the holy church which i am an
unworthy member
well hast thou said my sister replied
magdalen graeme but now it is not only
time to suffer in the good cause but to act
in it and since our pilgrim's meal is finished
let us go apart to prepare for our journey
 tomorrow and to advise on the
manner in which these children shall be employed
and what measures we can adopt to
supply their thoughtlessness and lack discretion

notwithstanding his indifferent cheerthe
heart roland graeme bounded high at
this proposal which he doubted not would
lead to another teteastute betwixt him and
the pretty novice but he was mistaken
catherine it would seem had no mind sofar
to indulge him for moved either by delicacy
or caprice or some those indescribable
shades betwixt the one and the other
with which women love to teaze and at the
same time to captivate the ruder sex she
l
 the abbot
reminded the abbess that it was necessary
she should retire for an hour before vespers
 and receiving the ready and approving
nod her superior she arose to
withdraw but before leaving the apartment
she made obeisance to the matrons
bending herself till her hands touched her
knees and then made a slighter reverence
to roland which consisted in a slight bend
 the body and gentle depression the
head this she performed very demurely 
but the party on whom the salutation was
conferred thought he could discern in her
manner an arch and mischievous exultation
over his secret disappointment the devil
take the saucy girl he thought in his
heart though the presence the abbess
should have repressed all such profane imaginations
 she is as hardhearted as the
laughing hyaena that the storybooks tell 
she has a mind that i shall not fot her
this night at least
the matrons now retired also gvx the
page to understand that he was on no acthe
abbot 
count to stir from the convent or to shew
himself at the windows the abbess expressing
as a reason the readiness with which
the rude heretics caught at every occasion
 scandahzing the religious orders
this is worse than the rigour mr henry
warden himself said the page when
he was left alone j for to do him justice
however strict in requiring the most rigid
attention during the time his homilies
he left us to the freedom our own wills
afterwards ay and would take a share in
our pastimes too if he thought them entirely
innocent but these old women are
utterly wrapt up in gloom mystery and
selfdenial well then if i must neither
stir out the gate nor look out at window
i will at least see what the inside the
house contains that may help to pass away
one's time peradventure i may light on
that blueeyed laugher in some corner or
other
going therefore out the chamber by
the entrance opposite to that through which
 the abbot
the two matrons had departed for it maybe
readily supposed he had no desire to
intrude on their privacy he wandered
from one chamber to another through the
deserted edifice seeking with boyish eagerness
some source interest or amusement
here he passed through a long gallery
opening on either hand into the little cells
 the nuns all deserted and deprived 
the few trifling articles furniture which
the rules the order admitted
the birds are flown thought the page
but whether they will find themselves worse
oflt in the open air than in these damp
narrow cages i leave my lady abbess
and my venerable relative to settle betwixt
them i think the lark which they have
left behind them would like best to sing
under god's free sky
a winding stair strait and narrow as
if to remind the nuns their duties fast
and maceration led down to a lower suite
 apartments which occupied the ground
story the house these rooms were even
the abbot 
more ruinous than those which he had left 
for having encountered the first fury the
assailants by whom the nunnery had been
wasted the windows had been dashed in
the doors broken down and even the partitions
betwixt the apartments in some
places destroyed as he thus stalked
from desolation to desolation and began to
think returning from so uninteresting a
research to the chamber which he had left
he was surprised to hear the low a cow
very close to him the sound was so unexpected
at the time and place that roland
graeme started as if it had been the voice
 a lion and laid his hand on his dagger
while at the same moment the light and
lovely form catherine seyton presented
itself at the door the apartment from
which the sound had issued
 good even to you valiant champion 
said she since the days guy warwick
never was one more worthy to encounter
a dun cow
cow said roland grme by my
 the abbot
faith i thought it had been the devil that
roared so near me who ever heard a
convent containing a cowhouse 
cow and calf may come hither now
answered catherine for we have no means
to keep out either but i advise you kind
sir to return to the place from whence you
came
 not till i see your charge fair sister
answered roland and made his way into
the apartment in spite the half serious
half laughing remonstrances the girl
the poor solitary cow now the only severe
recluse within the nunnery was quartered
in a spacious chamber which had once
been the refectory the convent the roof
was graced with groined arches and the wall
with niches from which the images had
been pulled down these remnants architectural
ornaments were strangely contrasted
with the rude crib and manger constructed
for the cow in one corner the
apartment and the stack fodder which
was piled beside it for her food
the abbot 
 by my faith said the page crosbie
is more lordly lodged than any one here
you had best remain with her said
catherine and supply by your filial attentions
the offspring she has had the ill luck
to lose
 i will remain at least to help you to
prepare her night's lair pretty catherine
said roland seizing upon a pitchfork
by no means said catherine for
besides that you know not in the least todo
her that service you will bring a chiding
my way and i get enough that in the
regular course things
 what for accepting my assistance 
said the page for accepting m assistance
who am to be your confederate in
some deep matter import that were
altogether unreasonable and now i think
on it tell me if you can what is this mighty
emprize to which i am destined 
 robbing a bird's nest i should suppose
said catherine considering the
champion whom they have selected
 the abbot
by my faith said the youth and
he that has taken a falcon's nest in the
scars polmoodie has done something
to brag my fair sister but that is allover
now a murrain on the nest and the
classes and their food washed or unwashed
for it was all anon cramming these
worthless kites that i was sent upon my
present travels save that i have met with
you pretty sister i could eat my daggerhilt
for vexation at my own folly but as
we are to be fellowtravellers
 fellowlabourers not fellowtravellers
answered the girl j for to your comfort
be it known that the lady abbess and
i set out earlier than you and your respected
relative tomorrow and that i partly endure
your company at present because it
may be long ere we meet again
by saint andrew but it shall not
though answered roland i will not
hunt at all unless we are to hunt in couples

 i suspect in that and in other points
the abbot 
we must do as we are bid but hark i
hear my aunt's voice
the old lady entered in good earnest
and darted a severe glance at her niece
while roland had the ready wit to busy
himself about the halter the cow
the young gentleman said catherine
gravely is helping me to tie the cow up
faster to her stake for i find that last night
when she put her head out window and
lowed she alarmed the whole village and
we will be suspected sorcery among the
heretics if they do not discover the cause
 the apparition or lose our cow if they
do
relieve yourself that fear said the
abbess somewhat ironically the person
to whom she is now sold comes for the
animal presently
good night then my poor companion
said catherine patting the animal's
shoulders i hope thou hast fallen into
kind hands for my happiest hours late
have been spent in tending thee i would
i had been born to no better task
 the abbot
 now out upon thee meanspirited
wench said the abbess is that a speech
worthy the name seyton or the
mouth a sister this house treading the
path election and to be spoken before
a stranger youth too go to my oratory
minion there read your hours till i
come thither when i will read you such a
lecture as shall make you prize the blessings
which you possess
catherine was about to withdraw in silence
casting a half sorrowful half comic
glance at roland gramme which seemed to
say you see to what your untimely visit
has exposed me when suddenly changing
her mind she came forward to the page
and extended her hand as she bid him good
evening their palms had pressed each
other ere the astonished matron could interfere
and catherine had time to say 

 the abbot
ry's men who dare worship where their predecessors
prayed while alive and were interred
when dead follow me this way my
son
roland graeme followed accordingly 
and magdalen casting a hasty glance to
see whether they were observed for she had
learned caution from the danger the
times commanded her grandson to knock
at a little wicket which she pointed out to
him but knock gently she added with
a motion expressive caution after a
little space during which no answer was
returned she signed to roland to repeat
his summons for admission and the door
at length partially opening discovered a
glimpse the thin and timid porter by
whom the duty was performed skulking
from the observation those who stood
without but endeavouring at the same time
to gain a sight them without being himself
seen how different from the proud
and dignified consciousness with which the
porter ancient days offered his important
brow and his goodly person to the pile
abbot 
grins who repaired to kennaquhair his
solemn ingrate meijiui was exchanged
for a tremulous you cannot enter now 
the brethren are in their chambers bat
when magdalen graeme asked in an undertone
 voice hast thou forgotten me my
father he changed his apologetic refusal
to enter my honoured sister enter speedily
for evil eyes are upon us
they entered accordingly and having
waited until the porter had with jealous
haste barred and bolted the wicket were
conducted by him through several dark and
winding passages as they walked slowly
on he spoke to the matron in a subdued
voice as if he feared to trust the very walls
with the avowal which he communicated
our fathers are assembled in the chapterhouse
worthy sister yes in the chapterhouse
 for the election an abbots 
ah benedicite there must be no ringing
 bells no high mass no opening the
great gates now that the people might see
and venerate their spiritual father our
 the abbot
fathers must hide themselves rather like
robbers who chuse a leader than godly
priests who elect a mitred abbot
 regard not that my brother answered
magdalen graeme the first successors
 saint peter himself were elected not in
sunshine but in tempests not in the halls
 the vatican but in the subterranean
vaults and dungeons heathen rome 
they were not granulated with shouts and
salvos cannonshot and musketry
and the display artificial fire no my
brother but by the hoarse summons 
victors and praetors who came to drag the
fathers the church to martyrdom from
such adversity was the church once raised
and by such will it now be purified and
mark me brother not in the proudest days
 the mitred abbey was a superior ever
chosen whom his office shall so much honour
as he shall be honoured who now
takes it upon him in these days tribulation
on whom my brother will the choice
fall 
the abbot 
on whom can it fall or alas who
would dare to reply to the call save the
worthy pupil the sainted eustatius the
good and valiant father ambrose 
i know it said magdalen my heart
told me long ere your lips had uttered his
name stand forth courageous champion
and man the fatal breach rise bold and
experienced pilot and seize the helm while
the tempest rages turn back the battle
brave raiser the fallen standard i wield
crook and sling noble shepherd a scattered
flock 
i pray you hush my sister said the
porter opening a door which led into the
great church the brethren will he presently
here to celebrate their election with
a solemn mass i must marshall them the
way to the high altar all the offices this
venerable house have now devolved on one
poor decrepit old man
he left the church and magdalen and
roland remained alone in that great vaulted
space whose style rich yet chaste
 the abbot
architecture referred its origin to the early
part the fourteenth century the best period
 gothic building but the niches
were stripped their images in the inside
as well s the outside the church and
in the pellmell havoc the tombs warriors
and princes had been included in
the demolition the idolatrous shrines
lances and swords antique size which
had hung over the tombs mighty warriors
 former days lay now strewed among reliques
with which the devotion pilgrims
had graced those their peculiar saints 
and the fragments the knights and dames
which had once lain recumbent or kneeled
in an attitude devotion where their mortal
reliques were reposed were mingled
with those the saints and angels the
gothic chisel which the hand violence
had sent headlong from their stations
the most fatal symptom the whole appeared
to be that though this violence had
now been committed for many months the
fathers had lost so totally all heart and resolve
abbot 
lotion that they had not adventured even
upon clearing away the rubbish or restoring
the church to some decent degree order
this might have been done without much
labour but terror had overpowered the
scanty remains a body once so powerful
and sensible they were only suffered to remain
in this ancient seat by connivance and
from compassion they'd not venture upon
taking any step which might be construed
into an assertion their ancient rights
contenting themselves with the secret and
obscure exercise their religious ceremonial
in as unostentatious a manner as was
possible
two or three the more aged brethren
had sunk under the pressure the times
and the ruins had been partly cleared away
to permit their interment one stone had
been laid over father nicholas which recorded
 him in special that he had taken
the vows during the incumbency abbot
ingelramthe period to which his memory so
frequently recurred another flag stone yet
more recently deposited covered the body
 the abbot
 peter the sacristan eminent for his aquatic
excursion with the phantom avenel 
and a third the most recent all bore the
outline a mitre and the words hicjacet
eustatius ahhas for no one dared to add
a word commendation in favour his
learning and strenuous zeal for the roman
catholic faith
magdalen graeme looked at and perused
the brief records these monuments successively
and paused over that father
eustace in a good hour for thyself she
said but oh in an evil hour for the church
wert thou called from us let thy spirit be
with us holy man encourage thy successor
to tread in thy footsteps give him thy
bold and inventive capacity thy zeal and
thy discretion even tk piety exceeds
not his as she spoke a side door which
closed a passage from the abbot's house
into the church was thrown open that the
fathers might enter the choir and conduct
to the high altar the superior whom they
had elected
in former times this was one the most
the abbot 
splendid the many pageants which the
hierarchy rome had devised to attract
the veneration the faithful the period
during which the abbacy remained vacant
was a state mourning or as their emblematical
phrase expressed it widowhood 
a melancholy term which was changed into
rejoicing and triumph when a new superior
was chosen when the foldingdoors
were on such solemn occasions thrown
open and the new abbot appeared on the
threshold in fullblown dignity with ring
and mitre and dalmatia and crosier his
hoary standardbearers and his juvenile dispensers
 incense preceding him and the
venerable train monks behind him withall
besides which could announce the supreme
authority to which he was now raised
his appearance was a signal for the magnificent
jubilate to rise from the organ and
musicloft and to be joined by the corresponding
bursts hallelujah from the whole
assembled congregation now all was changed
in the midst rubbish and desolation
 the abbot
seven or eight old men bent and shaken as
much by grief and fear as by age shrouded
hastily in the proscribed dress their order
wandered like a procession spectres from
the door which had been thrown open up
through the encumbered passage to the
high altar there to instal their elected superior
a chief ruins it was like a band
 bewildered travellers chusing a chief in
the wilderness arabia or a shipwrecked
crew electing a captain upon the barren
island on which fate has thrown them
they who in peaceful times are most
ambitious authority among others shrink
from the competition at such eventful periods
when neither ease nor parade attend
the possession it and when it gives only
a painful preeminence both in danger and
in labour and exposes the ill fated chieftain
to the murmurs his discontented associates
as well as to the first assault the
common enemy but he on whom the office
 the abbot saint mary's was now
conferred had a mind fitted for the situathe
abbot 
tion to which he was called bold and enthusiastic
yet generous and forgiving 
wise and skilful yet zealous and prompt 
he wanted but a better cause than the support
 a decaying superstition to have
raised him to the rank a truly great man
but as the crowns the work it also
forms the rule by which it must be ultimately
judged and those who with sincerity
and generosity fight and fall in an
evil cause posterity can only compassionate
as victims a generous but fatal error
amongst these we must rank ambrosius
the last abbot kennaquhair whose designs
must be condemned as their success
would have rivetted on scotland the chains
 antiquated superstition and spiritual tyranny
 but whose talents in themselves
commanded respect and whose virtues
even from the enemies his faith extorted
esteem
the bearing the new abbot served 
itself to dignify a ceremonial which was deprived
 all other attributes grandeur
 the abbot
conscious the peril in which they stood
and recalling doubtless the better days
they had seen there hung over his brethren
an appearance mingled terror and
grief and shame which induced them to
hurry over the office in which they were
engaged as something at once degrading
and dangerous
but not so father ambrose his features
indeed expressed a deep melancholy
as he walked up the centre aisle
amid the ruins things which he considered
as holy but his brow was undetected
and his step firm and solemn he
seemed to think that the dominion which
he was about to receive depended in no
sort upon the external circumstances under
which it was conferred and if a mind
so firm was accessible to sorrow or fear it
was not on his own account but on that 
the church to which he had devoted himself

at length he stood on the broken steps
 the high altar barefooted as was the
the abbot 
rule and holding in his hand his pastoral
staff for the gemmed ring and jewelled
mitre had become secular spoils no obedient
vassals came man after man to make
their homage and to offer the tribute which
should provide their spiritual superior with
palfrey and trappings no bishop assisted
at the solemnity to receive into the
higher ranks the church nobility a dignitary
whose voice in the legislature was
as potential as his own with hasty and
maimed rites the few remaining brethren
stepped forward alternately to give their
new abbot the kiss peace in token
 fraternal affection and spiritual homage
mass was then hastily performed but in
such precipitation as if it had been hurried
over rather to satisfy the scruples ol
a few youths who were impatient to set
out on a hunting party than as if it made
the most solemn part a solemn ordination
the officiating priest faultered as he
spoke the service and often looked around
 the abbor
as if he expected to be interrupted in the
midst his office and the brethren listened
as to that which short as it was they
wished yet more abridged
these symptoms alarm increased as
the ceremony proceeded and as it seemed
were not caused by mere apprehension
alone for amid the pauses the hymn
there were heard without sounds a very
different sort beginning faintly and at a
distance but at length approaching close
to the exterior the church and stunning
with dissonant clamour those engaged in
the service the winding horns blown
with no regard to harmony or concert the
jangling bells the thumping drums
the squeaking bagpipes and the clash 
cymbals the shouts a multitude now
as in laughter now as in anger the shrill
tones female voices and those children
mingling with the deeper clamours 
men formed a babel sounds which first
drowned and then awed into utter silence
the abbot 
the official hymns the convent the
cause and result this extraordinary interruption
will be explained in the next
chapter
 the abbot
chapter xiv
not the wild billow when it breaks its barrier 
not the wild wind escaping from its cavern 
not the wild fiend that mingles both together
and pours their rage upon the ripening harvest
can match the wild freaks this mirthful meeting 
comic yet fearful droll and yet destructive
the conspiracy
the monks ceased their song which like
that the choristers in the legend the
witch berkeley died away in a quaver 
consternation j and like a flock chickens
disturbed by the presence the kite they
at first made a movement to disperse and
fly in different directions and then with
despair rather than hope huddled themselves
around their new abbot who retaining
the lofty and undismayed look which
had dignified him through the whole cerethe
abbot 
mony stood on the higher step the altar
as if desirous to be the most conspicuous
mark on which danger might discharge itself
and to save his companions by his selfdevotion
since he could afford them no
other protection
involuntarily as it were maid ale gram e
and the page stepped from the station which
hitherto they had occupied unnoticed and
approached to the altar as desirous sharing
the fate which approached the monks
whatsoever that might be both bowed reverently
love to the abbot and while magdalen
seemed about to speak the youth
looking towards the main entrance at which
the noise now roared most loudly and which
was at the same time assailed with much
knocking laid his hand upon his dagger
the abbot motioned to both to forbear 
 peace my sister he said in a low tone
but which being in a different key from the
tumultuary sounds without could be distinctly
heard even amidst the tumult 
 peace he said my sister j let the new
vol i n
 the abbot
superior saint mary's himself receive and
reply to the grateful acclamations the
vassals who come to celebrate his installation
and thou my son forbear i charge
thee to touch thy earthly weapon if it 
is the pleasure our protectress that her
shrine be this day desecrated by deeds 
violence and polluted by bloodshedding
let it not i charge you happen through the
deed a catholic son the church
the noise and knocking at the outer gate
became now every moment louder and
voices were heard impatiently demanding
admittance the abbot with dignity and
with a step which even the emergency 
danger rendered neither faultering nor precipitate
moved towards the portal and demanded
to know in a tone authority who
it was that disturbed their worship and what
they desired 
there was a moment's silence and then a
loud laugh from without at length a voice
replied we desire entrance into the
church and when the door is opened you
will soon see who we are
the abbot 
by whose authority do you require entrance
 said the father
 by authority the right reverend lord
abbot replied the voice from without 
and from the laugh which followed it seemed
as if there was something highly ludicrous
couched under this reply
i know not and seek not to know your
meaning replied the abbot since it is
probably a rude one but begone in the
name god and leave his servants in
peace i speak this as having lawful authority
to command here
 open the door said another rude
voice and we will try titles with you sir
monk and shew you a superior we must all
obey
 break open the doors if he dallies any
longer said a third and down with the
carrion monks who would bar us our privilege
a general shout followed ay
ay our privilege our privilege down with
the doors and with the lurdane monks if
they make opposition
the knocking was now exchanged for
 the abbot
blows math great hammers to which the
doors strong as they were must soon have
given way but the abbot who saw resists
ance would be vain and who did not wish
to incense the assailants by an attempt at
offering it besought silence earnestly and
with difficulty obtained a hearing my
children said he i will save you from
committing a great sin the porter will
presently undo the gate he is gone to fetch
the keys meantime i pray you to consider
if you are in a state mind to cross
the holy threshold
 tillyvalley for your papistry was answered
from without we are in the mood
 the monks when they are merriest and
that is when they sup beef brewis for lane
so if your porter hath not the
gout let him come speedily or we heave
away readily said i well comrades 
bravely said and it shall be as bravely
done said the multitude and had not
the keys arrived at that moment and the
porter in hasty terror performed his office
and thrown open the great door the popu
the abbot 
lace without would have saved him the trouble
the instant he had done so the affrighted
janitor fled like one who has drawn
the bolts a floodgate and expects to be
overwhelmed by the rushing inundation
the monks with one consent had withdrawn
themselves behind the abbot who
alone kept his station about three yards from
the entrance shewing no signs fear or
perturbation his brethren partly encouraged
by his devotion partly ashamed to
desert him and partly animated by a sense
 duty remained huddled close together
at the back their superior there was
a loud laugh and huzza when the doors were
opened j but contrary to what might have
been expected no crowd enraged assailants
rushed into the church on the
contrary there was a cry a halt a
halt to order my masters and let the two
reverend fathers greet each other as beseems
them
the appearance the crowd who were
thus called to order was grotesque in the
extreme it was composed men women
 the abbot
and children ludicrously disguised in various
habits and presenting groupes equally
diversified and ludicrous here one fellow
with a horse's head painted before him and
a tail behind and the whole covered with
a long footcloth which was supposed to
hide the body the animal ambled caracoled
pranced and plunged as he performed
the celebrated part the hobbiehorse
so often alluded to in our ancient drama 
and which still flourishes on the stage in
the battle that concludes bayes's tragedy
to rival the address and agility displayed by
this character another personage advanced
in the more formidable character a huge
dragon with gilded wings open jaws and
a scarlet tongue cloven at the which
made various efforts to overtake and devour
a lad dressed as the lovely sabsea daughter
 the king egypt who fled before him 
while a martial saint george grotesquely
armed with a goblet for a helmet and a
spit for a lance ever and anon interfered
and compelled the monster to relinquish
his prey a bear a wolf and one or two
the abbot 
other wild animals played their parts with
the discretion snug the joiner for the
decided preference which they gave to the
use their hind legs was sufficient without
any formal annunciation to assure the
most timorous spectators that they had to do
with habitual bipeds there was a groupe
 outlaws with robin hood and little
john at their head the best representation
exhibited at the time and no great wonder
since most the actors were by profession
the banished men and thieves whom they
presented other masqueraders there were
 a less marked description men were
disguised as women and women as men 
children wore the dress aged people and
tottered with crutchsticks in their hands
furred gowns on their little backs and caps
on their round heads while grandsires assumed
the infantine tone as well as the
dress children besides these many hat
their faces painted and wore their shirts
over the rest their dress while coloured
pasteboard and ribbands furnished out decorations
for others those who wanted
c the abbot
all these properties blacked their faces and
turned their jackets inside out and thus
the transmutation the whole assembly into
a set mad grotesque mummers was at
once completed
the pause which the masqueraders made
waiting apparently for some person the
highest authority amongst them gave those
within the abbey church full time to observe
all these absurdities they were at
no loss to comprehend their purpose and
meaning
few readers can be ignorant that at an
early period and during the plenitude 
her power the church rome not only
connived at but even encouraged such saturnalian
licenses as the inhabitants 
and the neighbourhood had now
in hand and that the vulgar on such occasions
where not only permitted but encouraged
by a number gambols sometimes
puerile and ludicrous sometimes immoral
and profane to indemnify themselves for
the privations and penances imposed on
tiem at other seasons but all other
the abbot 
topics for burlesque and ridicule the rites
and ceremonial the church itself were
most frequently resorted to and strange
to say with the approbation the clergy
themselves
while the hierarchy flourished in full
glory they do not appear to have dreaded
the consequences suffering the people to
become so irreverently familiar with things
sacred they then imagined the laity to
be much in the condition a labourer's
horse which does not submit to the bridle
and the whip with greater reluctance because
at rare intervals he is allowed to
frolic at large in his pasture and fling out
his heels in clumsy gambols at the master
who usually drives him but when times
changed when doubt the roman catholic
doctrine and hatred their priesthood
had possessed the reformed party the
clergy discovered too late that no small inconvenience
arose from the established practice
 games and merrymakings in which
they themselves and all they held most 
the abbot
cried were made the subject ridicule it
then became obvious to duller politicians
than the romish churchmen that the same
actions have a very different tendency when
done in the spirit sarcastic insolence and
hatred than when acted merely in exuberance
 rude and uncontrollable spirits
they therefore though the latest endeavoured
where they had any remaining
influence to discourage the renewal these
indecorous festivities in this particular the
catholic clergy were joined by most the
reformed preachers who were more shocked
at the profanity and immorality many 
these exhibitions than disposed to profit by
the ridiculous light in which they placed the
church rome and her observances but
it was long ere these scandalous and immoral
sports could be abrogated the rude multitude
continued attached to their favourite
pastimes and both in england and scotland
the mitre the catholic the rocket
 the reformed bishop and the cloak and
band the calvinistic divine were in
turn compelled to give place to these jocu
the abbot 
lar personages the pope fools the boybishop
and the abbot unreason
it was the latter personage who now in
full costume made his approach to the great
door the church st mary's accoutred
in such a manner as to form a caricature
or practical parody on the costume and
attendants the real superior whom he
came to beard on the very day his installation
in the presence his clergy and
in the chancel his church the mock
dignitary was a stoutmade undersized fellow
whose thick squab form had been rendered
grotesque by a supplemental paunch
well stuffed he wore a mitre leather
with the front like a grenadier's cap adorned
with mock embroidery and trinkets 
tin this surmounted a visage the nose 
which was the most prominent feature being
 unusual size and at least as richly
gemmed as his headgear his robe was 
from the interesting novel entitled anastatius t
seems the same burlesque ceremonies were practiced
in the greek church
 the abbot
buckram and his cope canvass curiously
painted and cut into open work on
one shoulder was fixed the painted figure
 an owl and he bore in the right hand
his pastoral staff and in the left a small
mirror having a handle to it thus resembling
a celebrated jester whose adventures
translated into english were whilom extremely
popular and which may still be procured
in black letter for about one pound
per leaf
the attendants this mock dignitary
had their proper dresses and equipage bearing
the same burlesque resemblance to the
officers the convent which their leader
did to the superior they followed their
leader in regular procession and the motley
characters which had waited his arrival
now crowded into the church in his train
shouting as they came a hall a hall for
the venerable father howleglas the learned
monk misrule and the right reverend
abbot unreason 
the discordant minstrelsy every kind
renewed its din the boys shrieked and
the abbot 
howled and the men laughed and halloed
and the women giggled and screamed and
the beasts roared and the dragon galloped
and hissed and the hobbyhorse neighed
pranced and capered and the rest frisked
and frolicked clashing their hobnailed shoes
against the pavement till it sparkled with
the marks their energetic caprioles
it was in fine a scene ridiculous confusion
that deafened the ear made the eyes
giddy and must have altogether stunned
any indifferent spectator whilst personal
apprehension and a consciousness that
much the popular enjoyment arose from
the ridicule being addressed against them
dismayed the monks who were moreover
little comforted by the reflection that
bold in their disguise the mummers who
whooped and capered around them might
on slight provocation turn their jest into
earnest or at least proceed to those practical
pleasantries which at all times arise
so naturally out the frolicsome and mischievous
disposition the metropolis 
they looked to their abbot amid the tusoi
the abbot
must with such looks as landsmen cast upon
the pilot when the storm is at the highest
 looks which express that they are devoid
 all hope arising from their own exertions
and not very confident in any success
likely to attend those their paulinus

the abbot himself specified at a stand 
he felt no fear but he was sensible the
danger expressing his rising indignation
which he was scarcely able to suppress he
made a gesture with his hand as if commanding
silence which was at first only replied
to by redoubled shouts and peals 
wild laughter when however the same
motion and as nearly in the same manner
had been made by howleglas it was immediately
obeyed by the riotous companions
who expected fresh food for mirth
in the conversation betwixt the real and
mock abbot having no small confidence
in the vulgar wit and impudence their
leader accordingly they began to shout
 to it fathersto it fight monk
the abbot 
fight madcap abbot against abbot is fair
play and so is reason against unreason and
malice against monkery 
 silence my mates said howleglas 
cannot two learned fathers the church
hold communing together but you must
come here with your beargarden whoop
and hollow as if you were hounding forth
a mastiff upon a mad bull i say silence 
and let this learned father and i confer
touching matters affecting our mutual state
and authority
my children said father ambrose
 mis children too and happy children
they are said his burlesque counterpart 
many a wise child knows not its own father
and it is well they have two to chuse
betwixt
 if thou hast aught in thee save scoffing
and ribaldry said the real abbot
 permit me for thine own soul's sake to
speak a few words to these misguided men
 aught in me but scoffing mayest thou 
retorted the abbot unreason why
reverend brother i have all that becomes
 the abbot
mine office at this time aday i have beef
ale and brandywine with other condiments
not worth mentioning and for
speaking man why speak away and we
will have turn about like honest fellows
during this discussion the wrath magdalen
graeme had risen to the uttermost 
she approached the abbot and placing herself
by his side said in a low and yet distinct
tone wake and arouse thee father
 the sword saint peter is in thy
hand strike and avenge saint peter's patrimony
 bind them in the chains which
being rivetted by the church on earth are
rivetted in heaven's
 peace sister said the abbot let
not their madness destroy our discretion 
i pray thee peace and let me do mine 
it is the first peradventure it may bethe
last time i shall be called on to discharge
it
nay my holy brother said howleglas
 i read you take the holy sister's advice
never throve convent without woman's
counsel s
the abbot 
 peace vain man said the abbot 
 and you my brethren 
nay nay said the abbot unreason
 no speaking to the lay people until you
have conferred with your brother the
cowl i swear by bell and candle
that not one my congregation shall listen
to one word you have to say so you had as
well address yourself to me who will
to escape a conference so ludicrous
the abbot again attempted an appeal to
what respectful feelings might yet remain
amongst the inhabitants the halidome
once so devoted to their spiritual superiors
alas the abbot unreason had only to
flourish his mock crosier and the whooping
the hallooing and the dancing were
renewed with a vehemence which would
have defied the lungs stentor
 and now my mates said the abbot
 unreason once again dight your gabs
and be hushed let us see if the cock 
kennaquhair will fight or flee the pit
there was again a dead silence expectation
 which father ambrose availed
 the abbot
himself to address his antagonist seeing
plainly that he could gain an audience on
no other terms wretched man said
he hast thou no better employment for
thy carnal wit than to employ it in leading
these blind and helpless creatures into the
pit utter darkness 
truly my brother replied howleglas
 i can see little difference betwixt your
employment and mine save that you make
a sermon a jest and i make a jest a
sermon
 unhappy being said the abbot who
hast no better subject pleasantry than
that which should make thee tremble no
sounder jest than thine own sins and no
better objects for laughter than those who
can absolve thee from the guilt them 
 verily my reverend brother said the
mock abbot what you say might be true
if in laughing at hypocrites i meant to
laugh at religion o it is a precious thing
to wear a long dress with a girdle and a
cowl we become a holy pillar mother
church and a boy must not play at ball
the abbot 
against the walls for fear breaking a
painted window
and will you my friends said the
abbot looking round and speaking with a
vehemence which secured him a tranquil
audience for some time will you suffer
a profane buffoon within the very church
 god to insult his ministers many 
you all you perhaps have lived under
my holy predecessors who were called upon
to rule in this church where i am called
upon to suffer if you have worldly goods
they are their gift and when you scorned
not to accept better gifts the mercy and
forgiveness the church were they not
ever at your command did we not pray
whileyouwerejovialwake while you slept
some the good wives the hali
dome were wont to say so said the abbot
 unreason but his jest met in this instance
but slight applause and father ambrose
having gained a moment's attention
hastened to improve it
 what said he j and is this grateful is
 the abbot
it seemly is it honest to assail with scorn
a few old men from whose predecessors you
hold all and whose only wish is to die in
peace among these fragments what was
once the light the land and whose daily
prayer is that they may be removed ere that
hour comes when the last spark shall be extinguished
and the land left in the darkness
which it has chosen rather than light we
have not turned against you the edge the
spiritual sword to revenge our temporal persecution
 the tempest your wrath has despoiled
us land and deprived us almost
 our daily food but we have not repaid
it with the thunders excommunication 
we only pray your leave to live and die
within the church which is our own invoking
god our lady and the holy saints
to pardon your sins and our own undisturbed
by scurril buffoonery and blasphemy

this speech so different in tone and termination
from that which the crowd had
expected produced an effect upon their
the abbot 
feelings unfavourable to the prosecution 
their frolic the more ice dancers stood
still the hobbyhorse surceased his capering
 pipe and tabor were mute and silence
like a heavy cloud seemed to descend
on the once noisy rabble several the
beasts were obviously moved to compunction
 the bear could not restrain his sobs
and a huge fox was observed to wipe his eyes
with his tail but in especial the dragon
lately so formidably rampant now relaxed
the terror his claws uncoiled his tremendous
rings and grumbled out his fiery
throat in a repentant tone by the mass
i thought no harm in exercising our old
pastime but an i had thought the good
father would have taken it so to heart i
would as soon have played your devil as
your dragon
in this momentary pause the abbot
stood amongst the miscellaneous and grotesque
forms by which he was surrounded
triumphant as saint anthony in ballots
temptations but howleglas would not so
resign his purpose
 the abbot
 and how now my masters said he 
 is this fair play or no have you not chosen
me abbot unreason and is it lawful
for any you to listen to common sense today
was i not formally elected by you in
solemn chapter held in luckier martin's
changehouse and will you now desert me
and give up your old pastime and privilege 
play out the play and he that speaks the
next word sense or reason or bids us
think or consider or the like that which
befits not the day i will have him solemnly
ducked in the milldam 
the rabble mutable as usual huzza'd
the pipe and tabor struck up the hobbyhorse
pranced the beasts roared and even
the repentant dragon began again to coil
up his spires and prepare himself for fresh
gambols but the abbot might have still
overcome by his eloquence and his entreaties
the malicious designs the revellers
had not dame magdalen graeme given
loose to the indignation which she had long
suppressed
the abbot 
 scoffers she said and men belial
blasphemous heretics and truculent tyrants

your patience my sister entreat and
i command you said the abbot let me
do my duty disturb me not in mine own
office 
but dame magdalen continued to thunder
forth her threats in the name popes
and councils and in the name every
saint from saint michael downward
my comrades said the abbot unreason
 this good dame hath not spoke a
single word reason and therein may
esteem herself free from the law but
what she spoke was meant for reason and
therefore unless she confesses and avouches
all which she has said to be nonsense it
shall pass for such so far as to incur the
penalty our statutes wherefore holy
dame pilgrim or abbess or whatever thou
art be mute with thy mummery or beware
the milldam we will have neither spiritual
nor temporal scolds in our diocese
 unreason 
 the abbot
as he spoke thus he extended his hand
towards the old woman while his followers
shouted a doom a doom and prepared
to second his purpose when lo it was suddenly
frustrated roland graeme had witnessed
with indignation the insults offered
to his old spiritual preceptor but yet had
wit enough to reflect he could render him
no assistance but might well by ineffective
interference make matters worse but when
he saw his aged relative in danger personal
violence he gave way to the natural
impetuosity his temper and stepping
forward struck his poniard into the body
 the abbot unreason whom the blow
instantly prostrated on the pavement
the abbot 
chapter xv
as when in tumults rise the ignoble crowd
mad are their motions and their tongues are loud
and stones and brands in rattling holies fly
and all the rustic arras which fury can supply 
then if some grave and pious man appear
they hush their noise and lend a listening ear
dryden's virgil
a dreadful shout vengeance was raised
by the revellers whose sport was thus
so fearfully interrupted but for an instant
the want weapons amongst the multitude
as well as the inflamed features and
brandished poniard roland grasme kept
them at bay while the abbot horrorstruck
at the violence implored with uplifted
hands pardon for bloodshed committed
within the holy sanctuary magdalen
grasme alone expressed triumph in the
vol i o
s the abbot
blow her descendant had dealt to the scoffer
mixed however with a wild and anxious
expression terror for her grandson's safety
 let him perish she said in his
blasphemy let him die en the holy pavement
which he has insulted
but the rage the multitude the grief
 the abbot the exultation the enthusiastic
magdalen were all mistimed and unnecessary
the mortally wounded howled
as he was supposed sprung alertly up
from the floor calling aloud a miracle
a miracle my masters as brave a miracle
as ever was wrought in the kirk kenna
quhair and i charge you my masters as
your lawfully chosen abbot that you touch
no one without my command you wolf
and bear will guard this pragmatic youth
but without hurting him and you reverend
brother will with your comrades
withdraw to your cells for our conference
has ended like all conferences leaving each
 his own mind as before and if we fight
both you and your brethren and the kirk
the abbot 
will have the worst on't wherefore pack
up your pipes and begone
the hubbub was beginning again to awaken
but still father ambrose hesitated as
uncertain to what path his duty called him
whether to face out the present storm or
to reserve himself for a better moment his
brother unreason observed his difficulty
and said in a tone more natural and less affected
than that with which he had hitherto
sustained his character we came hither
my good sir more in mirth than in mischief
 our bark is worse than our bite
and especially we mean you no personal
harm wherefore draw off while the play
is good j for it is ill whistling for a hawk
when she is once on the soar and worse to
snatch the quarry from the ban dog let
these fellows once begin their brawl and
it will be too much for madness itself let
alone the abbot unreason to bring them
back to the lure
the brethren crowded around father
ambrosius and joined in urging him to
 the abbot
give place to the torrent the present revel
was they said an ancient custom which his
predecessors had permitted and old father
nicholas himself had played the dragon
in the days the abbot ingram
 and we now reap the fruit the seed
which they have so unadvisedly sown said
ambrosius they taught men to make a
mock what is holy what wonder that the
descendants scoffers become robbers and
plunderers but be it as you list my bred
towards the contour and
you dame i command you by the authority
which i have over you and by your
respect for that youth's safety that you go
with us without farther speech yet stay
what are your intentions towards that
youth whom you detain prisoner wot ye
he continued addressing howleglas in a
stern tone voice that he bears the livery
 the house avenel they who fear
not the anger heaven may at least dread
the wrath man
 cumber not yourself concerning him
the abbot 
answered howleglas we know right well
who and what he is
 let me pray said the abbot in a tone
 entreaty that you do him no wrong
for the rash deed which he attempted in
his imprudent zeal
i say cumber not yourself about it
father answered howleglas but move
off with your train male and female or i
will not undertake to save yonder shesaint
from the duckingstool and as for bearings
malice my stomach has no room for
it it is he added clapping his hand on
his portly belly too well untasted outwith
straw and buckram gramercy to them
both they kept out that madcap's dagger
as well as a milan corslet could have done
in fact the homedriven poniard roland
graeme had lighted upon the stuffing
 the fictitious paunch which the abbot
 unreason wore as a part his characteristic
dress and it was only the force 
the blow which had prostrated that reverend
person on the ground for a moment
satisfied in some degree by this man's
 the abbot
assurances and compelled to give way to
superior force the abbot ambrosius retired
from the church at the head the
monks and left the court free for the revellers
to work their will but wild and
wilful as these rioters were they accompanied
the retreat the religions with none
 those shouts contempt and derision
with which they had at first hailed then
the abbot's discourse had affected some
 them with remorse others with shame
and all with a transient degree respect
they remained silent until the last monk
had disappeared through the sidedoor
which communicated with their dwellingplace
and even then it cost some exhortations
on the part howleglas some caprioles
 the hobbyhorse and some gallops
 the dragon to rouse once more the rebuked
spirit revelry
 and how now my masters said the
abbot unreason and wherefore look
on me with such blank jack a lent visages 
will you lose your old pastime for an oldwife's
tale saints and purgatory why
the abbot 
i thought you would have made all split
long since come strike up tabor and harp
strike up fiddle and beck dance and be
merry today and let care come tomorrow
bear and wolf look to your prisonerprance
hobby hiss dragon and halloo
boys we grow older every moment we
stand idle and life is too short to be spent
in playing mischance
this pithy exhortation was attended with
the effect desired they fumigated the
church with burnt wool and feathers instead
 incense put foul water into the
holywater basins and celebrated a parody
on the churchservice the mock abbot
officiating at the altar they sung ludicrous
and indecent parodies to the tune church
hymns they violated whatever vestments
or vessels belonging to the abbey they
could lay their hands upon and playing
every freak which the whim the moment
could suggest to their wild caprice at length
they fell to more lasting deeds demolition
pulled down and destroyed some 
the abbot
vet woodwork dashed out the painted
windows which had escaped former violence
and in their rigorous search after
sculpture dedicated to idolatry began to
destroy what ornaments yet remained entire
upon the tombs and around the cornices
 the pillars
the spirit demolition like other tastes
increases by indulgence from these lighter
attempts at mischief the more tumultuous
part the meeting began to meditate destruction
on a more extended scale let
lis heave it down altogether the old crow's
nest became a general cry among them 
 it has served the pope and his rooks too
long and up they struck a ballad which
was then popular among the lower classes
the pain that pagan full pride
hath blinded us over lang
for where the blind the blind doth lead
no marvel faith gae wrong
like prince and king
he led the ring
 all iniquity
sing hay trix trim go trix
under the greenwood tree
the abbot 
the bishop rich he could not preach
for sporting with the lasses
the silly friar behoved to fleece
for awmous as he passes
the curate his creed
he could not read
shame fa the company
sing hay trin trim go trin
under the greenwood tree
thundering out this chorus a notable
hunting song which had been pressed into
the service some polemical poet the followers
 the abbot unreason were turning
every moment more tumultuous and
getting beyond the management even 
that reverend prelate himself when a knight
in full armour followed by two or three
menatarms entered the church and in a
stern voice commanded them to forbear
their riotous mummery
his visor was up but if it had been lowered
the cognizance the hollybranch
sufficiently distinguished sir halbert glendining
who on his homeward road was
passing through the village kennaquhair
o 
 the abbot
and moved perhaps by anxiety for his brother's
safety had come directly to the
church on hearing the uproar
 what is the meaning this he said
my masters are ye christian men and
the king's subjects and yet waste and destroy
church and chancel like so many heathens

all stood silent though doubtless there
were several disappointed and surprised at
receiving chiding instead thanks from so
zealous a protestant
the dragon indeed did at length take
upon him to be spokesman and growled
from the depth his painted maw that
they did but sweep popery out the
church with the besom destruction
 what my friends replied sir albert
glendinning think you this mumming
and masking has not more popery
in it than have these stone walls take the
leprosy out your flesh before you speak
 purifying stone walls abate your insolent
license which leads but to idle vanity
the abbot 
and sinful excess and know that what you
now practise is one the profane and unseemly
sports introduced by the priests 
rome themselves to mislead and to brutish
the souls which fell into their net
 marry come up are you there with
your bears muttered the dragon with a
draconic sullenness which was in good
keeping with his character we had as
good have been romans still if we are to
have no freedom in our pastimes 
doest thou reply to me so said sir
halbert glendinning or is there any pastime
in grovelling on the ground there like
a gigantic kail worm get out thy
painted case or by my knighthood i will
treat you like the beast and reptile you have
made yourself
beast and reptile retorted the offended
dragon setting aside your knighthood
i hold myself as well a born man as
thyself
the knight made no answer in words
but bestowed two such blows with the butt
 the abbot
 his lance on the petulant dragon that
had not the hoops which constituted the
ribs the machine been pretty strong they
would hardly have saved those the actor
from being broken in all haste the masquer
crept out his disguise unwilling to
abide a third buffet from the lance the
enraged knight and when the exdragon
stood on the floor the church he presented
to halbert glendinning the wellknown
countenance dan the howletfirst
an ancient comrade his own ere
fate had raised him so high above the rank
to which he was born the clown looked
sulkily upon the knight as if to upbraid
him for his violence towards an old acquaintance
and glendinning's own good
nature reproached him for the violence he
had acted upon him
 i did wrong to strike thee he said
dan but in truth i knew thee not
thou wert ever a mad fellow come to 
castle and we will see how my hawks
fly
the abbot 
and if we shew him not falcons that
will mount as merrily as rockets said the
abbot unreason i would your honour
laid as hard on my bones as you did on his
even now
 how now sir knave said the knight
and what has brought you hither 
the abbot hastily ridding himself the
false nose which mystified his physiognomy
and the supplementary belly which
made up his disguise stood before his master
in his real character adam woodcock
the falconer avenel
how varlet said the knight hast
thou dared to come here and disturb the
very house my brother was dwelling in 
 and it was even for that reason craving
your honour's pardon that i came hir
ther for i heard the country was to be upto
chuse an abbot unreason and sure
thought i i that can sing dance leap
backwards over a broadsword and am as
good a fool as ever sought promotion have
all chance carrying the office and if i
gain my election i may stand his honour's
 the abbot
brother in some stead supposing things fall
roughly out at the kirk saint mary's
 thou art but a cogging knave said
sir halbert and well i wot that love 
ale and brandy besides the humour riot
and frolic would draw thee a mile when
love my house would not bring thee a
yard but go to carry thy roisterers elsewhere
 to the alehouse if they list and
there are crowns to pay your charges 
make out the day's madness without doing
more mischief and be wise men tomorrow
and hereafter learn to serve a good cause
better than by acting like ruffians
obedient to his master's mandate the
falconer was collecting his discouraged followers
and whispering into their ears 
 away away tace is latin for a candle 
never mind the good knight's puritanism
we will play the frolic out over a stand
 double ale in dame martin the brewster's
barn yard draw off harp and tabor
bagpipe and drum mum till you are out
 the churchyard then let the welkin ring
again move on wolf and bear keep the
the abbot 
hind legs till you cross the kirkstyle and
then shew yourselves beasts mettle 
what devil sent him here to spoil our holiday
 but anger him not my heart his
lance is no goose feather as dan's ribs can
tell
 by my soul said dan had it been
another than my ancient comrade i would
have made my father's old fox fly about
his ears 
hush hush man replied adam
woodcock not a word that way as you
value the safety your bones what man 
we must take a clink as it passes so it is not
bestowed in downright illwill
but i will take no such thing said
dan the howletfirst sullenly resisting
the efforts woodcock who was dragging
him out the church when the quick
military eye sir halbert glendinning
detecting roland graeme betwixt his two
guards the knight exclaimed so ho 
falconer woodcock knave hast thou
brought my lady's page in mine own 
the abbot
very to assist at this hopeful revel thine
with your wolves and bears since you
were at such mumming you might if
you would have at least saved the credit
 my household by dressing him up as a
jackannales bring him hither fellows 
adam woodcock was too honest and
downright to permit blame to light upon
the youth when it was undeserved i
swear he said by saint martin bull
lions 
 and what hast thou to do with saint
martin 
nay little enough sir unless when he
sends such rainy days that we cannot fly a
hawk but i say to your worshipful knighthood
that as i am a true man
 as you are a false varlet had been the
better obtestation
 nay if your knighthood allows me not
to speak i can hold my tongue but the
boy came not hither by my bidding for all
that
but to gratify his own malapert pleathe
abbot 
sure i warrant me said sir halbert glendining
 come hither young springald
and tell me whether you have your mistress's
license to be so far absent from the castle
or to dishonour my livery by mingling in
such a maygame 
sir halbert glendinning answered
roland grasme with steadiness i have
obtained the permission or rather the commands
 your lady to dispose my time
hereafter according to my own pleasure i
have been a most unwilling spectator 
this maygame since it is your pleasure so
to call it and i only wear your livery until
i can obtain clothes which bear no such
badge servitude
 how am i to understand this young
man said sir halbert glendinning speak
plainly for i am no reader riddles that
my lady favoured thee i know what hast
thou done to disoblige her and occasion
thy dismissal 
nothing to speak said adam woods
the abbot
cock answering for the boy a foolish
quarrel with me which was more foolishly
told over again to my honoured lady cost
the poor boy his place for my part i
will say freely that i was wrong from beginning
to except about the washing
 the eyass's meat there i stand to it
that i was right
with that the goodnatured falconer
repeated to his master the whole history 
the squabble which had brought poland
graeme into disgrace with his mistress butin
a manner so favourable for the page that
sir halbert could not but suspect his generous
motive
 thou art a goodnatured fellow he
said adam woodcock
 as ever had falcon upon fist said
adam and for that matter so is master
roland but being half a gentleman by
his office his blood is soon up and so is
mine
well said sir halbert be it as it
the abbot 
will my lady has acted hastily for this was
no great matter offence to discard the
lad whom she had trained up for years j
but he i doubt not made it worse by his
prating it jumps well with a purpose however
which i had in my mind draw off
these people woodcock and you roland
grseme attend me
the page followed him in silence into
the abbot's house where stepping into
the first apartment which he found open
he commanded one his attendants to let
his brother master edward glendinning
know that he desired to speak with him
the menatarms went gladly off to join
their comrade adam woodcock and the
jolly crew whom he had assembled at dame
martin's the hostler's wife and the page
and knight were left alone in the apartment
sir halbert glendinning paced the
floor for a moment in silence and then
thus addressed his attendant
thou mayest have remarked stripling
 the abbot
that i have but seldom distinguished thee
by much notice i see thy colour rises but
do not speak till thou hearest me out i
say i have never much distinguished thee
not because i did not see that in thee
which i might well have praised but because
i saw something blameable which
such praises might have made worse thy
mistress dealing according to her pleasure
in her own household as no one hath better
reason or title had picked thee from
the rest and treated thee more like a relation
than a domestic and if thou didst
shew some vanity and petulance under such
distinction it were injustice not to say
that thou hast profited both in thy exercises
and in thy breeding and hast shown
many sparkles a gentle and manly spirit
moreover it were ungenerous having bred
thee up freakish and fiery to dismiss thee
to want or wandering for shewing that very
peevishness and impatience discipline
which arose from thy too delicate nurture
therefore and for the credit my own
the abbot 
household i am determined to retain thee
in my train until i can honourably dispose
 thee elsewhere with a fair prospect 
thy going through the world with credit to
the house that brought thee up
if there was something in sir halbert
glendinning's speech which flattered roland's
pride there was also much that according
to his mode thinking was an
alloy to the compliment and yet his conscience
instantly told him that he ought to
accept with grateful deference the offer
which was made him by the husband his
kind protectress and his prudence however
slender could not but admit he would
enter the world under very different auspices
as a retainer sir halbert blending
so famed for wisdom courage and
influence from those under which he might
partake the wanderings and become an
agent in the visionary schemes for such
they appeared to him magdalen his relative
still a strong reluctance to reenter
 the abbot
a service from which he had been dismissed
with contempt almost counterbalanced
these considerations
sir halbert looked on the youth with
surprise and resumed you seem to hesitate
young man are your own prospects
so inviting that you should pause ere
you accept those which i offer to you t or
must i remind you that although you have
offended your benefactress even to the
point her dismissing you yet i am convinced
the knowledge that you have gone
unguided on your own wild way into a
world so disturbed as ours scotland
cannot in the upshot but give her sorrow
and pain from which it is in gratitude
your duty to preserve her no less than it
is in common wisdom your duty to accept
my offered protection for your own sake
where body and soul are alike endangered
should you refuse it
roland graeme replied in a respectful
tone but at the same time with some spirit
the abbot 
i am not ungrateful for such countenance
as has been afforded me by the lord 
and i am glad to learn for the first
time that i have not had the misfortune to
be utterly beneath his observation as i had
thought and it is only needful to shew
me how i can testify my duty and my gratitude
towards my early and constant benefactress
with my life's hazard and i will
gladly peril it he stopped
these are but words young man answered
glendinning large protestations
are often used to supply the place effectual
service i know nothing in which the
peril your life can serve the lady 
 i can only say she will be pleased to
learn you have adopted some course which
may ensure the safety your person and
the weal your soul what ails you that
you accept not that safety when it is offered
you 
my only relative who is alive answered
roland at least the only relative whom
i have ever seen has rejoined me since i
sc the abbot
was dismissed from the castle avenel 
and i must consult with her whether i can
adopt the line to which you now call me
or whether her encreasing infirmities or the
authority which she is entitled to exercise
over me may not require me to abide with
her
 where is this relation said sir albert
glendinning
in this house answered the page
 go then and seek her out said the
knight avenel more than meet it is
that thou shouldst have her approbation
yet worse than foolish would she shew herself
in denying it
roland left the apartment to seek for his
grandmother and as he retreated the abbot
entered
the two brothers met as brothers who
love each other fondly yet meet rarely together
such indeed was the case their
mutual affection attached them to each
other but in every pursuit habit or sentiment
connected with the discords the
the abbot s
tides the friend and counsellor murray
stood opposed to the roman catholic priest
nor indeed could they have held very much
society together without giving cause 
offence and suspicion to their confederates
on each side after a close embrace on
the part both and a welcome on that
 the abbot sir halbert glendinning expressed
his satisfaction that he had come
in time to appease the riot raised by howhellas
and his tumultuous followers
and yet he said when i look on
your garments brother edward i cannot
help thinking there still remains an abbot
 unreason within the bounds the monastery

and wherefore carp at my garments
brother halbert said the abbot it is
the spiritual armour my calling and as
such beseems me as well as breastplate and
baldric become your own bosom
 ay but there were small wisdom methinks
in putting on armour where we have
vol r p
oi
 the abbot
 power to fight it is but a dangerous
temerity to defy the foe whom wee cannot
resist
for that my brother no one can answer
said the abbot until the battle be
fought and were it even as you say methinks
a brave man though desperate 
victory would rather desire to fight and
fall than to resign sword and shield on some
mean and dishonourable composition with
his insulting antagonist but let not you
and i make discord a theme on which vie
cannot agree but rather stay and partake
though a heretic my admission feast
you need not fear my brother that your
zeal for restoring the primitive discipline
 the church will on this occasion be offended
with the rich profusion a conventual
banquet the days our old friend
abbot boniface are over and the superior
 saint mary's has neither forests nor fishings
woods nor pastures nor cornfields 
neither flocks nor herds bucks nor wildthe
abbot 
fowl granaries wheat nor storehouses
 oil and wine ale and mead the
refectioners office is ended and such a
meal as a hermit in romance can offer to
a wandering knight is all we have to set
before you bat if you will share it with
us we will eat it with a cheerful heart and
thank you my brother for your timely protection
against these rude scoffers
 my dearest brother said the knight
 it grieves me deeply i cannot abide with
you j but it would sound ill for us both were
one the reformed congregation to sit
down at your admission feast and if i can
ever have the satisfaction affording you
effectual protection it will be much owing
to my remaining unsuspected countenancing
or approving your religious rites
and ceremonies it will demand whatever
consideration i can acquire among my own
friends to shelter the bold man who contrary
to law and the edicts parliament
has dared to take up the office abbot 
saint mary's
 the abbot
 trouble not yourself with the task my
brother replied father ambrosius i
would lay down my dearest blood to know
that you defended the church for the
church's sake but while you refrain unhappily
her enemy i would not that you
endangered your own safety or diminished
your own comforts for the sake my individual
protection but who comes hitherto
disturb the few minutes fraternal
communication which our evil fate allows
us
the door the apartment opened as the
abbot spoke and dame magdalen graeme
entered
 who is this woman said sir halbert
glendinning somewhat sternly and what
does she want 
 that you know me not said the ma
tron signifies little i come by your own
order to give my free consent that the
stripling leland graeme return to your
service j and having saidso i cumber you
no longer with my presence peace be with
you she turned to go away but was
the abbot 
stopped by the enquiries sir halbert
glendinning
 who are you what are you and
why do you not await to make me answer 
i was she replied while yet i belonged
to the world a matron no vulgar
name now i am magdalen a poorpilgrim
er for the sake holy kirk
 yea said sir halbert art thou a catholic
 i thought my dame said that roland
graeme came reformed kin
 his father said the matrons was a
heretic or rather one who regarded neither
orthodoxy nor heresy neither the temple
 the church or antichrist i too for
the sins the times make sinners have
seemed to conform to your unhallowed
rites but i had my dispensation and my
absolution
you see brother said sir halbert
with a smile meaning towards his brother
 that we accuse you not altogether
grounds mental equivocation
 my brother you do us injustice rep

 the abhor
plied the abbot this woman as her bearing
may itself warrant you is not in her
perfect mind thanks i must needs say
to the persecution your marauding barons
and your latitudinarian clergy
 i will not dispute the point said sir
halbert the evils the time are unhappily
so numerous that both churches may
divide them and have enow to spare so
saying he leaned from the window the
apartment and winded his bugle
why do you sound your horn my brother
 said the abbot we have spent but
few minutes together
alas said the elder brother and
even these few have been sullied by disagreement
i sound to horse my brother 
the rather that to avert the consequences 
this day's rashness on your part requires
hasty efforts on mine dame you will
oblige me by letting your young relative
know thatwe mount instantly i intend not
that he shall return to avenel with me it
would lead to new quarrels betwixt him and
my household j at least to taunts which his
the abbor 
proud heart could ill brook and my wish
is to do him kindness he shall therefore
go forward to edinburgh with one ray retinue
whom i shall send back to say what
has chanced here you seem rejoiced at
this he added fixing his eyes keenly on
magdalen greene who returned his gaze
with calm indifference
 i would rather she said that roland
a poor and friendless orphan were
the jest the world at large than the
menials at avenel
 fear not dame he shall be scorned
by neither answered the knight
 it may be she replied it may well
be but i will trust more to his own bearing
than to your countenance she iefc
the room as she spoke
the knight looked after her as she departed
but turned instantly to his brother
and expressing in the most affectionate
terms his wishes for his welfare and happiness
craved his leave to depart my
knaves he said are too busy at the 
the abbot
stand to leave their revelry for the empty
breath a bugle horn
you have freed them from higher restraint
halbert answered the abbot and
therein taught them to rebel against your
own
 fear not that edward exclaimed
halbert who never gave his brother his
monastic name ambrosius j none obey
the command real duty so well as those
who are free fiom the observance slavish
bondage
he was turning to depart when the abbot
said let us not yet part brother 
here comes some light refreshment leave
not the house which i must now call mine
till force expel me from it until you have
at least broken bread with me
the poor lay brother the same who acted
as porter now entered the apartment
bearing some simple refreshment and a
flask wine he had found it he said
with officious humility by rummaging
through every nook the cellar
the abbot 
the knight filled a small silver cup and
quaffing it off asked his brother to pledge
him observing the wine was bacharac 
the first vintage and great age
ay said the poor lay brother it
came out the nook which old brother
nicholas may his soul be happy was wont
to call abbot ingram's corner and abbot
ingram was bred at the convent 
wartburg which i understand to be near
where that choice wine grows 
 true my reverend sir said sir haubert
 and therefore i entreat my brother
and you to pledge me in a cup this orthodox
vintage
the thin old porter looked vith a wish
i'll glance towards the abbot do venial
said his superior and the old man
seized with a trembling hand a beverage
to which he had been long unaccustomed
drained the cup with protracted delight as
if dwelling on the flavour and perfume
and set it down with a melancholy smile
and shake the head as if bidding adieu
 the abbot
in future to such delicious potations the
brothers smiled but when sir halbert motioned
to the abbot to take up his cup and
do him reason the abbot in turn shook his
head and replied this is no day for the
abbot saint mary's to eat the fat and
drink the sweet in water from our lady's
well he added filling a cup with the limpid
element i wish you my brother all
happiness and above all a true sight 
your spiritual errors
and to you my beloved edward replied
glendinning wish the free exercise
 your own free reason and the discharge
 more important duties than are
connected with the idle name which you
have so rashly assumed
the brothers parted with deep regret y
and yet each confident in his own opinion
felt somewhat relieved by the absence 
one whom he respected so much and with
whom he could agree so little
soon afterwards the sound the knight
 avenei's trumpets were heard and the
the abbot st
abbot went to the top a tower from
whose dismantled battlements he could
soon see the horsemen ascending the riship
ground in the direction the drawbridge
as he gazed magdalen graeme
came to his side
 thou art come he said to catch
the last glimpse thy grandson my sister
yonder he wends under the charge the
best knight in scotland his faith ever excepted

 thou canst bear witness my father
that it was no vish either mine or roland's
replied the matron which induced
the knight avenel as he is called
again to entertain my grandson in his households
 heaven which confounds the wise
with their own wisdom and the wicked with
their own policy hath placed him wherefor
the service the church i would most
wish him to be
i know not what you mean my sister
said the abbot
reverend father replied magdalen
 hast thou never heard that there are spits
the abbot
its powerful to rend the walls a castle
asunder when once admitted which yet
cannot enter the house unless they are invited
nay dragged over the threshold 
twice hath roland grseme been thus
drawn into the household avenel by
those who now hold the title let them
look to the issue
so saying she left the turret and the
abbot after pausing a moment on her
words which hf imputed to the unsettled
state her mind followed down the winding
stair to celebrate his admission to his
high office by fast and prayer instead 
revelling and thanksgiving

youth i thou dearest to manhood now
darker lip and darker brow
statelier step more pensive mien
in thy face and gait are seen 
thou must now brook midnight watches
take thy food and sport by snatches 
for the gambol and the jest
thou wert wont to love the best
graver follies must thou follow
but as senseless false and hollow
life a poem
young roland gkme now trotted
gaily forward in the train sir halbert glen
dinning he was relieved from his most
galling apprehension the encounter 
the scorn and taunt which might possibly
 the abbot
hail his immediate return to the castle 
avenel there will be a change ere they
see me again he thought to himself i shall
wear the coat plate instead the buff
jerkin and the steel morion for the bonnet
and feather they will be bold that may
venture to break a gibe on the manalarms
for the follies the page and i trust that
ere we return i shall have done something
more worthy note than hallooing a hound
after a deer or scrambling a crag for a kite's
nest he could not indeed help marvelling
that his grandmother with all her religious
prejudices leaning it would seem to
the other side had consented so readily to
his reentering the service the house 
avenel and yet more at the mysterious
joy withvhich she took leave him at the
abbey
 heaven said the dame as she kissed
her young relation and bade him farewell
 works its oyn work even by the hands
 those our enemies who think themselves
the strongest and the wisest thou
the abbot 
my child be ready to act upon the call 
thy religion and country and remember
each earthly bond which thou canst form is
compared to the ties which bind thee to
them like the loose flax to the twisted cable
thou hast not forget the face or form
 the damsel catherine seyton 
roland would have replied in the negative
but the word seemed to stick in his
throat and magdalen continued her exhortations

 thou must not forget her my son and
here i entrust thee with a token which i
trust thou wilt speedily find an opportunity
 delivering with care and secrecy into
her own hand
she put here into roland's hand a very
small packet which she again enjoined
him to take the strictest care and to suffer
it to be seen by no one save catherine
seyton who she again unnecessarily reminded
him was the young maiden he had
met on the preceding day she then bec
the abbot
stowed on him her solemn benediction and
bade god speed him
there was something in her manner and
her conduct which implied mystery but
roland graeme was not an age or temper
to waste much time in endeavouring to
decipher her meaning all that was obvious
to his perception in the present journey
promised pleasure and novelty he
rejoiced that he was travelling towards
edinburgh in order to assume the character
 a man and lay aside that a boy he
was delighted to think that he would have
an opportunity rejoiningcatherinesey ton
whose bright eyes and lively manners had
made so favourable an impression on his
imagination and as an inexperienced yet
highspirited youth entering for the first
time upon active life his heart bounded at
the thought that he was about to see all
those scenes courtly splendour and warlike
adventures which the followers 
sir halbert used to boast on their occa
the abbot 
signal visits to avenel to the wonderment
and envy those who like roland knew
courts and camps only by hearsay and
were condemned to the solitary sports and
almost monastic seclusion avenel surrounded
by its lonely lake and embosomed
among its pathless mountains they shall
mention my name he said to himself if
the risk my life can purchase me opportunities
 distinction and catherine seyton's
saucy eye shall rest with more respect
on the distinguished soldier than that with
which she laughed to scorn the raw and inexperienced
page there was wanting but
one accessary to complete the sense rapturous
excitation and he possessed it by
being once more mounted on the back 
a fiery and active horse instead plodding
along on foot as had been the case during
the preceding days
impelled by the liveliness his own spirits
which so many circumstances tended
naturally to exalt roland graeme's voice
and his laughter were soon distinguished
b the abbot
amid the trampling the horses the retinue
and more than once attracted the attention
 their leader who remarked with
satisfaction that the youth replied with
goodhumoured raillery to such the train
as jested with him on his dismissal and return
to the service the house avenel
 i thought the holly branch in your
bonnet had been blighted master roland
said one the menatarms
 only pinched with half an hour's frost 
you see it flourishes as green as ever
 it is too grave a plant to flourish on so
hot a soil as that headpiece thine master
roland gramme retorted the other
who was an old equerry sir halbert
glendinning
 if it will not flourish alone said roland
 i will mix it with the laurel and the
myrtle and i will carry them so near the
sky that it shall make amends for their
stinted growth 
thus speaking he dashed his spurs into
his horse's sides and checking him at the
same time compelled him to execute a lofty
the abbot 
caracole sir halbert glendinning looked
at the demeanour his new attendant with
that sort melancholy pleasure with which
those who have long followed the pursuits
 life and are sensible their vanity regard
the gay young and buoyant spirits
to whom life as yet is only hope and promise

in the meanwhile adam woodcock the
falconer stripped his pasquin habit and
attired according to his rank and calling
in a green jerkin with a bag on the one
side and a short hanger on the other a
glove on his left hand which reached half
vay up his arm and a bonnet and feather
upon his head came after the party as fast
as his active little gallowaynag could trot
and immediately entered into parley with
roland graeme
 so my youngster you are once more
under shadow the holly branch 
c and in case to repay you my good
friend answered roland your ten groats
 silver
a 
 the abbot
 which but an hour since said the
falconer you had nearly paid me with
ten inches steel on my faith it is written
in the our destiny that i must
brook your dagger after all
 nay speak not that my good
friend said the youth i would rather
have broached my own bosom than yours 
but who could have known you in the mumming
dress you wore 
yes the falconer resumed for both
as a poet and actor he had his own professional
share selfconceit i think i was
as good an howleglas as ever played part
at a shrovetide revelry and not a much
worse abbot unreason i defy the old
enemy to unmask me when i chuse to keep
my vizard on what the devil brought the
knight on us before we had the game out
you would have heard me hollo my own
new ballad with a voice should have reached
to berwick but i pray you master
roland be less free cold steel on slight
occasions j for but for the stuffing my
the abbot 
reverend doublet i had only left the kirk
to take my place in the kirkyard
nay spare me that feud said roland
graeme we shall have no time to fight
it out for by our lord's command i am
bound for edinburgh
i know it said adam woodcock
and even therefore we shall have time ta
solder up this rent by the way for sir albert
has appointed me your companion and
guide
ay and with what purpose said
the page
that said the falconer is a question
i cannot answer but i know that bethe
food the ey asses washed or unwashed
and indeed whatsoever becomes 
perch and mew i am to go with you to
edinburgh and see you safely delivered to
the regent at holyrood
 how to the regent said roland in
surprise
 ay by my faith to the regent replied
woodcock j i promise you that if
 the abbot
you are not to enter his service at least
you are to wait upon him in the character
 a retainer our knight avenel
 i know no right said the youth
 which the knight avenel hath to
transfer my service supposing that i owe
it to himself
hush hush said the falconer that
is a question i advise no one to stir in until
he has the mountain or the lake or the
march another kingdom which is better
than either betwixt him and his feudal superior

 but sir halbert glendinning said the
youth is not my feudal superior nor has
he aught authority 
 i pray you my son to rein your
tongue answered adam woodcock my
lord's displeasure if you provoke it will be
worse to appease than my lady's the
touch his least finger were heavier than
her hardest blow and by my faith he is
a man steel as true and as pure but as
hard and as pitiless you remember the
the abbot t
cock capellae whom he hanged over
his gate for a mere mistake a poor yoke
 oxen taken in scotland when he thought
he was taking them in english land i loved
the cock capperlaw the kerr had not
an honest man in their clan and they
have had men that might have been a pattern
to the border men that would not
have lifted under twenty cows at once and
would have held themselves dishonoured if
they had taken a drift sheep or the like
but always managed their raids in full credit
and honour but see his worship halts
and we are close by the bridge ride up
ride up we must have his last instructions

it was as adam woodcock said in the
hollow way descending towards the bridge
which was still in the guardianship peter
bridge ward as he was called though he
was now very old sir halbert glendinning
halted his retinue and beckoned to woodcock
and greene to advance to the head
 the train
 the abbot
 woodcock said he thou knowest
to whom thou art to conduct this youth
and thou young man obey discreetly and
with diligence the orders that shall be
given thee curb thy vain and peevish
temper be just true and faithful and
there is in thee that which may raise thee
many a degree above thy present station
neither shalt thou always supposing thine
efforts to be fair and honest want the protection
and countenance avenel
leaving them in front the bridge
whose centre tower now began to cast a
prolonged shade upon the river the knight
 avenel turned to the left without crossing
the river and pursued his way towards
the chain hills within whose recesses are
situated the lake and castle avenel
there remained behind the falconer roland
graeme and a domestic the knight
 inferior rank who was left with them to
look after their horses while on the road
to carry their baggage and to attend to
their convenience
the abbot 
so soon as the more numerous body 
riders had turned off to pursue their journey
westward those whose route lay across
the river and was directed towards the
north summoned the bridgeward and demanded
a free passage
i will not lower the bridge answered
peter in a voice querulous with age and
illhumour come papist come protestant
ye are all the same the papist threatened
us with purgatory and fleeced us
with pardons the protestant mints at us
with the sword and cuttle us with the liberty
 conscience but the never a one 
either says peter there is your penny i
am well tired all this and for no man
shall the bridge fall that pays me not ready
money and i would have you inow i care
as little for geneva as for rome as little
for homilies as for pardons and the silver
pennies are the only passports i will hear

 here is a proper old chuff said 
title abbot
cock to his companion then raising his
voice he exclaimed hark thee dog 
bridgeward villain doest thou think we
have refused peter's pence to rome to pay
thine at the bridge kennaquhair let
thy bridge down instantly to the followers
 the house avenel or by the hand 
my father and that handled many a bridle
rein for he was a bluff yorkshireman i
say by my father's hand our knight will
blow thee out thy solangoose's nest therein
the middle the water with the light
falconet which we are bringing southward
from edinburgh tomorrow
the bridgeward heard and muttered
 a plague on falcon and falconet on cannon
and demicannon and all the barking
bulldogs whom they halloo against stone
and lime in these our days it was a merry
time when there was little besides handy
blows and it may be a flight arrows
that harmed an ashley wall as little as so
many hailstones but we must jowl and
the abbot it
let the jaw gang by comforting him
self in his state diminished consequence
with this pithy old proverb peter bridgeward
lowered the drawbridge and permitted
them to pass over at the sight his
white hair albeit it discovered a visage
equally peevish through age and misfortune
roland was inclined to give him an alms
but adam woodcock withheld him e'en
let him pay the penalty his former churlishness
and greed he said j the wolf
when he has lost his teeth should be treated
no better than a cur
leaving the bridgeward to lament the
alteration times which sent domineering
soldiers and feudal retainers to his place 
passage instead peaceful pilgrims and
reduced him to become the oppressed instead
 playing the extortioner the travellers
turned them northward and adam
woodcock well acquainted with that part
 the country proposed to cut short a
considerable portion the road by travers
the abbot
sing the little vale glendearg so famous
for the adventures which befel therein during
the earlier part the benedictine's
manuscript with these and with the thousand
commentaries representations and
misrepresentations to which they had given
rise roland graeme was course well
acquainted for in the castle avenel as
well as in other great establishments the
inmates talked nothing so often or with
such pleasure as the private affairs 
their lord and lady but while roland was
viewing with interest these haunted scenes
in which things were said to have passed
beyond the ordinary laws nature adam
woodcock was still regretting in his secret
soul the unfinished revel and the unsung
ballad and kept every now and then breaking
out with some such verses as these 
 the friars fail drank berrybrown ale
the best that ere was tasted 
the monks morose made gude kale
on fridays when they fasted
the abbot 
saint romance sister
the grey priest kist her 
fiend save the company 
sing hey trin
trim go trin
under the greenwood tree
by my hand friend woodcock said
the page though i know you for a hardy
gospeller that fear neither saint nor devil
yet if i were you i would not sing your
profane songs in this valley glendearg
considering what has happened here before
our time
a straw for your wandering spirits
said adam woodcock i mind them no
more than an earn cares for a string 
wild geese they have all fled since the
pulpits were filled with honest men and the
people's ears with sound doctrine nay i
have a touch at them in my ballad an i
had but had the good luck to have it sung
to j and again he set off in the same
key
from haunted spring and grassy rings
troop goblin elf and fairy 
 the abbot
and the kelpie must flit from the black bogpits
and the brownie must not tarry 
to limbolake
their way they take
with scarce the pith to flee
sing hey trin
trim go trin
under the greenwood tree
i think he added that could sir albert's
patience have stretched till we came
that length he would have had a hearty
laugh and that is what he seldom enjoys
 if it be all true that men tell his early
life said roland he has less right to
laugh at goblins than most men
 ay i it be all true answered adam
woodcock but who can insure us 
that moreover these were but tales the
monks used to gull us simple laymen withal
 they knew that fairies and hobgoblins
brought aves and paternosters into repute 
but now we have given up worship images
in wood and stone methinks were no
time to be afraid bubbles in the water or
shadows in the air
the abbot 
 but said roland graeme as the catholics
say they do not worship wood or
stone but only as emblems the holy
saints and not as things holy in themselves

 pshaw pshaw answered the falconer
 a rush for their prating they told
us another story when these baptized idols
 theirs brought pikestaves and sandalled
shoon from all the four winds and chilled
the old women out their corn and
their candleends and their butter bacon
wool and cheese and when not so much
as a grey groat escaped tithing
roland graeme had been long taught by
necessity to consider his form religion asa
profound secret and to say nothing whatsoever
in its defence when assailed lest he
should draw on himself the suspicion belonging
to the unpopular and exploded
church he therefore suffered adam woodcock
to triumph without farther opposition
marvelling in his own mind whether any 
the goblins formerly such active agents
 the abbot
would avenge his rude raillery before they
left the valley glendearg but no such
consequences followed they passed the
night quietly in a cottage in the glen and
the next day resumed their route to edinburgh

this then is edinburgh said the
youth as the fellowtravellers arrived at one
 the heights to the southward which commanded
a view the great northern capital
 this is that edinburgh which we
have heard so much 
 even so said the falconer yonder
stands auld reekie you may see the
smoke hover over her at twenty miles distance
as the goeshawk hangs over a plump

gives is felt from the edge sol way to

ground that is the castle craigmillar
which i have known a merry place in my
time
 was it not there said the page in a
low voice that the queen held her
court 
ay ay replied the falconer queen
she was then though you must not call her
so now well they may say what they will
i many a true heart will be sad for mary
stuart e'en if all be true men say her
for look you master rolandshe was the
loveliest creature to look upon that i ever

who could judge a hawk's flight as well as
any man in scotland a butt rhenish
the abbot 
and a ring gold was the wager and it
was flown as fairly for as ever was red gold
and bright wine and to see her there on
her white palfrey that flew as if it scorned
to touch more than the heather blossom 
and to hear her voice as clear and sweet
as the mavis's whistle mix among our jolly
whooping and whistling and to mark all
the nobles dashing round her happiest he

she will see little hawking where she lies
now ay ay pomp and pleasure pass away
as speedily as the wap a falcon's wing
 and where is this poor queen now

in the fate a woman whose beauty and
grace had made so strong an impression
even on the blunt and careless character 
adam woodcock
 where is she now imprisoned said
adam woodcock why in some castle in
vol b
 the abbot
the north they say know not where for
my part nor is it worth while to vex oneself
anent what cannot be mended an she
had guided her power well whilst she had
it she had not come to so evil a pass men
say she must resign her crown to this little
baby a prince for that they will trust her
with it no longer our master has been as
busy as his neighbours in all this work if
the queen should come to her own again
avenel castle is like to smoke for it unless
he makes his bargain all the better
 in a castle in the north queen mary
is confined said the page
ti why ay they say so at least in a
castle beyond that great river which comes
down yonder and looks like a river but it is
a branch the sea and as bitter as brine
 and amongst all her subjects said the
page with some emotion is there none
that will adventure any thing for her relief

that is a kittle question said the falconer
 and if you ask it often master
the abbot 
roland i am fain to tell you that you will
be mewed up yourself in some those castles
if they do not prefer twisting your
head off to save farther trouble with you 
adventure any thing lord why murray
has the wind in his poop now man and
flies so high and strong that the devil a
wing them can match him no no
there she is and there she must lie till
heaven send her deliverance or till her
son has the management all but murray
will never let her loose again he knows
her too well and hark thee we are now
bound for holyrood where thou wilt find
plenty news and courtiers to tell it 
but take my counsel and keep a calm
sough as the scots say hear every man's
counsel and keep your own and if you
hap to learn any news you like leap not upas
if you were to put on armour direct in
the cause our old mr wingate says and
he knows courtcattle well that if you are
told old king could is come alive again you
should turn it off with and is he in truth 
 the abbot
i heard not it and should seem no
more moved than if one told you by way
 novelty that old king could was dead and
buried wherefore look well to your bearing
master roland for i promise you you
come among a generation that are keen asa
hungry hawk and never be dagger out
 sheath at every wry word you hear spoken
 for you will find as hot blades as yourself
and then will be letting blood without
advice either leech or almanac
 you shall see how staid i will be and
how cautious my good friend said graeme
 but blessed lady what goodly house is
that which is lying all in ruins so close to
the city have they been playing at the
abbot unreason here and ended the
gambol by burning the church 
 there again now replied his companion
 you go down the wind like a wild
haggard that minds neither lure nor beck
that is a question you should have asked
in as low a tone as i shall answer it
if i stay here long said roland
the abbot 
grasme it is like i shall lose the natural
use my voice but what are the ruins
then 
 the kirk field said the falconer
in a low and impressive whisper laying at
the same time his finger on his lip ask
no more about it somebody got foul play
and somebody got the blame it and the
game began there which perhaps may not
be played out in our time poor henry
darnley to be an ass he understood somewhat
 a hawk but they sent him on the
wing through the air himself one bright
moonlight night
the memory this catastrophe was so
recent that the page averted his eyes with
horror from the scathed ruins in which it
had taken place and the accusations
against the queen to which it had given
rise came over his mind with such strength
as to balance the compassion he had begun
to entertain for her present forlorn situation

it was indeed with that agitating state
 the abbot
 mind which arises partly from horror
but more from eager interest and curiosity
that young graeme found himself actually
traversing the scene those tremendous
events the report which had disturbed
the most distant solitudes in scotland like
the echoes distant thunder rolling among
the mountains
now he thought now or never shall i
become a man and bear my part in those
deeds which the simple inhabitants our
hamlets repeat to each other as if they were
wrought by beings a superior race to
their own i will know now wherefore the
knight avenel carries his crest so much
above those the neighbouring baronage
and how it is that men by valour and wisdom
work their way from the hoddin gray
coat to the cloak scarlet and gold men
say i have not much wisdom to recommend
me and if that be true courage must doit
for i will be a man amongst living men
or a dead corpse amongst the dead
from these plans ambition he turned
the abbot 
his thoughts to those pleasure and began
to form many conjectures when and where
he should see catherine seyton and in
what manner their acquaintance was to be
renewed with such conjectures he was
amusing himself when he found that they
had entered the city and all other feelings
were suspended in the sensation giddy
astonishment with which the inhabitant 
a solitary country is affected when for the
first time he finds himself in the streets 
a large and populous city a unit in the
midst thousands
the principal street edinburgh was
then as now one the most spacious in
europe the extreme height the houses
and the variety gothic gables and battlements
and balconies by which the skyline
on each side was crowned and terminated
together with the width the street
itself might have struck with surprise a
more practised eye than that young
graeme the population close packed
within the walls the city and at this time
 the abbot
increased by the number the lords 
the king's party who had thronged to edinburgh
to wait upon the regent murray
absolutely swarmed like bees on the wide
and stately street instead the shopwindows
which are now calculated for the
display goods the traders had their open
booths projecting on the street in which
as in the fashion the modern bazaars all
was exposed which they had upon sale
and though the commodities were not 
the richest kinds yet greene seemed to seethe
wealth the whole world in the various
bales flanders cloths and the specimens
 tapestry and at other places the display
 domestic utensils and pieces silverplate
struck him with wonder the sight 
cutlers booths furnished with swords and
poniards which were manufactured in scotland
and with pieces defensive armour
imported from flanders added to his surprise
 and at every step he found so much
to admire and to gaze upon that adam
woodcock had no little difficulty in prethe
abbot 
wailing on him to advance through such
a scene enchantment
the sight the crowds which filled the
streets was equally a subject wonder
here a gay lady in her muffler or silken
veil traced her way delicately a gentleman
usher making way for her a page
bearing up her train and a waiting gentlewoman
carrying her bible and intimating
that her purpose was towards the church 
there he might see groupe citizens bending
the same way with their short flemish
cloaks wide trowsers and highcaped doublets
a fashion to which as well as to their
bonnet and feather the scots were long
faithful then again came the clergyman
himself in his black geneva cloak and band
lending a grave and attentive ear to the discourse
 several persons who accompanied
him and who were doubtless holding serious
converse on the religious subject he was
about to treat nor did there lack passengers
 a different class and appearance
b 
s the abbot
at every turn roland graeme might see
a gallant ruffle along in the newer or french
mode his doublet slashed and his points
 the same colours with the lining his long
sword on one side and his poniard on the
other behind him a body stout servingmen
proportioned to his estate and quality
all whom walked with the air military
retainers and were armed with sword and
buckler the latter being a small round
shield not unlike the highland target having
a steel spike in the centre two 
these parties each headed by a person 
importance chanced to meet in the very
centre the street or as it was called
 the crown the causeway a post 
honour as tenaciously asserted in scotland
as that giving or taking the wall
used to be in the more southern part the
island the two leaders being equal rank
and most probably either animated by political
dislike or by recollection some
feudal enmity marched close up to each
other without yielding an inch to the right
the abbot 
or the left and neither shewing the least
purpose giving way they stopped for an
instant and then drew their swords their
followers imitated their example about a
score weapons at once flashed in the
sun and there was an immediate clatter 
swords and bucklers while the followers on
either side cried their master's name the
one shouting help a leslie a leslie 
while the others answered with shouts 
seyton seyton with the additional punning
slogan set on set on bear the
knaves to the ground
if the falconer found difficulty in getting
the page to go forward before it was now
perfectly impossible he reined up his
horse clapped his hands and delighted
with the fray cried and shouted as fast as
any those that were actually engaged
in it
the noise and cries thus arising on the
high gait as it was called drew into the
quarrel two or three other parties gentlemen
and their servants besides some single
passengers who hearing a fray betwixt these
 the abbot
two distinguished names took part in it either
for love or hatred
the combat became now very sharp
and although the swordand buckler men
made more clatter and noise than they
did real damage yet several good cuts
were dealt among them and those who
wore rapiers a more formidable weapon
than the ordinary scottish sword gave and
received dangerous wounds two men were
already stretched on the causeway and
the party seyton began to give ground
being much inferior in number to the
other with which several the citizens
had united themselves when young roland
graeme beholding their leader a noble
gentleman fighting bravely and hard
pressed with numbers could withhold no
longer adam woodcock he said an
you be a man draw and let us take part
with the seyton and without waiting a
reply or listening to the falconers earnest
entreaty that he would leave alone a strife
in which he had no concern the fiery youth
sprung from his horse drew his short sword
the abbot 
and shouting like the rest a seyton a
seyton set on set on thrust forward into
the throng and struck down one those
who was pressing hardest upon the gentleman
whose cause he espoused this sudden
reinforcement gave spirit to the weaker
party who began to renew the combat
with much spirit when four the magistrates
 the city distinguished by their
velvet cloaks and gold chains came up with
a guard halberdiers and citizens armed
with long weapons who well accustomed
to such service thrust boldly forward and
compelled the swordsmen to separate who
immediately retreated in different directions
leaving such the wounded on both
sides as had been disabled in the fray lying
on the street
the falconer who had been tearing his
beard for anger at his comrade's rashness
now rode up to him with the horse which
he had caught by the bridle and accosted
him with master roland master goose
master madcap will it please you to
get on horse and budge or will you res
the abbot
main here to be carried to prison and made
to answer for this pretty day's work 
the page who had begun his retreat
along with the seytons just as if he had
been one their natural allies was by this
unceremonious application made sensible
that he was acting a foolish part and
obeying adam woodcock with some sense
 shame he sprung actively on horseback
and upsetting with the shoulder the animal
a cityofficer who was making towards
him he began to ride smartly down the
street along with his companion and was
quickly out the reach the hue and
cry in fact rencounters the kind
were so common in edinburgh at this period
that the disturbance seldom excited
much attention after the affray was over
unless some person consequence chanced
to have fallen an accident which imposed
on his friends the duty avenging
his death upon the first convenient opportunity
so feeble indeed was the arm 
the police that it was not unusual for such
skirmishes to last for hours where the parthe
abbot 
ties were numerous and well matched but
at this time the regent a man great
strength character aware the mischief
which usually arose from such acts violence
had prevailed with the magistrates to
keep a constant guard on foot for preventing
or separating such affrays as had happened
in the present case
the falconer and his young companion
were now riding down the canongate and
had slackened their pace to avoid attracting
attention the rather that there seemed to
be no appearance pursuit roland hung
his head as one who was conscious his conduct
had been none the wisest while his
companion thus addressed him
will you be pleased to tell me one
thing master roland graeme and that is
whether there be a devil incarnate in you
or no 
 truly master adam woodcock answered
the page i would fain hope there
is not
 then said adam i would fain know
 the abbot
by what other influence or instigation you
are perpetually at one or the other 
some bloody brawl what i pray had
you to do with these seytons and leslie
that you never heard the names in your
life before 
you are out there my friend said roland
graeme i have my own reasons for
being a friend to the seytons
 they must have been very secret reasons
then answered adam woodcock
for i think i could have wagered you had
never known one the name and i am
apt to believe still that it was rather your
unhallowed passion for that clashing cold
iron which has as much charm for you as
the clatter a brass pan hath for a hive 
bees more than any care either for seyton
or for leslie that persuaded you to thrust
your fool's head into a quarrel that no ways
concerned you but take this for a warning
my young master that if you are to draw
sword with every man who draws sword
on the highgait here it will be scarce
the abbot 
worth your while to sheathe bilbo again for
the rest your life since if i guess rightly
it will scarce endure on such terms for
many hours all which i leave to your serious
consideration
by my word adam i honour your
advice and i promise you that i will practise
by it as faithfully as if were sworn
apprentice to you to the trade and mystery
 bearing myself with all wisdom and safety
through the new paths life that i am
about to be engaged in
 and therein you will do well said the
falconer and i do not quarrel with you
master roland for having a grain overmuch
spirit because i know one may bring
to the hand a wild hawk which one never
can a dunghill hen and so betwixt two
faults you have the best side on't but besides
your peculiar genius for quarrelling
and lugging out your side companion my
dear master roland you have also the gift
 peering under every woman's muffler and
screen as if you expected to find an old
acquaintance though were you to spy one
 the abbot
i should be as much surprised at it well
wetting how few you have seen these same
wildfowl as i was at your taking so deep
an interest even now in the seyton
 tush man nonsense and folly answered
roland graeme i but sought to
see what eyes these gentle hawks have got
under their hood
ay but it's a dangerous subject inquiry
said the falconer you had better
hold out your bare wrist for an eagle to
perch upon look you master roland
these pretty wildgeese cannot be hawked
at without risk they have as many divines
bolting and villeins as the most
gamesome quarry that falcon ever flew at
and besides every woman them is manned
with her husband or her kind friend
or her brother or her cousin or her sworn
servant at the least but you heed me not
master roland though i know the game
so well your eye is all on that pretty damsel
who trips down the gait before us by
my certes i will warrant her a blithe dancer
either in reel or revel a pair silver
the abbot 
morisco bells would become these pretty
ancles as well as the jesses would suit the
fairest norway hawk
thou art a fool adam said the page
and i care not a button about the girl or
her ancles but what the foul fiend one
must look at something
 very true master roland grime
said his guide but let me pray you to
chuse your objects better look you there
is scarce a woman walks this highgait with
a silk screen or a berlin muffler but as i
said before she has either gentleman usher
before her or kinsman or lover or husband
at her elbow or it may be a brace stout
fellows with sword and buckler not so far
behind but what they can follow close 
but you heed me no more than a mossbank
minds a yellow holding
 o yes i do i do mind you indeed
said roland graeme but hold my nag a
bit i will be with you in the exchange 
a whistle so saying and ere adam woodcock
could finish the sermon which was 
the abbot
ing on his tongue roland graeme to the
falconer's utter astonishment threw him
the bridle his jennet jumped off horseback
and pursued down one the closes
or narrow lanes which opening under a
vault terminate upon the main street the
very maiden to whom his friend had accused
him shewing so much attention and who
had turned down the pass in question
saint mary saint magdalen saint benedict
saint barnabas said the poor falconer
when he found himself thus suddenly
brought to a pause in the midst the
canongate and saw his young charge start
off like a madman in quest a damsel
whom he had never as adam supposed
seen in his life before saint satan
and saint beelzebub for this would make
one swear saint and devil what can have
come over the lad with a wanton and
what shall i do the whilst he will have
his throat cut the poor lad as sure as i
was born at the foot roseberry topping
could find some one to hold the
the abbor 
horses but they are as sharp here northaway
as in canny yorkshire herself and
quit bridle quit pitt as we say an i could
but see one our folks now a holly sprig
were worth a gold tassel or could i but
see one the regent's men but to leave
the horses to a stranger that i cannot 
and to leave the place while the lad is in
jeopardy that i won't
we must leave the falconer however in
the midst his distress and follow the hotheaded
youth who was the cause his perplexity

the latter part adam woodcock's sage
remonstrance had been in a great measure
lost upon roland for whose benefit it was
intended because in one the female
forms which tripped along the street muffled
in a veil striped silk like the women
 brussels at this day his eye had discerned
something which closely resembled the
exquisite shape and spirited bearing catherine
seyton during all the grave advice
which the falconer was dinning into
his ear his eye continued intent upon so
 the abbot
interesting an object observation and
at length as the damsel just about to dive
under one the arched passages which
afford outlet to the canongate from the
houses beneath a passage graced bya projecting
shield arms supported by two
huge foxes stone had lifted her veil for
the purpose perhaps descrying who the
horseman was who for some time had eyed
her so closely young roland saw under
the shadow the silken plaid enough
 the bright azure eyes fair locks and
blithe features to induce him like an inexperienced
and rash madcap whose wilful
ways had never been traversed by contradiction
nor much subjected to consideration
to throw the bridle his horse into
adam woodcock's hand and leave him to
play the waiting gentleman while he dashed
down the paved court after catherine
seyton all as aforesaid
women's wits are proverbially quick but
apparently those catherine suggested no
better expedient than fairly to betake herthe
abbot 
self to speed foot in hopes baffling the
page's vivacity by getting safely lodged before
he could discover where but a youth
 eighteen in pursuit a mistress is not
so easily outstripped catherine fled across
a paved court decorated with large formal
vases stone in which yews cypresses
and other evergreens vegetated in sombre
sullenness and gave a correspondent degree
 solemnity to the high and heavy
building in front which they were placed
as ornaments aspiring towards a square
portion the blue hemisphere corresponding
exactly in extent to the quadrangle in
which they were stationed and all around
which rose huge black walls exhibiting windows
in rows five stories with heavy architraves
over each bearing armorial and religious
devices
through this court catherine seyton
flashed like a hunted doe making the best
use those pretty legs which had attracted
the commendation even the reflective
and cautious adam woodcock she hast
 the abbot
 towards a large door in the centre 
the lower front the court pulled the
bobbin till the latch flew up and ensconced
herself in the ancient mansion but
if she fled like a doe roland graeme followed
with the speed and ardour a youthful
staghound loosed for the first time on
his prey he kept her in view in spite
 her efforts for it is remarkable what
an advantage in such a race the gallant
who desires to see possesses over the maiden
who wishes not to be seen an advantage
which i have known counterbalance
a great start in point distance in short
he saw the waving her screen or veil
at one corner heard the tap her foot
light as that was as it crossed the court and
caught a glimpse her figure just as she
entered the door the mansion
roland graeme inconsiderate and headlong
as w'c have described him having no
knowledge real life but from the romances
which he had read and not an idea 
checking himself in the midst any eager
the abbot 
impulse possessed besides much courage
and readiness never hesitated for a
moment to approach the door through
which the object his search had disappeared
he too pulled the bobbin and
the latch though heavy and massive answered
to the summons and arose the
page entered with the same precipitation
which had marked his whole proceeding
and found himself in a large gloomy hall
or vestibule dimly enlightened by latticed
casements painted glass and rendered
yet dimmer through the exclusion the
sunbeams owing to the height the walls
 those buildings by which the courtyard
was enclosed the walls the hall were
surrounded with suits ancient and rusted
armour interchanged with huge and
massive stone scutcheons bearing double
tressuresfleured and counter fled red wheatsheaves
coronets and so forth things to
which roland graeme gave not a moment's
attention
in fact he only deigned to observe the
vol c
 the abbot
figure catherine seyton who deeming
herself safe in the hall had stopped
to take breath after her course and was
reposing herself for a moment on a large
oaken settle which stood at the upper 
 the hall the noise roland's entrance
at once disturbed her she started up with
a faint scream surprise and escaped
through one the several foldingdoors
which opened into this apartment as a common
centre this door which roland
grasme instantly approached opened on a
large and well lighted gallery at the upper
 which he could hear several voices
and the noise hasty steps approaching
toward the hall or vestibule a little recalled
to sober thought by an appearance 
serious danger he was deliberating whether
he should stand fast or retire when catherine
seyton reentered from a side door
running towards him with as much speed
as a few minutes since she had fled from
him
o what mischief brought you hither 
the abbot 
she said fly fly or you are a dead man
or stay they come flight is impossible
 say you came to ask after lord seyton

she sprung from him and disappeared
through the door by which she had made
her second appearance and at the same
instant a pair large foldingdoors at the
upper the gallery flew open with
vehemence and six or seven young gentlemen
richly dressed pressed forward into
the apartment having for the greater part
their swords drawn
 who is it said one dare intrude onus
in our own mansion 
 cut him to pieces said another let
him pay for this day's insolence and violences
 he is some follower the toties
no by saint mary said another he
i a follower the archfiend and ennobled
clown halbert glendinning who takes the
style avenel once a church vassal now
a pillager the church
 it is so said a fourth i know him
 the abbot
by the holly sprig which is their cognisance
secure the door he must answer
for this insolence
two the gallants hastily drawing their
weapon past on to the door by which roland
had entered the hall and stationed themselves
there as if to prevent his escape the
others advanced on gramme who had just
sense enough to perceive that any attempt
at resistance would be alike fruitless and
imprudent at once and by various voices
none which sounded amicably the page
was required to say who he was whence he
came his name his errand and who sent
him hither the number the questions
demanded him at once afforded a momentary
apology for his remaining silent
and ere that brief truce had elapsed a personage
entered the hall at whose appearance
those who had gathered fiercely around
roland fell back with respect
this was a tall man whose dark hair was
already grizzled though his eye and haughty
features retained all the animation 
the abbot 
youth the upper part his person was
undressed to his holland shirt whose ample
folds were stained with blood but he
wore a mantle crimson lined with rich
fur cast around him which supplied the deficiency
 his dress on his head he had
a crimson velvet bonnet looped up on one
side with a small golden chain many
links which going thrice round the hat was
fastened by a medal agreeable to the fashion
amongst the grandees the time
whom have you here sons and kinsmen
said he around whom you crowd
thus roughly know you not that the shelter
 this roof should secure every one fair
treatment who shall come hither either in
fair peace or in open and manly hostility 
 but here my lord answered one 
the youths sis a knave who comes on treacherous
espial 
i deny the charge said roland grime
boldly i came to inquire after my lord
seyton
 a likely tale answered his accusers
 the abbot
in the mouth a follower blending

 stay young men said the lord seyton
for it was that nobleman himself let
me look at this youth by heaven it is the
very same who came so boldly to my side
not very many minutes since when some 
my own knaves bore themselves with more
respect to their own worshipful safety than
to mine stand back from him for he well
deserves honour and a friendly welcome at
your handsjinstead this rough treatment
they fell back on all sides obedient to
lord seyton's commands who taking roland
grasme by the hand thanked him for
his prompt and gallant assistance adding
that he nothing doubted the same interest
which he had taken in his cause in the
affray brought him hither to inquire after
his hurt
roland bowed low in acquiescence
 or is there any thing in which i can
serve you to shew my sense your ready
gallantry
the abbot 
bat the page thinking it best to abide by
the apology for his visit which the lord
seyton had so aptly himself suggested replied
 that to be assured his lordship's
safety had been the only cause his intrusion
he judged he added he had
seen him receive some hurt in the affray
 a trifle said lord seyton i had but
stripped my doublet that the chirurgeon
might put some dressing on the paltry
scratch when these rash boys interrupted
us with their clamour
roland graeme making a low obeisance
was now about to depart for relieved from
the danger being treated as a spy he began
next to fear that his companion adam
woodcock whom he had so unceremoniously
quitted would either bring him into
some farther dilemma by venturing into
the hotel in quest him or ride offend leave
him behind altogether but lord seyton did
not permit him to escape so easily tarry
he said young man and let me know
thy rank and name the seyton has late
 the abbot
been more wont to see friends and followers
shrink from his side than to receive aid
from strangers but a new world may come
round in which he may have the chance 
rewarding his well wishers
my name is roland graeme my lord
answered the youth a page who for the
present is in the service sir halbert
glendinning
 i said so from the first said one the
young men my ife i will wager that this
is a shaft out the heretic's quiver a stratagem
from first to last to injeer into your
confidence some espial his own they
know how to teach both boys and women
to play the intelligencers
 that is false if it be spoken me
said roland no man in scotland should
teach me such a foul part 
i believe thee boy said seyton for
thy strokes were too fair to be dealt upon
an understanding with those that were to
receive them credit me however i little
expected to have help at need from one 
the abbot 
your master's household and i would know
what moved thee in my quarrel to shine
own endangering 
 so please you my lord said roland
i think my master himself would not have
stood by and seen an honourable man borne
to earth by odds if his single arm could
help him such at least is the lesson we
were taught in chivalry at the castle 
avenel
 the good seed hath fallen into good
ground young man said seyton but
alas if thou practise such honourable war
in these dishonourable days when right is
every where borne down by mastery thy
life my poor boy will be but a short one
 let it be short so it be honourable
said roland graeme and permit me now
my lord to commend me to your grace and
to take my leave a comrade waits with
my horse in the street
take this however young man said
lord seyton undoing from his bonnet the
c
 the abbot
golden chain and medal and wear it for
my sake
with no little pride roland greene accepted
the gift which he hastily fastened
around his bonnet as he had seen gallants
wear such an ornament and renewing his
obeisance to the baron left the hall traversed
the court and appeared in the street
just as adam woodcock vexed and anxious
at his delay had determined to leave the
horses to their fate and go in quest his
youthful comrade whose barn hast thou
broken next he exclaimed greatly relieved
by his appearance although his countenance
indicated that he had passed through
an agitating scene
 ask me no questions said roland
leaping gaily on his horse j but see how
short time it takes to win a chain gold
pointing to that which he now wore
 now god forbid that thou hast either
stolen it or reft it by violence said the
falconer for otherwise i wot not how
the abbot 
the devil thou couldst compass it i have
been often here ay for months at an 
and no one gave me either chain or medal

 thou seest i have got one on shorter
acquaintance with the city answered the
page and set thine honest heart at rest 
that which is fairly won and freely given
is neither reft nor stolen
 marry hang thee with thy fanfarona
about thy neck said the falconer i
think water will not drown nor hemp strangle
thee thou hast been discarded as
my lady's page to come in again as my
lord's squire and for following a noble
young damsel into some great household
thou gets a chain and a medal where another
would have had the baton across his
shoulders if he missed having the dirk in
a name given to the gold chains worn by the military
men the period it is spanish origin for
the fashion wearing these costly ornaments was
much followed amongst the conquerors the ney
world
 the abbot
his body but here we come in front 
the old abbey bear thy good luck with
you when you cross these paved stones
and by our lady you may brag scotland
as he spoke they checked their horses
where the huge old vaulted entrance to
the abbey or palace holyrood crossed
the termination the street down which
they had proceeded the courtyard 
the palace opened within this gloomy porch
shewing the front an irregular pile 
monastic buildings one wing which is
still extant forming a part the modern
palace erected in the days charles i
at the gate the porch the falconer
and page resigned their horses to the 
in attendance the falconer commanding
him with an air authority to
carry them safely to the stables we follows
he said the knight avenel ave
must bear ourselves for what we are here
said he in a whisper to roland for everyone
here ig looked on as they demean themselves
 and he that is too modest must to
the abbor 
the wall as the proverb says therefore
cock thy bonnet man and let us brook the
causeway bravely
assuming therefore an air consequence
corresponding to what he supposed
to be his master's importance and quality
adam woodcock led the way into the courtyard
 the palace holyrood
 the abbot
chapter iii
the sky is clouded gaspard
and the vex'd ocean sleeps a troubled sleep
beneath a lurid gleam parting sunshine
such slumber hangs o'er discontented lands
while factions doubt as yet if they have strength
to front the open battle
albion a poem
the youthful page paused on the entrance
 the courtyard and implored his guide
to give him a moment's breathing space
 let me but look around me man said
he you consider not i have never seen
such a scene as this before and this is 
 the resort the gallant and gay
and the fair and the wise and the powerful

ay marry is it said woodcock 
but i wish i could hood thee as they do
the hawks for thou stares as wildly as if
s
the abbot 
you sought another fray or another fanfa
roma i would i had thee safely housed
for thou loosest wild as a goeshawk
it was indeed no common sight to roland
the vestibule a palace traversed by
its various groupes some radiant with
gaiety some pensive and apparently weighed
down by affairs concerning the state
or concerning themselves here the hoary
statesman with his cautious yet commanding
look his furred cloak and sable pantoufles
j there the soldier in buff and steel his
long sword jarring against the pavement and
his whiskered upper lip and frowning brow 
there again passed my lord's servingman
high heart and bloody hand humble
to his master and his master's equals insolent
to all others to these might be added
the poor suitor with his anxious look
and depressed mien the officer full his
brief authority elbowing his betters and
possibly his benefactors out the road 
the proud priest who sought a better benefice
 the proud baron who sought a grant
 the abbot
 church lands the robber chief who came
to solicit a pardon for the injuries he had
inflicted on his neighbours the plundered
franklin who came to seek vengeance for
that which he had himself received besides
there was the mustering and disposition
 guards and soldiers the dispatching
 messengers and the receiving them
the trampling and neighing horses
without the gate the flashing arms and
rustling plumes and jingling spurs
within it in short it was that gay and
splendid confusion in which the eye 
youth sees all that is brave and brilliant and
that experience much that is doubtful
deceitful false and hollow hopes that will
never be gratified promises which will never
be fulfilled pride in the disguise 
humility and insolence in that frank
and generous bounty
as tired the eager and enraptured
attention which the page gave to a scene
so new to him adam woodcock endeavoured
to get him to move forward bethe
abbot 
fore his exuberance astonishment should
attract the observation the sharpwitted
denizens the court the falconer himself
became an object attention to a gay menial
in a darkgreen bonnet and feather with
a cloak a corresponding colour laid down
as the phrase then went by six broad bars 
silver lace and welted with violet and silver
the words recognition burst from
both at once what adam woodcock
at court and what michael 
 and how runs the hackit greyhound
bitch now 
the war for the wear like ourselves
adam eight years this grass no four legs
will carry a dog for ever j but we keep her
for the breed and so she scapes borderdoom
 but why stand you gazing there 
i promise you my lord has wished for you
and asked for you
 my lord murray asked for me and
he regent the kingdom too said adam
i hunger and thirst to pay my duty to my
good lord but i fancy his good lordship
remembers the day's sport on carnwarth
 the abbot
moor and my drummelzier falcon that
beat the hawks from the isle man and
won his lordship a hundred crowns from
the southern baron whom they called stanley

nay not to flatter thee adam said
his courtfriend he remembers nought 
thee or thy falcon either he hath flown
many a higher flight since that and struck
his quarry too but come come hither
away i trust we are to be good comrades
on the old score
what said adam you would have
me crash a pot with you but i must first
dispose my eyass where he will neither
have girl to chase or lad to draw sword
upon
is the youngster such a one said michael

ay by my hood he flies at all game
replied woodcock
then had he better come with us said
michael wingthewind for we cannot
have a proper carouse just now only i
would wet my hps and so must you i want
the abbot 
to hear the news from saint mary's before
you see my lord and i will let you know
how the wind sits up yonder
while he thus spoke he led the way
to a side door which opened into the
court and threading several dark passages
with the air one who knew the
most secret recesses the palace conducted
them to a small matted chamber where
he placed bread and cheese and a foaming
flagon ale before the falconer who
immediately did justice to the latter ina
hearty draught which nearly emptied
the measure having drawn his breath
and dashed the froth from his whiskers he
observed that his anxiety for the boy had
made him deadly dry
 mend your draught said his hospitable
friend again supplying the flagon from
a pitcher which stood beside i know the
way to the butterybar and now mind
what i say this morning the earl morton
came to my lord in a mighty chafe
what they keep the old friendship
then said woodcock
 the abbot
ay ay man what else said michael
 one hand must scratch the other
but in a mighty chafe was my lord morton
who to say truth looketh on such occasions
altogether uncanny and as it were
fiendish and he says to my lord for i was
in the chamber taking orders about a cast
 hawks that are to be fetched from darnway
 they match your long winged falcons
friend adam
 i will believe that when i see them fly
as high a pitch replied woodcock this
professional observation forming a sort 
parenthesis
 however said michael pursuing his
tale my lord morton in a mighty
chafe asked my lord regent whether he
was well dealt with for my brother said
he should have had a gift to be commendator
 kennaquhair and to have all the
temporalities erected into a lordship regality
for his benefit and here said he
the false monks have had the insolence to
chuse a new abbot to put his claim in my
brother's way j and moreover the rascality
the abbot 
 the neighbourhood have burnt and plundered
all that was left in the abbey so that
tiny brother will not have a house to dwell
in when he hath ousted the lazy hounds 
priests and my lord seeing him chafed said
mildly to him these are shrewd tidings
douglass but i trust they be not true for
halbert glendinning went southward yesterday
with a band spears and assuredly
had either these chances happened that
the monks had presumed to chuse an abbot
or that the abbey had been burnt as
you say he had taken order on the spot for
the punishment such insolence and had
dispatched us a messenger and the earl
 morton replied now i pray you adam
to notice that i say this out love to you
and your lord and also for old comradeship
and also because sir halbert hath
done me good and may again and also
because i love not the earl morton as
indeed more fear than like him so then it
were a foul deed in you to betray me but
said the earl to the regent take heed my
lord you trust not this glendinning too
 the abbot
far he comes churl's blood which was
never true to the nobles by saint andrew
these were his very words and besides
he said he hath a brother a monk in saint
mary's and walks all by his guidance and
is making friends on the border with buck
and with fernieherst and will join
hand with them were there likelihood a
new world and my lord answered like a
free noble lord as he is tush my lord
 morton i will be warrant for blending
faith and for his brother he is a
dreamer that thinks nought but 
and breviary and if such hap have chanced
as you tell i look to receive from glendining
the cowl a hanged monk and
the head a riotous churl by way sharp
and sudden justice and my lord morton
left the place and as it seemed tome
somewhat malcontent but since that
time iii lord has asked me more than
once whether there has arrived no messenger
from the knight avenel and all this
i have told you that you may frame your
the abbot 
discourse to the best purpose for it seems
to me that my lord will not be well pleased
if aught has happened like what my
lord morton said and if your lord hath
not ta'en strict orders with it
there was something in this communication
which fairly blanked the bold visage
 adam woodcock in spite the reinforcement
which his natural hardihood had
received from the berry brown ale holyrood

 what was it he said about a churl's
head that grim lord morton said the
discontented falconer to his friend
nay it was my lord regent who
said that he expected if the abbey was injured
your knight would send him the head
 the ringleader among the rioters
 nay but is this done like a good protestant
said adam woodcock or a true
lord the congregation we used to be
their whiteboys and darlings when we pulled
down the convents in fife and perthshires

 the abbot
 ay but that said michael was
when old mother rome held her own and
her great folks were determined she should
have no shelter for her head in scotland
bat now that the priests are fled in all quarters
and their houses and lands are given
to our grandees they cannot see that weare
working the work reformation in destroying
the palaces zealous protestants

but i tell you saint mary's is not destroyed
 said woodcock in increasing agitation
 some trash painted windows
there were broken things that no nobleman
could have brooked in his housesome
stone saints were brought on their
marrowbones like old warrington at
chevychace but as for fire raising there
was not so much as a lighted lunt amongst
us save the match which the dragon had to
light the burning tow withal which he was
to spit against saint george nay i had
caution that
 how adam woodcock said his comthe
abbot s
rade i trust thou hadst no hand in such
a fair work look you adam i were loth
to terrify you and you just come from a
journey but i promise you earl morton
hath brought you down a maiden from halifax
you never saw the like her and
shell clip you round the neck and your
head will remain in her arms
pshaw answered adam i am too
old to have my head turned by any maiden
 them all i know my lord morton
will go as far for a buxom lass as any one 
but what the devil took him to halifax all
the way and if he have got a gamester
there what hath she to do with my head 
 much much answered michael
 herod's daughter who did such execution
with her foot and ancle danced not
raen'sheads offmore cleanly than this maidens
 morton tis an axe man an axe which
falls itself like a sash window and never
gives the headsman the trouble to wield it
 by my faith a shrewd device said
woodcock j heaven keep us free on't 
vol d
 the abbot
the page seeing no to the conversation
between these two old comrades and
anxious from what he had heard concerning
the fate the abbot now interrupted
their conference
methinks he said adam woodcock
thou hadst better deliver thy master's
letter to the regent questionless he
hath therein stated what has chanced at
kennaquhair in the way most advantageous
for all concerned
the boy is right said michael 
 my lord will be very impatient

 the child hath wit enough to keep
himself warm said adam woodcock producing
from his hawkingbag his lord's
letter addressed to the earl murray
 and for that matter so have i so master
roland you will e'en please to present
this yourself to the lord regent his presence
will be better graced by a young
page than by an old falconer
well said canny yorkshire replied
the abbot 
his friend and but now you were so earnest
to see our good lord why wouldst
thou put the lad into the noose that thou
may est slip tether thyself or doest thou
think the maiden will clasp his fair young
neck more willingly than thy old sunburnt
weasand 
 go to answered the falconer thy
wit towers high an it could strike the quarry
i tell thee the youth has nought to fear
he had nothing to do with the gambol 
a rare gambol it was michael as madcaps
ever played and i had made as rare a ballad
if we had had the luck to get it sung to
an but mum for that tace as i said
before is latin for a candle carry the
youth to the presence and i will remain
here with bridle in hand ready to strike
the spurs up to the rowelheads in case the
hawk flies my way i will soon put soltra
edge i trow betwixt the regent and me if
he means me less than fair play
come on then my lad said michael
 since thou must needs take the spring bec
the abbot
fore canny yorkshire so saying he led
the way through winding passages closely
followed by roland graeme until they arrived
at a large winding stone stair the
steps which were so long and broad and
at the same time so low as to render the
ascent uncommonly easy when they had
ascended about the height one storey
the guide stepped aside and pushed open
the door a dark and gloomy antichamber
 so dark indeed that his youthful companion
stumbled and nearly fell down
upon a low step which was awkwardly placed
on the very threshold
take heed said michael wingshewing
in a very low tone voice and first
glancing cautiously round to see if any one
listened take heed my young friend
for those who fall on these boards seldom
arise again seest thou that he added ina
still lower voice pointing to some dark
crimson stains on the floor on which a ray
 light shot through a small aperture and
traversing the general gloom the apartthe
abbot 
ment fell with mottled radiance seest
thou that youth walk warily for men have
fallen here before you
 what mean you said the page his
flesh creeping though he scarce knew why 
 is it blood 
ay ay said the domestic in the
same whispering tone and dragging the
youth on by the arm blood it is but
this is no time to question or even to look
at it blood it is foully and fearfully shed
as foully and fearfully avenged the
blood he added in a still more cautious
tone seignior david
koland greeme's heart throbbed when
he found himself so unexpectedly in the
scene rizzio's slaughter a catastrophe
which had chilled with horror all even
in that rude age which had been the theme
 wonder and pity through every cottage
and castle in scotland and had not escaped
that avenel but his guide hurried
him forward permitting no further
question and with the manner one
who has already tampered too much with
 the abbot
a dangerous subject a tap which he made
at a low door at one the vestibule
was answered by a huissier or usher who
opening it cautiously received michael's
intimation that a page waited the regent's
leisure who brought letters from the knight
 avenel
 the council is breaking up said the
usher but give me the packet his grace
the regent will presently see the messenger

 the packet replied the page must
be delivered into the regent's own hands 
such were the orders my master
the usher looked at him from head to
foot as if surprised at his boldness and then
replied with some asperity say you so
my young master thou lowest loudly to
be but a chicken and from a country barnyard
too
were it a time or place said roland
 thou shouldst see i can do more than
crow but do your duty and let the regent
know i wait his pleasure
the abbot 
 thou art but a pert knave to tell me
 my duty said the courtier in office but
i will find a time to shew you you are out
 yours meanwhile wait there till you are
wanted so saying he shut the door in
roland's face
michael wingthewind who had shrunk
from his youthful companion during this
altercation according to the established
maxim courtiers all ranks and in ail
ages now transgressed their prudential line
 conduct so far as to come up to him once
more thou art a hopeful young springaid
said he and i see right well old
yorkshire had reason in his caution thou
hast been five minutes in the court and
hast employed thy time so well as to make
a powerful and a mortal enemy out the
usher the councilchamber why man
you might almost as well have offended the
deputy butler
i care not what he is said roland
gramme i will teach whomsoever i speak
with to speak civilly to me in return i
 the abbot
did not come from avenel to be browbeaten
in holyrood
bravo my lad said michael j it is a
fine spirit if you can but hold it but seethe
door opens
the usher appeared and in a more civil
tone voice and manner said that his
grace the regent would receive the knight
 avenel's message and accordingly marshalled
roland graeme the way into the
apartment from which the council had
been just dismissed after finishing their consultations
there was in the room a long
oaken table surrounded by stools the
same wood with a large elbow chair covered
with crimson velvet at the head writing
materials and papers were lying therein
apparent disorder and one or two 
the privy counsellors who had lingered behind
assuming their cloaks bonnets and
swords and bidding farewell to the regent
were departing slowly by a large door on
the opposite side to that through which the
page entered apparently the earl murthe
abbot 
ray had made some jest for the smiling countenances
 the statesmen expressed that sort
 cordial reception which is paid by courtiers
to the condescending pleasantries a
prince
the regent himself was laughing heartily
as he said farewell my lords and hold
me remembered to the cock the north
he then turned slowly round towards
roland greene and the marks gaiety
real or assumed disappeared from his countenance
as completely as the passing bubbles
leave the dark mirror a still profound
lake into which a traveller has cast a stone 
in the course a minute his noble fear
lures had assumed their natural expression
 deep and even melancholy gravity
this distinguished statesman for as such
his worst enemies acknowledged him possessed
all the external dignity as well as almost
all the noble qualities which could
grace the power that he enjoyed j and had
he succeeded to the throne ashes legitimate
inheritance it is probable he would have
d f
 the abbot
been recorded as one scotland's wisest
and greatest kings but that he held his
authority by the deposition and imprisonment
 his sister and benefactress was a
crime which those only can excuse who
think ambition an apology for ingratitude
he was dressed plainly in black velvet after
the flemish fashion and wore in his
highcrowned hat a jewelled clasp which
looped it up on one side and formed the
only ornament his apparel he had his
poniard by his side and his sword lay on
the council table
such was the personage before whom
roland graeme now presented himself with
a feeling breathless awe very different
from the usual boldness and vivacity his
temper in fact he was from education and
nature forward but not impudent and was
much more easily controuled by the moral
superiority arising from the elevated talents
and renown those with whom he
conversed than pretensions founded only
on rank or external shew he might have
braved with indifference the presence an
the abbot 
earl merely distinguished by his belt and
coronet but he felt overawed in that the
eminent soldier and statesman the wielder
 a nation's power and the leader her
armies the greatest and wisest are flattered
by the deference youth so graceful
and becoming in itself and murray
took with much courtesy the letter from
the hands the abashed and blushing page
and answered with complaisance to the imperfect
and halfmuttered greeting which
he endeavoured to deliver to him on the
part sir halbert avenel he even
paused a moment ere he broke the silk
with which the letter was secured to ask
the page his name so much he was struck
with his very handsome features and form
 roland graeme he said repeating the
words after the hesitating page what 
the grahame the lennox 
no may lord replied roland my
parents dwelt in the debateable land
murray made no farther enquiry but
proceeded to read his dispatches during
the perusal which his brow began to ask
the abbot
some a stern expression displeasure as
that one who found something which at
once surprised and disturbed him he
sate down on the nearest seat frowned
till his eyebrows almost met together read
the letter twice over and was then silent
for several minutes at length raising
his head his eye encountered that the
usher who in vain endeavoured to exchange
the look eager and curious observation
with which he had been perusing the regent's
features for that open and noticing
expression countenance which in
looking at all seems as if it saw and marked
nothing a cast look which may be
practised with advantage by all those 
whatsoever degree who are admitted to
witness the familiar and unguarded hours
 their superiors great men are as jealous
 their thoughts as the wife king
candles was her charms and will as
readily punish those who have however
involuntarily beheld them in mental deshabille
and exposure
leave the apartment hyndman said
the abbot 
the regent sternly and carry your observation
elsewhere you are too knowing
sir for your post which by special order
is destined for men blunter capacity so 
now you look more like a fool than you did
for hyndman as may easily be supposed
was not a little discouraged by this rebuke
 keep that confused stare and it
may keep you your office begone sir 
the usher departed in dismay not forgetting
to register amongst his other causes
 dislike to roland graeme that he had
been the witness this disgraceful chiding
when he had left the apartment the regent
again addressed the page
 your name you say is armstrong 
 no replied roland my name is
graeme so please you roland graeme
whose forbears were designated heathergill
in the debateable land
 ay i knew it was a name from the
debateable land hast thou any acquaintances
here in edinburgh 
 my lord replied roland willing rash
the abbot
ther to evade this question than to answer
it directly for the prudence being silent
with respect to lord seyton's adventure
immediately struck him i have been in
edinburgh scarce an hour and that for the
first time in my life
 what and thou sir halbert blending
page said the regent
i was brought up as my lady's page
said the youth and left avenel castle for
the first time in my life at least since my
childhood only three days since
my lady's page repeated the earl
 murray as if speaking to himself it
was strange to send his lady's page on a
matter such deep concernment morton
will say it is a piece with the nomination
 his brother to be abbot and yet in some
sort an inexperienced youth will best serve
the turn what hast thou been taught
young man in thy doughty apprenticeship

 to hunt my lord and to hawk said
roland graeme
the abbot 
 to hunt coneys and to hawk at ouzel
said the regent smiling for such
are the sports ladies and their followers
graeme's cheek reddened deeply as he
replied not without some emphasis to
hunt red deer the first head and to
strike down herons the highest soar my
lord which in lothian speech may be
termed for aught i know coneys and ouzel
 also i can wield a brand and couch
a lance according to our border meaning 
in inland speech these may be termed 
and bullrushes
thy speech rings like metal said the
regent and i pardon the sharpness it
for the truth thou knowest then what
belongs to the duty a manatarms
so far as exercise can teach it without
real service in the field answered roland
grme but our knight permitted none
 his household to make raids and i never
had the good fortune to see a stricken
field
 the good fortune repeated the res
the abbot
gent smiling somewhat sorrowfully take
my word young man war is the only game
from which both parties rise losers
not always my lord answered the
page with his characteristic audacity if
fame speaks truth
 how sir said the regent colouring
in his turn and perhaps suspecting an
indiscreet allusion to the height which he
himself had attained by the hap civil war
because my lord said roland graeme
without change tone she who fights well
must have fame in life or honour in death 
and so war is a game from which no one
can rise a losers
the regent smiled and shook his head
when at that moment the door opened and
the earl morton presented himself
i come somewhat hastily he said and
i enter unannounced because my news are
 weight it is as i said edward glendining
is named abbot and
 hush my lord said the regent i
know it but
the abbot 
and perhaps you knew it before i did
my lord murray answered morton his
dark red brow growing darker and redder
as he spoke
 morton said murray suspect me
not touch not mine honour i have to
suffer enough from the calumnies foes
let me not have to contend with the unjust
suspicions my friends we are not
alone said he recollecting himself or i
gould tell you more
he led morton into one the deep
embrasures which the windows formed in
the massive wall and which afforded a retiring
place for their conversing apart in
this recess roland observed them speak
together with much earnestness murray
appearing to be grave and earnest and
morton having a jealous and offended air
which seemed gradually to give way to the
assurances the regent
as their conversation grew more earnest
they became gradually louder in speech
having perhaps forgotten the presence 
 the abbot
the page the more readily as his position
in the apartment placed him out sight
so that he found himself unwillingly privy
to more their discourse than he cared to
hear for page though he was a mean
curiosity after the secrets others had never
been numbered amongst roland's failings
 and moreover with all his natural
rashness he could not but doubt the safety
 becoming privy to the secret discourse
 these powerful and dreaded men still he
could neither stop hisearsnorwithpropriety
leave the apartment j and while he thought
 some means signifying his presence
he had already heard so much that to have
produced himself suddenly would have been
as awkward and perhaps as dangerous as
in quiet to abide the their conference
what he overheard however was
but an imperfect part their communication
 and although a more expert politician
acquainted with the circumstances 
the times would have had little difficulty in
tracing the meaning yet roland graeme
the abbot 
could only form very general and vague
conjectures as to the import their discourse

 all is prepared said murray and
lindesay is setting forward she must hesitate
no longer thou seest i act by thy
counsel and harden myself against softer
considerations
true my lord replied morton in
what is necessary to gain power you do not
hesitate but go boldly to the mark bat
are you as careful to defend and preserve
what you have won why this establishment
 domestics around her has not
your mother men and maidens enough to
tend her but you must consent to this superfluous
and dangerous retinue 
for shame morton a princess and
my sister could i do less than allow her due
tendance 
ay replied morton even thus fly
all your shafts smartly enough loosened
from the bow and not unskilfully aimed
but a breath foolish affection ever crosses
 the abbot
in the mid volley and sways the arrow from
the mark
say not so morton replied murray
i have both dared and done
yes enough to gain but not enough to
keep reckon not that she will think and
act thus you have wounded her deeply
both in pride and in power it signifies
nought that you would tent now the wound
with unavailing salves as matters stand
with you you must forfeit the title an
affectionate brother to hold that a bold
and determined statesman
 morton said murray with some impatience
 i brook not these taunts what
i have done i have done what i must further
do i must and will but i am not
made iron like thee and i cannot but
remember enough thismy purpose
holds
and i warrant me said morton the
choice these domestic consolations will
rest with 
here he whispered names which escaped
the abbot 
roland graeme's ear murray replied in a
similar tone but so much raised towards
the conclusion the sentence that the
page heard these words and him i
hold myself secure by glendinning's recommendation

ay which may be as much trustworthy
as his late conduct at the abbey 
saint mary's you have heard his brother's
election has taken place your favourite
sir halbert my lord murray has as
much fraternal affection as yourself
by heaven morton that taunt demanded
an unfriendly answer but i pardon it for
your brother also is concerned but this
election shall be annulled i tell you earl
 morton while i hold the sword state
in my royal nephew's name neither lord nor
knight in scotland shall dispute my authority
 and if i bear with insults from my
friends it is only while i know them to be
such and forgive their follies for their faithfulness

morton muttered what seemed to be
 the abbot
some excuse and the regent answered him
in a milder tone and then subjoined besides
i have a pledge besides glendinning's
recommendation for this youth's fidelity
his nearest relative has placed herself in my
hands as his security to be dealt withal as
his doings shall deserve
that is something replied morton 
 but yet in fair love and good will i must
still pray you to keep on your guard the
foes are stirring again as horseflies and
hornets become busy so soon as the stormblast
is over george seyton was cropping
the causeway this morning with a score
 men at his back and had a ruffle with
my friends the house leslie they
met at the trone and were fighting hard
when the provost with his guard partizans
came in thirdsman and staved them
asunder with their halberds as men part
dog and bear
he hath my order for such interference
said the regent has any one
been hurt 
the abbot 
 george seyton himself by black
ralph leslie the devil take the rapier that
ran not through from side to side ralph
has a bloody coxcomb by a blow from a
messanpage whom nobody knew dick
seyton windygowl is run through the
arm and two gallants the leslie have
suffered phlebotomy this is all the gentle
blood which has been spilled in the revel 
but a yeoman or two on both sides have
had bones broken and ears cropped the
ostlerwives who are like to be the only
losers by their miscarriage have dragged
the knaves off the street and are crying a
drunken coronach over them
 you take it lightly douglas said the
regent these broils and feuds would
shame the capital the great turk let
alone that a christian and reformed state
but if i live this gear shall be amended 
and men shall say when they read my story
that if it were my cruel hap to rise to power
by the dethronement a sister i employed
it when gained for the benefit the commonweal

 the abbot
and your friends replied morton j
wherefore i trust for your instant order
annulling the election this lurdane abbot
edward glendinning
 you shall be presently satisfied and
stepping forward he began to call soho
hyndman when suddenly his eye
lighted on roland graeme by my faith
douglas said he turning to his friend
here have been three at counsel
ay but only two can keep counsel
said morton the galliard must be disposed

 for shame morton an orphan boy 
hearken thee my child thou hast told
me some thy accomplishments canst
thou speak truth 
ay my lord when it serves my turn
replied gramme
 it shall serve thy turn now said the
regent and falsehood shall be thy destruction
how much hast thou heard or
understood what we two have spoken
together 
the abbot 
but little my lord replied roland
graeme boldly which met my apprehension
saving that it seemed to me as if in
something you doubted the faith the
knight avenel under whose roof i was
nurtured
and what hast thou to say on that
point young man continued the regent
bending his eyes upon him with a keen and
strong expression observation
that said the page depends on the
quality those who speak against his honour
whose bread i have long eaten if
they be my inferiors i say they lie and
will maintain what i say with my barton 
if my equals still i say they lie and will do
battle in the quarrel if they list with my
sword if my superiors he paused
 proceed boldly said the regent
 what if thy superior said aught that nearly
touched your master's honour 
 i would say replied graeme that
he did ill to slander the absent and that my
vol lu e
 the abbot
master was a man who could render an account
 his actions to any one who should
manfully demand it him to his face
and it were manfully said replied the
regent what thinks thou my lord 
morton 
 i think replied morton that if the
young galliard resemble a certain ancient
friend ours as much in the craft his
disposition as he does in eye and in brow
there may be a wide difference betwixt
what he means and what he speaks
 and whom meanest thou that he resembles
so closely said murray
even the true and trusty julian 
replied morton
 but this youth belongs to the debateable
land said murray
 it may be so but julian was an outlying
striker venison and made many a
far cast when he had a fah doe in chase
 pshaw said the regent this is but
idle talk here thou hyndman thou curiosity
 conduct this youth to his compare
abbot 
non you will both he said to graeme
 keep yourselves in readiness to travel on
short notice and then motioning to him
courteously to withdraw he broke up the
interview
 the abbot
chapter 
it is and is not tis the thing i sought for
have kneel'd for pray'd for risk'd my fame and life for
and yet it is not no more than the shadow
upon the hard cold flat and polish'd mirror
is the warm graceful rounded living substance
which it presents in form and lineament
old plain
the usher with gravity which ill concealed
a jealous scowl conducted roland
graeme to a lower apartment where he
found his comrade the falconer the man
 office then briefly acquainted them that
this would be their residence till his grace's
further orders that they were to go to the
pantry to the buttery to the cellar and to
the kitchen at the usual hours to receive
the allowances becoming their station
instructions which adam woodcock's old
familiarity with the court made him perfectthe
abbot 
ly understand for your beds he said
you must go to the hostelry saint michael's
in respect the palace is now full 
the domestics the greater nobles
no sooner was the usher's back turned
than adam exclaimed with all the glee 
eager curiosity and now master roland
the news the news come unbutton
thy pouch and give us thy tidings what
says the regent asks he for adam woodcock
 and is all soldered up or must the
abbot unreason strap for it 
all is well in that quarter said the
page and for the rest but heyday
what have you taken the chain and medal
off from my bonnet 
 and meet time it was when yon usher
vinegarfaced rogue that he is began to
enquire what popish trangam you were
wearing by the mass the metal would
have been confiscated for consciencesake
like your other rattle trap yonder at 
which mrs lilies bears about on her
shoes in the guise a pair shoebuckles
 the abbot
this comes carrying popish nicknames
about you
 time jade exclaimed roland graeme
 has she melted down my rosary into
buckles for her clumsy hoofs which will
become such a garnish well nigh as well asa
cow's might but hang her let her keep
them many a dog's trick have i played
old lilies for want having something
better to do and the buckles will serve fora
remembrance do you remember the
verjuice i put into the comfits when old
wingate and she were to breakfast together
on easter morning 
in troth do i master roland the
majordomo's mouth was as crooked as a
hawk's beak for the whole morning afterward
and any other page in your room
would have tasted the discipline the
porter's lodge for it but my lady's favour
stood between your skin and many a jerking
 lord send you may be the better for
her protection in such matters
the abbot 
i am at least grateful for it adam 
and i am glad you put me in mind it
well but the news my young master
said woodcock spell me the tidings 
what are we to fly at next what did the
regent say to you f
nothing that i am to repeat again said
koland graeme shaking his head
why heyday said adam how prudent
we are become ail a sudden you
have advanced rarely in brief space master
roland you have well nigh had your
broken head and you have gained your
gold chain and you have made an enemy
master usher to wit with his two legs like
hawk's perches and you have had audience
 the first man in the realm and bear as
much mystery in your brow as if you had
flown in the courtsky ever since you were
hatched i believe in my soul you would
run with a piece the eggshell on your
head like the purlieus whom i would we
were after them again we used to call
whaup in the halidome and its neighbourhood
the abbot
hood but sit thee down boy adam
woodcock was never the lad to seek to enter
into forbidden secrets sit thee down
and i will go fetch the vivers i know the
butler and the panther old
the goodnatured falconer set forth upon
his errand busying himself about procuring
their refreshment and during his absence
roland graeme abandoned himself to the
strange complicated and yet heartstirring
reflections to which the events the morning
had given rise yesterday he was 
neither mark nor likelihood a vagrant boy
the attendant on a relative whose sane
judgment he himself had not the highest
opinion but now he had become he
knew not why or wherefore or to what
extent the custodier as the scottish phrase
went some important state secret in the
safe keeping which the regent himself
was concerned it did not diminish from
but rather added to the interest a situation
so unexpected that roland himself
did not perfectly understand wherein he
the abbor 
stood committed by the state secrets in
which he had unwittingly become participator
on the contrary he felt like one who
looks on a romantic landscape which
he sees the features for the first time and
then obscured with mist and driving tempest
the imperfect glimpse which the eye
catches rocks trees and other objects
around him adds double dignity to these
shrouded mountains and darkened abysses
 which the height depth and extent are
left to imagination
but mortals especially at the well appetite
age which precedes twenty years are
seldom so much engaged either by real or
conjectural subjects speculation but
what their earthly wants claim their hour
 attention and with many a smile did
our hero so the reader may term him if he
will hail the reappearance his friend
adam woodcock bearing on one wooden
platter a tremendous portion boiled beef
and on another a plentiful allowance 
 the abbot
greens or rather what the scotch call langkail
a groom followed with bread salt
and the other means setting forth a meal 
and when they had both placed on the oaken
table what they bore in their hands the falconer
observed that since he knew the court
it had got harder and harder every day to
the poor gentlemen and yeomen retainers
but that now it was an absolute flaying a
flea for the hide and tallow such thronging
to the wicket and such churlish answers
and such bare beefbones such a
shouldering at the butteryhatch and cellarage
and nought to be gained beyond small
insufficient single ale or at best with a single
strike malt to counterbalance a double
allowance water by the mass
though my young friend said he while he
saw the food disappearing fast under roland's
active exertions it is not so well to
lament for former times as to take the advantage
 the present else we are like to
lose on both sides
so saying adam woodcock drew his
the abbot 
chair towards the table unsheathed his
knife for every one carried that minister 
festive distribution for himself and imitated
his young companion's example who for the
moment had lost his anxiety for the future
in the eager satisfaction an appetite sharpened
by youth and abstinence
in truth they made though the materials
were sufficiently simple a very respectable
meal at the expence the royal allowance
and adam woodcock notwithstanding the
deliberate censure which he had passed on
the household beer the palace had taken
the fourth deep draught the black jack
ere he remembered him that he had spoken
in its dispraise flinging himself jollily and
luxuriously back in an old danse elbow
chair and looking with a careless glee
towards the page extending at the same
time his right leg and stretching the other
easily over it he reminded his companion
that he had not yet heard the ballad which
he had made for the abbot unreason's
 the abbot
revel and accordingly he struck merrily
up with
the pope that pagan full pride
has blinded us full lang
roland grasme who felt no great delight
as may be supposed in the falconer's
satire considering its subject began to
snatch up his mantle and fling it around his
shoulders an action which instantly interrupted
the ditty adam woodcock
 where the vengeance are you going
now he said thou restless boy thou
hast quicksilver in the veins thee to a
certainty and can'st no more abide any
douce and sensible communing than a
bootless hawk would keep perched on ray
wrist 
 why adam replied the page if
you must needs know i am about to take
a walk and look at this fair city one mayas
well be still mewed up in the old castle
 the lake if one is to sit the livelong night
between four stone walls and hearken to
old ballads
the abbot 
it is a new ballad the lord help thee
replied adam and that one the best
that ever was matched with a rousing chorus

 be it so said the page i will hear
it another day when the rain is dashing
against the windows and there is neither
steed stamping nor spur jingling nor feather
waving in the neighbourhood to mar
my marking it well but even now i want
to be in the world and to look about me
but the never a stride shall you go
without me said the falconer until the
regent shall take you whole and sound off
my hand and so if you will we may goto
the hostelry saint michael's and there
you will see company enough but through
the casement mark you me for as to rambling
through the street to seek seytons
and leslie and having a dozen holes drilled
in your new jacket with rapier and poniard
i will yield no way to it
to the hostelry saint michael's then
with all my heart said the page and they
 the abbot
left the palace accordingly rendered to the
sentinels at the gate who had now taken
their posts for the evening a strict account
 their names and business were dismissed
through a small wicket the closebarred
portal and soon reached the inn or
hostelry saint michael which stood in a
large courtyard off the main street close
under the descent the cantonhill the
place wide waste and uncomfortable resembled
rather an eastern caravansery
where men found shelter indeed but were
obliged to supply themselves with everything
else than one our modern inns 
where not one comfort shall to those be lost
who never ask or never feel the cost
but still to the inexperienced eye roland
greene the bustle and confusion 
this place public resort furnished excitement
and amusement in the large
room into which they had rather found
their own way than been ushered by mine
host travellers and natives the city enthe
abbot hi
tered and departed met and greeted gamed
or drank together regardless each other's
presence forming the strongest contrast to
the stern and monotonous order and silence
with which matters were conducted
in the wellordered household the knight
 avenel altercation every kind from
brawling to jesting was going on amongst
the groupes around them and yet the noise
and mingled voices seemed to disturb no
one and indeed to be noticed by no others
than by those who composed the groupe
to which the speaker belonged
the falconer passed through the apartment
to a projecting latticed window which
formed a sort recess from the room itself
and having here ensconced himself and his
companion he called for some refreshments 
and a tapster after he had shouted for the
twentieth time accommodated him with
the remains a cold capon and a neat's
tongue together with a pewter stoup 
weak french vindespair fetch a stoup
 brandywine thou knave we will be jolly
tonight master roland said he when
 the abbot
he saw himself thus accommodated and
let care come tomorrow
but roland had eaten too lately to enjoy
the good cheer j and feeling his curiosity
much sharper than his appetite he made
it his choice to look out the lattice which
overhung a large yard surrounded by the
stables the hostelry and fed his eyes on
the busy sight beneath while adam woodcock
after he had compared his companion
to the laird macfarlane's geese who
liked their play better than their meat
disposed his time with the aid cup and
trencher occasionally humming the burthen
 his birth strangled ballad and beating
time to it with his fingers on the little
round table in this exercise he was frequently
interrupted by the exclamations 
his companion as he saw something new in
the yard beneath to attract and interest
him
it was a busy scene for the number gentlemen
and nobles who were now crowded
into the city had filled all spare stables and
places public reception with their horses
the abbot 
and military attendants there were some
score yeomen dressing their own or their
masters horses in the yard whistling singing
laughing and upbraiding each other ina
style wit which the good order avenel
castle rendered strange to roland grasme's
ears others were busy repairing their own
arms or cleaning those their masters one
fellow having just bought a bundle twenty
spears was sitting in a corner employed
in painting the white handles the weapons
with yellow and vermillion other
lacqueys led large staghounds or wolfdogs
 noble race carefully muzzled to
prevent accidents to passengers all came
and went mixed together and separated
under the delighted eye the page whose
imagination had not even conceived a scene
so gaily diversified with the objects he had
most pleasure in beholding j so that he was
perpetually breaking the quiet reverie honest
woodcock and the mental progress
which he was making in his ditty by exclaiming
 look here adam look at the bonny
 the abbot
bay horse saint anthony what a gallant
forehand he hath got and see the goodly
grey which yonder fellow in the friezejacket
is dressing as awkwardly as if he had
never touched aught but a cow i would i
were nigh him to teach him his trade 
and lo you adam the gay milan armour
that the yeoman is scouring all steel and
silver like our knight's prime suit which
old wingate makes such account and see
to yonder pretty wench adam who comes
tripping through them all with her milkpail
 i warrant me she has had a long walk
from the loaning she has a stammel waistcoat
like your favourite cissy sunderland
master adam
by my hood lad answered the falconer
 it is well for thee thou wert brought
up where grace grev even in the castle
 avenel thou wert a wildblood enough
but hadst thou been nurtured here within
a flightshot the court thou hadst been
the veriest crackhemp a page that ever
wore feather in thy bonnet or steel by thy
the abbot 
side truly i wish it may well with
thee
 nay but leave thy senseless humming
and drumming old adam and come to the
window ere thou hast drenched thy senses
in the pintpot there see here comes a
merry minstrel with his crowd and a wench
with him that dances with bells at her ancles
 and see the yeomen and pages leave
their horses and the armour they were
cleaning and gather round as is very natural
to hear the music come old adam
we will thither too
 you shall call me cut if i do go down
said adam you are near as good minstrelsy
as he can make if you had the grace
to listen to it
 but the wench in the stammel waistcoat
is stopping too adam by heaven
they are going to dance frieze jacket
wants to dance with stammelwaistcoat but
she is coy and recusant
then suddenly changing his tone levity
into one deep interest and surprise
 the abbot
he exclaimed queen heaven what
is it that i see and then remained silent
the sage adam woodcock who was ina
sort languid degree amused with the
page's exclamations even while he professed
to despise them became at length rather
desirous to set his tongue once more going
that he might enjoy the superiority afforded
by his own intimate familiarity withall
the circumstances which excited in his
young companion's mind so much wonderment

well then he said at last what is it
you do see master roland that you have
become mute all a sudden 
roland returned no answer
i say master roland greene said the
falconer it is manners in my country fora
man to speak when he is spoken to
roland graeme remained silent
 the murrain is in the boy said adam
woodcock he has stared out his eyes and
talked his tongue to pieces i think
the falconer hastily drank off his can 
the abbot 
wine and came to roland who stood like
a statue with his eyes eagerly bent on the
courtyard though adam woodcock was
unable to detect amongst the merry scene
which it exhibited aught that could deserve
such devoted attention
the lad is mazed said the falconer
to himself
but roland greene had good reasons for
his surprise though they were not such ashe
could communicate to his companion
the touch the old man's instrument
for he had already begun to play had
drawn in several auditors from the street
when one entered the gate the yard
whose appearance exclusively arrested the
attention roland graeme he was 
his own age or a good deal younger and
from his dress and bearing might be the
same rank and calling having all the air 
coxcombry and pretension which accorded
with a handsome though slight and low figure
and an elegant dress in part hid by
a large purple cloak as he entered he
 the abbot
cast a glance up towards the windows and
to his extreme astonishment under the
purple velvet bonnet and white feather
roland recognized the features so deeply
impressed on his memory the bright and
clustered tresses the laughing full blue
eyes the well formed eyebrows the nose
with the slightest possible inclination to be
aquiline the ruby lip which an arch and
half suppressed smile seemed the habitual
expression in short the form and face 
catherine sey ton in man's attire however
and mimicking as it seemed not unsuccessfully
the bearing a youthful but forward
page
saint george and saint andrew said
the astonished roland graeme to himself
 was there ever such an audacious quean 
she seems a little ashamed her mummery
too for she holds the lap her cloak
to her fac and her colour is heightened 
but santa maria how she threads the
throng with as firm and bold a step as
if she had never tied petticoat round her
the abbot 
waist holy saints she holds up her ridingrod
as if she would lay it about some 
their ears that stand most in her way by
the hand my father she bears herself
like the very model pagehood hey 
what sure she will not strike friezejacket
in earnest but he was not long left in
doubt for the lout whom he had before repeatedly
noticed standing in the way the
bustling page and maintaining his place
with clownish obstinacy or stupidity the
advanced ridingrod was without a moment's
hesitation sharply applied to his
shoulders in a manner which made him
spring aside rubbing the part the body
which had received so unceremonious a
hint that it was in the way his betters
the party injured growled forth an oath or
two indignation and roland grasme
began to think flying down stairs to the
assistance the translated catherine j but
the laugh the yard was against friezejacket
which indeed had in these days
 the abbor
small chance fair play in a quarrel with velvet
and embroidery so that the fellow who
was a menial in the inn slunk back to finish
his task dressing the bonny grey laughed
at by all but most by the wench in the
stammel waistcoat his fellow servant who
to crown his disgrace had the cruelty to
cast an applauding smile upon the author
 the injury while with a freedom more
like the milkmaid the town than she 
the plains she accosted him with is
there any one you want here my pretty
gentleman that you seem in such haste 
i seek a sprig a lad said the seeming
gallant with a sprig holly in his
cap black hair and black eyes green jacket
and the air a country coxcomb i have
sought him through every close and alley
in the canongate the fiend gore him 
 why goda mercy nun muttered
roland greene much bewildered
i will enquire him presently out for your
fair young worship said the wench the
inn
the abbot 
do said the gallant squire and if
you bring me to him you shall have a groat
tonight and a kiss on sunday when you
have on a cleaner kirtle
why godmercy nun again muttered
roland this is a note above e la
in a moment after the servant entered
the room and ushered in the object his
surprise
while the disguised vestal looked with
unabashed brow and bold and rapid glance
 her eye through the various parties in
the large old room roland greeme who
felt an internal awkward sense bashful
confusion which he deemed altogether unworthy
 the bold and dashing character
to which he aspired determined not to be
browbeaten and put down by this singular
female but to meet her with a glance 
recognition so sly so penetrating so expressively
humorous as should shew her at
once he was in possession her secret and
master her fate and should compel her
vol f
 the abbot
to humble herself towards him at least into
the look and manner respectful and deprecating
observance
this was extremely well planned but
just as roland had called up the knowing
glance the suppressed smile the shrewd
intelligent look which was to ensure his
triumph he encountered the bold firm and
steady gaze his brother or sisterpage
who casting on him a falcon glance and
recognizing him at once as the object 
his search walked up with the most unconcerned
look the most free and undaunted
composure and hailed him with you sir
holly top i would speak with you
the steady coolness and assurance with
which these words were uttered although
the voice was the very voice he had heard
at the old convent and although the features
more nearly resembled those catherine
when seen close than when viewed
from a distance produced nevertheless
such a confusion in roland's mind that he
became uncertain whether he was not still
the abbot 
under a mistake from the beginning the
knowing shrewdness which should have
animated his visage faded into a sheepish
bashfulness and the halfsuppressed but
most intelligible smile became the senseless
giggle one who laughs to cover his
own disorder ideas
 do they understand a scotch tongue
in thy country holytop said this marvellous
specimen metamorphosis i
said i would speak with thee
 what is your business with my comrade
my young chick the game said
adam woodcock willing to step in to his
companion's assistance though totally at a
loss to account for the sudden disappearance
 all roland's usual smartness and
presence mind
 nothing to you my old cock the
perch replied the gallant go mind your
hawk's castings i guess by your bag and
your gauntlet that you are squire the
body to a sort kites
he laughed as he spoke and the laugh
 the abbot
reminded roland so irresistibly the
hearty fit risibility in which catherine
had indulged at his expence when they first
met in the old nunnery that he could scarce
help exclaiming catherine seyton by
heavens he checked the exclamation
however and only said i think sir we
two are not totally strangers to each other
 we must have met in our dreams then
said the youth and my days are too busy
to remember what i think at nights
 or apparently to remember upon one
day those whom you may have seen on the
preceding eve said roland graeme
the youth in his turn cast on him a look
 some surprise as he replied i know
no more what you mean than does the
horse i ride on if there be offence in your
words you shall find me as ready to take it
as any lad in lothian
you know well said roland though
if it pleases you to use the language a
stranger that with you i can have no purpose
to quarrel
the abbot 
let me do mine errand then and be
rid you said the page step hither
this way out that old leathern fist's hearing

they walked into the recess the window
which roland had left upon theyouth's
entrance into the apartment the messenger
then turned his back on the company
after casting a hasty and sharp glance around
to see if they were observed roland did
the same and the page in the purple mantle
thus addressed him taking at the same
time from under his cloak a short but beautifully
wrought sword with the hilt and ornaments
upon the sheath silver massively
chased and over gilded i bring you
this weapon from a friend who gives it you
under the solemn condition that you will
not unsheathed it until you are commanded
by your rightful sovereign for your
warmth temper is known and the presumption
with which you intrude yourself
into the quarrels others and therefore
this is laid upon you as a penance by those
 the abbot
who wish you well and whose hand will influence
your destiny for good or for evil
this is what i was charged to tell you soif
you will give a fair word for a fair sword
and pledge your promise with hand and
glove good and well and if not i will carry
back caliban to those who sent it
 and may i not ask who these areas
said roland gramme admiring at the same
time the beauty the weapon thus offered
him
 my commission in no way leads me
to answer such a question said he the
purple mantle
 but if i am offended said roland
 may i not draw to defend myself
 not this weapon answered the swordbearer
 but you have your own at command
and besides for what do you wear
your poniard 
 for no good said adam woodcock
who had now approached close to them 
 and that i can witness as well as any one
 stand back fellow said the messenger 
the abbot 
thou hast an intrusive curious face that
will come by a buffet if it is found where it
has no concern
 a buffet my young master malapert
said adam drawing back however best
keep down fist or by our lady buffet will
beget buffet 
be patient adam woodcock said
roland greene and let me pray you
fair sir since by such addition you chuse
for the present to be addressed may i not
barely unsheathed this fair weapon in pure
simplicity desire to know whether so
fair a hilt and scabbard are matched with a
befitting blade 
 by no manner means said the messenger
 at a word you must take it under
the promise that you never draw it until
you receive the commands your lawful
sovereign or you must leave it alone
 under that condition and coming from
your friendly hand i accept the sword
said roland taking it from his hand but
credit me that if we are to work together
in any weighty emprise as i am induced to
 the abbot
believe some confidence and openness on
your part will be necessary to give the right
impulse to my zeal i press for no more at
present it is enough that you understand
me
i understand you said the page exhibiting
the appearance unfeigned surprise
in his turn renounce me if do
here you stand suggesting and smuggling
and looking cunning as if there were some
mighty matter intrigue and common understanding
betwixt you and me whom
you never set your eyes on before 
 what said roland graeme will
you deny that we have met before 
marry that i will in any christian
court said the other page
and will you also deny said roland
 that it was recommended to us to study
each other's features well that in whatsoever
disguise the time might impose upon us
each should recognize in the other the secret
agent a mighty work do not you
remember that sister magdalen and dame
bridget
the abbot 
the messenger here interrupted him
shrugging up his shoulders with a look 
compassion bridget and magdalen why
this is madness and dreaming hark ye
master holly top your wits are gone on
woolgathering comfort yourself with a
caudle thatch your brainsick noddle with
a woollen night cap and so god be with
you
as he concluded this polite parting address
adam woodcock who was again
seated by the table on which stood the now
empty can said to him will you drink
a cup young man in the way courtesy
now you have done your errand and listen
a good song and without waiting for an
answer he commenced his ditty 
the pope that pagan full prideshath
blinded us full long
it is probable that the good wine had made
some innovation in the falconer's brain
otherwise he would have recollected the
danger introducing any thing like political
or polemical pleasantry into a public
f 
 the abbot
assemblage at a time when men's minds
were in a state great irritability todo
him justice he perceived his error and
stopped short so soon as he saw that the
word pope had at once interrupted the separate
conversations the various parties
which were assembled in the apartment 
and that many began to draw themselves
up bridle look big and prepare to take
part in the impending brawl while others
more decent and cautious persons hastily
paid down their laying and prepared ta
leave the place ere bad should come to
worse
and to worse it was soon likely to come 
for no sooner did woodcock's ditty reach
the ear the stranger page than uplifting
his ridingrod he exclaimed he who
speaks irreverently the holy father 
the church in my presence is the cub a
heretic wolfbitch and i will switch him as
i would a mongrel cur
and i will break thy young pate said
adam if thou dearest to lift a finger to
the abbot 
me and then in defiance the young
drawcansir's threats with a stout heart and
dauntless accent he again uplifted the stave
 the pope that pagan full pride
hath blinded
bat adam was able to proceed no farther
being himself unfortunately blinded
by a stroke the impatient youth's switch
across his eyes enraged at once by the
smart and the indignity the falconer started
up and darkling as he was for his eyes
watered too fast to permit his seeing anything
he would soon have been at close
grips with his insolent adversary had not
roland graeme contrary to his nature played
for once the prudent man and the peacemaker
and thrown himself betwixt them imploring
woodcock's patience you know
not he said with whom you have to do
and thou addressing the messenger who
stood scornfully laughing at adam's rage
 get thee gone whoever thou art j if thou
 the abbot
best what i guess thee thou well knowest
there are earnest reasons why thou shouldst
thou hast hit right for once hollytop
said the gallant though i guess you
drew your bow at a venture here host
let this yeoman have a pottle wine to
wash the smart out his eyes and there
is a french crown for him so saying he
threw the piece money on the table and
left the apartment with a quick yet steady
pace looking firmly at right and left as if
to defy interruption and snapping his fingers
at two or three respectable burghers
who declaring it was a shame that any one
should be suffered to rant and ruffle in defence
 the pope were labouring to find
the hilts their swords which had got for
the present unhappily entangled in the
folds their cloaks but as the adversary
was gone ere any them had reached
his weapon they did not think it necessary
to unsheathe cold iron but merely observed
to each other this is more than masterful
violence to see a poor man stricken
the abbot 
in the face just for singing a ballad against
the whore babylon if the popes champions
are to be songsters in our very changehouses
we shall soon have the old shavelines
back again
the provost should look to it said
another and have some five or six armed
with partizans to come in upon the first
whistle to teach these gallants their lesson
forlookyouneighbourlugleatheritisnot
for decent householders like ourselves to be
brawling with the godless grooms and pert
pages the nobles that are bred up to little
else save bloodshed and blasphemy
for all that neighbour said lugleather
 i would have curried that youngster as
properly as ever i curried a lamb's hide had
not the hilt my bilbo been for the instant
beyond my grasp and before i could
turn my girdle gone was my master
ay said the others the devil go
with him and peace abide with us i give
my rede neighbours that we pay the laying
and be stepping homeward like brother
and brother j for old saint giles's is tolling
 the abbot
curfew and the street grows dangerous at
night
with that the good burghers adjusted their
cloaks and prepared for their departure
while he that seemed the briskest the three
laying his hand on his andrea ferrara observed
that they that spoke in praise the
pope on the highgate edinburgh had
best bring the sword saint peter to defend
them
while the illhumour excited by the insolence
 the young aristocrat was thus evaporating
in empty menace roland greene
had to controul the far more serious indignation
 adam woodcock why manit
was but a switch across the mazzard
blow your nose dry your eyes and you will
see all the better for it
by this light which i cannot see said
adam woodcock thou hast been false
friend to me young man neither taking
up my rightful quarrel nor letting me fight
it out myself
 fye for shame adam woodcock replied
the youth determined to turn the tathe
abbot 
bless on him and become in turn the counsellor
 good order and peaceable demeanour
 i say fye for shame alas that
you will speak thus here are you sent
with me to prevent my innocent youth
getting into snares 
 i wish your innocent youth were cut
short with a halter with all my heart said
adam who began to see which way the
admonition tended
 and instead setting before me
continued roland an example patience
and sobriety becoming the falconer sir
halbert glendinning you quaff me off i
know not how many flagons ale besides
a gallon wine and a full measure strong
waters
 it was but one poor pottle said poor
adam whom consciousness now reduced
to a merely defensive warfare
it was enough to pottle you handsomely
however said the page and then
instead going to bed to sleep off your
liquor must you sit singing your roistering
 the abbot
songs about popes and pagans till you have
got your eyes almost switched out your
head and but for my interference whom
your drunken ingratitude accuses deserting
you yon galliard would have cut your
throat for he was whipping out a linger
as broad as my hand and as sharp as a razor
 and these are lessons for an inexperienced
youth oh adam out upon you 
out upon you 
marry amen and with all my heart
said adam out upon my folly for expecting
any thing but impertinent raillery
from a page hke thee that if he saw his father
in a scrape would laugh at him instead
 lending him aid
 nay but i will lend you aid said the
page still laughing that is i will lend thee
aid to thy chamber good adam where thou
shalt sleep off wine and ale ire and indignation
and awake the next morning with as
much fair wit as nature has blessed thee
withal only one thing i will warn thee
good adam that henceforth and for ever
the abbot 
when thou fairest at me for being somewhat
hot at hand and rather too prompt to outwith
poniard or so thy admonition shall
serve as a prologue to the memorable adventure
 the switching saint michael's

with such condoling expressions he got
the crestfallen falconer to his bed and then
retired to his own pallet where it was sometime
ere he could fall asleep if the messenger
whom he had seen were really catherine
seyton what a masculine virago
and termagant must she be and stored
with what an inimitable command insolence
and assurance the brass on her
brow would furbish the front twenty
pages and i should know thought roland
what that amounts to and yet her features
her look her light gait her laughing
eye the art with which she disposed the
mantle to shew no more her limbs than
needs must be seen i am glad she had at
least that grace left the voice the smile
it must have been catherine seyton or
 the abbot
the devil in her likeness one thing is
good i have silenced the eternal predications
 that ass adam woodcock who has
set up for being a preacher and a governor
over me so soon as he has left the hawks
mew behind him
and with this comfortable reflection
joined to the happy indifference which
youth hath for the events the morrow
roland grme fell fast asleep
the abbot 
chapter v
now have you reft from me my staff my guide
who taught my youth as men teach untamed falcons
to use my strength discreetly i am reft
 comrade and counsel
old plain
in the grey the next morning's dawn
there was a loud knocking at the gate 
the hostelry andthose without proclaiming
that they came in the name the regent
were instantly admitted a moment or two
afterwards michael ingthewind stood
by the bedside our travellers
 up up i he said there is no slumber
where murray hath work ado
both sleepers sprung up and began to
dress themselves
you old friend said wing the wind to
adam woodcock must to horse instantly
with this packet to the monks kenna
quhair and with this delivering them a
he spoke to the knight aveneu
 the abbot
 as much as commanding the monks
to annul their election til warrant me 
an abbot quoth adam woodcock as he
put the packets into his bag and charging
my master to see it done to hawk atone
brother with another is less than fair
play methinks
 fash not thy beard about it old boy
said michael but betake thee to the saddle
presently for if these orders are not
obeyed there will be bare walls at the kirk
 saint mary's and it may be at the castle
 avenel to boot for i heard my lord 
morton loud with the regent and we are
at a pass that we cannot stand with him
anent trifles
 but said adam touching the abbot
 unreason what say they to that
outbreak an they be shrewishly disposed
i were better pitch the packets to satan
and take the other side the border
for my bield
 o that is passed over as a jest since
there was little harm done but hark thee
adams continued his comrade if there
the abbot 
was a dozen vacant abbacies in your road
whether jest or earnest reason or unreason
draw thou never one their mitres
over thy brows the time is not fitting
man besides our maiden longs to clip
the neck a fat churchman
 she shall never sheer mine in that capacity
said the falconer while he knotted
the kerchief in two or three double folds
around his sun burnt bullneck calling out
at the same time master roland master
roland make haste we must back to
perch and mew and thank heaven more
than our own wit with our bones whole
and without a stab in the stomach
nay but said wingthewind the
page goes not back with you the regent
has other employment for him
saints and sorrows exclaimed the
falconer master roland grme to remain
here and i to return to avenel 
why it cannot be the child cannot manage
himself in this wide world without me
and i question if he will stoop to any other
 the abbot
whistle than mine own there are times i
myself can hardly bring him to my lure
it was at roland's tongue's to say
something concerning the occasion they
had for using mutually each other's prudence
but the real anxiety which adam
evinced at parting with him took away his
disposition to such ungracious raillery the
falconer did not altogether escape however
for in turning his face towards the lattice
his friend michael caught a glimpse it
and exclaimed i pr'ythee adam woodcock
what hast thou been doing with these
eyes thine they are swelled to the
starting from the hoot 
 nought in the world said he after
casting a deprecating glance at roland
graeme but the effect sleeping in this
d d truckle without a pillow
i why adam woodcock thou art grown
strangely dainty said his old companion 
 i have known thee sleep all night with
no better pillow than a bush ling and
start up with the sun as gregg as a falcon 
and now thine eyes resembles
abbot 

tie was roused from his reverie by michael
wingthewind who reminded him
that it was necessary they should instantly
return to the palace as my lord regent
went to the sessions early in the morning
they went thither accordingly and 
a favourite old domestic who was
admitted nearer to the regent's person and
privacy than many whose posts were more
ostensible soon introduced graeme into a
small matted chamber where he had an
audience the present head the troubled
state scotland the earl murray was
clad in a sadcoloured morninggown with
a cap and slippers the same cloth but
even in this easy dishabille held his sheathed
rapier in his hand a precaution which
he adopted when receiving strangers rather
in compliance with the earnest remonstrances
 his friends and partizans than from
any personal apprehensions his own he
answered with a silent nod the respectful
obeisance the page and took one or two
turns through the small apartment in silence
fixing his keen eye on roland as if
 the abbot
he wished to penetrate into his very soul
at length he broke silence
 your name is i think julian graeme
roland graeme my lord not julian
replied the page
right i was misled by some trick 
my memory roland graeme from the
debateable land roland thou knowest
the duties which belong to a lady's service

i should know them my lord replied
roland having been bred so near the
person my lady avenel but i trust
never more to practise them as the knight
hath promised
be silent young man said the regent
 i am to speak and you to hear and
to obey it is necessary that for some space
at least you shall again enter into the service
 a lady who in rank hath no equal
in scotland and this service accomplished
i give thee my word as knight and prince
that it shall open to you a course ambition
such as may well gratify the aspiring
wishes one whom circumstances entitle
the abbot 
to entertain much higher views than thou
i will take thee into my household and near
to my person or at your own choice will
give you the command a footcompany 
either is a preferment which the proudest
laird in the land might be glad to assure to
a second son
 may i presume to ask my lord said
roland observing the earl paused for a reply
 to whom my poor services are in the
first place destined 
 you will be told hereafter said the
regent and then as if overcoming some
internal reluctance to speak further himself
he added or why should i not myself tell
you that you are about to enter into the
service a most illustrious most unhappy
lady into the service mary scotland

 the queen my lord said the page
unable to repress his surprise
 her who was the queen said
murray with a singular mixture displeasure
and embarrassment in his tone voice
 the abbot
 you must be aware young man that her
son reigns in her stead
he sighed from an emotion partly perhaps
natural and partly assumed
and am i to attend upon her grace in
her place imprisonment my lord again
demanded the page with a straightforward
and hardy simplicity which somewhat disconcerted
the sage and powerful statesman
she is not imprisoned answered murray
angrily j god forbid she should 
she is only sequestrated from state affairs
and from the business the public until
the world be so effectually settled that she
may enjoy her natural and uncontrouled
freedom without her royal disposition being
exposed to the practices wicked and
designing men it is for this purpose he
added that while she is to be furnished
as right is with such attendance as may befit
her present secluded state it becomes
necessary that those placed around her are
persons on whose prudence i can have reliance
you see therefore you are at once
the abbot 
called on to discharge an office most honourable
in itself and so to discharge it that you
may make a friend the regent scotland
thou art i have been told a singularly
apprehensive youth and i perceive by
thy look that thou doest already understand
what i would say on this matter
in this schedule your particular points 
duty are set down at length but the sum
required you is fidelity i mean fidelity
to myself and to the state you are therefore
to watch every attempt which is made
or inclination displayed to open any communication
with any the lords who have
become banders in the west with hamilton
with seyton with fleming or the like
it is true that my gracious sister reflecting
upon the ill chances that have lapped to the
state this poor kingdom from evil counsellors
who have abused her royal nature intime
past hath determined to sequestrate
herself from state affairs in future but it is
our duty as acting for and in name our
infant nephew to guard against the evils
which may arise from any mutation or 
the abbot
collation in her royal resolutions wherefore
it will be thy duty to watch and report
to our lady mother whose guest our sister
is for the present whatever may infer a disposition
to withdraw her person from the
place security in which she is lodged or
to open communication with those without
if however your observation should detect
any thing weight and which may
exceed mere suspicion fail not to send notice
by an especial messenger to me directly
and this ring shall be thy warrant to order
horse and man on such service and
now begone if there be half the wit in thy
head that there is apprehension in thy look
thou fully comprehended all that i would
say serve me faithfully and sure as i am
belted earl thy reward shall be great
roland grace made an obeisance and
was about to depart
the earl signed to him to remain i
have trusted thee deeply he said young
man for thou art the only one her suite
who has been sent to her by my own recommendation
her gentlewomen are her
the abbot 
own nomination it were too hard to have
barred her that privilege though some there
were who reckoned it inconsistent with sure
policy thou art young and handsome
mingle in their follies and see they cover
not deeper designs under the appearance 
female levity if they do mine do thou
countermine for the rest bear all decorum
and respect to the person thy mistress 
she is a princess though a most unhappy
one and hath been a queen though now
alas no longer such pay therefore to
her all honour and respect consistent with
thy fidelity to the king and me and
now farewell yet stay you travel with
lord lindesay a man the old world
rough and honest though untaught see
that thou offend him not for he is not patient
 raillery and thou i have heard art
a crackhalter this he said with a smile
then added i could have wished the lord
lindesay's mission had been entrusted to
some other and more gentle noble
 and wherefore should you wish that
g 
 the abbot
my lord said morton who even then entered
the apartment the council have
decided for the best we have had but too
many proofs this lady's stubbornness 
mind and the oak that resists the sharp
steel axe must be riven with the rugged
iron wedge and this is to be her page 
my lord regent hath doubtless instructed
you young man how you shall guide yourself
in these matters i will add but a little
hint on my part you are going to the castle
 a douglas where treachery never thrives
the first moment suspicion will be the
last your life my kinsman william
douglas understands no raillery and if he
once have cause to think you false you will
waver in the wind from the castle battlements
ere the sun set upon his anger and
is the lady to have an almoner withal 
occasionally douglas said the regent
 it were hard to deny the spiritual
consolation which she thinks essential to
her salvation
 you are ever too softhearted my lord
the abbot 
what a false priest to communicate her
lamentations not only to our friends in
scotland but to the guises to rome to
spain and i know not where 
fear not said the regent we will
take such order that no treachery shall happen

 look to it then said morton you
know my mind respecting the wench you
have consented she shall receive as a 
 one a family which all
others has ever been devoted to her and
inimical to us had we not been wary she
would have been purveyed a page as
much to her purpose as her waiting damsel
i hear a rumour that an old mad romish
pilgrims who passes for at least half a
saint among them was employed to find a
fit subject
 we have escaped that danger at least
said murray and converted it into a point
 advantage by sending this boy glendining's
 and for her waiting damsel you
cannot grudge her one poor maiden instead
 the abbot
 her four noble maries and all their silken
train
 i care not so much for the waiting
maiden said morton but i cannot brook
the cautioner i think priests all persuasions
are much like each other here is
john knox vho made such a noble pullerdown
is ambitious becoming a setter up
and a founder schools and colleges out 
the abbey lands and bishop's rents and
other spoils rome which the nobility 
scotland have won with their sword and
bow and with which he would nowendow
new hives to sing the old drone
 john is a man god said the regent
 and his scheme is a devout imagination

the sedate smile with which this was
spoken left it impossible to conjecture
whether the words were meant in approbation
or in derision the plan the scottish
reformer turning then to roland
graeme as if he thought he had been long
enough a witness this conversation he
the abbot 
bade him get him presently to horse since
my lord lindesay was already mounted
the page made his reverence and left the
apartment
guided by michael wingthewind he
found his horse ready saddled and prepared
for the journey in front the palace porch
where hovered about a score menatarms
whose leader shewed no small symptoms
 surly impatience
is this the jackanapes page for whom
wee have waited this long said he to 
 and my lord ruthven will
reach the castle long before us
michael assented and added that the boy
had been detained by the regent to receive
some parting instructions the leader
made an inarticulate sound in his throat
expressive sullen acquiesence and calling
to one his domestic attendants
 edward said he take the gallant into
your charge and let him speak with no one
else
he then addressed by the title sir
robert an elderly and respectable looking
 the abbot
gentleman the only one the party who
seemed above the rank a retainer or
domestic and observed that they must get
to horse with all speed
during this discourse and while they
were riding slowly along the street the
suburb roland had time to examine more
accurately the looks and figure the baron
who was at their head
lord lindesay the byres was rather
touched than stricken with years his upright
stature and strong limbs still shewed
him fully equal to all the exertions and fatigues
 war his thick eyebrows now
partially grizzled lowered over large eyes
full dark fire which seemed yet darker
from the uncommon depth at which they
were set in his head his features naturally
strong and harsh had their sternness exaggerated
by one or two scars received in battle
these features naturally calculated to
express the harsher passions were shaded by
an open steel cap with a projecting front
but having no visor over the gorget which
fell the black and grizzled beard the grim
the abbot 
old baron and totally hid the lower part
 his face the rest his dress was a loose
buffcoat which had once been lined with
silk and adorned with embroidery but which
seemed much stained with travel and damaged
with cuts received probably in battle
it covered a corslet which had once been
 polished steel fairly gilded but was now
somewhat injured with rust a sword 
antique make and uncommon size framed
to be wielded with both hands a kind 
weapon which was then beginning to go
out use hung from his neck in a baldrick
and was so disposed as to traverse his
whole person the huge hilt appearing over
his left shoulder and the point reaching
well nigh to the right heel and jarring
against his spur as he walked this unwieldy
weapon could only be unsheathed
by pulling the handle over the left should
no human arm was long enough
to draw it in the usual manner the whole
equipment was that a rude warrior negligent
 his exterior even to misanthropic
the abbot
cal sullenness and the short harsh haughty
tone which he used towards his attendants
belonged to the same unpolished character

the personage who rode with lord lindsay
at the head the party was an absolute
contrast to him in manner form
and features his thin and silky hair was
already white though he seemed not above
fortyfive or fifty years old his tone 
voice was soft and insinuating his form
thin spare and bent by a habitual stoop 
his pale cheek was expressive shrewdness
and intelligence his eye was quick
though placid and his whole demeanour
mild and conciliatory he rode an ambling
nag such as were used by ladies clergymen
or others peaceful professions wore
a riding habit black velvet with a cap
and feather the same hue fastened up
by a golden medal and for show and as a
mark rank rather than for use carried a
walking sword as the short light rapiers
were called without any other arms offensive
or defensive
the abbot ll
the party had now quitted the town
and proceeded at a steady trot towards
the westward as they prosecuted their
journey roland graeme would gladly have
learned something its purpose and tendency
but the countenance the personage
next to whom he had been placed in the
train discouraged all approach to familiarity
the baron himself did not look more
grim and inaccessible than his feudal retainer
whose grizzly beard fell over his
mouth like the portcullis before the gate 
a castle as if for the purpose preventing
the escape any word which absolute
necessity did not demand the utterance
the rest the train seemed under the
same taciturn influence and journeyed on
without a word being exchanged amongst
them more like a troop carthusian friars
than a party military retainers roland
graeme was surprised at this extremity
 discipline for even in the household
 the knight avenel though somewhat
distinguished for the accuracy with which
 the abbot
decorum was enforced a journey was a pes 
riot licence during which jest and song
and every thing within the iitnits becoming
mirth and pastime was freely permitted
this unusual silence was however sofar
acceptable that it gave him time to
bring any shadow judgment which he
possessed to council on his own situation
and prospects which would have appeared
to any reasonable person in the highest degree
dangerous and perplexing
it was quite evident that he had through
various circumstances not under his own 
controul formed contradictory connexions
with both the contending factions by whose
strife the kingdom was distracted without
being properly an adherent either it
seemed also clear that the same situation in
the household the deposed queen to
which he was now promoted by the influence
 the regent had been destined to
him by his enthusiastic grandmother magdalen
grme for on this subject the words
which morton had dropped had been a ray
the abbot l
 light yet it was no less clear that these
two persons the one the declared enemy
the other the enthusiastic votary the catholic
religion the one at the head the
king's new government the other who regarded
that government as a criminal usurpation
must have required and expected very
different services from the individual whom
they had thus united in recommending it
required very little reflection to foresee that
these contradictory claims on his services
might speedily place him in a situation
where his honour as well as his life might
be endangered but it was not in roland
grasme's nature to anticipate evil before it
came or to prepare to combat difficulties
before they arrived i will see this beautiful
and unfortunate mary stuart said he
 whom we have heard so much and
then there will be time enough to determine
whether i will be kinsman or queensman
none them can say i have given
word or promise to either their factions 
for they have led me up and down like a
 the abbor
blind billy without giving me any light into
what i was to do but it was lucky that
grim douglas came into the regent's closet
this morning otherwise i had never got
free him without plighting my troth todo
all the earl would have me which seemed
after all but foul play to the poor imprisoned
lady to place her page as an espial
on her
skipping thus lightly over a matter 
such consequence the thoughts the hairbrained
boy went a woolgathering after
more agreeable topics now he admired
the gothic towers barnbougle rising
from the seabeaten rock and overlooking
one the most glorious landscapes in scotland
 and now he began to consider what
notable sport for the hounds and the hawks
must be afforded by the variegated ground
over which they travelled and now he
compared the steady and dull trot at which
they were then prosecuting their journey
with the delight sweeping over hill and
dale in pursuit his favourite sports as
the abbot 
under influence these joyous recollections
he gave his horse the spur and made
him execute a gambade he instantly incurred
the censure his grave neighbour who
hinted to him to keep the pace and move
quietly and in order unless he wished such
notice to be taken his eccentric movements
as was likely to be very displeasing
to him
the rebuke and the restraint under which
the youth now found himself brought back
to his recollection his late goodhumoured
and accommodating associate and guide
adam woodcock and from that topic his
imagination made a short flight to avenel
castle to the quiet and unconfined life its
inhabitants the goodness his early protectress
not forgetting the denizens its
stables kennels and hawk mews in a brief
space all these subjects meditation gave
way to the remembrance that riddle 
womankind catherine sey ton who appeared
before the eye his mind now in her
female form now in her male attire now
 the abbot
in both at once like some strange dream
which presents to us the same individual
under two different characters at the same
instant her mysterious present also recurred
to his recollection the sword which
he now wore at his side and which he was
not to draw save by command his legitimate
sovereign but the key this mystery
he judged he was likely to find in the
issue his present journey
with such thoughts passing through his
mind roland graeme accompanied the
party lord lindesay to the queen'sferry
which they passed in vessels that
lay in readiness for them they encountered
no adventure whatsoever in their passages
excepting one horse being lamed in
getting into the boat an incident very common
on such occasions until a few years
ago when the ferry was completely regulated
what was more peculiarly characteristic
 the olden age was the discharge 
a culverin at the party from the battlements
 the old castle rosette on the
the abbot l
tiorth side the ferry the lord which
happened to have some public or private
quarrel with the lord lindesay and took
this mode expressing his resentment
the insult however as it was harmless remained
unnoticed and unavenged nor did
anything else occur worth notice until the
band had come where lochleven spread its
magnificent sheet waters to the beams 
a bright summer sun
the ancient castle which occupies an
island nearly in the centre the lake recalled
to the page that avenel in which
he had been nurtured but the lake was
much larger and adorned with several islets
besides that on which the fortress was situated
 and instead being embosomed in
hills like that avenel had upon the
southern side only a splendid mountainous
screen being the descent one the lomond
hills and on the other was surrounded
by the extensive and fertile plain 
kinross roland grasme looked with some
degree dismay on the watergirdled forts
the abbot
tress which then as now consisted only 
one large donjonkeep surrounded with a
courtyard with two round flankingtowers
at the angles which contained wutliin its
circuit some other buildings inferior
importance a few old trees clustered together
near the castle gave some relief to
the air desolate seclusion but yet the
page while he gazed upon a building so
sequestered could not but feel for the situation
 a captive princess doomed to
dwell there as well as for his own i must
have been born he thought under the star
that presides over ladies and lakes water
for i cannot by any means escape from the
service the one or from dwelling in the
other but if they allow me not the fair
freedom my sport and exercise they shall
find it as hard to confine a wilddrake as a
youth who can swim like one
the band had now reached the edge 
the water and one the party advancing
displayed lord lindesay's pennon waving
it repeatedly to and fro while that baron
the abbot 
himself blew a clamorous blast on his bugle
a banner was presently displayed from the
roof the castle in reply to these signals
and one or two figures were seen busied as
if unmooring a boat which lay close to the
islet
it will be some time ere they can reach
us with the boat said the companion 
the lord lindsay should we not do well
to proceed to the town and array ourselves
in some better order ere we appear befores

 you may do as you list sir robert
replied lindesay have neither time nor
temper to waste on such vanities she has
cost me many a hard ride and must not
now take offence at the thread bare cloak
and soiled doublet that i am arrayed in it
is the livery to which she has brought all
scotland
 do not speak so harshly said sir robert
 if she hath done wrong she hath
dearly abed it and in losing all real power
vol n h
 the abbot
one would not deprive her the little external
homage due at once to a lady and a
princess
 i say to you once more sir robert
melville replied lindesay do as you
will for me i am now too old to drink
myself as a gallant to grace the bower 
dames
 the bower dames my lord said
melville looking at the rude old tower
 is it yon dark and grated castle the
prison a captive queen to which you
give so gay a name 
name it as you list replied lindesay 
had the regent desired to send an envoy
capable to speak to a captive queen there
are many gallants in his court who would
have courted the occasion to make speeches
out amadis gaul or the mirror 
knighthood but when he sent blunt old
lindesay he knew he would speak to a misguided
woman as her former misdoings and
her present state render necessary i sought
not this employment it has been thrust
the abbot 
upon me and i will not cumber myself with
more form in the discharge it than needs
must be tacked to such an occupation
so saying lord lindesay threw himself
from horseback and wrapping his ridingcloak
around him lay down at lazy length
upon the sward to await the arrival the
boat which was now seen rowing from the
castle toward the shore sir robert melville
who had also dismounted walked at short
turns to and fro upon the bank his arms
crossed on his breast often looking to the
castle and displaying in his countenance a
mixture sorrow and anxiety the rest
 the party sate like statues on horseback
without moving so much as the points 
their lances which they held upright in the
air
as soon as the boat approached a rude
quay or landingplace near to which they
had stationed themselves lord lindesay
started up from his recumbent posture and
asked the person who steered why he had
 the abbot
not brought a larger boat with him to transport
his retinue
 so please you replied the boatman
because it is the order our lady that
we bring not to the castle more than four
persons
 thy lady is a wise woman said lindsay
 to suspect me treachery or had
i intended it what is to hinder us from
throwing you and your comrades into the
lake and filling the boat with my own fellows

the steersman on hearing this made a
hasty signal to his men to back their oars
and hold oft from the shore which they
were approaching
why thou ass said lindesay thou
didst not think that i meant thy fool's head
serious harm hark thee friend with
fewer than three servants i will go nowhither
sir robert melville will require
at least the attendance one domestic 
and it will be at your peril and your lady's
the abbot 
to refuse us admission come hither as weare
on matters great national concern
the steersman answered with firmness
but with great civ ility expression that his
orders were positive to bring no more than
four into the island but he offered to row
back to obtain a revisal his orders
 do so my friend said sir robert melville
after he had in vain endeavoured to
persuade his stubborn companion to consent
to a temporary abatement his train
row back to the castle sith it will be no
better and obtain thy lady's orders to transport
the lord lindesay myself and our
retinue hither
and hearken said lord lindesay
take with you this page who comes as an
attendant on your lady's guest dismount
sirrah said he addressing roland and
embark with them in that boat
 and what is to become my horse 
said graeme i am answerable for him to
my master
 will relieve you the charge said
 the abbot
lindesay thou wilt have little enow todo
with horses for ten years to come
 if i thought so said roland but he
was interrupted by sir robert melville
who said to him goodhumouredly dispute
it not young friend resistance can
do no good but may well run thee into
danger
roland greene felt the justice what
he said and though neither delighted with
the matter nor manner lindesay's address
deemed it best to submit to necessity
and to embark without further remonstrance
the men plied their oars the
quay with the party horse stationed near
it receded from the page's eyes the castle
and the islet seemed to draw near in the
same proportion and in a brief space he
landed under the shadow a huge old tree
which overhung the landingplace the
steersman and graeme leaped ashore the
boatmen remained lying on their oars ready
for further service

could valour aught avail or people's love
france had not wept navarre's brave henry slain 
if wit or beauty could compassion move
the rose scotland had not wept in vain
elegy in a royal mausoleum lewis
at the gate the courtyard lochleven
appeared the stately form the
lady lochleven a female whose early
charms had captivated james v by whom
she became mother the celebrated regent
murray as she was noble birth
being a daughter the house mar
and great beauty her intercourse with
james did not prevent her being afterwards
sought in honourable marriage by many
gallants the time among whom she had
 the abbot
preferred sir william douglas cochlea
but well has it been said
sour pleasant vices
are made the whips to scourge us 
the station which the lady cochlea
even now held as the wife a man high
rank and interest and the mother a lawful
family did not prevent her nourishing a
painful sense degradation even while she
was proud the talents the power and the
station her son now prime ruler the
state but still a pledge her illicit intercourse
had james done to her she said
in her secret heart the justice he owed her
she had seen in her son as a source unmixed
delight and unchastened pride the
lawful monarch scotland and one the
ablest who ever swayed the sceptre the
house mar not inferior in antiquity or
grandeur to that drummond would then
have also boasted a queen amongst its
daughters and escaped the stain attached
to female frailty even when it has a royal
lover for its apology while such feelings
the abbot 
preyed on a bosom naturally proud and severe
they had a corresponding effect on her
countenance where with the remains 
great beauty were mingled traits indicative
 inward discontent and peevish melancholy
it perhaps contributed to increase
this habitual temperament that the lady
loehleven had adopted uncommonly rigid
and severe views religion imitating in
her ideas reformed faith the very worst
errors the catholics in limiting the benefit
 the gospel to those who profess their
own speculative tenets
in every respect the unfortunate queen
mary's now the compulsory guest or rather
prisoner this sullen lady was obnoxious
to her hostess lady loehleven disliked
her as the daughter mary guise the
legal possessor those rights over james's
heart and hand which she conceived herself
to have been injuriously deprived and
yet more so as the professor a religion
which she detested worse than paganism
such was the dame who with stately
 the abbot
mien and sharp yet handsome features
shrouded by her black velvet coif interrogated
the domestic who steered her barge
to the shore what had become lindesay
and sir robert melville the man related
what had passed and she smiled scornfully
as she replied fools must be flattered
not fought with row back make thy
excuse as thou canst say lord ruthven
hath already reached this castle and that he
is impatient for lord lindesay's presence
away with thee randal yet stay what
galopin is that thou hast brought hither 
 so please you my lady he is the page
who is to wait upon 
 ay the new male minion said the
lady lochleven j the female attendant
arrived yesterday i shall have a wellordered
house with this lady and her retinue 
but i trust they will soon find some others
to undertake such a charge begone randal
 and you to roland graeme follow
me to the garden
she led the way with a slow and stately
the abbot 
step to the small garden which enclosed
by a stone wall ornamented with statues
and an artificial fountain in the centre
extended its dull parterres on the side 
the courtyard with which it communicated
by a low and arched portal within the narrow
circuit its formal and limited walks
mary stuart was now learning to perform
the weary part a prisoner which with
little interval she was doomed to sustain
during the remainder her life she was
followed in her slow and melancholy exercise
by two female attendants but in the
first glance which roland greene bestowed
upon one so illustrious by birth so distinguished
by her beauty accomplishments
and misfortunes he was sensible the
presence no other than the unhappy
queen scotland
her face her form have been so deeply
impressed upon the imagination that even at
the distance nearly three centuries it is unnecessary
to remind the most ignorant and
uninformed reader the striking traits which
 the abbot
characterize that remarkable countenance
which seems at once to combine our ideas 
the majestic the pleasing and the brilliant
leaving us to doubt whether they express
most happily the queen the beauty or the
accomplished woman who is there at the
very mention mary stuart's name that
has not her countenance before him familiar
as that the mistress his youth or
the favourite daughter his advanced age 
even those who feel themselves compelled
to believe all or much what her enemies
laid to her charge cannot think without
a sigh upon a countenance expressive
 anything rather than the foul crimes
with which she was charged when living
and which still continue to shade if not
to blacken her memory that brow so
truly open and regal those eyebrows so
regularly graceful which yet were saved
from the charge regular insipidity by
the beautiful effect the hazel eyes which
they overarched and which seem to utter
a thousand histories the nose with
the abbot 
all its grecian precision outline the
mouth so well proportioned so sweetly
formed as if designed to speak nothing but
what was delightful to hear the dimpled
chin the stately swanhke neckform a countenance
the like which we know not to
have existed in any other character moving
in that high class life where the actresses
as well as the actors command general
and undivided attention it is in vain
to say that the portraits which exist this
remarkable woman are not like each other 
for amidst their discrepancy each possesses
general features which the eye at once acknowledges
as peculiar to the vision which
our imagination has raised while we read
her history for the first time and which
has been impressed upon it by the numerous
prints and pictures which we have
seen indeed we cannot look on the worst
 them however deficient in point execution
without saying that it is meant for
queen mary and no small instance it is
 the power beauty that her charms
 the abbot
should have remained the subject not merely
 admiration but warm and chivalrous
interest after the lapse such a length
 time we know that by far the most
acute those who in latter days have
adopted the unfavourable view mary's
character longed like the executioner before
his dreadful task was performed to kiss
the fair hand her on whom he was about
to perform so horrible a duty
dressed then in a deep mourning robe
and with all those charms face shape and
manner with which faithful tradition has
made each reader familiar mary stuart advanced
to meet the lady lochleven who
on her part endeavoured to conceal dislike
and apprehension under the appearance 
respectful indifference the truth was that
she had experienced repeatedly the queen's
superiority in that species disguised yet
cutting sarcasm with which women can successfully
avenge themselves for real and
substantial injuries it may be well doubted
whether this talent was not as fatal to
the abbot 
its possessor as the many others enjoyed by
that highly gifted but most unhappy female
for while it often afforded her a momentary
triumph over her keepers it failed not to
exasperate their resentment and the satire
and sarcasm in which she had indulged
where frequently retaliated by the deep and
bitter hardships which they had the power
 inflicting it is well known that her
death was at length hastened by a letter
which she wrote to queen elizabeth in
which she treated her jealous rival and the
countess shrewsbury with the keenest
irony and ridicule
as the ladies met together the queen
said bending her head at the same time in
return to the obeisance the lady lochleven
 we are this day fortunate we
enjoy the company our amiable hostess
at an unusual hour and during a period
which we have hitherto been permitted to
give to our private exercise but our good
hostess knows well she has at all times access
to our presence and need not observe
 the abbot
the useless ceremony requiring our permission

i am sorry my presence is deemed an
intrusion by your grace said the lady
 lochleven i came but to announce
the arrival an addition to your train
motioning with her hand towards roland
graeme a circumstance towards which
ladies are seldom indifferent
 o i crave your ladyship's pardon 
and am bent to the earth with obligation for
the kindness my nobles or my sovereigns
shall i call them who have permitted me
such a respectable addition to my personal
retinue
they have indeed studied madam
said the lady lochleven to shew their
kindness toward your grace something at
the risk perhaps sound policy and i trust
their doings will not be misconstrued
impossible said the queen the
bounty which permits the daughter so
many kings and who yet is queen the
the abbot 
realm the attendance two waiting women
and a boy is a grace which mary stuart can
never sufficiently acknowledge why my
train will be equal to that any countrydame
in this your kingdom fife saving
but the lack a gentlemanusher and two
blue coated servingmen but i must not
forget in my selfish joy the additional trouble
and charges to which this augmentation
 our train will put our kind hostess and
the whole house lochleven it is this
i am aware which clouds your brows my
worthy lady but be good cheer the
crown scotland has many a fair manor
and your affectionate son and my no less
affectionate brother will endow the good
knight your husband with the best them
ere mary should be dismissed from this hospitable
castle from your ladyship's lack 
means to support the charges
the douglass lochleven madam
answered the lady have known for ages
how to discharge their duty to the state
 the abbot
without looking for reward even when the
task was both irksome and dangerous
nay but my dear lochleven said the
queen you are over scrupulous i pray
you accept a goodly manor what should
support the queen scotland in this her
princely court saving her own crown lands
and who should minister to the wants 
a mother save an affectionate son like the
earl murray who possesses so wonderfully
both the power and inclination or
said you it was the danger the task which
clouded your smooth and hospitable brow 
no doubt a page is a formidable addition
to my bodyguard females and i bethink
me it must have been for that reason
that my lord lindesay refused even now
to venture within the reach a force so
formidable without being attended by a
competent retinue
the lady lochleven started and looked
something surprised and mary suddenly
changing her manner from the smooth ironthe
abbot 
ital affectation mildness to an accent 
austere command and drawing up at the
same time her fine person said with the full
majesty her rank yes lady lochleven
 i know that ruthven is already in
the castle and that lindesay waits on the
bank the return your barge to bring him
hither along with sir robert melville for
what purpose do these nobles come and
why am i not in ordinary decency apprized
 their arrival 
 their purpose madam replied the
lady lochleven they must themselves
explain but a formal annunciation were
needless where your grace hath attendants
who can play the espial so well
 alas poor fleming said the queen
turning to the elder the female attendants
 thou wilt be tried condemned and
gib betted for a spy in the garrison because
thou didst chance to cross the great
hall while my good lady lochleven was
parleying at the full pitch her voice with
her pilot randal put black wool in thy
 the abbot
ears girl as you value the wearing them
longer remember in the castle lochleven
ears and tongues are matters not 
use but show merely our good hostess
can hear as well as speak for us all
we excuse your further attendance my
lady hostess she said once more addressing
the object her resentment and
retire to prepare for an interview with our
rebel lords we will use the antichamber
 our sleeping apartment as our hall
 audience you young man she proceeded
addressing roland graeme aid at
once softening the ironical sharpness her
manner into goodhumoured raillery you
who are all our male attendance from our
lord high chamberlain down to our least
galopin follow us to prepare our court
she turned and walked slowly towards
the castle the lady lochleven folded
her arms and smiled in bitter resentment
as she watched her retiring steps
 thy whole male attendance she muttered
repeating the queen's last words
the abbot 
 and well for thee had it been had thy
train never been larger then turning to
roland in whose way she had stood while
making this pause she made room for him
to pass saying at the same time art thou
already evesdropping follow thy mistress
minion and if thou wilt tell her what i have
now said
roland graeme hastened after his royal
mistress and her attendants who had just
entered a posterngate communicating betwixt
the castle and the small garden they
ascended a winding stair as high as the second
storey which was in a great measure
occupied by a suite three rooms opening
into each other and assigned as the dwelling
 the captive princess the outermost
was a small hall or outerroom within
which opened a large parlour and from
that again the queen's bedroom another
small apartment which opened into
the same parlour contained the beds the
gentlewomen in waiting
 the abbot
roland graeme stepped as became his
station into the outermost these apartments
there to await such orders as might
be communicated to him from the grated
window the room he saw lindesay
melville and their followers disembark 
and observed that they were met at the castle
gate by a third noble to whom lindesay
exclaimed in his loud harsh voice my
lord ruthven you have the start us
at this instant the page's attention was
called to a burst hysterical sobs from the
inner apartment and to the hurried ejaculations
 the terrified females which led him
almost instantly to hasten to their assistance
when he entered he saw that the queen
had thrown herself into the large chair
which stood nearest the door and was sobbing
for breath in a strong fit hysterical
affection the elder female supported her
in her arms while the younger bathed her
face with water and with tears alternately
hasten young man said the elder
the abbot 
lady in alarm fly call in assistance she
is swooning 
but the queen ejaculated in a faint and
broken voice stir not i charge you 
call no one to witness i am better i will
recover instantly and indeed with an
effort which seemed like that one struggling
for life she sate up in her chair and
endeavoured to resume her composure
while her features yet trembled with the
violent emotion body and mind which
she had undergone i am ashamed 
my weakness girls she said taking the
hands her attendants j but it is over
and i am mary stuart once more the savage
tone that man's voice my knowledge
 his insolence the name which he
named the purpose for which they come
may excuse a moments weakness and it
shall be a moment's only she snatched
from her head the curch or cap which had
been disordered during her hysterical agoi
ny shook down the thick clustered tresses
 dark brown which had been before 
the abbot
ed under it and drawing her slender fingers
across the labyrinth which they formed
she arose from the chair and stood
like the inspired image a grecian prophetess
in a mood which partook at once
 sorrow and pride smiles and tears
 we are ill appointed she said to meet
our rebel subjects but as far as we may
we will strive to present ourselves as becomes
their queen follow me my maidens
she said what says thy favourite
song my fleming 
my maids come to my dressing bower
and deck my nutbrown hair 
where'er ye laid a plait before
look ye lay ten times mair
alas she added when she had repeated
with a smile these lines an old ballad
 violence has already robbed me the
ordinary decorations my rank and the
few that nature gave me have been destroyed
by sorrow and by fear yet while she
spoke thus she again let her slender fingers
stray through the wilderness the beauties
abbot 
ful tresses which veiled her kingly neck and
swelling bosom as if in her agony mind
she had not altogether lost the consciousness
 her unrivalled charms roland graeme
on whose youth inexperience and ardent
sense what was dignified and lovely the
demeanour so fair and highborn a lady
wrought like the charm a magician stood
rooted to the spot with surprise and interest
longing to hazard his life in a quarrel
so fair as that which mary stuart's must
needs be she had been bred in france 
she was possessed the most distinguished
beauty she had reigned a queen and
a scottish queen to whom knowledge 
character was as essential as the use vital
air in all these capacities mary was
 all women on the earth most alert at
perceiving and using the advantages which
her charms gave her over almost all who
came within the sphere their influence
she cast on roland a glance which might
nave melted a heart stone my poor
boy she said with a feeling partly real
vol n i
 the abbot
partly political thou art a stranger to us
sent to this doleful captivity from the society
 some tender mother or sister or
maiden with whom you had freedom to
tread a gay measure round the may pole i
grieve for you but you are the only male
in my limited household wilt thou obey
my orders 
to the death madam said graeme ina
determined tone
 then keep the door mine apartment
said the queen keep it till they
offer actual violence or till we shall be fitly
arrayed to receive these intrusive visitors

 i will defend it till they pass over my
body said roland graeme any hesitation
which he had felt concerning the line 
conduct he ought to pursue being completely
swept away by the impulse the
moment
 not so my good youth answered mary
 not so command thee if i have
one faithful subject beside me much need
the abbot 
god wot i have to care for his safety
resist them but till they are put to the
shame using actual violence and then
give way i charge you remember my commands
and with a smile expressive at
once favour and authority she turned
from him and followed by her attendants
entered the bedroom
the youngest paused for half a second ere
she followed her companion and made a signal
to roland graeme with her hand he had
been already long aware that this was catherine
seyton a circumstance which could
not much surprise a youth quick intellects
who recollected the sort mysterious discourse
which had passed betwixt the two matrons
at the deserted nunnery and on which
his meeting with catherine in this place
seemed to cast so much light yet such was
the engrossing effect mary s presence that
it surmounted for the moment even the feelings
 a youthful lover and it was not until
catherine seyton had disappeared that
roland began to consider in what relation
 the abbor
they were to stand to each other she held
up her hand to me in a commanding manner
he thought j perhaps she wanted to
confirm my purpose for the execution 
the queen's commands for i think she
could scarce purpose to scare me with the
sort discipline which she administered to
freezejacket and to poor adam woodcock
but we will see to that anon j meantime
let us do justice to the trust reposed
in us by this unhappy queen i think my
lord murray will himself own that it is
the duty a faithful page to defend his lady
against intrusion on her privacy
accordingly he stepped to the little vestibule
made fast with lock and bar the
door which opened from thence to the large
staircase and then sate himself down to attend
the result he had not long to wait
a rude and strong hand first essayed to
lift the latch then pushed and shook the
door with violence and when it resisted his
attempt to open it exclaimed undo the
door there you within 
the abbot 
 why and at whose command said
the page am i to undo the door the
queen scotland 
another vain attempt which made hinge
and bolts jingle shewed that the impatient
applicant without would willingly have entered
without regarding his challenge j but
at length an answer was returned
 undo the door on your peril the lord
lindesay comes to speak with the lady
mary scotland
the lord lindesay as a scottish noble
answered the page must await his
sovereign's leisure
an earnest altercation ensued amongst
those without in which roland distinguished
the remarkably harsh voice lindesay
in reply to sir robert melville who appeared
to have been using some soothing language
 no no no i tell thee no i
will place a petard against the door rather
than be baulked by a profligate woman and
bearded by an insolent footboy
yet at least said melville let me
 the abbot
try fair means in the first instance violence
to a lady would stain your scutcheon
for ever or await till my lord ruthven
comes
 will await no longer said lindesay 
it is high time the business were done
and we on our return to the council but
thou mayest try thy fair play as thou callest
it while i cause my train to prepare
the petard i came hither provided with as
good gunpowder as blew up the kirk 
field
for god's sake be patient said melville
 and approaching the door he said
as speaking to those within let the queen
know that i her faithful servant robert
melville do entreat her for her own sake
and to prevent worse consequence that she
will undo the door and admit lord lindsay
who brings a mission from the council
 state
 i will do your errand to the queen
said the page and report to you her answer

the abbot 
he went to the door the bedchamber
and tapping against it gently it was
opened by the elder lady to whom he communicated
his errand and returned with
directions from the queen to admit sir robert
melville and lord lindesay roland
greene returned to the vestibule and opened
the door accordingly into which the
lord lindesay strode with the air a soldier
who has fought his way into a conquered
fortress j while melville deeply dejected
followed him more slowly
i draw you to witness and to record
said the page to this last that save for
the especial commands the queen i
would have made good the entrance with
my best strength and my best blood against
all scotland
 be silent young man said melville
in a tone grave rebuke add not brands
to dre this is no time to make a flourish
 thy boyish chivalry
 she has not appeared even yet said
lindesay who had now reached the midst

 the abbot
 the parlour or audience room how call
you this trifling 
patience my lord replied sir robert
time presses not and lord ruthven hath
not as yet descended
at this moment the door the inner
apartment opened and queen mary presented
herself advancing with an air peculiar
grace and majesty and seeming totally
unruffled either by the visit or by the
rude manner in which it had been enforced
her dress was a robe black velvet a
small ruff open in front gave a full view
 her beautifully formed chin and neck but
veiled the bosom on her head she wore
a small cap lace and a transparent white
veil hung from her shoulders over the long
black robe in large loose folds so that it
could be drawn at pleasure over the face
and person she wore a cross gold
around her neck and had her rosary gold
and ebony hanging from her girdle she was
closely followed by her two ladies who remained
standing behind her during the conthe
abbot 
terence even lord lindesay though the
rudest noble that rude age was surprised
into something like respect by the unconcerned
and majestic mien her whom
he had expected to find frantic with impotent
passion or dissolved in useless and
vain sorrow or overwhelmed with the fears
likely in such a situation to assail fallen
royalty
 we fear we have detained you my
lord lindesay said the queen while
she curtsied with dignity in answer to his
reluctant obeisance but a female does
not willingly receive her visitors without
some minutes spent at the toilette men
my lord are less dependant on such ceremonies

lord lindsay casting his eye down on
his own travelstained and disordered dress
muttered something a hasty journey and
the queen paid her greeting to sir robert
melville with courtesy and even as
it seemed with kindness there was then
a dead pause during which lindesay 
the abbot
ed towards the door as if expecting with
impatience the colleague their embassy
the queen alone was entirely unembarrassed
and as if to break the silence she addressed
lord lindesay with a glance at the
large and cumbrous sword which he wore
as already mentioned hanging from his
neck
you have there a trusty and a weighty
travelling companion my lord i trust you
expected to meet with no enemy here
against whom such a formidable weapon
could be necessary it is methinks somewhat
a singular ornament for a court
though i am as i well need to be too
much a stuart to fear a sword
 it is not the first time madam replied
lindesay bringing round the weapon
so as to rest its point on the ground and
leaning one hand on the huge crosshandle
it is not the first time that this weapon
has intruded itself into the presence the
house stuart
 possibly my lord replied the queen
the abbot 
 it may have clone service to my ancestors
 your ancestors were men loyalty
 ay madam replied he service it
hath done but such as kings love neither
to acknowledge nor to reward it was the
service which the knife renders to the tree
when trimming it to the quick and depriving
it the superfluous growth rank
and unfruitful suckers which rob it nourishment

 you talk riddles my lord said mary 
i will hope the explanation carries nothing
insulting with it
 you shall judge madam answered
lindesay with this good sword was
archibald douglas earl angus girded
on the memorable day when he acquired
the name bellthereat for dragging from
the presence your greatgrandfather the
third james the race a crew minions
flatterers and favourites whom he hanged
over the bridge lauder as a warning to
such reptiles how they approach a scottish
throne with this same weapon the same
inflexible champion scottish honour and
 the abbot
nobility slew at one blow spent kilspin
die a courtier your grandfather james
the fourth who had dared to speak lightly
 him in the royal presence they fought
near the brook fall and bellthereat
with this blade sheared through the thigh
 his opponent and lopped the limb as
easily as a shepherd's boy slices a twig from
a sapling
 my lord replied the queen reddening
 my nerves are too good to be alarmed
even by this terrible history may i ask
how a blade so illustrious passed from the
house douglas to that lindesay 
methinks it should have been preserved asa
consecrated relique by a family who have
held all that they could do against their
king to be done in favour their country
nay madam said melville anxiously
interfering ask not that question lord
lindesay and you my lord for shame 
for decency forbear to reply to it
 it is time that this lady should hear the
truth replied lindesay
the abbot 
 and be assured that she will be moved
to anger by none that you can tell her my
lord there are cases in which just scorn
has always the mastery over just anger
 then know said lindesay that upon
the field carburyhill when that false
and infamous traitor and murtherer james
sometime earl both well and nicknamed
duke orkney offered to do personal
battle with any the associated nobles
who came to drag him to justice i accepted
his challenge and was by the noble
earl morton gifted with this good sword
that i might therewith fight it out ah so
help me heaven had his presumption been
one grain more or his cowardice one grain
less i should have done such work with
this good steel on his traitorous corpse that
the hounds and carrioncrows should have
found their morsels daintily carved to their
use 
the queen's courage well nigh gave way
to the mention bothwell's name a name
connected with such a train guilt shame
 the abbot
and disaster but the prolonged boast 
lindesay gave her time to rally herself and
to answer with an appearance cold contempt
 it is easy to slay an enemy who
enters not the lists but had mary stuart
inherited her father's sword as well as his
sceptre the boldest her rebels should
not upon that day have complained that
they had no one to cope withal your
lordship will forgive me if i abridge this
conference a brief description a bloody
fight is long enough to satisfy a lady's curiosity
 and unless my lord lindesay has
something more important to tell us than 
the deeds which old bellthereat achieved
and how he would himself have emulated
them had time and tide permitted we will
retire to our private apartment and you
fleming shall finish reading to us yonder
little treatise des rhodomontade espag
nobles
tarry madam said lindesay his complexion
reddening in his turn i know
your quick wit too well old to have sought
the abbot 
an interview that yon might sharpen its
edge at the expence my honour lord
kuthven and myself with sir robert melville
as a concurrent come to your grace
on the part the secret council to tender
to you what much concerns the safety 
your own life and the welfare the state
the secret council said the queen 
by what powers can it subsist or act
while i from whom it holds its character
am here detained under unjust restraint 
but it matters not what concerns the welfare
 scotland shall be acceptable to mary
stuart come from whatsoever quarter it will
and for what concerns her own life she
has lived long enough to be weary it even
at the age twentyfive where is your
colleague my lord why tarries he 
he comes madam said melville and
lord ruthven entered at the instant holding
in his hand a packet as the queen
returned his salutation she became deadly
pale but instantly recovered herself by dint
 strong and sudden resolution just as the
 the abbot
noble whose appearance seemed to excite
such emotions in her bosom entered the
apartment in company with george douglas
the youngest son the knight 
lochleven who during the absence his
father and brethren acted as seneschal 
the castle under the direction the elder
lady lochleven his father's mother
the abbot 
chapter vii
i give this heavy weight from oflpmy heads
and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand 
with mine own tears i wash away ray balm
with my own hand i give away my crown
with mine own tongue deny my sacred state
with mine own breath release all duteous oaths
richard 
lord ruthven had the look and bearing
which became a soldier and a statesman
and the martial cast his form and features
procured him the popular epithet 
greysteil by which he was distinguished
by his intimates after the hero a metrical
romance then generally known his dress
which was a buffcoat embroidered had a
half military character but exhibited nothing
 the sordid negligence which distinguished
that lindesay but the son
 an illfated sire and the father a yet
 the abbot
more unfortunate family bore in his look
that cast inauspicious melancholy by
which the physiognomists that time pretended
to distinguish those who were predestined
to a violent and unhappy death
the terror which the presence this
nobleman impressed on the queen's mind
arose from the active share he had borne
in the slaughter david rizzio his father
having presided at the perpetration
 that abominable crime although so weak
from long and wasting illness that he could
not endure the weight his armour having
arisen from a sickbed to commit a
murther in the presence his sovereign
on that occasion his son also had attended
and taken an active part it was little
to be wondered at that the queen
considering her condition when such a
deed horror was acted in her presence
should retain an instinctive terror for the
principal actors in the mulier she returned
however with grace the salutation
 lord ruthven and extended her hand
the abbot 
to george douglas who kneeled and kissed
it with respect the first mark a subject's
homage which roland graeme had seen any
 them render to the captive sovereign she
returned his greeting in silence and there
was a brief pause during which the steward
 the castle a man a sad brow and a severe
eye placed under george douglas's
directions table and writing materials and
the page obedient to his mistress's dumb
signal advanced a large chair to the side on
which the queen stood the table thus forming
a sort bar which divided the queen
and her personal followers from her unwelcome
visitors the steward then withdrew
after a low reverence when he had closed
the door behind him the queen broke silences
with your favour my lords i
will sit my walks are not indeed extensive
enough at present to fatigue me greatly
yet i find repose something more necessary
than usual
she sate down accordingly and shading
her cheek with her beautiful hand looked
 the abbot
keenly and impressively at each the nobles
in turn mary fleming applied her
kerchief to her eyes and catherine seyton
and roland graeme exchanged a glance
which showed that both were too deeply
engrossed with sentiments interest and
commiseration for their royal mistress to
think any thing which regarded themselves

 i wait your business my lords said
the queen after she had been seated for
about a minute without a word being spoken
 i wait your message from those you
call the secret council i trust it is a petition
 pardon and a desire that i will
resume my rightful throne without using
with due severity my right punishing
those vvho have dispossessed me it
madam replied ruthven it is painful
for us to speak harsh truths to a princess
who has long ruled us but we come to
offer not to implore pardon in a word
madam we have to propose to you on the
the abbot 
part the secret council that you sign
these deeds which will contribute greatly
to the pacification the state the advancement
 god's word and the welfare your
own future life
 am i expected to take these fair words
on trust my lord or may i hear the contents
 these reconciling papers ere i am
asked to sign them
 unquestionably madam it is our purpose
and wish you should read what you
are required to sign replied ruthven
 required replied the queen with
some emphasis but the phrase suits well
the matter read my lord
the lord ruthven proceeded to read a
formal instrument running in the queen's
name and setting forth that she had been
called at an early age to the administration
 the crown and realm scotland and had
toiled diligently therein until she was in
body and spirit so wearied out and disgusted
that she was unable any longer to endure
the travail and pain state affairs j and
 the abbot
that since god blessed her with a fair and
hopeful son she was desirous to ensure to
 him even while she yet lived his succession
to the crown which was his by right hereditary
descent wherefore the instrument
proceeded we the motherly affection
we bear to our said son have renounced
and demitted and by these our
letters free good will renounce and demit
the crown government and guiding the
realm scotland in favour our said son
that he may succeed to us as native prince
thereof as much as if we had been removed
by decease and not by our own proper act
and that this demission our royal authority
may have the more full and solemn effect
and none pretend ignorance we give
grant and commit full and free and plain
power to our trusty cousins lord lindesay
 the byres and william lord ruthven
to appear in our name before as many 
the nobility clergy and burgesses as maybe
assembled at stirling and there in our
name and behalf publicly and in their prethe
abbot 
sence to renounce the crown guidance
and government this our kingdom 
scotland
the queen here broke in with an air 
extreme surprise how is this my lords
she said are my ears turned rebels that
they deceive me with sounds so extraordinary
 and yet it is no wonder that having
conversed so long with rebellion they
should now force its language upon my understanding
 say i am mistaken my lords
say for the honour yourselves and
the scottish nobility my right trusty cousins
 lindesay and ruthven two barons
 warlike fame and ancient line have not
sought the prisonhouse their kind mistress
for such a purpose as these words seem
to imply say for the sake honour and
loyalty that my ears have deceived me
 no madam said ruthven gravely
 your ears do not deceive you they deceived
you when they were closed against
the preachers the evangelic and the 
the abbor
nest advice your faithful subjects j and
when they were ever open to flattery 
pickthanks and traitors foreign circulars
and domestic minions the land may no
longer brook the rule one who cannot
rule herself wherefore i pray you to comply
with the last remaining wish your
subjects and counsellors and spare yourself
and us the further agitation matter so
painful
and is this all my loving subjects require
 me my lord said mary in a tone
 bitter irony do they really stint
themselves to the easy boon that i should
yield up the crown which is mine by birthright
to an infant which is scarcely more
than a year old fling down my sceptre
and take up a distaff o no it is too little
for them to ask that other roll parchment
contains something harder to be complied
with and which may more highly tax
my readiness to comply with the petitions
 my lieges
this parchment answered ruthven
the abbot 
in the same tone inflexible gravity and
unfolding the instrument as he spoke is
one by which your grace constitutes your
nearest in blood and the most honourable
and trustworthy your subjects james
earl murray regent the kingdom
during the minority the young king
he already holds the appointment from the
secret council
the queen gave a sort shriek and
clapping her hands together exclaimed
comes the arrow out his quiver out
 my brother's bow alas i looked for
his return from france as my sole at least
my readiest chance deliverance and
yet when i heard that he had assumed the
government i guessed he would shame to
wield it in my name
 i must pray your answer madam said
lord ruthven to the demand the
council
 the demand the council said the
queen say rather the demand a set
vol k
 the abbot
 robbers impatient to divide the spoil
they have seized to such a demand and
sent by the mouth a traitor whose scalp
but for my womanish mercy should long
since have stood on the city gates mary 
scotland has no answer
 i trust madam said lord ruthven
my being unacceptable to your presence
will not add to your obduracy resolution
it may become you to remember that
the death the minion rizzio cost the
house ruthven its head and leader my
father more worthy than a whole province
 such vile sycophants died in exile and
brokenhearted
the queen clasped her hands on her
face and resting her arms on the table
stooped down her head and wept so bitterly
that the tears were seen to find their
way in streams between the white and slender
fingers with which she endeavoured to
conceal them
 my lords said sir robert melville
 this is too much rigour under your
the abbot 
lordships favour we came hither not to revive
old griefs but to find the mode 
avoiding new ones
 sir robert melville said ruthven
we best know for what purpose we were
delegated hither and wherefore you were
somewhat unnecessarily sent to attend us
nay by my hand said lord lindsay
 i know not why we were cumbered
with the good knight unless he comes in
place the lump sugar which pothicars
put into their wholesome but bitter medicaments
to please a froward child a needless
labour methinks where men have the
means to make them swallow the physic
otherwise
 nay my lords said melville rye best
know your own secret instructions i conceive
i shall best obey mine in striving to
mediate between her grace and you
be silent sir robert melville said
the queen arising and her face still glowing
with agitation as she spoke my kerchief
fleming i shame that traitors should
 the abbot
have power to move me thus tell me
proud lords she added wiping away the
tears as she spoke by what earthly warrant
can liege subjects pretend to challenge the
rights an anointed sovereign to throw
off the allegiance they have vowed and to
take avay the crown from the head on
which divine warrant hath placed it 
 madam said ruthven i will deal
plainly with you your reign from the dismal
field pinkieclench when you were
a babe in the cradle till now that ye
stand a grown dame before us hath been
such a tragedy losses disasters civil dissentions
and foreign wars that the like is
not to be found in our chronicles the
french and english have one consent
made scotland the battlefield on which to
fight out their own ancient quarrel for
ourselves every man's hand hath been
against his brother nor hath a year passed
over without rebellion and slaughter exile
 nobles and oppressing the commons
we may endure it no longer and therethe
abbot 
fore as a prince to whom god hath refused
the gift hearkening to wise counsel
and on whose dealings and projects no
blessing hath ever descended we pray you
to give way to other rule and governance
 the land that a remnant may yet be saved
to this distracted realm
 my lord said mary it seems to me
that you fling on my unhappy and devoted
head those evils which with far more justice
 may impute to your own turbulent
wild and untameable dispositionsthe frantic
violence with which you the magnates
 scotland enter into feuds against each
other sticking at no cruelty to gratify your
wrath taking deep revenge for the slightest
offences and setting at defiance those
wise laws which your ancestors made for
staunching such cruelty rebelling against
the lawful authority and bearing yourselves
as if there where no king in the land or rather
as if each were king in his own premises
and now you throw the blame on
 the abbot
me on me whose life has been embittered
 whose sleep has been broken whose
happiness has been wrecked by your dissentions
have i not myself been obliged to
traverse wilds and mountains at the head
 a few faithful followers to maintain peace
and to put down oppression have i not
worn harness on my person and carried
pistols at my saddle j fain to lay aside the
softness a woman and the dignity a
queen that i might show an example to
my followers 
i we grant madam said lindesay rudely
 that the affrays occasioned by your
misgovernment may sometimes have startled
you in the midst a masque or galliard
 or it may be that such may have interrupted
the idolatry the mass or the
jesuitical counsels some french ambassador
but the longest and severest journey
which your grace has taken in my memory
was from hawick to hermitage castle
j and whether it was for the weal the
the abbot sl
state or for your own honour rests with
your grace's conscience
the queen turned to him with inexpressible
sweetness tone and manner and
that engaging look which heaven had assigned
her as if to shew that the choicest
arts to win men's affections may be given
in vain lindesay she said you spoke
not to me in this stern tone and with such
scurril taunt yon fair summer evening when
you and i shot at the butts against the earl
 mar and mary livingstone and won 
them the evening's collation in the privy
garden saint andrews the master 
lindesay was then my friend and vowed
to be my soldier how i have offended the
lord lindesay i know not unless honours
have changed manners
hardhearted as he was lindesay seemed
struck with this unexpected appeal but almost
instantly replied madam it is well
known that your grace could in those days
make fools whomsoever approached you
 the abbot
i pretend not to have been wiser than
others but gayer men and better courtiers
soon jostled aside my rude homage and i
think your grace cannot but remember
times when my awkward attempts to take
the manners that pleased you were the sport
 the courtpopinjays the maries and the
frenchwomen
 my lord i grieve if i have offended you
through idle gaiety said the queen and
can but say it was most unwittingly done
you are fully revenged for through gaiety
she said with a sigh will i never offend
any one more
our time is wasting madam said
lord ruthven j i must pray your decision
on this weighty matter which i have
submitted to you
 what my lord said the queen upon
the instant and without a moment's time to
deliberate can the council as they term
themselves expect this me 
madam replied ruthven the count
abbot 
cil hold the opinion that since the fatal
term which passed betwixt the night 
king henry's murder and the day 
your grace should have held you
prepared for the measure now proposed as
the easiest escape from your numerous dangers
and difficulties
 great god exclaimed the queen 
and is it as a boon that you propose tome
what every christian king ought to regard
as a loss honour equal to the loss 
life you take from me my crown my
power my subjects my wealth my state
what in the name every saint can you
offer or do you offer in requital my compliance

 we give you pardon answered rutheven
sternly we give you space and means
to spend your remaining life in penitence
and seclusion we give you time to make
your peace with heaven and to receive the
pure gospel which you have ever rejected
and persecuted
k 
sic the abbot
the queen turned pale at the menace
which this speech as well as the rough and
inflexible tones the speaker seemed distinctly
to infer and if i do not comply
with your request so fiercely urged my
lord what then follows 
she said this in a voice in which female
and natural fear was contending with the
feelings insulted dignity there was a
pause as if no one cared to return to the
question a distinct answer at length rutheven
spoke there is little need to tell
to your grace who are well read both in
the laws and in the chronicles the realm
that murder and adultery are crimes for
which ere now queens themselves have suffered
death
and where ray lord or how found you
an accusation so horrible against her who
stands before you said queen mary
 the foul and odious calumnies which
have poisoned the general mind scotland
and placed me a helpless prisoner in
your hands are surely no proof guilt
the abbot 
we need look for no farther proof than
the shameless marriage betwixt the widow
 the murdered and the leader the band
 murderers they that joined hands in
the fated month may had already united
hearts and counsel in the deed which preceded
that marriage but a few brief weeks
my lord my lord said the queen
eagerly remember well there were more
consents than mine went to that fatal union
that most unhappy act a most unhappy
life the evil steps adopted by sovereigns
are often the suggestion bad counsellors
but these counsellors are worse than fiends
who tempt and betrays they themselves are
the first to call their unfortunate princes to
answer for the consequences their own
advice heard ye never a bond by the
nobles my lords recommending that illfated
union to the illfated mary methinks
were it carefully examined we should see
that the names morton and lindesay
and ruthven may be found in that bond
i 
s the abbot
which pressed me to marry that unhappy
man ah stout and loyal lord berries
who never knew guile or dishonour you
bent your noble knee to me in vain to
warn me my danger and wert yet the first
to draw thy good sword in my cause when i
suffered for neglecting thy counsel faithful
knight and true noble what a difference
betwixt thee and those counsellors evil
who now threaten my life for having fallen
into the snares they spread for me 
 madam said ruthven we know that
you are an orator and perhaps for that reason
the council has sent hither men whose
converse hath been more with the wars than
with the language the schools or the cabals
 state we but desire to know if on
assurance life and honour ye will demit
the rule this kingdom scotland 
 and what warrant have i said the
queen that ye will keep treaty with me
if i should barter my kingly estate for seclusion
and leave to weep in secret 
the abbor 
 our honour and our word madam
answered ruthven
they are too slight and unsold pledges
my lord said the queen add at
least a handful thistledown to give them
weight in the balance
away ruthven said lindesay she
was ever deaf to counsel save slaves and
sycophants let her remain by her refusal
and abide by it
stay my lord said sir robert melville
 or rather permit me to have but a
few minutes private audience with her
grace if my presence with you could
avail aught it must be as a mediator do
not i conjure you leave the castle or
break off the conference until i bring you
word how her grace shall finally stand disposed

 we will remain in the hall said lindsay
 for half an hour's space but in despising
our words and our pledge honour
she has touched the honour my name 
s the abbot
let her look herself to the course she has to
pursue if the half hour should pass away
without her determining to comply with
the demands the nation her career will
be brief enough
with little ceremony the two nobles left
the apartment traversed the vestibule and
descended the windingstairs the clash 
lindesay's huge sword being heard as it rang
against each step in his descent george
douglas followed them after exchanging
with melville a gesture surprise and sympathy

as soon as they were gone the queen
again giving way to grief fear and agitation
threw herself into the seat wrung her
hands and seemed to abandon herself to
despair her female attendants weeping
themselves endeavoured yet to pray hero
be composed and sir robert melville
kneeling at her feet made the same entreaty
after giving way to a passionate
burst sorrow she at length said to melthe
abbot 
ville kneel not to me melville mock
me not with the homage the person when
the heart is far away why stay you behind
with the deposed the condemned her who
has but few hours perchance to live you
have been favoured as well as the rest j why
do you continue the empty show gratitude
and thankfulness any longer than they 
 madam said sir robert melville so
help me heaven at my need my heart is as
true to you as when you were in your highest
place
 true to me true to me repeated the
queen with some scorn j tush melville
what signifies the truth which walks hand
in hand with my enemies falsehood thy
hand and thy sword have never been so well
acquainted that i can trust thee in aught
where manhood is required o seyton for
thy bold father who is both wise true and
valiant 
roland graeme could withstand no longer
his earnest desire to offer his services to a
 the abbot
princess so distressed and so 
one sword he said madam can do
any thing to back the wisdom this grave
counsellor or to defend your rightful cause
here is my weapon and here is my hand
ready to draw and use it and raising his
sword with the one hand he laid the other
upon the hilt
as he thus held up the weapon catherine
seyton exclaimed methinks i see a
token from my father madam and immediately
crossing the apartment she took
roland graeme by the skirt the cloak
and asked him earnestly whence he had
that sword
the page answered with surprise methinks
this is no presence in which to jest 
surely damsel you yourself best know
whence and how i obtained the weapon
 is this a time for folly said catherine
seyton unsheathe the sword instantly 
if the queen commands me said the
youth looking towards his royal mistress
the abbot s
 for shame maiden said the queen j
 wouldst thou instigate the poor boy to
enter into useless strife with the two most
approved soldiers in scotland 
in your grace's cause replied the
page i will venture my life upon them 
and as he spoke he drew his weapon partly
from the sheath and a piece parchment
rolled around the blade fell out and dropped
on the floor catherine seyton caught
it up with eager haste
 it is my father's hand writing she
said and doubtless conveys his best duteous
advice to your majesty i knew that
it was prepared to be sent in this weapon
but i expected another messenger
by my faith fair one thought roland
and if you knew not that i had such a secret
missive about me i was yet more ignorant

the queen cast her eye upon the scroll
and remained a few minutes wrapped in
deep thought sir robert melville she
 the abbot
at length said this scroll advises me to
submit myself to necessity and to subscribe
the deeds these hard men have brought with
them as one who gives way to the natural
fear inspired by the threats rebels and
murtherers you sir robert are a wiseman
and seyton is both sagacious and
brave neither i think would mislead
me in this matter
madam said melville if i have not
the strength body the lords berries or
seyton i will yield to neither in zeal for
your majesty's service i cannot fight for
you like these lords but neither them
are more willing to die for your service
i believe it my old and faithful counsellor
said the queen and believe me
melville i did thee but a moment's injustice
read what my lord seyton hath
written to us and give us thy best counsel
he glanced over the parchment and instantly
replied o my dear and royal
mistress only treason itself could give you
other advice than lord seyton has here
the abbot 
expressed he berries huntley the english
ambassador throgmorton and others
your friends are all alike opinion that
whatever deeds or instruments you execute
within these walls must lose all force and
effect as extorted from your grace by dress
by sufferance present evil and fear
 men and harm to ensue on your refusal
yield therefore to the tide and be assured
that in subscribing what parchments they
presenttoyou you bind yourself to nothing
since your act signature wants that which
alone can make it valid the free will 
the granter
 ay so says my lord seyton replied
mary yet methinks for the daughter 
so long a line sovereigns to resign her
birth right because rebels press upon her
with threats argues little royalty and
will read ill for the fame mary in future
chronicles tush sir robert melville
the traitors may use black threats and bold
words but they will not dare to put their
hands forth on our person
 the abbot
alas madam they have already dared
so far and incurred such peril by the lengths
which they have gone that they are but one
step from the worst and uttermost
 surely said the queen her fears again
predominating scottish nobles would not
lend themselves to assassinate a helpless
woman 
 bethink you madam he replied
 what horrid spectacles have been seen
in our day and what act is so dark that
some scottish hand has not been found to
dare it lord lindesay besides his natural
sullenness and hardness temper is the
near kinsman henry darnley and rutheven
has his own deep and dangerous plans
the council besides speak proofs by
writ and word a casket with letters 
i know not what
ah good melville answered the
queen were i as sure the evenhanded
integrity my judges as my own
innocence and yet
 oh pause madam said melville j
the abbot 
 even innocence must sometimes for a
season stoop to injurious blame besides
you are here
he looked round and paused
 speak out melville said the queen
 never one approached my person who
wished to work me evil and even this poor
page whom i have today seen for the first
time in my life i can trust safely with your
communication
 nay madam answered melville in
such emergence and he being the bearer
 lord seyton's message i will venture to
say before him and these fair ladies whose
truth and fidelity i dispute not i say i will
venture to say that there are other modes
besides that open trial by which deposed
sovereigns often die and that as machiavel
saith there is but one step betwixt a
king's prison and his grave
oh were it but swift and easy for the
body said the unfortunate princess were
it but safe and happy change for the soul
the woman lives not that would take the
 the abbot
step so soon as i but alas melville
when we think death a thousand sins
which we have trode as worms beneath our
feet rise up against us as flaming serpents
most injuriously do they accuse me being
aiding darnley death yet blessed
lady i afforded too open occasion for the
suspicion i espoused bothwell
think not that now madam said
melville think rather the immediate
mode saving yourself and son comply
with their present unreasonable demands
and trust that better times will shortly arrives

 madam said roland graeme if it
pleases you that i should do so i will presently
swim through the lake if they refuse
me other conveyance to the shore i will
go to the courts successively england
france and spain and will shew you have
subscribed these vile instruments from no
stronger impulse than the fear death
and i will do battle against them that say
otherwise
the abbot 
the queen turned her round and with
one those sweet smiles which during the
era life's romance overpay every risk
held her hand towards roland but without
speaking a word he kneeled reverently
and kissed it and melville again resumed
his plea
 madam he said time presses and you
must not let these boats which i see they are
even now preparing put forth on the lake
here are enough witnesses your ladies
this bold youth myself when it can serve
your cause effectually for i would not hastily
stand committed in this matter but
even without me here is evidence enough
to shew that you have yielded to the demands
 the council through force and
fear but from no sincere and unconstrained
assent their boats are already manned
for their return oh permit your old servant
to recal them
 melville said the queen thou art
an ancient courtier when didst thou ever
know a sovereign prince recal to his presto
the abbot
sence subjects who had parted from him on
such terms as those on which these envoys
 the council left us and who yet were
recalled without submission or apology 
let it cost me both life and crown i will
not again command them to my presence
alas madam that empty form should
make a barrier if i rightly understand you
are not unwilling to listen to real and advantageous
counsel but your scruple is saved
i hear them return to ask your final resolution
 o take the advice the noble
seyton and you may once more command
those who now usurp a triumph over you
but hush i hear them in the vestibule
as he concluded speaking george douglas
opened the door the apartment and
marshalled in the two noble envoys
 we come madam said the lord
ruthven to request your answer to the
proposal the council
 your final answer said lord lindesay
for with a refusal you must couple the
certainty that you have precipitated your
the abbot 
fate and renounced the last opportunity 
making peace with god and ensuring your
longer abode in the world
my lords said mary with inexpressible
grace and dignity the evils we cannot
resist we must submit to i will subscribe
these parchments with such liberty choice
as my condition permits me were i on
yonder shore with a fleet jennet and ten
good and loyal knights around me i would
subscribe my sentence eternal condemnation
as soon as the resignation my
throne but here in the castle cochlea
with deep water around me and you
my lords beside me i have no freedom 
choice give me the pen melville and bear
witness to what i do and why i do it
 it is our hope your grace will not suppose
yourself compelled by any apprehensions
from us said the lord ruthven to
execute what must be your own voluntary
deed
the queen had already stooped towards
the table and placed the parchment before
vol l
 the abbot
her with the pen between her fingers ready
for the important act signature but
when lord ruthven had done speaking she
looked up stopped short and threw down
the pen if said she i am expected
to declare i give away my crown freewill
or otherwise than because i am compelled
to renounce it by the threat worse
evils to myself and my subjects i will not
put my name to such an untruth not to
gain full possession england france and
scotland all once my own in possession or
by right
beware madam said lindesay and
snatching hold the queen's arm with his
own gauntlets hand he pressed it in the
rudeness his passion more closely perhaps
than he was himself aware beware
how you contend with those who are
the stronger and have the mastery your
fate
he held his grasp on her arm bending
his eyes on her with a stern and intimidating
look till both ruthven and melthe
abbot 
ville cried shame and douglas who had
hitherto remained in a state apparent
apathy had made a stride from the door as
if to interfere the rude baron then quitted
his hold disguising the confusion which
he really felt at having indulged his passion
to such extent under a sullen and contemptuous
smile
the queen immediately began with an
expression pain to bare the arm which
he had grasped by drawing up the sleeve 
her gown and it appeared that his grasp
had left the purple marks his iron fingers
upon her flesh my lord she said asa
knight and gentleman you might have
spared my frail arm so severe a proof that
you have the greater strength on your side
and are resolved to use it but i thank
you for itit is the most decisive token 
the terms on which this day's business is to
rest i draw you to witness both lords and
ladies she said shewing the marks the
grasp on her arm that i subscribe these
instruments in obedience to the sign manual
 the abbot
 my lord lindesay which you may
see imprinted on mine arm
lindesay would have spoken but was restrained
by his colleague ruthven who said
to him peace my lord let the lady
mary scotland ascribe her signature to
what she will it is our business to procure
it and to carry it to the council should
there be debate hereafter on the manner in
which it was exhibited there will be time
enough for it
lindesay was silent accordingly only
muttering within his beard i meant not
to hurt her but i think women's flesh be as
tender as newfallen snow
the queen meanwhile subscribed the
rolls parchment with a hasty indifference
as if they had been matters slight consequence
or mere formality when she had
performed this painful task she arose and
having curtsied to the lords was about to
withdraw to her chamber ruthven and
sir robert melville made the first a formal
reverence the second an obeisance in
the abbot 
which his desire to acknowledge his sympathy
was obviously checked by the fear 
appearing in the eyes his colleagues too
partial to his former mistress but lindsay
stood motionless even when they were
preparing to withdraw at length as if
moved by a sudden impulse he walked
round the table which had hitherto been
betwixt them and the queen kneeled on
one knee took her hand kissed it let it
fall and arose lady he said thou
art a noble creature even though thou
hast abused god's choicest gifts i pay that
devotion to thy manliness spirit which
i would not have paid to the power thou
hast long unreservedly wielded i kneel to
mary stuart not tb the queen
 the queen and mary stuart pity thee
alike lindesay said mary alike they
pity and they forgive thee an honoured soldier
hadst thou been by aking's side leagued
with rebels what art thou but a good blade
in the hands a ruffian farewell my
lord ruthven the smoother but the deeper
 the abbot
traitor farewell melville mayst thou
find masters that can understand state policy
better and have the means to reward
it more richly than mary stuart farewell
george douglas make your respected
grand'dame comprehend that we would be
alone for the remainder the day god
wot we have need to collect our thoughts
all bowed and withdrew but scarce had
they entered the vestibule ere ruthven
and lindesay were at variance chide
not with me ruthven lindesay was heard
to say in answer to something more indistinctly
urged by his colleague chide not
with me for i will not brook it you put
the hangman's office on me in this matter
and even the very hangman hath leave to
ask some pardon those on whom he does
his office i would i had as deep cause to
be this lady's friend as i have to be her enemy
 thou shouldst see if i spared limb and
life in her quarrel
thou art a sweet minion said rutheven
 to fight a lady's quarrel and all for
the abbot 
a brent brow and a tear in the eye such
toys have been out thy thoughts this
many a year
 do me right ruthven said lindesay
you are like a polished corslet steel it
shines more gaudily but it is not a whit
softer nay it is five times harder than a
glasgow breastplate hammered iron
enough we know each other
they descended the stairs were heard
to summon their boats and the queen signed
to roland graeme to retire to the vestibule
and leave her with her female attendants

 the abbot
chapter viii
give me a morsel on the greensward rather
coarse as you will the cooking let the fresh spring
bubble beside my napkin sand the free birds
twittering and chirping hop from bough to bough
to claim the crumbs i leave for perquisites 
your prisonfeasts i like not 
the woodsman a drama
a recess in the vestibule was enlightened
by a small window at which roland
graeme stationed himself to mark the departure
 the lords he could see their
followers mustering on horseback under
their respective banners the western sun
glancing on their corslet and steel caps as
they moved to and fro mounted or dismounted
at intervals on the narrow space
betwixt the castle and the water the lords
bwuthven and lindesay were already moving
the abbot 
slowly to their boats accompanied by the
lady lochleven her grandson and their
principal attendants they took a ceremonious
leave each other as roland could
discern by their gestures and the boats put
c from the landingplace the boatmen
stretched to their oars and they speedily
diminished upon the eye the idle gazer
who had no better employ ment than to watch
their motions such seemed also the occupation
 the lady lochleven and george
douglas who returning from the landingplace
looked frequently back to the boats
and at length stopped as if to observe their
progress under the window at which roland
graeme was stationed as they gazed on
the lake he could hear the lady distinctly
say and she has bent her mind to save
her life at the expence her kingdom r
her life madam replied her son i
know not who would dare to attempt it
in the castle my father had i dreamt
that it was with such purpose that lindesay
l 
 the abbot
insisted on bringing his followers hither
neither he nor they should have passed the
iron gate lochleven castle
 i speak not private slaughter my
son but open trial condemnation and
execution for with such she has been threatened
and to such threats she has given way
had she not had more the false russian
blood than the royal race scotland in
her veins she had bidden them defiance to
their teeth but it is all the same complexion
and meanness is the natural companion
 profligacy i am discharged forsooth
from intruding on her gracious presence
this evening go thou my son and
render the usual service the meal to this
unqueened queen
so please you lady mother said douglas
 i care not greatly to approach her
presence
 thou art right my son and therefore
i trust thy prudence even because i have
noted thy caution she is like an isle on the
the abbot 
ocean surrounded with shelves and quicksands
its verdure fair and inviting to the eye
but the wreck many a goodly vessel which
hath approached it too rashly but for thee
my son i fear nought and we may not
with our honour suffer her to eat without
the attendance one us she may die
by the judgment heaven or the fiend
may have power over her in her despair 
and then we would be touched in honour
to shew that in our house and at our table
she had had all fair play and fitting usage
here roland was interrupted by a smart
tap on the shoulders reminding him sharply
 adam woodcock's adventure the
preceding evening he turned round almost
expecting to see the page saint
michael's hostelry he saw indeed catherine
seyton but she was in female attire
differing indeed a great deal in shape and
materials from that which she had worn
when they first met and becoming her
birth as the daughter a great baron and
 the abbot
her rank as the attendant on a princess
 so fair page said she eaves dropping
is one your page like qualities i presume
 fair sister answered roland in the
same tone if some friends mine be as
well acquainted with the rest our mystery
as they are with the arts swearing
swaggering and switching they need ask
no page in christendom for further insight
into his vocation
 unless that pretty speech infer that
you have yourself had the discipline the
switch since we last met the probability
whereof i nothing doubt i profess fair
page i am at a loss to conjecture your
meaning but there is no time to debate
it now they come with the evening meal
be pleased sir page to do your duty
four servants entered bearing dishes
preceded by the same stern old steward
whom roland had already seen and followed
by george douglas already mentioned
as the grandson the lady lochleven
and who acting as seneschal replete
abbot 
seated upon this occasion his father the
lord the castle he entered with his
arms folded on his bosom and his looks
bent on the ground with the assistance
 roland grasme a table was suitably covered
in the next or middle apartment on
which the domestics placed their burthens
with great reverence the steward and douglas
bending low when they had seen the
table properly adorned as if their royal prisoner
had sate at the board in question the
door opened and douglas raising his eyes
hastily cast them again on the earth when
he perceived it was only the lady mary
fleming who entered
her grace she said will not eat
tonight
 let us hope she may be otherwise persuaded
said douglas meanwhile madam
please to see our duty performed
a servant presented bread and salt on a
silver plate and the old steward carved for
douglas a small morsel in succession from
each the dishes presented which he
 the abbot
tasted as was then the custom at the tables
 princes to which death was often
suspected to find its way in the disguise 
food
the queen will not then come forth
tonight said douglas
 she has so determined replied the
lady
 our further attendance then is unnecessary
 we leave you to your supper fair
ladies and wish you good even
he retired slowly as he came and with
the same air deep dejection and was
followed by the attendants belonging to
the castle the two ladies sate down to
their meal and poland greene with ready
alacrity prepared to wait upon them catherine
seyton whispered her companion
who replied with the question spoken in a
low tone but looking at the page is he
 gentle blood and well nurtured 
the answer which she received seemed
satisfactory for she said to roland sit
the abbot 
down young gentleman and eat with your
sisters in captivity
 permit me rather to perform my duty
in attending them said roland anxious
to shew he was possessed the high tone
 deference prescribed by the rules chivalry
towards the fair sex and especially to
dames and maidens quality
you will find sir page said catherine
you will have little time allowed you for
your meal waste it not in ceremony or you
may rue your politeness ere tomorrow
morning
 your speech is too free maiden said
the elder lady the modesty the youth
may teach you more fitting fashions towards
one whom today you have seen for the first
time
catherine sey ton cast down her eyes but
not till she had given a single glance inexpressible
archness towards roland whom
her more grave companion now addressed
in a tone protection
 the abbot
 regard her not young gentleman 
she knows little the world save the forms
 a country nunnerystake thy place at the
board and refresh thyself after thy
journey
roland graeme obeyed willingly as it
was the first food he had that day tasted j
for lindesay and his followers seemed regardless
 human wants yet notwithstanding
the sharpness his appetite a natural
gallantry disposition the desire 
shewing himself a wellnurtured gentleman
in all courtesies towards the fair sex and
for aught i know the pleasure assisting
catherine seyton kept his attention awake
during the meal to all those nameless acts
 duty and service which gallants that
age were accustomed to render he carved
with neatness and decorum and selected
duly whatever was most delicate to place
before the ladies ere they could form a
wish he sprung from the table ready to
comply with it poured wine tempered
the abbot 
it with water removed and exchanged
trenchers and performed the whole honours
 the table with an air at once 
cheerful diligence profound respect and
graceful promptitude
when he observed that they had finished
eating he hastened to offer to the elder
lady the silver ewer basin and napkin
with the ceremony and gravity which
he would have used towards mary herself
he next with the same decorum having
supplied the basin with fair water presented
it to catherine seyton apparently
she was determined to disturb his selfpossession
if possible for while in the act 
bathing her hands she contrived as it were
by accident to flirt some drops water
upon the face the assiduous assistant
but if such was her mischievous purpose
she was completely disappointed for roland
graeme internally piquing himself on
his selfcommand neither laughed nor was
discomposed and all that the maiden gained
by her frolic was a severe rebuke from
 the abbot
her companion taxing her with maladdress
and indecorum catherine replied not but
sat pouting something in the humour a
spoilt child who watches the opportunity
 wreaking upon some one or other its resentment
for a deserved reprimand j
the lady mary fleming in the meanwhile
was naturally well pleased with the
exact and reverent observance the page a
and said to catherine after a favourable
glance at roland graeme you might
well say catherine our companion in inactivity
was wellborn and gently nurtured i
i would not make him vain by my praise
but his services enable us to dispense with
those which george douglas condescends
not to afford us save when the queen is
herself in presence
humph i think hardly answered catherine
 george douglas is one the
most handsome gallants in scotland and
tis pleasure to see him even still when the
gloom lochleven castle has shed the
same melancholy over him that it has done
the abbot 
over every thing else when he was at
holyrood who would have said the young
sprightly george douglas would have been
contented to play the locksman here in
lochleven with no gayer amusement than
that turning the key on two or three
helpless women a strange office for a
knight the bleeding heart why does
he not leave it to his father or his brothers

perhaps like us he has no choice answered
the lady fleming but catherine
thou hast used thy brief space at court
well to remember what george douglas
was then
i used mine eyes which i suppose was
what i was designed to do and they were
worth using there when i was at the nunnery
they were very useless appurtenances
and now i am at lochleven they are good
for nothing save to look over that eternal
work embroidery
 you say thus when you have been but
 the abbot
a few brief hours amongst us was this the
maiden who would live and die in a dungeon
might she but have permission to wait
on her gracious queen 
nay if you chide in earnest my jest
is ended said catherine seyton i would
not yield in attachment to my poor godmother
to the gravest dame that ever had
wise saws upon her tongue and a doublestarched
ruff around her throat you know
i would not dame mary fleming and it
is putting shame on me to say otherwise 
she will challenge the other court lady
thought roland greene j she will to a certainty
fling down her glove and if dame
mary fleming hath but the soul to lift it
we may have a combat in the lists but the
answer lady mary fleming was such as
turns away wrath
 thou art a good child she said my
catherine and a faithful but heaven pity
him who shall have one day a creature so
beautiful to delight him and a thing so
the abbot l
mischievous to torment him thou art fit
to drive twenty husbands stark mad
 nay said catherine resuming the
full career her careless good humour
he must be halfwitted beforehand that
gives me such an opportunity but i am
glad you are not angry with me in sincerity
casting herself as she spoke into the
arms her friend and continuing with a
tone apologetic fondness while she kissed
her on either side the face you
know my dear fleming that i have to contend
with both my father's lofty pride and
with my mother's high spirit god bless
them they have left me these good qualities
having small portion to give beside as
times go and so i am wilful and saucy 
but let me remain but a week in this castle
and o my dear fleming my spirit will
be as chastised and as humble as thine
own
dame mary fleming's sense dignity
and love form could not resist this
 the abbot
affectionate appeal she kissed catherine
seyton in her turn affectionately while answering
the last part her speech she said
 now our lady forbid dear catherine
that you should lose aught that is beseeming
 what becomes so well your light heart
and lively humour keep but your sharp
wit on this side madness and it cannot
but be a blessing to us but let me go mad
wench i hear her grace touch her silver
call and extricating herself from catherine's
grasp she went towards the door 
queen mary from which was heard the
low tone a silver whistle which now only
used by the boatswains in the navy was
then for want bells the ordinary mode
by which ladies even the very highest
rank summoned their domestics when
she had made two or three steps towards
the door the queen's apartment however
she turned back and advancing to the
young couple whom she left together she
said in a very serious though a low tone
 i trust it is impossible that we can any 
the abbot 
us or in any circumstances forget that few
as we are we form the household the
queen scotland and that in her calamity
all boyish mirth and childish jesting
can only serve to give a great triumph to
her enemies who have already found their
account in objecting to her the lightness
 every idle folly that the young and the
gay practised in her court so saying she
left the apartment
catherine seyton seemed much struck
with this remonstrance she suffered herself
to drop into the seat which she had
quitted when she went to embrace dame
mary fleming and for some time rested
her brow upon her hands while roland
graeme looked at her earnestly with a mixture
 emotions which perhaps he himself
could neither have analyzed nor explained
as she raised her face slowly from the posture
to which a momentary feeling selfrebuke
had depressed it her eyes encountered
those roland and became gradually
animated with their usual spirit 
the abbot
pious drollery which not unnaturally exci 
ted a similar expression in those the 
equally volatile page they sat for the
space two minutes each looking at the 
other with great seriousness on their features
and much mirth in their eyes until 
at length catherine was the first to break
silence
 may i pray you fair sir she began
very demurely to tell me what you see
in my face to arouse looks so extremely sagacious
and knowing as those with which
it is your worship's pleasure to honour me i
it would seem as there were some wonderful
confidence and intimacy betwixt us fair
sir if one is to judge from your extremely
cunning looks and so help me our lady
as i never saw you but twice in my life before

and where were these happy occasions
said roland if i may be bold
enough to ask the question 
 at the nunnery saint catherine's
said the damsel in the first instance j and
the abbot 
in the second during five minutes a certain
raid or foray which it was your pleasure
to make into the lodging my lord
and father lord seyton from which to my
surprise as probably to your own you returned
with a token friendship and favour
instead broken bones which were
the more probable reward your intrusion
considering the prompt ire the house 
seyton i am deeply mortified she added
ironically that your recollection should
require refreshment on a subject so important
 and that my memory should be stronger
than yours on such an occasion is truly
humiliating
 your own memory is not so exactly
correct fair mistress answered the page
 seeing you have forgotten meeting the
third in the hostelry saint michael's
when it pleased you to lay your switch
across the face my comrade in order
i warrant to shew that in the house 
seyton neither the prompt ire its descendants
nor the use the doublet and
vol ir m
 the abbot
hose are subject to salique law or confined
to the use the males
fair sir answered catherine looking
at him with great steadiness and some surprise
 unless your fair wits have forsaken
you i am at a loss what to conjecture 
your meaning
by my troth fair mistress answered
roland and were i as wise a warlock as
michael scott i could scarce riddle the
dream you read me did i not see you last
night in the hostelry saint michael's 
did you not bring me this sword with command
not to draw it save at the command
 my native and rightful sovereign and
have i not done as you required me oris
the sword a piece lath mynvord a
bullrush my memory a dream and my
eyes good for nought spirals which corlies
might pick out my head 
and if your eyes serveyou not more
truly on other occasions than in your vision
 saint michael said catherine i know
not the pain apart that the cries would
the abbot l
do you any great injury in the deprivation
but hark the bell hush for god's sake
we are interrupted
the damsel was right for no sooner
had the dull toll the castle bell begun
to resound through the vaulted apartment
than the door the vestibule flew open
and the steward with his severe countenance
his gold chain and his white rod
entered the apartment followed by the
same train domestics who had placed
the dinner on the table and who now
with the same ceremonious formality began
to remove it
the steward remained motionless as
some old picture while the domestics did
their office and when it was accomplished
every thing removed from the table
and the board itself taken from its tresses
and disposed against the wall he said
aloud without addressing any one in particular
and somewhat in the tone a herald
reading a proclamation my noble
lady dame margaret erskine by marcs
the abbot
rage douglas lets the lady mary scotland
and her attendants to wit that a servant
 the true evangelic her reverend
chaplain will tonight as usual expound
lecture and catechize according to the
forms the congregation gospellers
 hark you my friend mr dryfesdale
said catherine i understand this announcement
is a nightly form yours
now i pray you to remark that the lady
fleming and i for i trust your insolent
invitation concerns us only have chosen
saint peter's pathway to heaven so i see
no one whom your godly exhortation catechize
or lecture can benefit excepting
this poor page who being in satan's hand
as well as yourself had better worship with
you than remain to cumber our betteradvised
devotions
the page was well nigh giving a round
denial to the assertion with this speech
implied when remembering what had passed
betwixt him and the regent and seeing
catherine's finger raised in a monitory
the abbot 
fashion he felt himself as on former occasions
at the castle avenel obliged to
submit to the task dissimulation and
followed clydesdale down to the castlechapel
where he assisted in the devotions
 the evening
the chaplain was named elias henderson
he was a man in the prime 
life and possessed good natural parts
carefully improved by the best education
which these times afforded to these qualities
were added a faculty close and
terse reasoning and at intervals a flow 
happy illustration and natural eloquence
the religious faith roland graeme as
we have already had opportunity to observe
rested on no secure basis but was
entertained rather in obedience to his
grandmother's behests and his secret desire
to contradict the chaplain avenel
castle than from any fixed or steady reliance
which he placed on the romish creed
his ideas had been late considerably enlarged
by the scenes he had passed through j
 the abbot
and feeling that there was shame in not understanding
something those political
disputes betwixt the professors the ancient
and the reformed faith he listened
with more attention than it had hitherto
been in his nature to yield on such occasions
to an animated discussion some
 the principal points difference betwixt
the churches so passed away the
first day in the castle lochleven and
those which followed it were for sometime
 a very monotonous and uniform
tenor
the abbot ll
chapter 
tis a weary life this
vaults overhead and grates and bars around me
and my sad hours spent with as sad companions
whose thoughts are brooding o er their own mischances
far far too deeply to take part in mine
the woodsman
the course life to which mary and
her little retinue were doomed was in the
last degree secluded and lonely varied only
as the weather permitted or rendered impossible
the queen's usual walk in the garden
or on the battlements the greater part 
the morning she wrought with her ladies at
those pieces needle work many which
still remain proofs her indefatigable application
at such hours the page was permitted
the freedom the castle and islet 
nay he was sometimes invited to attend
george douglas when he went a sporting
the abbot
ing upon the lake or on its margin j opportunities
 diversion which were only
clouded by the remarkable melancholy
which always seemed to brood on that gentleman's
brow and to mark his whole demeanour
 a sadness so profound that roland
never observed him to smile or to
speak any word unconnected with the immediate
object their exercise
the most pleasant part roland's day
was the occasional space which he was permitted
to pass in personal attendance on the
queen and her ladies together with the regular
dinnertime which he always spent
with dame mary fleming and catherine
seyton on these occasions he had frequent
occasion to admire the lively spirit and inventive
imagination the latter damsel
who was unwearied in her contrivances to
amuse her mistress and to banish for a time
at least the melancholy which preyed on
her bosom she danced she sung she recited
tales ancient and modern times with
that heartfelt exertion talent which
the abbot 
the pleasure lies not in the vanity displaying
it to others but in the enthusiastic
consciousness that we possess it ourselves
and yet these high accomplishments were
mixed with an airof rusticity and hairbrained
vivacity which seemed rather to belong
to some village maid the coquette the
ring around the maypole than to the highbred
descendant an ancient baron a
touch audacity altogether shorts effrontery
and far less approaching to vulgarity
gave as it were a wildness to all that she did
and mary while defending her from some
occasional censure her grave companion
compared her to a trained singingbird escaped
from a cage which practises in all the
luxuriance freedom and in full possession
 the greenwood bough the airs which
it had learned during its earlier captivity
the moments which the page was permitted
to pass in the presence this fascinating
creature danced so rapidly away
that brief as they were they compensated
the weary dulness all the rest the day
m 
 the abt
the space indulgence however was
always brief nor were any private interviews
betwixt him and catherine permitted
or even possible whether it were some
special precaution respecting the queen's
household or whether it were her general
ideas propriety dame fleming seemed
particularly attentive to prevent the young
people from holding any separate correspondence
together and bestowed for catherine's
sole benefit in this matter the full
stock prudence and experience which she
had acquired when mother the queen's
maidens honour and by which she had
acquired their hearty hatred casual meetings
however could not be prevented unless
catherine had been more desirous 
shunning or roland graeme less anxious
in watching for them a smile a gibe
a sarcasm disarmed its severity by the
arch look with which it was accompanied
was all that time permitted to pass between
them on such occasions but such
passing interview neither afforded time nor
the abbot 
opportunity to renew the discussion the
circumstances attending their earlier acquaintance
nor to permit roland to investigate
more accurately the mysterious apparition
 the page in the purple velvet cloak
at the hostelry saint michael's
the winter's months slipped heavily away
and spring was already advanced when
roland graeme observed a gradual change
in the manners his fellow prisoners
having no business his own to attend
to and being like those his age education
and degree sufficiently curious concerning
what passed around he became by
degrees to suspect and finally to be convinced
that there was something in agitation
among his companions in captivity
to which they did not desire that he should
be privy nay he became almost certain
that by some means unintelligible to him
queen mary held correspondence beyond
the walls and waters which surrounded her
prisonhouse and that she nourished some
secret hope deliverance or escape in
the conversations betwixt her and her 
the abbot
tenants at which he was necessarily present
the queen could not always avoid
shewing that she was acquainted with the
events which were passing abroad in the
world and which he only heard through
her report he observed that she wrote
more and worked less than had been her
former custom and that as if desirous to lull
suspicion asleep she changed her manner
towards the lady lochleven into one more
gracious and which seemed to express a
resigned submission to her lot they
think i am blind he said to himself and
that i am unfit to be trusted because i am
so young or it may be because i was sent
hither by the regent well be it so 
they may be glad to confide in me in the
long run and catherine seyton for as saucy
as she is may find me as safe a confidant as
that sullen douglas whom she is always running
after it may be they are angry with
me for listening to master elias henderson 
but it was their own fault for sending me
there and if the man speaks truth and good
sense and preaches only the word god
the abbot 
he is as like to be right as either pope or
councils
it is probable that in this last conjecture
roland graeme had hit upon the real cause
why the ladies had not entrusted him with
their counsel he had late had several
conferences with henderson on the subject
 religion and had given him to understand
that he stood in need his instructions
although he had not thought there
was either prudence or necessity for confessing
that hitherto he had held the tenets 
the church rome
elias henderson a keen propagator 
the reformed faith had sought the seclusion
 lochleven castle with the express purpose
and expectation making converts
from rome amongst the domestics the
dethroned queen and confirming the faith 
those who already held the protestant doctrines
perhaps his hopes soared a little higher
and he might nourish some expectation
 a proselyte more distinguished in the person
 the deposed queen but the 
the abbot
tenacity with which she and her female au
tenants refused to see or listen to him
rendered such hope if he nourished it altogether
abortive
the opportunity therefore enlarging
the religious information roland
graeme and bringing him to a more due
sense his duties to heaven was hailed
by the good man as a door opened by
providence for the salvation a sinner
he dreamed not indeed that he was converting
a papist but such was the ignorance
which england displayed upon some
material points the reformed doctrine
that master henderson while praising his
docility to the lady lochleven and her
grandson seldom failed to add that his venerable
brother henry warden must be
now decayed in strength and in mind since
he found a catechumen his flock so ill
grounded in the principles his belief
for this indeed roland graeme thought it
was unnecessary to assign the true reason
which was his having made it a point 
the abbot 
honour to forget all that henry warden
taught him as soon as he was no longer
compelled to repeat it over as a lesson acquired
by rote the lessons his new instructor
if not more impressively delivered
were received by a more willing ear
and a more awakened understanding and
the solitude lochleven castle was favourable
to graver thoughts than the page
had hitherto entertained he wavered yet
indeed as one who was almost persuaded 
but his attention to the chaplain's instructions
procured him favour even with the
stern old dame herself and he was once or
twice but under great precaution permitted
to go to the neighbouring village 
kinross situated on the mainland to execute
some ordinary commission his unfortunate
mistress
for some time roland greene might be
considered as standing neuter betwixt the
two parties who inhabited the watergirdled
tower lochleven but as he rose in the
opinion the lady the castle and her
 the abbot
chaplain he perceived with great grief that
he lost ground in that mary and her female
allies
he came gradually to be sensible that
he was regarded as a spy upon their discourse
and that instead the ease with
which they had formerly conversed in his
presence without suppressing any the
natural feelings anger or sorrow or
mirth which the chance topic the moment
happened to call forth their talk was
now studiously restricted to the most indifferent
subjects and a studied reserve
observed even in their mode treating
these this obvious want confidence was
accompanied with a correspondent change
in their personal demeanour towards the
unfortunate page the queen who had
at first treated him with marked courtesy
now scarce spoke to him save to convey
some necessary command for her service
the lady fleming restricted her notice to
the most dry and distant expressions civility
and catherine seyton became bitthe
abbot 
ter in her pleasantries and shy cross and
petted in any intercourse they had together
what was yet more provoking he
saw or thought he saw marks intelligence
betwixt george douglas and the
beautiful catherine seyton and sharpened
by jealousy he wrought himself almost
into a certainty that the looks which they
exchanged conveyed matters deep and
serious import no wonder he thought if
courted by the son a proud and powerful
baron she can no longer spare a word
or look to the poor fortuneless page
in a word roland graeme's situation
became truly uncomfortable and his heart
naturally enough rebelled against the injustice
 this treatment which deprived him
 the only comfort which he had received
for submitting to a confinement in other respects
irksome he accused queen mary
and catherine seyton for concerning the
opinion dame fleming he was indifferent
 inconsistency in being displeased
with him on account the natural cones
the abbot
quinces an order their own why
did they send him to hear this overpowering
preacher the abbot ambrosius he
recollected understood the weakness 
their popish cause better when he enjoined
him to repeat within his miiid avert
and credos and paters all the while old
henry warden preached or lectured that
so he might secure himself against lending
even a momentary ear to his heretical
doctrine but i will endure this life no
longer said he to himself manfully j do
they suppose i would betray my mistress
because i see cause to doubt her religion
 that would be a serving as they
say the devil for god's sake i will forth
into the world he that serves fair ladies
may at least expect kind looks and kind
words and i bear not the mind a gentleman
to submit to cold treatment and
suspicion and a lifelong captivity besides
i will speak to george douglas tomorrow
when we go out together fishing
a sleepless night was spent in agitating
the abbot 
this magnanimous resolution and he arose
in the morning not perfectly decided in
his own mind whether he should abide by
it or not it happened that he was summoned
by the queen at an unusual hour
and just as he was about to go out with
george douglas he went to attend her
commands in the garden but as he had
his anglingrod in his hand the circumstance
announced his previous intention
and the queen turning to the lady fleming
said catherine must devise some
other amusement for us ma honneamiey our
discreet page has already made his party
for the day's pleasure
 said from the beginning answered
the lady fleming that your grace ought
not to rely on being favoured with the company
 a youth who has so many huguenot
acquaintances and has the means 
amusing himself far more agreeably than
with us
i wish said catherine her animated
features reddening with mortification that
 the abbot
his friends would sail away with him for
good and bring us in return a page if such
a thing can be found faithful to his queen
and to his religion
 one part your wishes may be granted
madam said roland graeme unable i
any longer to restrain his sense the treatment
which he received on all sides and 
he was about to add i heartily wish you
a companion in my room if such can be
found who is capable enduring women's 
caprices without going distracted luckily
he recollected the remorse which he had i
felt at having given way to the vivacity 
his temper upon a similar occasion and
closing his lips imprisoned until it died on
his tongue a reproach so misbecoming the
presence majesty
 why do you remain there said the
queen as if you were rooted to the parterre

 i but attend your grace's commands
said the page
 i have none to give you begone sir 
the abbot 
as he left the garden to go to the boat
he distinctly heard mary upbraid one her
attendants in these words you see to
what you have exposed us
this brief scene at once determined roland
graeme's resolution to quit the castle
if it were possible and to impart his resolution
to george douglas without loss 
time that gentleman in his usual mood
 silence sate in the stern the little skiff
which they used on such occasions trimming
his fishingtackle and from time to
time indicating by signs to greene who
pulled the oars which way he should row
when they were a furlong or two from the
castle roland rested on the oars and addressed
his companion somewhat abruptly
 i have something importance to say to
you under your pleasure fair sir
the pensive melancholy douglas's
countenance at once gave way to the eager
keen and startled look one who expects
to hear something deep and alarming
import
 the abbot
i am wearied to the very death this
castle lochleven continued roland
is that all said douglas i know
none its inhabitants who are much better
pleased with it
 ay but i am neither a native the
house nor a prisoner in it and so i may
reasonably desire to leave it
 you might desire to quit it with equal
reason answered douglas if you were
both the one and the other
but said roland greene i am not
only tired living in lochleven castle but
i am determined to quit it
that is a resolution more easily taken
than executed replied douglas
 not if yourself sir and your lady mother
chuse to consent answered the page
 you mistake the matter roland said
douglas you will find that the consent
 two other persons is equally essential 
that the lady mary your mistress and
that my uncle the regent who placed
you about her person and who will not
the abbot 
think it proper that she should change her
attendants so soon
 and must i then remain whether i will
or no demanded the page somewhat appalled
at a view the subject which would
have occurred sooner to a person more
experience
at least said george douglas you
must will to remain till my uncle wills to
dismiss you
 frankly said the page and speaking
to you as a gentleman who is incapable
 betraying me i will confess that if
i thought myself a prisoner here neither
walls nor water should confine me ions
frankly said douglas i could not
much blame you for the attempt yet for
all that my father or uncle or the earl or
any my brothers or in short any the
king's lords into whe hands you fell would
in such a case hang you like a dog or like a
sentinel who deserts his post and i promise
you that you will hardly escape them
but row towards saint serf's island there
 the abbot
is a breeze from the west and we will have
sport keeping to windward the isle where
the ripple is strongest we will speak more
 what you have mentioned when we have
had an hour's sport
their fishing was successful though never
did two anglers pursue even that silent
and unsocial pleasure with less verbal intercourse

when their time was expired douglas
took the oars in his turn and by his order
roland greene steered the boat directing
her course upon the landingplace at the
castle but he also stopped in the midst 
his course and looking around him said to
graeme there is a thing which i could
mention to thee but it is so deep a secret
that even here surrounded as we are by sea
and sky without the possibility a listener
i cannot prevail on myself to speak it out
 better leave it unspoken sir answered
roland greene if you doubt the honour
 him who alone can hear it
 i doubt not your honour replied
the abbot 
george douglas but you are young imprudent
and changeful
 young said roland i am and it
may be imprudent but who hath informed
you that i am changeful 
 one that knows you perhaps better
than you know yourself replied douglas
i suppose you mean catherine seyton
said the page his heart rising as he spoke j
 but she is herself fifty times more variable
in her humour than the very water which
we are floating upon
 my young acquaintance said douglas
 i pray you to remember that catherine
seyton is a lady blood and birth and
must not be lightly spoken 
mastergeorgeof douglassaidgrame
 as that speech seemed to be made under
the warrant something like a threat i pray
you to observe that i value not the threat
at the estimation a fin one these
dead trouts and moreover i would have
you to know that the champion who undervol
 n
 the abbot
takes the defence every lady blood
and birth whom men accuse change 
faith and fashion is like to have enough
 work on his hands
go to said the seneschal but in a
tone good humour thou art a foolish
boy unfit to deal with any matter more serious
than the casting a net or the flying
 a hawk
 if your secret concern catherine seyton
said the page i care not for it and
so you may tell her if you will i wot she
can shape you opportunity to speak with
her as she has ere now
the flush which passed over douglas's
face made the page aware that he had
lighted on a truth when he was in fact
speaking at random and the feeling that
he had done so was like striking a dagger
into his own heart his companion without
farther answer resumed the oars and
pulled lustily till they arrived at the island
and the castle the servants received the
produce their spoil and the two fishers
the abbot 
turning from each other in silence went
each to his several apartment
roland graeme had spent about an hour
in grumbling against catherine seyton the
queen the regent and the whole house
 lochleven with george douglas at the
head it when the time approached that
his duty called him to attend the meal 
queen mary as he arranged his dress for
this purpose he grudged the trouble which
on similar occasions he used with boyish
foppery to consider as one the most important
duties his day and when he
went to take his place behind the chair 
the queen it was with an air offended
dignity which could not escape her observation
and probably appeared to her ridiculous
enough for she whispered something
in french to her ladies at which the lady
fleming laughed and catherine appeared
half diverted and half disconcerted this
pleasantry which the subject was concealed
from him the unfortunate page 
the abbot
civet course as a new offence and
called an additional degree sullen dignity
into his mien which might have exposed
him to farther raillery but that mary appeared
disposed to make allowance for and
compassionate his feelings
with the peculiar tact and delicacy which
no woman possessed in greater perfection
she began to sooth by degrees the vexed
spirit her magnanimous attendant the
excellence the fish which he had taken
in his expedition the high flavour and
beautiful red colour the trouts which
have long given distinction to the lake led
her first to express her thanks to her attendant
for so agreeable an addition to her table
especially upon i jour che jeune and then
brought on enquiries into the place where
the fish had been taken their size their peculiarities
the times when they were in season
and a comparison between the lochleven
trouts and those which are found in
the lakes and rivers the south scotthe
abbot 
land the ill humour roland giccrae
was never an obstinate character it rolled
away like mist before the sun and he
was easily engaged in a keen and animated
dissertation about lochleven trout and sea
trout and river trout and bull trout and
char which never rise to a lily and par
which some suppose infant salmon and
herrings which frequent the nith and vena
kisses which are only found in the castlewood
 lochmaben and he was hurrying
on with the eager impetuosity and enthusiasm
 a young sportsman when he observed
that the smile with which the queen at
first listened to him died languidly away and
that in spite her efforts to suppress them
tears rose to her eyes he stopped suddenly
short and distressed in his turn asked
if he had had the misfortune unwittingly
to give displeasure to her grace 
no my poor boy replied the queen 
but as you numbered up the lakes and
rivers my kingdom imagination cheated
me as it will do and snatched me
 the abbot
from these dreary walls away to the romantic
streams nithsdale and the royal
towers lochmaben o land which my
fathers have so long ruled the pleasures
which you extend so freely your queen is
now deprived and the poorest beggar who
may wander free from one landward town
to another would scorn to change fates with
mary scotland j
 your highness said the lady fleming
 will do well to withdraw
come with me then fleming said 
the queen i would not burthen hearts
so young as these are with the sight my
sorrows
she accompanied these words with a look
 melancholy compassion towards roland
and catherine who were now left alone together
in the apartment
the page found his situation not a little 
embarrassing for as every reader has expel
pierced who may have chanced to be in such
a situation it is extremely difficult to maintain
the full dignity an offended person
the abbot 
in the presence a beautiful girl whatever
reason we may have for being angry with
her catherine seyton on her part sate
still like a lingering ghost which conscious
 the awe which its presence imposes is
charitably disposed to give the poor confused
mortal whom it visits time to recover
his senses and comply with the grand rule
 damonology by speaking first but as
roland seemed in no hurry to avail himself
 her condescension she carried it a step
farther and herself opened the conversation

 i pray you fair sir if it may be permitted
me to disturb your august reverie
by a question so simple what may have
become your rosary 
it is lost madam lost sometime since
said roland partly embarrassed and partly
indignant
 and may i ask farther sir said catherine
 why you have not replaced it
with another i have half a mind she
said taking from her pocket a string ebon
the abbot
ny beads adorned with gold to bestow
one upon you to keep for my sake just to
remind you former acquaintance
there was a little tremulous accent in
the tone with which these words were delivered
which at once put to flight roland
graeme's resentment and brought him to
catherine's side but she instantly resumed
the bold and firm accent which was more
familiar to her i did not bid you she
said come and sit so close by me for the
acquaintance that i spoke has been stiff
and cold dead and buried for this many a
day
 now heaven forbid i said the page 
it has only slept and now that you desire
it should awake fair catherine believe me
that a pledge your returning favour
 nay nay said catherine withholding
the rosary towards which as he spoke he
extended his hand have changed my
mind on better reflection what should a
heretic do with these holy beads that have
been blessed by the father the church
himself
the abbot 
roland winced grievously for he saw
plainly which way the discourse was now
likely to tend and felt that it must at all
events be embarrassing nay but he
said it was as a token your own regard
that you offered them
 ay fair sir but that regard attended
the faithful subject the loyal and pious catholic
the individual who was so solemnly
devoted at the same time with myself to
the same grand duty which you must now
understand was to serve the church and
the queen to such a person if you ever
heard him was my regard due and not
to him who associates with heretics and is
about to become a renegado
 i should scarce believe fair mistress
said roland indignantly that the vane
 your favour turned only to a catholic
wind considering that it points so plainly
to george douglas who i think is both
kinsman and protestant
think better george douglas said
catherine than to believe and then
n 
 the abbot
checking herself as if she had spoken too
much she went on i assure you fair
mr roland that all who wish you well are
sorry for you
their number is very few i believe
answered roland and their sorrow if
they feel any not deeper than ten minutes
time will cure
 they are more numerous and think
more deeply concerning you than you seem
to be aware answered catherine but
perhaps they think wrong you are the
best judge for yourself and if you prefer
gold and church lands to honour and loyalty
and the faith your fathers why should
you be hampered in conscience more than
others 
may heaven bear witness for me
said roland that if i entertain any difference
 opinion that is if i nourish any
doubts in point religion they have been
adopted on the conviction my own mind
and the suggestion my conscience 
ay ay your conscience your conthe
abbot 
science repeated she with satiric emphasis
y your conscience is the scapegoat i
warrant it an able one it will bear the burthen
 one the bestmanorsof the abbey
 saint mary's kennaquhair lately forfeited
to our noble lord the king by the
abbot and community thereof for the
high crime fidelity to their religious vows
and now to be granted by the high and
mighty traitor and so forth james earl
 murray to the good squire dames
roland graeme for his loyal and faithful
service as underespial and deputyturnkey
for securing the person his lawful
sovereign queen mary
 you misconstrue me cruelly said the
page yes catherine most cruelly god
knows i would protect this poor lady at the
risk my life or with my life but what can
i do what can any one do for her 
 much may be done enough may be
done all may be doneif men will be
but true and honourable as scottish men
were in the days bruce and wallace o
roland from what an enterprize you are now
soo the abbot
withdrawing your heart and hand through
mere fickleness and coldness spirit 
 how can i withdraw said roland
from an enterprize which has never been
communicated to me has the queen or
have you or has any one communicated
with me upon any thing for her service
which i have refused or have you not
all you held me at such distance from
your counsels as if i were the most faithless
spy since the days gallon 
and who said catherine seyton
 would trust the sworn friend and pupil
and companion the heretic preacher
henderson ay a proper tutor you have
chosen instead the excellent ambrosius
who is naw turned out house and
homestead if indeed he is not languishing
in a dungeon for withstanding the tyranny
 morton to whose brother the temporalities
 that noble house god have
been gifted away by the regent
 is it possible said the page j and is
the excellent father ambrose in such distress

the abbot 
he would account the news your
falling away from the faith your fathers
answered catherine a worse mishap than
aught that tyranny can inflict on himself
but why said roland very much
moved should you suppose that that 
that it is with me as you say 
 do you yourself deny it replied catherine
do you not admit that you have drank
the poison which you should have dashed
from your lips do you deny that it now
ferments in your veins if it has not altogether
corrupted the springs life do yau
deny that you have your doubts as you
proudly term them respecting what papes
and councils have declared it unlawful to
doubt is not your faith wavering if not
overthrown does not the heretic preacher
boast his conquest does not the heretic
woman this prisonhouse hold up thy
example to others do not the queen
and the lady fleming believe in thy falling
away and is there any except oneyes
i will speak it out and think as lightly
 the abbot
as you please my good will is there one
except myself that holds even a lingering
hope that you may yet prove what we once
all believed you 
 i know not said our poor page much
embarrassed by the view which was thus presented
to him the conduct he was expected
to pursue and by a person in whom he
was not the less interested that so long
residence in lochleven castle with no object
so likely to attract his undivided attention
had taken place since since they had
first met i know not what you expect
 me or fear from me was sent hitherto
attend queen mary and to her i acknowledge
the duty a servant through
life and death if any one had expected
service another kind i was not the party
to render it i neither avow nor disclaim
the doctrines the reformed church will
you have the truth it seems to me that
the profligacy the catholic clergy has
brought this judgment on their own heads
and for aught i know it may be for their
the abbot 
reformation but for betraying this unhappy
queen god knows i am guiltless 
the thought did i believe worse her
than as her servant i wish as her subject
i dare to do i would not betray her 
far from it i would aid her in aught which
could tend to a fair trial her cause
enough enough answered catherine
clasping her hands together then thou
wilt not desert us if any means are presented
by which placing our royal mistress at
freedom this case may be honestly tried
betwixt her and her rebellious subjects
nay but fair catherine replied the
page hear but what the lord murray
said when he sent me hither
 hear but what the devil said replied
the maiden rather than what a false subject
a false brother a false counsellor a
false friend said a man raised from a petty
pensioner on the crown's bounty to bethe
counsellor majesty and the prime
distributor the bounties the state 
sod the abbor
one with whom rank fortune title consequence
and power all grew up like a mushroom
by the mere warm good will the
sister whom in requital he hath mewed
up in this place melancholy seclusion 
whom in further requital he has deposed
and whom if he dared he would murder
i think not so ill the earl murray
said roland graeme and sooth to
speak he added with a slight smile it
would require some bribe to make me embrace
with firm and desperate resolution
either one side or the other
 nay if that is all replied catherine
seyton in a tone enthusiasm you shall
be guerdon with prayers from oppressed
subjects from dispossessed clergy from
insulted nobles with immortal praise by
future ages with eager gratitude by the
present with fame an earth and with felicity
in heaven your country will thank
you your queen will be debtor to you 
you will achieve at once the highest from
the abbot 
the lowest degree in chivalry all men will
honour all women will love you and i
sworn with you so early to the accomplishment
 queen mary's freedom will yes
i will love you better than ever sister loved
brother
say on say on said poland kneeling
on one knee and taking her hand which
in the warmth her exhortation catherine
held towards him
nay said she pausing i have already
said too much far too much if i
prevail not with you far too little if i do
but i prevail lie continued seeing that
the countenance the youth she addressed
returned the enthusiasm her own i
prevail or rather the good cause prevails
through its own strength thus i devote
thee to it and as she spoke she approached
her finger to the brow the astonished
youth and without touching it signed the
cross over his forehead stooped her face
towards him and seemed to kiss the empty
space in which she had traced the symbol j
 the abbot
then starting up and extricating herself
from his grasp darted into the queen's
apartment
koland graeme remained as the enthusiastic
maiden had left him kneeling on one
knee with breath withheld and with eyes
fixed upon the space which the fairy form
 catherine seyton had so lately occupied
if his thoughts were not unmixed delight
they at least partook that thrilling
and intoxicating though mingled sense
 pain and pleasure the most overpowering
which life offers in its blended cup he
rose and retired slowly and although the
chaplain mr henderson preached on that
evening his best sermon against the errors
 popery i would not engage that he was
followed accurately through the train his
reasoning by the young proselyte with a
view to whose especial benefit he had handled
the subject
the abbot 
chapter x
and when love's torch hath set the heart in flame
comes signor reason with his saws and cautions
giving such aid as the old greybeard sexton
who from the church vault drags his crazy engine
to ply its dribbling ineffectual streamlet
against a conflagration
old play
in a musing mood roland graeme upon
the ensuing morning betook himself to the
battlements the castle as a spot where
he might indulge the course his thickcoming
fancies with least chance interruption
but his place retirement was
in the present case ill chosen for he was
presently joined by master elias henderson

 i sought you young man said the
preacher having to speak something
which concerns you nearly
the page had no pretence for avoiding
the conference which the chaplain thus 
 the abbot
feared though he felt that it might prove an
embarrassing one
 in teaching thee as far as my feeble
knowledge hath permitted thy duty towards
god said the chaplain there are
particulars your duty towards man upon
which i was unwilling long or much to insist
you are here in the service a lady
honourable as touching her birth deserving
 all compassion as respects her misfortunes
and garnished with even but too
many those outward qualities which win
men's regard and affection have you ever
considered your regard to this lady mary
 scotland in its true light and bearing 
 i trust reverend sir replied roland
graeme that i am well aware the duties
a servant in my condition owes to his
royal mistress especially in her lowly and
distressed condition
true answered the preacher but it
is even that honest feeling which may in
the lady mary's case carry thee into great
crime and treachery
the abbot 
 how so reverend sir replied the
page i profess i understand you not
i speak to you not the crimes this
illadvised lady said the preacher they
are not subjects for the ears her sworn
servant but it is enough to say that this
unhappy person hath rejected more offers 
grace more hopes glory than ever were
held out to earthly princes and that she is
now her day favour being passed sequestered
in this lonely castle for the commonweal
 the people scotland and it maybe
for the benefit her own soul
 reverend sir said roland somewhat
impatiently i am but too well aware that
my unfortunate mistress is imprisoned since
i have the misfortune to share in her restraint
myself which to speak sooth i
am heartily weary
 it is even that which i am about to
speaksaid the chaplain mildly but first
my good roland look forth on the pleasant
prospect yonder cultivated plain you see
where the smoke arises yonder village 
the abbot
ing half hidden by the trees and you know it
to be the dwellingplace peace and industry
from space to space each by the side 
its own stream you see the gray towers 
barons with cottages interspersed and you
know that they also with their household
are now living in unity the lance hung up on
the wall and the sword resting in its sheath
you see too more than one fair church
where the pure waters life are offered to
the thirsty and where the hungry are refreshed
with spiritual food what would
he deserve who should bring fire and
slaughter into so fair and happy a scene 
who should bare the swords the gentry
and turn them against each other who
should give tower and cottage to the flames
and slake the embers with the blood the
indwellers what would he deserve who
should lift up again that ancient dagon 
superstition whom the worthies the time
have beaten down and who should once
more make the churches god the high
places baal 
the abbot 
 you have limned a frightful picture
reverend sir said roland greene yet i
guess not whom you would charge with the
purpose effecting a change so horrible
 god forbid replied the preacher that
 should say to thee thou art the man 
yet beware roland graeme that thou in
serving thy mistress hold fast the still higher
service which thou west to the peace thy
country and the prosperity her inhabitants
 else roland gramme thou mayest bethe
very man upon whose head will fall the
curses and assured punishment due to such
work ifthou art won by the song these syrens
to aid that unhappy lady's escape from
this place penitence and security it is
over with the peace scotland's cottages
and with the prosperity her palaces and
the babe unborn shall curse the name the
man who gave inlet to the disorder which
will follow the war betwixt the mother and
the son
 i know no such plan reverend sir
 the abbot
answered the page and therefore can aid
none such my dirty towards the queen
has been simply that an attendant it is
a task which at times i would willingly
have been freed nevertheless 
 it is to prepare thee for the enjoyment
 something more liberty said the
preacher that i have endeavoured to impress
upon you the deep responsibility under
which your office must be discharged
george douglas hath told the lady loch
leven that you are weary this service and
my intercession hath partly determined her
good ladyship that as your discharge cannot
be granted you shall instead be employed
in certain commissions on the mainland
which have hitherto been discharged
by other persons confidence wherefore
come with me to the lady for even today
such duty will be imposed on you
 i trust you will hold me excused reverend
sir said the page who felt that an
increase confidence on the part the
the abbot 
lady the castle and her family would
render his situation in a moral view doubly
embarrassing one cannot serve two masters
 and i much fear that my mistress will
not hold me excused for taking employment
under another
 dear not that said the preacher her
consent shall be asked and obtained i fear
she will yield it but too easily as hoping to
avail herself your agency to maintain
correspondence with her friends as those
falsely call themselves who would make
her name the watch word for civil war
 and thus said the page i will be
exposed to suspicion on all sides for my
mistress will consider me as a spy placed on
her by her enemies seeing me so far trusted
by them and the lady lochleven will
never cease to suspect the possibility my
betraying her because circumstances put it
into my power to do so i would rather remain
as i am
there followed a pause one or two
minutes during which henderson looked
vol ir o
 the abbot
steadily in roland's countenance as if desirous
to ascertain whether there was not
more in the answer than the precise words
seemed to imply he failed in this point
however for roland bred a page from
childhood knew how to assume a sullen
petted cast countenance well enough
calculated to hide all internal emotions
 i understand thee not roland said
the preacher or rather thou thickest on
this matter more deeply than i apprehended
to be in thy nature methought the
delight going on shore with thy bow or
thy gun or thy anglingrod would have
borne away all other feelings
 and so it would replied roland who
perceived the danger suffering henderson's
half raised suspicions to become fully
awake i would have thought nothing
but the gun and the oar and the wild waterfowl
that tempt me by sailing among
the sedges yonder so far out flightshot
had you not spoken my going on shore
as what was to occasion burning town
the abbot 
and tower the downfall the evangelic
and the up setting the mass
 follow me then said henderson
 and we will seek the lady lochleven
they found her at breakfast with her
grandson george douglas peace be with
your ladyship said the preacher bowing
to his patroness roland graeme awaits
your order
 young man said the lady our
chaplain hath warranted for thy fidelity
and we are determined to give you certain
errands to do for us in our town kinross
 not by my advice said douglas coldly
 i said not that it was answered the lady
something sharply the mother thy
father may i should think be old enough
to judge for herself in a matter so simple
thou wilt take the skiff roland and two
 my people whom clydesdale or randal
will order out and fetch off certain stuff 
plate and hangings which should last night
be lodged at kinross by the wains from
edinburgh
s the abbot
and give this packet said george
douglas to a servant ours whom you
will find in waiting there it is the report
to my father he added looking towards
the grandmother who acquiesced by bending
her head
i have already mentioned to master
henderson said roland graeme that
as my duty requires my attendance on the
queen her grace's permission for my journey
ought to be obtained before i can undertake
your commission
 look to it my son said the old lady
the scruple the youth is honourable
craving your pardon madam i have
no wish to force myself on her presence
thus early said douglas in an indifferent
tone j it might displease her and were noway
agreeable to me
and i said the lady lochleven although
her temper hath been more gentle
 late have no will to undergo without
necessity the rancour her wit
 under your permission madam said
the abbot 
the chaplain i will myself render your
request to the queen during my long residence
in this house she hath not deigned
to see me in private or to hear my doctrine
 yet so may heaven prosper my labours
as love for her soul and desire to
bring her into the right path was my chief
desire for coming hither
take care master henderson said
douglas in a tone which seemed almost
sarcastic lest you rush hastily on an adventure
to which you have no vocation 
you are learned and know the adage ne
aceesseris in consilium nisi vocat who
hath required this at your hand 
the master to whose service i am called
answered the preacher looking upward
 he vho hath commanded me to
be earnest in season and out season
 your acquaintance hath not been much
i think with courts or princes continued
the young esquire
 no sir replied henderson but
 the abbot
ike my master knox i see nothing frightful
in the fair face a pretty lady
my son said the lady lochleven
 quench not the good man's zeal let him
do the errand to this unhappy princess
 with more willingness than i would
do it myself said george douglas yet
something in his manner appeared to con 
tract his words 
the minister went accordingly and demanding
an audience the imprisoned
princess was admitted he found her with
her ladies engaged in the daily task embroidery
the queen received him with 
that courtesy which in ordinary cases she j
used towards all who approached her and 
the clergyman in opening his commission
was obviously somewhat more embarrassed
than he had expected to be the good
lady lochleven may it please your
grace
he made a short pause during which
mary said with a smile my grace would
the abbot 
in truth be well pleased were the lady
lochleven our good lady but go on 
what is the will the good lady lochleven

 she desires madam said the chaplain
 that your grace will permit this young
gentleman your page roland grme to
pass to kinross to look after some household
stuff and hangings sent hither for the
better furnishing your grace's apartments
the lady lochleven said the
queen uses needless ceremony in requesting
our permission for that which
stands within her own pleasure we well
know that this young gentleman's attendance
on us had not been so long permitted
were he not thought to be more at the command
 that good lady than at ours but
we cheerfully yield consent that he shall goon
her errand with our will we would doom
no living creature to the captivity which
we ourselves must suffer
 ay madam answered the preacher
 and it is doubtless natural for humanity
s the abbot
to quarrel with its prisonhouse yet there
have been those who have found that time
spent in the house temporal captivity
may be so employed as to redeem us from
spiritual slavery
i apprehend your meaning sir replied
the queen but i have heard your
apostle i have heard master john knox 
aim were i to be perverted i would willingly
resign to the ablest and most powerful 
heresiarchs the poor honour he might acquire
by overcoming my faith and my
hope
 madam said the preacher it is not
to the talents or skill the husbandman
that god gives the increase the words
which were offered in vain by him whom
you justly call our apostle during the bustle
and gaiety a court may yet find better
acceptance during e leisure for reflection
which this place affords god knows
lady that i speak in singleness heart
as one who would as soon compare himself
to the immortal angels as to the holy man
the abbot si
whom you have named yet would you
but condescend to apply to their noblest
use those talents and that learning which
all allow you to be possessed would
you afford us but the slightest hope that
you would hear and regard what can be
urged against the blinded superstition and
idolatry in which you are brought up sure
am i that the most powerfully gifted my
brethren that even john knox himself
would hasten hither and account the rescue
 your single soul from the nets romish
error
 i am obliged to you and o them for
their charity said mary bu as i have
at present but one presencechamber i
will reluctantly see it converted into a huguenot
synod
 at least madam be not thus obstinately
blinded in your errors hear one who
has hungered and thirsted watched and
prayed to undertake the good work your
conversion and who would be content to
die the instant that a work so advantageous
 the abbot
for yourself and so beneficial to scotland
were accomplished yes lady could i but
shake the remaining pillar the heathen
temple in this land and that permit me to
term your faith in the delusions rome 
i could be content to die overwhelmed in
the ruins
 i will not insult your zeal sir replied
mary by saying you are more likely to
make sport for the philistines than to overwhelm
them your charity claims my
thanks for it is warmly expressed and maybe
truly purposed but believe as well 
me as i am willing to do you and think
that i may be as anxious to recal you to the
ancient and only road as you are to teach
me your new byeways to paradise
 then madam if such be your generous
purpose said henderson eagerly what
hinders that we should dedicate some part
 that time unhappily now too much at
cour grace's disposal to discuss a question
so weighty you by report all men are
both learned and witty and i though withthe
abbot 
c
out such advantage am strong in my cause
as in a tower defence why should we
not spend some space in endeavouring to
discover which us hath the wrong side
in this most important matter 
nay said queen mary i never alleged
my force was strong enough to accept
 a combat en champ clos with a scholar
and a polemic besides the match is not
equal you sir might retire when you felt
the battle go against you while i am tied
to the stake and have no permission to say
the debate wearies me i would be alone
she curtsied low to him as she uttered
these words and henderson whose zeal
was indeed ardent but did not extend to
the neglect delicacy bowed in return
and prepared to withdraw
 i would he said that my earnest
wish my most zealous prayer could procure
to your grace any blessing or comfort
but especially that in which alone
blessing or comfort is as easily as the slighted
ths abbot
est intimation your wish will remove me
from your presence
he was in the act departing when
mary said to him with much courtesy
do me no injury in your thoughts good
sir j it may be that if my time here be protracted
longer as surely i hope it will not
trusting that either my rebel subjects will repent
 their disloyalty or that my faithful
lieges will obtain the upper hand but if my
time be here protracted it may be i shall
have no displeasure in hearing one who seems
so reasonable and compassionate as yourself
and i may hazard your contempt by endeavouring
to recollect and repeat the reasons
which schoolmen and councils give for the
faith that is in me although i fear that
god help mee my latin has deserted me
with my other possessions this must however
be for another day meanwhile sir let
the lady lochleven employ my page as
she lists i will not afford suspicion by speaking
a word to him before he goes roland
the abbot 
greeme my friend lose not an opportunity
 amusing thyself dance sing run and
leap all may be done merrily on the mainland
 but he must have more than quicksilver
in his vins who could frolic here
 alas madam said the preacher to
what is it you exhort the youth while time
passes and eternity summons can our
salvation be insured by idle mirth or our
good work wrought out without fear and
trembling 
 i cannot fear or tremble replied the
queen to mary stuart such emotions
are unknown but if weeping and sorrow
on my part will atone for the boy enjoying
an hour boyish pleasure be assured the
penance shall be duly paid
nay but gracious lady said the
preacher in this you greatly err our
tears and our sorrows are all too little for
our own fauns and follies nor can we transfer
them as your church falsely teaches to
the benefit others
 may pray you sir answered the
 the abbot
queen with as little offence as such a
prayer may import to transfer yourself elsewhere
we are sick at heart and may not
now be disturbed with farther controversy
and thou roland take this little purse 
then turning to the divine she said shewing
its contents look reverend sir it
contains only these two or three gold festoons
a coin which though bearing my own
poor features i have ever found more active
against me than on my side just as my subjects
take arms against me with my own
name for their summons and signal take
this purse that thou mayest want no means
 amusement fail not fail not to bring
me back news from kinross only let it be
such as without suspicion or offence maybe
told in the presence this reverend
gentleman or the good lady lochleven 
herself
the last hint was too irresistible to be
withstood and henderson withdrew half
mortified half pleased with his reception
for mary from long habit and the address
the abbot 
which was natural to her had learned in an
extraordinary degree the art evading
discourse which was disagreeable to her
feelings or prejudices without affronting
those by whom it was proffered
roland graeme retired with the chaplain
at a signal from his lady but it did not
escape him that as he left the room stepping
backwards and making the deep obeisance
due to royalty catherine seyton held
up her slender forefinger with a gesture
which he alone could witness and which
seemed to say remember what has passed
betwixt us
roland greene had now his last charge
from the lady lochleven there are
revels she said this day at the village 
my son's authority is as yet unable to prevent
these continued workings the ancient
leaven folly which the romish
priests have kneaded into the very souls 
the scottish peasantry t do not command
thee to abstain from them that would be
only to lay a snare for thy folly or to teach
 the abbot
thee falsehood but enjoy these vanities
with moderation and mark them as what
thou must soon learn to renounce and contemn
our chamberlain at kinross luke
lundin doctor as he foolishly calleth
himself will acquaint thee what is to be
done in the matter about which thou goes
remember thou art trusted shew thyself
therefore worthy trust
when we recollect that roland graeme
was not yet nineteen and that he had spent
his whole life in the solitary castle avenel
excepting the few hours he had passed in
edinburgh and his late residence at lochleven
the latter period having very little
served to enlarge his acquaintance with the
gay world we cannot wonder that his heart
beat high with hope and curiosity at the
hope partaking the sport even a country
wake he hastened to his little cabin
and turned over the wardrobe with which
in every respect becoming his station
he had been supplied from edinburgh
probably by order the earl murray
the abbot 
by the queen's command he had hitherto
waited upon her in mourning or at least in
sadcoloured raiment her condition she
said admitted nothing more gay but
now he selected the gayest dress his wardrobe
afforded composed scarlet slashed
with black satin the royal colours 
scotland combed his long curled hairdisposed
his chain and medal round a beaver
hat the newest block and with the
gay falchion which had reached him in so
mysterious a manner hung by his side in
an embroidered belt his apparel added to
his natural frank mien and handsome form
made a most commendable and pleasing
specimen the young gallant the period
he sought to make his parting reverence to
the queen and her ladies but old clydesdale
hurried him to the boat
 we will have no private audiences he
said my master since you are to be trusted
with somewhat we will try at least to
save thee from the temptation opportunity
god help thee child he added with
 the abbor
a glance contempt at his gay clothes
 an the bearward be yonder from saint
andrews have a care thou go not near
him
 and wherefore i pray you said roland

lest he take thee for one his runaway
jack anapes answered the steward
smiling sourly
i wear not my clothes at thy cost said
roland indignantly
nor at thine own either my son replied
the steward else would thy garb
better resemble thy merit
roland graeme suppressed with difficulty
the repartee which arose to his lips and
wrapping his scarlet mantle around him
threw himself into the boat which two
rowers themselves urged by curiosity to
see the revels pulled stoutly towards the
west the lake as they put off roland
thought he could discover the face 
catherine seyton though carefully withdrawn
from observation peeping from a
the abbot 
loophole to view his departure he pulled
off his hat and held it up as a token that
he saw and wished her adieu a white kerchief
waved for a second across the window
and for the rest the little voyage the
thoughts catherine seyton disputed
ground in his breast with the expectations
excited by the approaching revel as they
approached nigher and nigher to the shore
the sounds mirth and music the laugh
the halloo and the shout came thicker upon
the ear and in a trice the boat was moored
and roland graeme hastened in quest 
the chamberlain that being informed what
time he had to his own disposal he might
lay it out to the best advantage

no long space intervened ere roland
graeme was able to discover among the
crowd revellers who gambollel upon the
open space which extends betwixt the village
and the lake a person so great importance
as doctor luke lundin upon
whom devolved officially the charge representing
the lord the land and who
was attended for support his authority
by a piper a drummer and four sturdy
clowns armed with rusty halberds garnished
with partycoloured ribbands myrmidons
who early as the day was had althe
abbot 
ready broken more than one head in the
awful names the laird lochleven and
his chamberlain
as soon as this dignitary was informed
that the castle skiff had arrived with a gallant
dressed like a lord's son at the least
who desired presently to speak with him
he adjusted his ruff and his black coat
turned round his girdle till the garnished
hilt his long rapier became visible and
walked with due solemnity towards the
beach solemn indeed he was entitled to
be even on less important occasions for he
had been bred to the venerable study medicine
as those acquainted with the science
very soon discovered from the aphorisms
which ornamented his discourse his success
had not been equal to his pretensions 
but as he was a native the neighbouring
kingdom fife and bore distant relation
to or dependance upon the ancient
family lundin that ilk who were
bound in close friendship with the house
 lochleven he had through their inter
the abbot
rest got planted comfortably enough in his
present station upon the banks that beautiful
lake the profits his chamberlain
being moderate especially in these unsettled
times he had eked it out a little with some
practice in his original profession and it
was said that the inhabitants the village
and barony kinross were not more effectually
whirled which may be translated
enthralled to the baron's mill than they
were to the medical monopoly the chamberlain
woe betide the family the rich
boor who presumed to depart this life without
a passport from doctor luke lundin 
for if his representatives had aught to settle
with the baron as it seldom happened otherwise
they were sure to find a cold friend
in the chamberlain he was considerate
enough however gratuitously to help the
poor out their ailments and sometimes
out all their other distresses at the same
time
formal in a double proportion both asa
physician and as a person in office and
the abbot sb
proud the scraps learning which rendered
his language almost universally unintelligible
doctor luke lundin approached
the beach and hailed the page as he advanced
towards him the freshness the
morning upon you fair sir you are sent
i warrant me to see if we observe here the
regimen which her good ladyship hath prescribed
for eschewing all superstitious ceremonies
and idle abilities in these our
revels i am aware that her good ladyship
would willingly have altogether abolished
and abrogated them but as i had
the honour to quote to her from the works
 the learned hercules saxony finis
curate est vel canonical velcoactuy that is fair
sir for silk and velvet have seldom their
latin ad imguem every cure must be
wrought either by art and induction rule
or by constraint and the wise physician
chuse the former which argument her
ladyship being pleased to allow well i
have made it my business so to blend 
the abbot
destruction and caution with delight fiat
mixtioi as we say that i can answer that the
vulgar mind will be defeated and purged
 anile and popish fooleries by the medicament
exhibited so that the privue vice
being cleansed master henderson or any
other able pastor may at will throw in tonics
and effectuate a perfect moral cure
tutti citojucundo
i have no charge doctor lundin
replied the page
call me not doctor said the chamberlain
 since i have laid aside my furred
gown and bonnet and retired me into this
temporality chamberlainship
o sire said the page who was no
stranger by report to the character this

and this i must say better fashioned medicines

longa rohha cora scientia saith the italian
 ha fair sir you have the language 
roland greeme did not think it necessary
to expound to this learned theban
whether he understood him or no but
leaving that matter uncertain he told him
he came in quest certain packages which
should have arrived at kinross and been
placed under the chamberlain's charge the
evening before
 body o me said doctor lundin i
fear our common carrier john auchter
muchty hath met with some mischance
that he came not up last night with his

although besides all maladies from your

a dozen swashbucklers who will ease him
at once his baggage and his earthly complaints

me from the city for composition my

some terror if you meet with opposers
he then added turning to roland graeme
 i warrant me we shall have news the
the abbot 
pains in brief season meantime it will
please you to look upon the sports but first
to enter my poor lodging and take your
morning's cup for what saith the school
 salerno 
speculum mane haustura
restaurant naturam exhausted
 your learning is too profound for me
replied the page and so would your
draught be likewise i fear
not a whit fair sir a cordial cup 
sack impregnated with wormwood is the
best anti pestilential draught j and to speak
truth the pestilential miasmata are now
very rife in the atmosphere we live in a
happy time young man continued he ina
tone grave irony and have many
blessings unknown to our fathers here
are two sovereigns in the land a regnant
and a claimant that is enough one good
thing but if any one wants more he may
find a king in every peelhouse in the country
 so if we lack government it is not for
want governors then have we a civil
 the abbot
war to refresh us every year and to prevent
our population from starving for want 
food and for the same purpose we have
the plague proposing us a visit the best 
all recipes for thinning a land and converting
younger brothers into elder ones well
each man in his vocation you young fellows
 the sword desire to wrestle fence
or so forth with some expert adversary 
and for my part i love to match myself for
life or death against that same plague
as they proceeded up the street the
little village towards the doctor's lodgings
his attention was successively occupied by
the various personages whom he met and
pointed out to the notice his companion
do you see that fellow with the red
bonnet the blue jerkin and the great rough
barton in his hand i believe that clown
hath the strength a tower he has lived
fifty years in the world and never encouraged
the liberal sciences by buying one
pennyworth medicaments but see you
that man with the fades hippocrates v said
the abbot 
he pointing out a thin peasant with swelled
legs and a most cadaverous countenance 
that i call one the worthiest men in
the barony he breakfasts luncheons dines
and sups by my advice and not without my
medicine and for his own single part will
go farther to clear out a moderate stock 
pharmaceutical than half the country besides
 how do you my honest friend 
said he to the party in question with a tone
 condolence
 very weakly sir since i took the electuary
answered the patient it neighboured
ill with the two spoonfuls peaseporridge
and the kernmilk
peaseporridge and kernmilk have you
been under medicine these ten years and
keep your diet so ill the next morning
take the electuary by itself and touch nothing
for six hours the poor object bowed
and shuffled off
the next whom the doctor deigned to
take notice j was a lame fellow by whom
the honour was altogether undeserved for
p 
 the abbot
at sight the medicine he began to shuffle
away in the crowd as fast as his infirmities
would permit
 there is an ungrateful hound for you
said doctor lundin j i cured him the
gout in his feet and now he talks the
agreeableness medicine and makes the
first use his restored legs to fly from his
physician hisjodagra hath become a cki
agra as honest martial hath it the gout
has got into his fingers and he cannot draw
his purse old saying and true
anaemia cum poscit medicis satan est
we are angels when we come to cure devils
when we ask payment but i will administer
a purgation to his purse i warrant
him there is his brother too a sordid
chuff so ho there saunders varlet you
have been ill i hear 
just got the turn as i was thinking to
send to your honour and i am brawly now
again it was nae great thing that ailed
me
the abbot 
hark you sirrah said the doctor i
trust you remember you are owing to the
laird four stones barley meal and a bow
 oats j and i would have you send no more
such kainfowls as you sent last season that
looked as wretchedly as patients just dismissed
from a plaguehospital and there
is hard money owing besides
 i was thinking sir said the man more
scoticoy that is returning no direct answer
on the subject on which he was addressed
my best way would be to come down to
your honour and take your advice yet incase
my trouble should come back
 do so then knave replied lundin
 and remember what ecclesiasticus saith
give place to the physician let him not
go from thee for thou hast need him
his exhortation was interrupted by an
apparition which seemed to strike the doctor
with as much horror and surprise as his
own visage inflicted upon sundry those
persons whom he had addressed
the figure which produced this effect on
 the abbot
the aesculapius the village was that a
tall old woman who wore a highcrowned
hat and muffler the first these habiliments
added apparently to her stature
and the other served to conceal the lower
part her face and as the hat itself was
slouched little could be seen besides two
brown cheekbones and the eyes swarthy
fire that gleamed from under two shaggy
grey eye brows she was dressed in a long
darkcoloured robe unusual fashion bordered
at the skirts and on the stomacher
with a sort white trimming resembling
the jewish phylacteries on which were
wrought the characters some unknown
language she held in her hand a walking
staff black ebony
by the soul celsus said doctor
luke lundin it is old mother nineveh
herself she hath come to beard me within
mine own bounds and in the very execution
 mine office have at thy coat
old woman as the song says hob anster
let her presently be seized and comthe
abbot 
mitted to the tolbooth and if there are any
zealous brethren here who would give the
hag her deserts and duck her as a witch
in the loch i pray let them in no way be
hindered
but the myrmidons doctor lundin
shewed in this case no alacrity to do his
bidding hob anster even ventured to remonstrate
in the name himself and his
brethren to be sure he was to do his
honour's bidding and for a that folks said
about the skill and the witcheries mother
nicneven he would put his trust in
god and his hand on her collar without
dreadful but she was no common spae
wife this mother nicneven like jean joppa
that lived in the briersbaulk she had
lords and lairds that would ruffle for her
there was moncrief tippermalloch that
was popish and the laird carslogie a
kennedy queen's man were in the fair with
wha kennedy how mony swords and bucklers
at their back and they would be sure to
make a breakout if the officers meddled with
s the abbot
the auld popish witch wife who was sewell
friend mair especially as the laird's best
men such as were not in the cattle were
in edinburgh with him and he doubted his
honour the doctor would find over few to
make a good backing if blades were bare
the doctor listened unwillingly to this
prudential counsel and was only comforted
by the faithful promise his satellite that
the old woman should as he expressed
it be ta'en canny the next time she trespassed
on the bounds
 and in that event said the doctor to
his companion fire and faggot shall bethe
best her welcome
this he spoke in hearing the dame
herself who even then and in passing the
doctor shot towards him from under her
grey eyebrows a look the most insulting
and contemptuous superiority
this way continued the physician
this way marshalling his guest into his
lodging take care you stumble not over
the abbot 
a retort for it is hazardous for the ignorant
to walk in the ways art
the page found all reason for the caution
 for besides stuffed birds and lizards
and snakes bottled up and bundles simples
made up and other parcels spread out
to dry and all the confusion not to mention
the confused and sickening smells incidental
to a druggist's stock in trade he
had also to avoid heaps charcoal crucibles
boltheads stoves and the other furniture
 a chemical laboratory
amongst his other philosophical qualities
doctor lundin failed not to be a confused
sloven and his old dame housekeeper whose
life as she said was spent in redding
him up had trotted off to the mart 
gaiety with other and younger folks much
clattering and jangling therefore there was
among jars and bottles and vials ere the
doctor produced the salutiferous potion
which he recommended so strongly and
a search equally long and noisy follows
the abbot
ed among broken cans and cracked pipkin
ere he could bring forth a cup out 
which to drink it both matters being at
length achieved the doctor set the example
to his guest by quaffing off a cup the
cordial and smacking his lips with approbation
as it descended his gullet roland
in turn submitted to swallow the potion
which his host so earnestly recommended
but which he found so insufferably bitter
that he became eager to escape from the
laboratory in search a draught fair
water to expel the taste in spite his
efforts he was nevertheless detained by the
garrulity his host till he gave him some
account mother nicneven
 i care not to speak her said the
doctor in the open air and among the
throng people not for fright like yon
cowardly dog anster but because i would
give no occasion for a fray having no leisure
to look to stabs slashes and broken bones
men call the old hag a prophetess i do
scarce believe she could foretell when a
the abbot 
brood chickens will chip the shell men
say she reads the heavens my black bitch
knows as much them when she sits baying
the moon men pretend the old wretch
is a sorceress a witch and what not liter
nos i will never contradict a rumour which
may bring her to the stake which she so
richly deserves but neither will i believe
that the tales witches which they din into
our ears are aught but knavery cozenage
and old womens fables
in the name heaven what is she
then said the page that you make such
a stir about her 
 she is one those cursed old women
replied the physician who take currently
and impudently upon themselves to act as
advisers and curers the sick on the
strength some trash herbs some
rhyme spells some julep or diet drink
or cordial
 nay go no farther said the page if
they brew cordials evil be their lot and
all their partakers

 the abbot
you say well young man said doctor
lundin for mine own part i know no
such pests to the commonwealth as these
old incarnate devils who haunt the chambers
 the brainsick patients that are mad
enough to suffer them to interfere with
disturb and let the regular progress a
learned and artificial cure with their syrups
and their juleps and discords and mithridate
and my lady whatshallcall'ums
powder and worthy dame trachea's pill 
and thus make widows and orphans and
cheat the regular and well studied physician
in order to get the name wise women
and steely neighbours and so forth
but no more on't mother nicneven and
i will meet one day and she shall know
there is danger in dealing with the doctor
it is a true word and many have found
it said the page but under your favour
i would fain walk abroad for a little and
see these sports
 it is well moved said the doctor
 and i too should be showing myself

in proportion all other sports
were discontinued the dance around the
maypole was arrested the ring broken up
and dispersed while the dancers each leading
his partner by the hand tripped off to the
sylvan theatre a truce was in like manner
achieved betwixt a huge brown bear and
certain mastiffs who were tugging and pulling
at his shaggy coat under the mediation
 the bear ward and half a dozen butchers
and yeomen who by dint staving entailing
as it was technically termed separated
the unfortunate animals whose fury
had for an hour past been their chief amusement
the itinerant minstrel found himself
deserted by the audience he had collected

they would err greatly who should regulate
their ideas this dramatic exhibition
upon those derived from a modern theatre
 for the rude shews thespis were far
less different from those exhibited by euripides
on the stage athens with all its
magnificentdecorations and pompous dresses

were no scenes no stage no machinery no
pit box and gallery no box lobby and

sate around prompt to applaud the whole
the wit the piece which was not 
the most polished kind was chiefly directed
against the superstitious practices the
catholic religion j and the stage artillery
had on this occasion been levelled by no
less a person than doctor lundin who
had not only commanded the manager 
the entertainment to select one the numerous
satires which had been written
against the papists several which were
cast in a dramatic form but had even like
the prince denmark caused them to insert
or according to his own phrase to infuse
here and there a few pleasantries 
 the abbot
his own penning on the same inexhaustible
subject hoping thereby to mollify the
rigour the lady lochleven towards
pastimes this description he failed not
to jog roland's elbow who was sitting instate
behind him and recommend to his
particular attention those favourite passages
as for the page to whom the very
idea such an exhibition simple as it
was was entirely new he beheld it with
the undiminished and ecstatic delight with
which men all ranks look for the first
time on dramatic representation and laughed
shouted and clapped his hands as the
performance proceeded an incident at
length took place which effectually broke
off his interest in the business the scene

comic part the drama was as we have
already said a qusestionaryor pardoner one

down to that heywood their present
representative failed not to follow the same
line humour exhibiting pig's bones lor
reliques and boasting the virtues small
tin crosses which had been shaken in the
holy porringer at lorenzo and cockleshells
which had been brought from the
shrine saint james composedly all
which he disposed to the devout catholics
at nearly as high a price as antiquaries
are now willing to pay for baubles similar
intrinsic value at length the pardoner
pulled from his scrip a small phial clear
vater which he vaunted the quality in
the following verses 
listneth gode people everiche one
for in the lone babylon
far eastward wot it lyethj
and is the first lone the sonne espieth
ther as he cometh fro out the se 
in this ilk lone as thinker me

 the abbot
right as hole legends tell
snottreth from a rose a well
and falleth into ane bath son
wher cast susanne in times long gon
was wont to wash her bodie and lira

through nights cold and dayes hope

or a maiden stepp'd aside 
putteth this water under her nose

the jest as the reader skilful in the antique
language the drama must at once
perceive turned on the same pivot as in the
old minstrel tales the drinking horn 
king arthur and the mantle made amiss
but the audience were neither learned nor
critical enough to challenge its want originality
the potent relique was after
such grimace and buffoonery as befitted the
subject presented successively to each 
the female personages the drama not
one whom sustained the supposed test
 discretion but to the infinite delight 
the abbot 
the audience sneezed much louder and
longer than perhaps they themselves had
counted on the jest seemed at last worn
threadbare and the pardoner was passing
on to some new pleasantry when the jester
or clown the drama possessing himself
secretly the phial which contained the
wondrous liquor applied it suddenly to the
nose a young woman who with her
black silk muffler or screen drawn over her
face was sitting in the foremost rank the
spectators intent apparently upon the business
 the stage the contents the
phial well calculated to sustain the credit
 the pardoner's legend set the damsel a
sneezing violently an admission frailty
which was received with shouts rapture
by the audience these were soon however
renewed at the expence the jester
himself when the insulted maiden extricated
ere the paroxysm was well over one
hand from the folds her mantle and bestowed
on the wag a buffet which made him
reel fully his own length from the pardoner
 the abbot
and then acknowledge the favour by instant
prostration
no one pities a jester overcome in his
vocation and the clown met with little sympathy
when rising from the ground and
whimpering forth his complaints harsh
treatment he invoked the assistance and
sympathy the audience but the chamberlain
feeling his own dignity insulted ordered
two his halberdiers to bring the
culprit before him when these official persons
first approached the virago she threw
herself into an attitude firm defiance as
if determined to resist their authority j and
from the sample strength and spirit which
she had already displayed they shewed no
alacrity at executing their commission but
on half a minute's reflection the damsel
changed totally her attitude and manner
folded her cloak around her arms in modest
and maidenlike fashion and walked her
own accord to the presence the great
man followed and guarded by the two manful
satellites as she moved across the vathe
abbot 
cant space and more especially as she stood
at the footstool the doctor's judgmentseat
the maiden discovered that lightness
and elasticity step and natural grace 
manner which connoisseurs in female beauty
know to be seldom divided from it
moreover her neat russetcoloured jacket
and short petticoat the same colour displayed
a handsome form and a pretty leg
her features were concealed by the screen j
but the doctor whose gravity did not prevent
his pretensions to be a connoisseur 
the school we have hinted at saw enough
to judge favourably the piece by the
sample
he began however with considerable
austerity manner and how nosy
saucy quean said the medical man office
 what have you to say why i shout
not order you to be ducked in the loch for
lifting your hand to the man in my presence

 marry replied the culprit because
 the abbot
i judge that your honour will not think the
cold bath necessary for my complaints
a pestilent jade said the doctor whispering
to roland grme and i'll warrant
her a good one her voice is as sweet as
syrup but my pretty maiden said he
you shew us wonderfully little that
countenance yours be pleased to throw
aside your muffler
 i trust your honour will excuse me till
we are more private answered the maiden 
for i have acquaintance and i should hke
ill to be known in the country as the poor
girl whom that scurvy knave put his jest
upon
fear nothing for thy good name my
sweet little modicum candied manna
replied the doctor for i protest to you
as i am chamberlain lochleven kinross
and so forth that the chaste susanna
herself could not have snuffed that elixir
without sternutation being in truth a curious
distillation rectified acefum or vinegar
 the sun prepared by mine own hands
the abbot 
wherefore as thou mayest thou wilt come
to me in private and express thy contrition
for the offence whereof thou hast been guilty
i command that all for the present go
forward as if no such interruption the
prescribed course had taken place
the damsel curtsied and tripped back to
her place the play proceeded but it no
longer attracted the attention roland
gramme
the voice the figure and what the veil
permitted to be seen the neck and tresses
 the village damsel bore so strong a resemblance
to those catherine seton
that he felt like one bewildered in the mazes
 a changeful and studying dream the
memorable scene the hostelry rushed on
his recollection with all its doubtful and
marvellous circumstances were the tales
 enchantment which he had read in romances
realized in this extraordinary girl 
could she transport herself from the walled
and guarded castle lochleven moaned
with its broad lake towards which he cast
 the abbot
back a look as if to ascertain it was still inexistence
and watched with such scrupulous
care as the safety a nation demanded
 could she surmount all these obstacles
and make such careless and dangerous use
 her liberty as to engage herself publicly
in a quarrel in a village fair roland was
unable to determine whether the exertions
which it must have cost her to gain her
freedom or the use to which she had put
it rendered her the most unaccountable
creature
lost in these meditations he kept his
gaze fixed on the subject them and in
every casual motion discovered or thought
he discovered something which reminded
him still more strongly catherine seton
it occurred to him more than once indeed
that he might be deceiving himself by exaggerating
some casual likeness into absolute
identity but then the meeting at the
hostelry saint michael's returned to his
mind and it seemed in the highest degree
improbable that under such various cir
the abbot 
substances mere imagination should twice
have found opportunity to play him the selfsame
trick this time however he determined
to have his doubts resolved and for
this purpose he sate during the rest the
play like a greyhound in the slip ready
to spring upon the hare the instant that she
was started the damsel whom he watched
attentively lest she should escape in
the crowd when the spectacle was closed
sate as if perfectly unconscious that she was
observed but the worthy doctor marked
the direction his eyes and magnanimously
suppressed his own inclination to become
the theseus to this hippolyta in deference to
the rights hospitality which enjoined him
to forbear interference with the pleasurable
pursuits his young friend he passed one
or two formal gibes upon the fixed attention
which the page paid to the unknown and
upon his own jealousy adding however that
if both were to be presented to the patient
at once he had little doubt she would think
the younger man the sounder prescription
 the abbot
i fear me he added we shall have no
news the knave auchtermuchty for sometime
since the vermin whom i sent after
him seem to have proved corbiemessengers
so you have an hour or two on your
hands master page and as the minstrels
are beginning to strike up now that the
play is ended why an you incline for a
dance yonder is the green and there sits
your partner i trust you will hold me perfect
in ray diagnostics since i see with half
an eye what disease you are sick and
have administered a pleasing remedy
discern sapiens res as chambers hath it quae con
pundit apelles
the page hardly heard the the
learned adage or the charge which the
chamberlain gave him to be within reach
in case the pains arriving suddenly and
sooner than expected so eager he was at
once to shake himself free his learned associate
and to satisfy his curiosity regarding
the unknown damsel yet in the haste
the abbot 
with which he made towards her he found
time to reflect that in order to secure an
opportunity conversing with her in private
he must not alarm her at first accosting
her he therefore composed his manner
and gait and advancing with becoming selfconfidence
before three or four countryfellows
who were intent on the same design
but knew not so well how to put their request
into shape he acquainted her that he
as the deputy the venerable chamberlain
requested the honour her hand as a partner

the venerable chamberlain said the
damsel frankly reaching the page her hand
 does very well to exercise this part his
privilege by deputy and i suppose the laws
 the revels leave me no choice but to accept
 his faithful delegate
 providing fair damsel said the page
his choice a delegate is not altogether
distasteful to you
 that fair sir replied the maiden
 the abbot
 i will tell you more when we have danced
the first measure
we have mentioned that catherine seyton
had admirable skill in gestic lore and
that she was sometimes called on to dance
for the amusement her royal mistress roland
graeme had often been a spectator 
her sml and sometimes at the queen's command
catherine's partner on such occasions
he was therefore perfectly acquainted with
catherine's mode dancing and observed
that his present partner in grace in agility
in quickness ear and precision execution
exactly resembled her save that the
scottish jigg which he now danced with
her required a more violent and rapid motion
and more rustic agility than the stately
parens lavoltas and counties which
he had seen her execute in the chamber 
queen mary the active duties the
dance left him little time for reflection and
none for conversation but when their jades
deux was finished amidst the acclama
the abbot 
tions the villagers who had seldom witnessed
such an exhibition he took an opportunity
when they yielded up the green to
another couple to use the privilege a
partner and enter into conversation with
the mysterious maiden whom he still held
by the hand fair partner may i not
crave the name her who has graced me
thus far 
you may said the maiden but it
is a question whether shall answer you
 and why asked roland
 because nobody gives anything for nothing
 and you can tell me nothing in return
which i care to hear
 could i not tell you my name and lineage
in exchange for yours returned
roland
 no answered the maiden for you
know little either
 how said the page somewhat angrily

wrath you not for the matter said
the damsel i will shew you in an instant
 the abbot
that i know more you than you do 
yourself
 indeed answered graeme for whom
then do you take me 
 for the wild falcon answered she
whom a dog brought in his mouth to a
certain castle when he was but an unfledged
eyass for the hawk whom men dare
not let fly lest he should check at game
and pounce on carrion whom folks must
keep hooded till he has the proper light 
his eyes and can discover good from evil
well be it so replied roland graeme
i guess at a part your parable fair mistress
mine and perhaps i know as much
 you as you do me and can well dispense
with the information which you are
so niggard in giving
 prove that said the maiden and i
will give you credit for more penetration
than i judged you to be gifted withal
 it shall be proved instantly said roland
graeme the first letter your
name is s and the last n
the abbot 
admirable said his partner guess
on
it pleases you today continued roland
 to wear the snood and kirtle and
perhaps you may be seen tomorrow in hat
and feather hose and doublet
in the clout in the clout you have
hit the very white said the damsel suppressing
a great inclination to laugh
you can switch men's eyes out their
heads as well as the heart out their bosoms

these last words were uttered in a low
and tender tone which to roland's great
mortification and somewhat to his displeasure
was so far from allaying that it greatly
increased his partner's disposition to
laughter she could scarce compose herself
while she replied if you had thought
my hand so formidable extricating it from
his grasp you would not have grasped it
so hard but i perceive you know me so
fully that there is no occasion to shew you
mv face
 the abbot
 fair catherine said the page he
were unworthy ever to have seen you far
less to have dwelt so long in the same service
and under the same roof with you who
could mistake your air your gesture your
step in walking or in dancing the turn 
your neck the symmetry your form
none could be so dull as not to recognize
you by so many proofs but for me i could
swear even to that tress hair that escapes
from under your muffler
and to the face course which that
muffler covers said the maiden removing
her veil and in an instant endeavouring to
replace it she shewed the features catherine
 but an unusual degree petulant
impatience inflamed them when from some
awkwardness in her management the
muffler she was unable again to adjust it
with that dexterity which was a principal
accomplishment the coquettes the
time
 the fiend rive the rag to tatters said
the damsel as the veil fluttered about her
the abbott s
shoulders with an accent so earnest and
decided that it made the page start he
looked again at the damsel's face but the
information which his eyes received was to
the same purport as before he assisted
her to adjust her muffler and both were for
for an instant silent the damsel spoke
first for roland greene was overwhelmed
with surprise at the contrarieties which catherine
seyton seemed to include in her
person and character
 you are surprised said the damsel to
him at what you see and hear but the
times which make females men are least 
all fitted for men to become women yet you
yourself are in danger such a change
 i in danger becoming effeminate 
said the page
yes you for all the boldness your
reply said the damsel when you should
hold fast your religion because it is assailed
on all sides by rebels traitors and heretics
you let it glide out your breast like wavol
iii b
 the abbot

ter grasped in the hand if you are driven
from the faith your fathers from fear 
a traitor is not that womanish if you
are cajoled by the cunning arguments a
trumpeter heresy or the praises a puritanic
old woman is not that womanish 
if you are bribed by the hope spoil
and preferment is not that womanish 
and when you wonder at my venting a
threat or an execration should you not
wonder at yourself who pretending to a
gentle name and aspiring to knighthood
can be at the same time cowardly silly
and selfinterested 
i would that a man would bring such
a charge said the page he should see
ere his life was a minute older whether he
had cause to term me coward or no
 beware such big words answered
the maiden you said but anon that i
sometimes wear hose and doublet
 but remain still catherine seyton
wear what you list said the page endear
abbot 
pouring again to possess himself her
hand
 you indeed are pleased to call me
so replied the maiden evading his intention
 but i have many another name besides

 and will you not reply to that said
the page by which you are distinguished
beyond every other maiden in scotland

the damsel unaltered by his praises still
kept aloof and sung with gaiety a verse from
an old ballad
o some do call me jack sweet love
and some do call me gill 
but when i ride to holyrood
my name is wilful will
 wilful will exclaimed the page
impatiently say rather will o the wisp
jack with the lantern for never was such
a deceitful or wandering meteor
 if i be such replied the maiden i
 the abbot
ask no fools to follow me if they do so it
is at their own pleasure and must be on
their own proper peril
 nay but dearest catherine said
roland graeme be for one instant serious

 if you will call me your dearest catherine
when i have given you so many
names to chuse upon replied the damsel
 i would ask you how supposing me
for two or three hours my life escaped
from yonder tower you have the cruelty
to ask me to be serious during the only
merry moments i have seen perhaps for
months 
ay but fair catherine there are moments
 deep and true feeling which are
worth ten thousand years the liveliest
mirth and such was that yesterday when
you so nearly
 so nearly what demanded the darnsel
hastily
 when you approached your hips so
the abbot 
near to the sign you had traced on my forehead

mother heaven said she in a yet
fiercer tone and with a more masculine
manner than she had yet exhibited catherine
seyton approach her lips to a man's
brow and thou that man vassal thou
lies r
the page stood astonished but conceiving
he had alarmed the damsel's delicacy
by alluding to the enthusiasm a moment
and the manner in which she had expressed
it he endeavoured to faulter forth an
apology his excuses though he was unable
to give them any regular shape were
accepted by his companion who had indeed
suppressed her indignation after its first explosion
 speak no more on't she said 
and now let us part our conversation may
attract more notice than is convenient for
either us
 nay but allow me at least to follow
you to some sequestered place
so the abbot
 you dare not replied the maiden
how said the youth dare not 
where is it you dare go where i dare not
follow r
you fear a will o the wisp said the
damsel how would you face a fiery dragon
with an enchantress mounted on its
back 
like sir ever sir grime or sir greysteel
said the page but be there such
toys to be seen here 
 go to mother nicneven's answered
the maid and she is witch enough to
rein the horned devil with a red silk thread
for a bridle and a rowantree switch for a
whip
 i will follow you said the page
let it be at some distance said the
maiden
and wrapping her mantle around her
with more success than on her former attempt
she mingled with the throng and
walked towards the village heed fully folthe
abbot 
lowed by roland gramme at some distance
and under every precaution which he could
use to prevent his purpose from being observed

s the abbot
chapter 
yes it is he whose eyes look'd on thy childhood
and watch d with trerabhng hope thy dawn youth
that now with these same eyeballs dirnm'd with age
and dimnict yct with tears sees thy dishonour
old play
at the entrance the principal or indeed
so to speak the only street in kinross
the damsel whose steps were pursued by
roland graeme cast a glance behind her
as if to be certain he had not lost trace 
her and then plunged down a very narrow
lane which run betwixt two rows poor
and ruinous cottages she paused for a second
at the door one those miserable
tenements again cast her eye up the lane
towards roland then lifted the latch opened
the door and disappeared from his view
with whatever haste the page followed
the abbot s

her example the difficulty which he found
in discovering the trick the latch which
did not work quite in the usual manner
and in pushing open the door which did
not yield to his first effort delayed for a
minute or two his entrance into the cottage
a dark and smoky passage passed as
usual betwixt the exterior wall the house
and the hullan or claywall which served asa
partition betwixt and the interior at the
 this passage and through the partition
was a door leading into the hen or
inner chamber the cottage and when
roland gramme's hand was upon the latch
 this door a female voice pronounced
benedictus qui venial in nomine domini 
damascus qui in wmiie inimici on entering
the apartment he perceived the figure
which the chamberlain had pointed out to
him as mother nicneven seated beside the
lowly hearth but there was no other person
in the room roland graeme gazed
around in surprise at the disappearance 
catherine seyton without paying much reb

 the abbot
gard to the supposed sorceress until she
attracted and rivetted his regard by the
tone in which she asked him what seekest
thou here 
 i seek said the page with much embarrassment
 i seek 
but his answer was cut short when the
old woman drawing her huge grey eyebrows
sternly together with a frown which
knitted her brow into a thousand wrinkles
arose and stretching herself up to her full
natural size tore the kerchief from her
head and seizing roland by the arm made
two strides across the floor the apartment
to a small window through which the light
fell full on her face and shewed the astonished
youth the countenance magdalen
graeme yes roland she said thine
eyes deceive thee not they shew thee truly
the features her whom thou hast thyself
deceived whose wine thou hast turned into
gall her bread joyfulness into bitter poison
her hope into the blackest despair it is
she who now demands thee what meekest
the abbot
thou here she whose heaviest sin towards
heaven hath been that she loved thee even
better than the weal the whole church
and could not without reluctance surrender
thee even in the cause god she now
asks you what meekest thou here 
while she spoke she kept her broad black
eye rivetted on the youth's face with the
expression with which the eagle regards his
prey ere he tears it to pieces roland felt
himself at the moment incapable either
 reply or evasion this extraordinary
enthusiast had preserved over him in some
measure the ascendancy which she had
acquired during his childhood and besides
he knew the violence her passions and
her impatience contradiction and was
sensible that almost any reply which he
could make was like to throw her into an
ecstacy rage he was therefore silent
and magdalen graeme proceeded with encreasing
enthusiasm in her apostrophe
 once more what seek'st thou false boy
seest thou the honour thou hast renown
s the abbot
cet the faith thou hast abandoned the
hopes thou hast destroyed or didst thou
seek me the sole protectress thy youth
the only parent whom thou hast known
that thou mayst trample on my grey hairs
even as thou hast already trampled on the
best wishes my heart
 pardon me mother said roland
gramme j but in truth and reason deserve
not your blame i have been treated
amongst you even by yourself my reverend
parent as well as by others as one who
lacked the common attributes freewill
and human reason or was at least deemed
unfit to exercise them a land enchantment
have i been led into and spells have
been cast around me every one has met
me in disguise every one has spoke to mein
parables i have been like one who walks
in a weary and bewildering dream and now
you blame me that i have not the sense and
judgment and steadiness a waking and
a disenchanted and a reasonable man who
knows what he is doing and wherefore he
the abbot 
does it if one must walk with masks and
spectres who waft themselves from place to
place as it were in vision rather than reality
it might shake the soundest faith and turn
the wisest head i sought since i must
needs avow my folly the same catherine
seyton with whom you made me first acquainted
and whom i most strangely find
in this village kinross gayest among the
revellers when i had but just left her in the
wellguarded castle lochleven the sad
attendant an imprisoned queen i sought
her and in her place i find you my mother
more strangely disguised than even she is
 and what hadst thou to do with catherine
seyton said the matron sternly 
 is this a time or a world to follow maidens
or to dance around a maypole when the
trumpet summons every truehearted scotsman
around the standard the true sovereign
shalt thou be found loitering in a
lady's bower 
no by heaven nor imprisoned in the
rugged walls an island castle answered
 the abbot
roland grseme i would the blast were
to sound even now for i fear that nothing
less loud will dispel the chimerical visions
by which i am surrounded
 doubt not that it will be winded said
the matron and that so fearfully loud that
scotland will never hear the like until the
last and loudest blast all shall announce
to mountain and to valley that time is no
more meanwhile be thou but brave and
constant serve god and honour thy sovereign
 abide by thy religion i cannot 
i will not i dare not ask thee the truth 
the terrible surmises i have heard touching
thy falling away perfect not that accursed
sacrifice and yet even at this late hour
thou mayst be what i have hoped for the
son my dearest hope what say i theson
omy hope thou shalt be the hope scotland
her boast and her honour even thy
wildest and most foolish wishes may perchance
be fulfilled i shame to mingle meaner
motives with the noble guerdon i hold out
to thee it shames me being such as i am
the abbot 
to mention the idle passions youth save
with contempt and the purpose censure
but we must bribe children to wholesome
medicine by the offer cates and youth
to honourable achievement with the promise
 pleasure mark me therefore roland
the love catherine seyton will
follow him only who shall achieve the freedom
 her mistress and believe it maybe
one day in thine own power to be
that happy lover cast therefore away
doubt and fear and prepare to do what religion
calls for what thy country demands
 thee what thy duty as a subject and asa
servant alike require at your hand and
be assured even the idlest wishes thy
heart will be most readily attained by following
the call thy duty
as she ceased speaking a double knock
was heard against the inner door the matron
hastily adjusting her muffler and resuming
her chair by the hearth demanded
who was there
 the abbot
 salve in nomine sanctity was answered
from without
salute et vos answered magdalen
graeme
and a man entered in the ordinary dress
 a nobleman's retainer wearing at his
girdle a sword and buckler sought
you said he my mother and him whom
i see with you then addressing himself
to roland graeme he said to him hast
thou not a packet from george douglas 
 i have said the page suddenly recollecting
that which had been committed to
his charge in the morning but i may not
deliver it to any one without some token
that they have right to ask it
 you say well replied the servingman
and whispered into his ear the packet
which i ask is the report to his father will
this token suffice 
 it will replied the page and taking
the packet from his bosom gave it to the
man
the abbot 
 i will return presently said the 
and left the cottage
roland had now sufficiently recovered his
surprise to accost his relative in turn and
request to know the reason why he found
her in so precarious a disguise and a place
so dangerous you cannot be ignorant
he said the hatred that the lady 
lochleven bears to those your that is
 our religion your present disguise lays
you open to suspicions a different kind
but inferring no less hazard and whether
as a catholic or as a sorceress or as a friend
to the unfortunate queen you are in equal
danger if apprehended within the bounds
 thedouglasandinthechamberlainwho
administers their authority you have for
his own reasons an enemy and a bitter one
 i know it said the matron her eyes
kindling with triumph i know that vain
 his school craft and carnal wisdom luke
lundin views with jealousy and hatred the
blessings which the saints have conferred on
my prayers and on the holy reliques before
 the abbot
the touch nay before the bare presence 
which disease and death have so often been
known to retreat i know he would rend
and tear me but there is a chain and a
muzzle on the ban dog that shall restrain
his fury and the master's servant shall not
be offended by him until the master's work
is wrought when that hour comes let the
shadows the evening descend on me in
thunder and in tempest the time shall be
welcome that relieves my eyes from seeing
guilt and my ears from listening to blasphemy
do thou but be constant play
thy part as i have played and will play
mine and my release shall be like that a
blessed martyr which angels hail with psalm
and song while earth pursues him with hiss
and with execration
as she concluded the servingman again
entered the cottage and said all is well 
the time holds for tomorrow night
 what time what holds exclaimed
roland grasme trust i have given the
douglas's packet to no wrong
the abbot 
content yourself young man answered
the serving man thou hast my word
and token
 i know not if the token be right said
the page and i care not much for the
word a stranger
what said the matron although
thou mayst have given a packet delivered
to thy charge by one the queen's rebels
into the hand a loyal subject there were
no great mistake in that thou hotbrained
boy
 by saint andrew there were foul mistake
though answered the page it is
the very spirit my duty in this first stage
 chivalry to be faithful to my trust and
had the devil given me a message to discharge
i would not so i had plighted my
faith to the contrary betray his counsel to
an angel light
now by the love i once bore thee said
the matron i could slay thee with mine
own hand when hear thee talk a dearer
 the abbot
faith being due to rebels and heretic than
thou west to thy church and thy prince 
 be patient my good sister said the
serving man i will give him such reasons
as shall counterbalance the scruples which
beset him the spirit is honourable though
now it may be mistimed and misplaced 
follow me young man
 ere i go to call this stranger to a reckoning
said the page to the matron is
there nothing i can do for your comfort
and safety r
 nothing she replied nothing save
what will lead more to thy own honour the
saints who have protected me thus far will
lend me succour as i need it tread the
path glory that is before thee and only
think me as the creature on earth who
will be most delighted to hear thy fame
follow the stranger he hath tidings for
you that you little expect
the stranger remained on the threshold
as if waiting for roland and whenever he
the abbot 
saw him put himself in motion he moved
on before him at a quick pace diving
still deeper down the lane roland perceived
that it was now bordered by buildings
upon the one side only and that the
other was fenced by a high old wall over
which some trees extended their branches
descending a good way farther they came
to a small door in the wall roland's guide
paused looked around for an instant to see
if any one were within sight then taking
a key from his pocket opened the door and
entered making a sign to roland grasme
to follow him the guided did so and the
stranger locked the door carefully on the
inside during this operation the page had
a moment to look around and perceived
that he was in a small orchard very trimly
kept
the stranger led him through an alley or
two shaded by trees loaded with summerfruit
into a pleached arbour where taking
the turf seat which was on the one side he
motioned to roland to occupy that which
 the abbot
was opposite to him and after a momentary
silence opened the conversation as follows 
you have asked a better warrant than the
word a mere stranger to satisfy you that
i have the authority george douglas
for possessing myself the packet entrusted
to your charge 
 it is precisely the point on which demand
reckoning you said roland i
fear i have acted hastily if so must redeem
my error as i best may
you hold me then as a perfect stranger
said the man look at my face more
attentively and see if the features do not
resemble those a man much known to
you formerly
roland gazed attentively but the ideas
recalled to his mind were so inconsistent
with the mean and servile dress the person
before him that he did not venture to
express the opinion which he was irresistibly
induced to form
yes my son said the stranger observing
his embarrassment you do indeed
the abbot 
see before you the unfortunate father ambrose
who once accounted his ministry
crowned in your preservation from the
snares heresy but who is now condemned
to lament thee as a castaway 
roland graeme's kindness heart was
at least equal to his vivacity temper he
could not bear to see his ancient and honoured
master and spiritual guide in a situation
which inferred a change fortune
so melancholy but throwing himself at his
feet grasped his knees and wept aloud
 what mean these tears my son said
the abbot if they are shed for your own
sins and follies surely they are gracious
showers and may avail thee much but
weep not if they fall on my account you
indeed see the superior the community
 saint mary's in the dress a poor shorter
who gives his master the use his blade
and buckler and if needful his life for a
coarse livery coat and four marks by the
year but such a garb suits the time and
 the abbot
in the period the church militant as well
becomes her prelates as staff mitre and
crosier in the days the church's triumph
 by what fate said the page and yet
why added he checking himself need
i ask catherine seyton in some sort prepared
me for this but that the change
should be so absolute the destruction so
complete 
 yes my son said the abbot ambrosius
 thine own eyes beheld in my unworthy
elevation to the abbot's stall the
last especial act holy solemnity which
shall be seen in the church saint mary's
until it shall please heaven to turn back the
captivity the church for the present the
shepherd is smitten ay well nigh to the
earth the flock are scattered and the
shrines saints and martyrs and pious benefactors
to the church are given to the
owls night and the satyrs the desert
and your brother the knight 
 could he do nothing for your protection

the abbot 
he himself hath fallen under the suspicion
 the ruling powers said the abbot
 who are as unjust to their friends as
they are cruel to their enemies i could
not grieve at it did i hope it might estrange
him from his course but i know the soul
 halbert and i rather fear it will drive
him to prove his fidelity to their unhappy
cause by some deed which may be yet more
destructive to the church and rare offensive
to heaven enough this and now
to the business our meeting i trust you
will hold it sufficient if i pass my word to
you that the packet which you were lately
the bearer was designed for my hands by
george douglas 
 then said the page is george 
douglas
 a true friend to his queen roland
and will soon i trust have his eyes opened
to the errors his miscalled church
 but what is he to his father and what
to the lady lochleven who has been
vol ill c
 the abbot
as a mother to him said the page impatiently

 the best friend to both in time and
through eternity said the abbot if he
shall prove the happy instrument for redeeming
the evil they have wrought and
are still working
 still said the page i like not that
good service which begins in breach 
trust
i blame not thy scruples my son said
the abbot but the time which has wrenched
asunder the allegiance christians to
the church and subjects to their king
has dissolved all the lesser bonds society 
and in such days mere human ties must no
more restrain our progress than the brambles
and briars which catch hold his garments
should delay the path a pilgrim
who travels to pay his vows
but my father said the youth and
then stopped short in a hesitating manner
speak on my son said the abbot j
speak without fear
cc
the abbot 
 let me not offend you then said roland
 when i say that it is even this which
our adversaries charge against us that shaping
the means according to the we are
willing to commit great moral evil in order
that we may work out eventual good
 the heretics have played their usual
arts on you my son said the abbot they
would willingly deprive us the power
 acting wisely and secretly though their
possession superior force forbids our contending
with them on the terms equality
they have reduced us to a state exhausted
weakness and now would fain proscribe
the means by which weakness through
all the range nature supplies the lack
 strength and defends itself against its
potent enemies as well might the hound
say to the hare use not these wily turns to
escape me but contend with me in pitched
battle as the armed and powerful heretic
demand the down trodden and oppressed
catholic to lay aside the wisdom the serpent
by which alone they may again hope
 the abbot
to raise up the jerusalem over which the
weep and which it is their duty to rebuild
but more this hereafter and now
my son i command thee on thy faith to
tell me truly and particularly what has chanced
to thee since we parted and what is
the present state thy conscience thy
relation our sister magdalen is a woman
 excellent gifts blessed with a zeal which
neither doubt nor danger can quench but
yet it is not a zeal altogether according to
knowledge wherefore ray son i would
willingly be myself thy interrogator and thy
counsellor in these days darkness and
stratagem
with the respect which he owed to his
first instructor roland graeme went rapidly
through the events which the reader is
acquainted with and while he disguised
not from the prelate the impression which
had been made on his mind by the arguments
 the preacher henderson he accidentally
and almost involuntarily gave
his father confessor to understand the inthe
abbot 
fluence which catherine seyton had acquired
over his mind
it is with joy i discover my dearest
son replied the abbot that i have arrived
in time to arrest thee on the verge 
the precipice to which thou wert approaching
these doubts which you complain
are the weeds which naturally grow up ina
strong soil and require the careful hand
 the husbandman to eradicate them thou
must study a little volume which i will
impart to thee in fitting time in which by
our lady's grace i have placed in somewhat
a clearer light than heretofore the
points debated betwixt us and these heretics
who sow among the wheat the same
tares which were formerly privily mingled
with the good seed by the albigenses and
the dollars but it is not by reason alone
that you must hope to conquer these insinuations
 the enemy it is sometimes
by timely resistance but oftener by timely
flight you must shut your ears against
the arguments the heresiarch when circe
the abbot
substances permit you not to withdraw
the foot from his company anchor your
thoughts upon the service our lady
while he is expending in vain his heretical
sophistry are you unable to maintain
your attention on heavenly objects think
rather on thine own earthly pleasures than
tempt providence and the saints by giving
an attentive ear to the erring doctrine 
think thy hawk thy hound thine anglingrod
thy sword and buckler think even
 catherine seyton rather than give thy
soul to the lessons the tempter alas my
son believe not that worn out with woes
and bent more by affliction than by years
i have forgotten the effect beauty over
the heart youth even in the watches 
the night broken by thoughts an imprisoned
queen a distracted kingdom a church
laid waste and ruinous come other thoughts
than these suggest and feelings which belonged
to an earlier and happier course 
life be it so we must bear our load as
we may j and not in vain are these passions
the abbot 
implanted in our breast since as now in
thy case they may come in aid resolutions
founded upon higher grounds yet
beware my son this catherine seyton is
the daughter one scotland's proudest
as well as most worthy barons j and thy
state may not suffer thee as yet to aspire
so high but thus it is heaven works its
purposes through human folly and douglas's
ambitious affection as well as thine
shall contribute alike to the desired 
 how my father said the page my
suspicions are then true douglas loves 
 he does and with a love as much
misplaced as thine own j but beware him
cross him not thwart him not
let him not cross or thwart me said
the page for i will not yield him an
inch way had he in his body the soul 
every douglas that has lived since the time
 the dark grey man
nay have patience idle boy and re
fleet that your suit can never interfere with
his a truce with these vanities and let us
 the abbot
better employ the little space which it still
remains to us to spend together to thy
knees my son and resume the long interrupted
duty confession that happen
what may the hour may find in thee a faithful
catholic relieved from the guilt his
sins by authority the holy church could
i but tell thee roland the joy with which
i see thee once more put thy knee to its
best and fittest use quid dicis mi fill 
culpas easy answered the youth and
according to the ritual the catholic
church he confessed and received absolution
to which was annexed the condition
 performing certain enjoined penances
when this religious ceremony was ended
an old man in the dress a peasant 
the better order approached the arbour
and greeted the abbot i have waited
the conclusion your devotions he said
 to tell you the youth is sought after by
the chamberlain and it were well he were
to appear without delay holy saint francis
if the halberdiers were to seek him here
the abbot 
they might sorely wrong my gardenplot 
they are in office and reck not where they
tread were each step on jessamine and
clovecauliflowers
 we will speed him forth my brother
said the abbot but alas is it possible
that such trifles should live in your mind
at a crisis so awful as that which is now impending

 reverend father answered the proprietor
 the garden for such he was how
oft shall i pray you to keep your high counsel
for high minds like your own what
have you required me that i have not
granted unresisting though with a sore
heart r
 i would require you to be yourself
my brother said the abbot ambrosius 
 to remember what you were and to what
your early vows have bound you
i tell thee father ambrosius replied
the gardener the patience the best
saint that ever said paternoster would be
exhausted by the trials to which you have
c 
 the abbot
put mine what i have been it skills not
to speak at present no one knows better
than yourself father what i renounced
in hopes to find ease and quiet during the
remainder my days and no one better
knows how my retreat has been invaded
my fruittrees broken my flowerbeds
trodden down my quiet frightened away
and my very sleep driven from my bed
since ever this poor queen god bless
her hath been sent to lochleven i blame
her not j being a prisoner it is natural she
should wish to get out from so vile a hold
where there is scarce any place even for a
tolerable garden and where the watermists
as i am told blight all the early blossoms
 i say i cannot blame her for endeavouring
for her freedom but why i should be
drawn into the scheme why my harmless
arbours that i planted with my own hands
should become places privy conspiracy
why my little quay which i built for my
own fishing boat should have become a haven
for secret embarkations in short why
the abbot 
i should be dragged into matters where
both heading and hanging are like to bethe
issue i profess to you reverend father
i am totally ignorant
my brother answered the abbot
you are wise and ought to know
i am not i am not i am not wise
replied the horticulturist pettishly and
stopping his ears with his fingers i was
never called wise but when men wanted
to engage me in some action notorious
folly
 but my good brother said the abbots

 am not good neither said the gardener
 i am neither good nor wise had
i been wise you would not have been admitted
here and were i good methinks 
would send you elsewhere to hatch plots
for destroying the quiet the country
what signifies disputing about queen or
king when men may sit at peace sui uniira
viris sui and so would i do after the
precept holy writ were i as you term
 the abbot
me wise or good but such as i am my
neck is in the yoke and you make me draw
what weight you list follow me youngster
this reverend father who makes in his
jackman's dress nearly as reverend a figure
as i myself will agree with me in one thing
at least and that is that you have been
long enough here
 follow the good father roland said
the abbot and remember my words a
day is approaching that will try the temper
 all true scotsmen may thy heart prove
faithful as the steel thy blade 
the page bowed in silence and they parted
 the gardener notwithstanding his advanced
age walking on before him very
briskly and muttering as he went partly to
himself partly to his companion after the
manner old men weakened intellects 
 when i was great thus run his maundering
 and had my mule and my ambling
palfrey at command i warrant you
i could have as well flown through the
hair as have walked at this pace i had my
the abbot l
gout and my rheumatics and an hundred
things beside that hung fetters on my
heels and now thanks to our lady and
honest labour i can walk with any goodman
 my age in the kingdom fife 
fie upon it that experience should be so
long in coming
as he was thus muttering his eye fell
upon the branch a pear tree which drooped
down for want support and at once
forgetting his haste the old man stopped
and set seriously about binding it up roland
graeme had both readiness neatness
 hand and good nature in abundance 
he immediately lent his aid and in a minute
or two the bough was supported and
tied up in a way perfectly satisfactory to
the old man who looked at it with great
complaisance they are bargains he
said and if you will come ashore in
autumn you shall taste them the like
are not in lochleven castle the garden
there is a poor pinfold and the gardener
hugh oakham hath little skill his
 the abbot
craft come ashore master page in autumn
when you would eat pears but what
am i thinking ere that time come they
may have given thee sour pears for plums
take an old man's advice youth one who
hath seen many days and sat in higher
places than thou canst hope for bend thy
sword into a pruninghook and make a
dibble thy dagger thy days shall be the
longer and thy health the better for it and
come to aid me in my garden and i will
teach thee the real french fashion imp
whig which the southron call grafting do
this and do it without loss time for there
is a whirlwind coming over the land and
only those shall escape who lie too much beneath
the storm to have their boughs broken
by it
so saying he dismissed roland greene
through a door different from that by which
he had enteredjsigned a cross and pronounced
a benedicite as they parted and then
still muttering to himself retired into the
garden and locked the door on the inside
the abbot 
chapter iii
pray god she prove not masculine ere long 
king henry 
dismissed from the old man's garden roland
graeme found that a grassy paddock
in which sauntered two cows the property
 the gardener still separated him from
the village he paced through it lost in
meditation upon the words the abbot
father ambrosius had vith success enough
exerted over him that reverential influence
which the guardians and instructors our
childhood possess over our more mature
youth and yet when roland looked back
upon what the father had said he could
not but suspect that he had rather sought
to evade entering into the controversy beck
the abbot
twixt the churches than to repel the objections
and satisfy the doubts which the
lectures henderson had excited for
this he had no time said the page to
himself neither have i now calmness and
learning sufficient to judge upon points
 such magnitude besides it were base
to quit my faith while the wind fortune
sets against it unless i were so placed
that my conversion should it take place
were free as light from the imputation 
self interest i was bred a catholic bredin
the faith bruce and wallace i will
hold that faith till time and reason shall
convince me that it errs i will serve this
poor queen as a subject should serve an imprisoned
and wronged sovereign they wha
placed me in her service have to blame themselves
 they sent me hither a gentleman
trained in the paths loyalty and honour
when they should have sought out some
truckling cogging doubledealing knave
who would have been at once the observant
page the queen and the obsequious spy
the abbot 
 her enemies since i must chuse betwixt
aiding and betraying her i will decide
as becomes her servant and her subject
j but catherine seyton catherine
seyton beloved by douglas and holding
me on or off as the intervals her leisure
or caprice will permit how shall i deal
with the coquette by heaven when i
next have an opportunity she shall render
me some reason for her conduct or i will
break with her for ever
as he formed this doughty resolution he
crossed the stile which led out the little
enclosure and was almost immediately
greeted by dr luke lundin
ha my most excellent young friend
said the doctor from whence come you 
but i note the place yes neighbour
blinkhoolie's garden is a pleasant rendezvous
and you are the age when lads look
after a bonny lass with one eye and a dainty
plum with another but hey i you look
sub tri stand melancholic i fear the maiden
has proved cruel or the plums unripe j and
 the abbot
surely think neighbour blinkhoolie's damsons
can scarce have been well preserved
throughout the winter he spares the saccharine
juice on his confects but courage
man there are more rates in kinross and
for the immature fruit a glass my double
distilled aqua nirahilisprohattim est
the page darted an ireful glance at the
facetious physician but presently recollecting
that the name kate which had provoked
his displeasure was probably but introduced
for the sake alliteration he suppressed
his wrath and only asked if the
pains had been heard 
 why i have been seeking for you this
hour to tell you that the stuff is in your
boat and that the boat waits your pleasure
auchtermuchty had only fallen into company
with an idle knave like himself and a
stoup aquavitas between them your
boatmen lie on their oars and there have
already been made two wets from the warder's
turret to intimate that those in the
castle are impatient for your return yet
the abbot 
there is time for you to take a slight repast 
and as your friend and physician i hold it
unfit you should face the waterbreeze with
an empty stomach
roland graeme had nothing for it but to
return with such cheer as he might to the
place where his boat was moored on the
beach and resisted all offer refreshment
although the doctor promised that he should
prelude the collation with a gentle appe
tierra decoction herbs gathered and
distilled by himself indeed as roland had
not forgotten the contents his morning
cup it is possible that the recollection induced
him to stand firm in his refusal all
food to which such an unpalatable 
was to be annexed as they passed towards
the boat for the ceremonious politeness
 the worthy chamberlain would not
permit the page to go thither without attendance
roland graeme amidst a group who
seemed to be assembled around a party 
wandering musicians distinguished as he
 the abbot
thought the dress catherine seyton he
shook himself clear from his attendant and
at one spring was in the midst the crowd
and at the side the damsel catherine
he whispered is it well for you to
be still here will you not return to the
castle 
to the devil with your catherine and
your castles answered the maiden snappishly
 have you not had time enough already
to get rid your follies begone i
desire not your farther company and there
will be danger in thrusting it upon me
nay but if there be danger fairest
catherine replied roland why will you
not allow me to stay and share it with you 
intruding fool said the maiden the
danger is all on thine own side the risk
is in plain terms that i strike thee on the
mouth with the hilt my dagger so saying
she turned haughtily from him and
moved through the crowd who gave way
in some astonishment at the masculine acthe
abbot 
activity with which she forced her way among
them
as roland though much irritated prepared
to follow he was grappled on the
other side by doctor luke lundin who
reminded him the loaded boat the two
wets or signals with the flag which had
been made from the tower the danger 
the cold breeze to an empty stomach and
 the vanity spending more time upon
coy wenches and sour plums roland was
thus in a manner dragged back to his
boat and obliged to launch her forth upon
his return to lochleven castle
that little voyage was speedily accomplished
and the page was greeted at the
landingplace by the severe and caustic welcome
 old dryfesdale so young gallant
you are come at last after a delay 
six hours and after two signals from the
castle but i warrant some idle upsetting
had occupied you too deeply to think 
your service or your duty where is the
note the plate and household stuff 
 the abbot
pray heaven it hath not been diminished
under the sleeveless care so young a gadabout

 diminished under my care sir steward
 retorted the page angrily say soin
earnest and by heaven your grey hair
shall hardly protect your saucy tongue 
 a truce with your swaggering young
esquire returned the steward we have
bolts and dungeons for brawlers go to my
lady and swagger before her if thou darest
 she will give thee proper cause 
offence for she has waited thee long and
impatiently
 and where then is the lady lochleven
 said the page for i conceive it
is her thou speaks
 ay whom else replied clydesdale
 or who besides the lady lochleven
hath a right to command in this castle

the lady lochleven is thy mistress
said roland graeme i but mine is
the queen scotland
the abbot 
the steward looked at him fixedly for a
moment with an air in which suspicion and
dislike were ill concealed by an affectation
 contempt the bragging cockchicken
he said will betray himself by his hath
crowing i have marked thy changed manner
in the chapel late ay and your
changing glances at mealtime with a
certain idle damsel who like thyself laughs
at all gravity and goodness there is something
about you my master which should
be looked to but if you would know
whether heady lochleven or that other
lady hath right to command thy service
thou wilt find them together in the lady
mary's antiroom
roland hastened thither not unwilling to
escape from the illnatured penetration 
the old man and marvelling at the same time
what peculiarity could have occasioned the
lady lochleven's being in the queen's
apartment at this time the afternoon so
much contrary to her usual wont his
 the abbot
acuteness instantly penetrated the meaning
she wishes he concluded to see the
meeting betwixt the queen and me on my
return that she may form a guess whether
there is any private intelligence or understanding
betwixt us i must be guarded
with this resolution he entered the parlour
where the queen seated in her chair
with the lady fleming leaning upon the
back it had already kept the lady 
lochleven standing in her presence for the
space nearly an hour to the manifest increase
 her very visible bad humour roland
graeme on entering the apartment
made a deep obeisance to the queen and another
to the lady and then stood still as if to
await their further question speaking almost
together the lady lochleven said
 so young man you are returned at
length 
and then stopped indignantly short
while the queen went on without regarding
her roland you are welcome home
the abbot 
to us you have proved the true dove and
not the raven yet i am sure i could have
forgiven you if once dismissed from this
water circled ark ours you had never
again returned to us i trust you have
brought back an olive branch for our kind
and worthy hostess has chafed herself much
on account your long absence and we
never needed more some symbol peace
and reconciliation
 i grieve i should have been detained
madam answered the page but from the
delay the person entrusted with the matters
for which i was sent i did not receive
them till late in the day
 see you there now said the queen
to the lady lochleven we could not
persuade you our dearest hostess that your
household goods were in all safe keeping
and surety true it is that we can excuse
your anxiety considering that these august
apartments are so scantily furnished that
we have not been able to offer you even the
vol iii d
 the abbot
relief a stool during the long time you
have afforded us the pleasure your society

 the will madam said the lady
 the will to offer such accommodation was
more wanting than the means
 what said the queen looking round
and affecting surprise there are then
stools in this apartment one two no less
than four including the broken one a royal
garniture we observed them not will it
please your ladyship to sit 
 no madam i will soon relieve you 
my presence replied the lady lochleven 
 and while with you my aged limbs can
still better brook fatigue than my mind
stoop to accept constrained courtesy
 nay lady lochleven if you take
it so deeply said the queen rising and
motioning to her own vacant chair i
would rather you assumed my seat you
are not the first your family who has done
so

the abbot 
the lady lochleven curtsied a negative
but seemed with much difficulty to
suppress the angry answer which rose to her
lips
during this sharp conversation the page's
attention had been almost entirely occupied
by the entrance catherine seyton
who came from the inner apartment in the
usual dress in which she attended upon the
queen and with nothing in her manner
which marked either the hurry or confusion
incident to a hasty change disguise or
the conscious fear detection in a perilous
enterprize roland giseme ventured to
make her an obeisance as she entered but
she returned it with an air the utmost indifference
which in his opinion was extremely
inconsistent with the circumstances
in which they stood towards each other
surely he thought she cannot in reason
expect to bully me out the belief
due to mine own eyes as she tried to do
concerning the apparition in the hostelry 
saint michael's i will try if i cannot make
 the abbot
her feel that this will be but a vain task
and that confidence in me is the wiser and
safer course to pursue
thesethoughts had passed rapidly through
his mind when the queen having finished
her altercation with the lady the castle
again addressed him what the revels
at kinross roland grasme methought
they were gay if i may judge from some
faint sounds mirth and distant music
which found their way so far as these grated
windows and died when they entered them
as all that is mirthful must but thou lookest
as sad as if thou hadst come from a conventicle
 the huguenots 
and so perchance he hath madam
replied the lady lochleven at whom
this sideshaft was launched i trust amid
yonder idle fooleries there wanted not some
pouring forth doctrine to a better purpose
than that vain mirth which blazing
and vanishing like the crackling dry
thorns leaves to the fools who love it nothing
but dust and ashes
the abbot 
 mary fleming said the queen turning
round and drawing her mantle around
her i would that we had the chimneygrate
supplied with a faggot or two these
same thorns which the lady lochleven
describes so well methinks the damp air
from the lake which stagnates in these
vaulted rooms renders them deadly cold
your grace's pleasure shall be obeyed
said the lady lochleven yet may i
presume to remind you that we are now in
summer 
i thank you for the information my
good lady said the queen for prisoners
better learn their calendar from the mouth
 their jailor than from any change they
themselves feel in the seasons once more
roland grme what the revels 
 they were gay madam said the page
 but the usual sort and little worth your
highness's ear
 o you know not said the queen
how very indulgent my ear has become
s the abbot
to all that speaks freedom and the pleasures
 the free methinks i would rather
have seen the gay villagers dance their
ring round the maypole than have witnessed
the most stately masques within the
walls a palace the absence stonewalls
 the sense that the green turf is under
the foot which may tread it free and
unrestrained is worth all that art or splendour
can add to more courtly revels
i trust said the lady lochleven addressing
the page in her turn there were
amongst these follies none the riots or
disturbances to which they so naturally
lead 
roland gave a slight glance to catherine
seyton as if to bespeak her attention as he
replied i witnessed no offence madam
worthy marking none indeed any
kind save that a bold damsel made her hand
somewhat too familiar with the cheek a
playerman and ran some hazard being
ducked in the lake
the arbor 
as he uttered these words he cast a hasty
glance at catherine but she sustained with
the utmost serenity manner and countenance
the hint which he had deemed could
not have been thrown out before her without
exciting some fear and confusion
 i will cumber your grace no longer
with my presence said the lady cochlea
 unless you have aught to command
me
 nought our good hostess answered
the queen unless it be to pray you that
on another occasion you deem it not needful
to postpone your better employment to
wait so long upon us
 may it please you added the lady
lochleven to command this your gentleman
to attend us that may receive some
account these matters which have been
sent hither for your grace's use
we may not refuse what you are pleased
to require madam answered the queen
 go with the lady roland if our como
the abbot
hands be indeed necessary to thy doing so
we will hear tomorrow the history thy
kinross pleasures for this night we dismiss
thy attendance
roland graeme went with the lady 
lochleven who failed not to ask him many
questions concerning what had passed at
the sports to which he rendered such answers
as were most likely to lull asleep any
suspicions which she might entertain his
disposition to favour queen mary taking
especial care to avoid all allusion to the apparition
 magdalen graeme and the
abbot ambrosius at length after undergoing
a long and somewhat close examination
he was dismissed with such expressions
as coming from the reserved and
stern lady lochleven might seem to
express a degree favour and countenance
his first care was to obtain some refreshment
which was more cheerfully afforded
him by a goodnatured panther than by
dryfesdale who was on this occasion much
the abbot 
disposed to abide by the fashion 
house where
they who came not the first call
gat no more meat till the next meal
when roland graeme had finished his
repast having his dismissal from the queen
for the evening and being little inclined
for such society as the castle afforded he
stole into the garden in vhich he had permission
to spend his leisure time when it
pleased him in this place the ingenuity
 the contriver and disposer the walks
had exerted itself to make the most little
space and by screens both stone ornamented
with rude sculpture and hedges 
living green had endeavoured to give as
much intricacy and variety as the confined
limits the garden would admit
here the young man walked sadly considering
the events the day and comparing
what had dropped from the abbot
with what he had himself noticed the
demeanour george douglas it must
be so was the painful but inevitable con

 the abbot
elusion at which he arrived it must be
by his aid that she is thus enabled like a
phantom to transport herself from place
to place and to appear at pleasure on the
mainland or on the islet it must be so
he repeated once more j with him she
holds a close secret and intimate correspondence
altogether inconsistent with the
eye favour which she has sometimes
cast upon me and destructive to the hopes
which she must have known these glances
have necessarily inspired and yet for
love will hope where reason despairs the
thought rushed on his mind that it was possible
she only encouraged douglas's passion
so far as might serve her mistress's interest
and that she was too frank noble and
candid a nature to hold out to himself hopes
which she meant not to fulfil lost in these
various conjectures he seated himself upon
a bank turf which commanded a view
 the lake on the one side and on the other
 that front the castle amongst which the
queen's apartments were situated
the abbot 
the sun had now for some time set and
the twilight may was rapidly fading into
a serene night on the lake the expanded
water rose and fell with the slightest and
softest influence a southern breeze which
scarcely dimpled the surface over which it
passed in the distance was still seen the
dim outline the island saint serf once
visited by many a sandalled pilgrim as the
blessed spot trodden by a man god 
now neglected or violated as the refuge 
lazy priests who had with justice been compelled
to give place to the sheep and the
heifers a protestant baron
as roland gazed on the dark speck
amid the lighter blue the waters which
surrounded it the mazes polemical discussion
again stretched themselves before the
eye his mind had these men justly suffered
their exile as licentious drones the
robbers at once and disgrace the busy
hive or had the hand avarice and rapine
expelled from the temple not the 
the abbot
balls who polluted but the faithful priests
who served the shrine in honour and fidelity
i the arguments henderson in this
contemplative hour rose with double force
before him and could scarce be parried by
the appeal which the abbot ambrosius
had made from his understanding to his
feelings an appeal which he had felt more
forcibly amid the bustle stirring yit'e
than it now seemed to his more undisturbed
reflection it required an effort to
divert his mind from this embarrassing topic
 and he found that he best succeeded
by turning his eyes to the front the
tower watching where a twinkling light
still streamed from the casement catherine
seyton's apartment obscured by times
for a moment as the shadow the fair
inhabitant passed betwixt the taper and
the window at length the light was removed
or extinguished and that object 
speculation was also withdrawn from the
eyes the meditative lover dare i cones
the abbot 
fessthe fact without injuring his character
for ever as a hero romance these eyes
gradually became heavy speculative doubts
on the subject religious controversy and
anxious conjectures concerning the state 
his mistress's affections became confusedly
blended together in his musings the fatigues
 a busy day prevailed over the harassing
subjects contemplation which occupied
his mind and he fell fast asleep
sound were his slumbers until they were
suddenly dispelled by the iron tongue the
castle bell which sent its deep and sullen
sounds wide over the bosom the lake and
awakened the echoes bennarty the hill
which descends steeply on its southern bank
roland started up for this bell was always
tolled at ten o'clock as the signal for locking
the castle gates and placing the keys
under the charge the seneschal he therefore
hastened to the wicket by which the
garden communicated with the building
and had the mortification just as he reached
the abbot
ed it to hear the bolt leave its sheath with
a discordant crash and enter the stone
groove the doorjinteh
 hold hold cried the page and let
me in ere you lock the wicket
the voice dryfesdale replied from
within in his usual tone embittered sullenness
 the hour is passed fair master
you like not the inside these walls 
even make it a complete holiday and pass
the night as well as the day out bounds
open the door exclaimed the indignant
page or by saint giles i will make
thy gold chain smoke for it 
make no alarm here retorted the impenetrable
dryfesdale but keep thy sinful
oaths and silly threats for those that regard
them i do mine office and carry the
keys to the seneschal adieu my young
master the cool night air will advantage
your hot blood
the steward was right in what he said 
for the cooling breeze was very necessary
to appease the feverish fit anger which
the abbot 
roland experienced nor did the remedy
succeed for some time at length after
some hasty turns made through the garden
exhausting his passion in vain vows vengeance
roland graeme began to be sensible
that his situation ought rather to beheld
as matter laughter than serious
resentment to one bred a sportsman a
night spent in the open air had in it little
 hardship and the poor malice the
steward seemed more worthy his contempt
than his anger i would to god he
said that the grim old man may always have
contented himself with such sportive revenge
he often looks as he were capable
 doing us a darker turn returning therefore
to the turfseat which he had formerly
occupied and which was partially sheltered
by a trim fence green holly he drew his
mantle around him stretched himself at
length on the verdant settle and endeavoured
to resume that sleep which the 
had interrupted to so little purpose
sleep like other earthly blessings is nigh
the abbot
gard its favours when most courted the
more roland invoked her aid the further
she fled from his eyelids he had been
completely awakened first by the sounds 
the bell and then by his own aroused vivacity
 temper and he found it difficult
again to compose himself to slumber at
length when his mind was wearied out with
a maze unpleasing meditation he succeeded
in coaxing himself into a broken
slumber this was again dispelled by the
voices two persons who were walking
in the garden the sound whose conversation
after mingling for some time in
the page's dreams at length succeeded
in awaking him thoroughly he raised
himself from his reclining posture in the
utmost astonishment which the circumstance
 hearing two persons at that late
hour conversing on the outside the
watchfully guarded castle lochleyen
was so well calculated to excite his first
thought was upon supernatural beings his
next upon some attempt on the part 
the abbot 
queen mary's friends and followers his last
was that george douglas possessed 
the keys and having the means ingress
and egress at pleasure was availing himself
 his office to hold a rendezvous with catherine
seyton in the castle garden he
was confirmed in this opinion by the tone
 the voice which asked in a low whispers
whether all was ready
 the abbot
chapter 
la some breasts passion lies conceal'd and silent
like war's swart powder in a castlevault
until occasion like the linstock lights it 
then comes at once the lightning and the thunder 
and distant echoes tell that all is rent asunder
old play
roland grme availing himself a
breach in the holy screen and the assistance
 the full moon which was now
arisen had a perfect opportunity himself
unobserved to reconnoitre the persons and
the motions those by whom his rest had
been thus unexpectedly disturbed and his
observations confirmed his jealous apprehensions
they stood together in close and
earnest conversation within four yards 
the place his retreat and he could easily
recognize the tall form and deep voice 
the abbot 
douglas and the no less remarkable dress
and tone the page at the hostelry saint
michael's
 i have been at the door the page's
apartment said douglas but he is not
there or he will not answer it is fast bolted
on the inside as is the custom and we
cannot pass through it and what his silence
may bode i know not
you have trusted him too far said the
other a featherheaded coxcomb uxoris
whose changeable mind and hot brain there
is no making an abiding impression
it was not i who was willing to trust
him said douglas j but i was assured he
would prove friendly when called upon
for here he spoke so low that roland
lost the tenor his words which was the
more provoking as he was fully aware
that he was himself the subject their
conversation
nay replied the stranger more aloud
 i have on my side put him off with fail
 the abbot
words which make fools fain but now if
you distrust him at the push deal with him
with your dagger and so make open passage

 that were too rash said douglas 
and besides as i told you the door his
apartment is shut and bolted will essay
again to waken him
gramme instantly comprehended that the
ladies having been somehow made aware 
his being in the garden had secured the
door the outer room in which he usually
slept as a sort sentinel upon that only
access to the queen's apartments but then
how came catherine seyton to be abroad if
the queen and the other lady were still
within their chambers and the access to
them locked and bolted i will be instantly
at the bottom these mysteries
he said and then thank mrs catherine if
this be really she for the kind use which
she exhorted douglas to make his dagger
they seek me as i comprehend and they
shall not seek me in vain
the abbot 
douglas had by this time reentered the
castle by the wicket which was now open
the stranger stood alone in the garden walk
his arms folded on his breast and his eyes
cast impatiently up to the moon as if accusing
her betraying him by the magnificence
 her lustre in a moment roland
graeme stood before him a goodly
night he said mrs catherine for a
young lady to stray forth in disguise and
to meet with men in an orchard
 hush said the stranger page hush
thou foolish patch and tell us in a word
if thou art friend or foe
 how should i be friend to one who
deceives me by fair words and who would
have douglas deal with me with his poniard
 replied roland
the fiend receive george douglas
and thee too thou born madcap and sworn
marplot said the other we shall be discovered
and then death is the word
catherine said the page you have
dealt falsely and cruelly with me and the
 the abbot
moment explanation is now come neither
it nor you shall escape me
 madman said the stranger i am
neither kate nor catherine the moon
shines bright enough surely to know the
hart from the hind
that shift shall not serve you fair mistress
said the page laying hold on the lap
 the stranger's cloak this time at least
i will know with whom i deal
 unhand me said she endeavouring
to extricate herself from his grasp and in a 
tone where anger seemed to contend with
a desire to laugh use you so little discretion
towards a daughter seyton 
but as roland encouraged perhaps by
her risibility to suppose his violence was
not unpardonably offensive kept hold on
her mantle she said in a sterner tone 
vmraixed resentment madman let me
go there is life and death in this moment
i would not willingly hurt thee and yet
beware 
as she spoke she made a sudden effort
the abbot 
to escape and in doing so a pistol which
she carried in her hand or about her person
went off
this warhke sound instantly awakened
the well warded castle the warder blew
his horn and began to toll the castlebell
crying out at the same time fie treason 
treason cry all cry all 
the apparition catherine seyton
which the page had let loose in the first
moment astonishment vanished in darkness
but the plash oars was heard and
in a second or two five or six harquebusses
and a falconet were fired from the battlements
 the castle successively as if levelled
at some object on the water confounded
with these incidents no way for catherine's
protection supposing her to be in
the boat which he had heard put from the
shore occurred to roland save to have
recourse to george douglas he hastened
for this purpose towards the apartment
 the queen whence he heard loud
voices and much trampling feet when
 the abbot
he entered he found himself added to a
confused and astonished group which assembled
in that apartment stood gazing
upon each other at the upper the
room stood the queen equipped as for a
journey and attended not only by the lady
fleming but by the omnipresent catherine
seyton dressed in the habit her own sex
and bearing in her hand the casket in which
mary kept such jewels as she had been permitted
to retain at the other the
hall was the lady lochleven hastily
dressed as one startled from slumber by the
sudden alarm and surrounded by domestics
some bearing torches others holding naked
swords partizans pistols or such other
weapons as they had caught up in the hurry
 a night alarm betwixt these two parties
stood george douglas his arms folded
on his breast his eyes bent on the ground
like a criminal who knows not how to deny
yet continues unwilling to avow the
guilt in which he has been detected
the abbot 
 speak george douglas said the
lady lochleven speak and clear the
horrid suspicion which rests on thy name
say a douglas was never faithless to his
trust and i am a douglas say this my
dearest son and it is all i ask thee to say
to clear thy name even under such a foul
charge say it was but the wile these
unhappy women and this false boy which
plotted an escape so fatal to scotland so
destructive to thy father's house
 madam said old dryfesdale the steward
 this much do i say for this silly page
that he could not be accessary to unlocking
the doors since i myself this night bolted
him out the castle whoever limned
this nightpiece the lad's share in it seems
to have been small
thou lies dryfesdale said the lady
and wouldst throw the blame on thy master's
house to save the worthless life a
gipsey boy
his death were more desirable to me
vol iii e
 the abbot
than his life answered the steward sullenly
 but the truth is the truth
at these words douglas raised his head
drew up his figure to its full height and
spoke boldly and sedately as one whose resolution
was taken let no life be endangered
for me i alone
douglas said the queen interrupting
him art thou mad speak not i
charge you
 madam he replied bowing with the
deepest respect gladly would i obey your
commands but they must have a victim
and let it be the true one yes madam he
continued addressing the lady lochleven
 i alone am guilty in this matter if
the word a douglas has yet any weight
with you believe me that this boy is innocent
 and on your conscience i charge you
do him no wrong nor let the queen suffer
hardship for embracing the opportunity 
freedom which sincere loyalty which a
sentiment yet deeper offered to her acceptance
yes i had planned the escape
the abbot 
 the most beautiful the most persecuted
 women and far from regretting that i
for a while deceived the malice her enemies
i glory in it and am most willing to
yield up life itself in her cause
 now may god have comfort on my
age said the lady lochleven and
enable me to bear this load affliction o
princess born in a luckless hour when will
you cease to be the instrument seduction
and ruin to all who approach you 
o ancient house lochleven famed so
long for birth and honour evil was the hour
brought the deceiver under thy roof
 say not so madam replied her grandson
 the old honours the douglas line
will be outshone when one its descendants
dies for the most injured queens 
for the most lovely women
douglas said the queen must i at
this moment ay even at this moment
when i may lose a faithful subject for ever
chide thee for forgetting what is due to roe
as thy queen 
loo the abbot
wretched boy said the distracted
lady lochleven hast thou fallen even
thus far into the snare this moabitish
woman hast thou bartered thy name thy
allegiance thy knightly oath thy duty to
thy parents thy country and thy god fora
feigned tear or a sickly smile from lips
which flattered the infirm francis lured to
death the idiot darnley read luscious poetry
with the minion chastest mingled in
the lays love which were sung by the
beggar rizzio and which were joined in
rapture to those the foul and licentious
bothwell 
 blaspheme not madam said douglas 
nor you fair queen and virtuous as fair
chide at this moment the presumption 
thy vassal think not that the mere devotion
 a subject could have moved me to
the part i have been performing well you
deserve that each your lieges should die
for you but i have done more have done
that to which love alone could compel a
douglas i have dissembled farewell then
the abbot 
queen all hearts and empress that 
douglas when you are freed from this
vile bondage as freed you shall be if justice
remains in heaven and when you load
with honours and titles the happy man who
shall deliver you cast one thought on him
whose heart would have despised every reward
for a kiss your hand cast one
thought on his fidelity and drop one tear
on his grave and throwing himself at her
feet he seized her hand and pressed it to
his lips
this before my face said the lady 
lochlevenvwilt thou court thy adulterous
paramour before the eyes a parent tear
them asunder and put him under strict
ward seize him upon your lives she added
seeing that her attendants looked on
each other with hesitation
 they are doubtful said mary save
thyself douglas i command thee 
he started up from the floor and only
exclaiming my life or death are yours
 the abbot
and at your disposal drew his sword
and broke through those who stood betwixt
him and the door the enthusiasm his
onset was too sudden and too lively to have
been opposed by any thing short the
most decided opposition and as he was
both loved and feared by his father's vassals
none them would offer him actual injury
the lady lochleven stood astonished
at his sudden escape am i surrounded
she said by traitors upon him villains
pursue stab cut him down 
he cannot leave the island madam
said dryfesdale interfering i have the
key the boatchain
but two or three voices those who
pursued from curiosity or command their
mistress exclaimed from below that he had
cast himself into the lake
 brave douglas still exclaimed the
queen o true and noble heart that
prefers death to imprisonment 
 fire upon him said the lady lochthe
abbot 
leven if there be here a true servant 
his father let him shoot the runagate dead
and let the lake cover our shame 
the report a gun or two were heard
but they were probably shot rather to obey
the lady than with any purpose hitting
the mark and randal immediately entering
said that master george had been
taken up by a boat from the castle which
lay at a little distance
man a barge and pursue them said
the lady
 it were quite vain said randal by
this time they are half way to shore and a
cloud has come over the moon
 and has the traitor then escaped 
said the lady pressing her hands against
her forehead with a gesture despair 
the honour our house is for ever gone
and all will be deemed accomplices in this
base treachery
 lady lochleven said mary advancing
towards her you have this night cutoff
my fairest hopes you have turned my
 the abbot
expected freedom into bondage and dashed
away the cup joy in the very instant
i was advancing it to my lips and yet i
feel for your sorrow the pity that you deny
to mine gladly would i comfort you
if i might but as i may not i would at
least part from you in charity
 away proud woman said the lady 
 who ever knew so well as thou to deal
the deepest wounds under the pretence 
kindness and courtesy who since the
great traitor could ever so betray with a
kiss
lady douglas lochleven said the
queen in this moment thou canst not
offend me no not even by thy coarse
and unwomanly language held to me in
the presence menials and armed retainers
i have this night owed so much to
one member the house lochleven as
to cancel whatever its mistress can do or
say in the wildness her passion
we are bounden to you princess said
lady lochleven putting a strong constraint
the abbot 
on herself and passing from her tone violence
to that bitter irony ourpoorhouse
hath been but seldom graced with royal
smiles and will hardly with my choice exchange
their rough honesty for such courthonour
as mary scotland has now to
bestow
 they replied mary who knew so
well how to take may think themselves excused
from the obligation implied in receiving
and that i have now little to offer is
the fault the douglasseses and their allies
fear nothing madam replied the lady
 lochleven in the same bitter tone
 you retain an exchequer which neither
your own prodigality can drain nor your
offended country deprive you while you
have fair words and delusive smiles at command
you need no other bribes to lure
youth to folly
the queen cast a not ungratified glance
on a large mirror which hanging on one
side the apartment and illuminated by
the torchlight reflected her beautiful face
e 
 the abbot
and person our hostess grows complaisant
she said my fleming we had not
thought that grief and captivity had left us
so well stored with that sort wealth which
ladies prize most dearly
 your grace will drive this severe woman
frantic said fleming in a low tone
 on my knees i implore you to remember
she is already dreadfully offended and that
we are in her power
i will not spare her fleming answered
the queen it is against my nature
she returned my honest sympathy with insult
and abuse and i will gall her in return
if her words are too blunt for answer let
her use her poniard if she dare
the lady lochleven said the lady
fleming aloud would surely do well now
to withdraw and to leave her grace to repose

 ay replied the lady or to leave her
grace and her grace's minions to think
what silly fly they may next wrap their
meshes about my eldest son is a widower
the abbot 
were he not more worthy the flattering
hopes with which you have seduced his brother
 true the yoke marriage has been
already thrice fitted on but the church 
rome calls it a sacrament and its votaries
may deem it one in which they cannot too
often participate
 and the votaries the church geneva
replied mary colouring with indignation
 as they deem marriage no sacrament
are said at times to dispense with the
holy ceremony then as if afraid the
consequences this home allusion to the
errors lady lochleven's early life the
queen added come my fleming we
grace her too much by this altercation we
will to our sleeping apartment if she would
disturb us again tonight she must cause
the door to be forced so saying she retired
to her bedroom followed by her two
women
lady lochleven stunned as it were by
this last sarcasm and not the less deeply
incensed that she had drawn it upon heros
the abbot
self remained like a statue on the spatwhich
she had occupied when she received an
affront so flagrant dryfesdale and randal
endeavoured to rouse her to recollection
by questions
 what is your honourable ladyship's
pleasure in the premises 
shall we not double the sentinels and
place one upon the boats and another in
the garden said randal
 would you that dispatches were sent
to sir william at edinburgh to acquaint
him with what has happened demanded
dryfesdale and ought not the place 
kinross to be alarmed lest there be force
upon the shores the lake 
do all as thou wilt said the lady collecting
herself and about to depart thou
hast the name a good soldier dryfesdale
take all precautions sacred heaven that
i should be thus openly upbraided 
 would it be your pleasure said clydesdale
hesitating that this person this
lady be more severely restrained 
the abbot 
 no vassal answered the lady indignantly
 my revenge stoops not to such a
low gratification but i will have more
worthy vengeance or the tomb my ancestors
shall cover my shame
and you shall have it madam replied
dryfesdale ere two suns go down you
shall term yourself amply revenged
the lady made no answer perhaps did
not hear his words as she presently left the
apartment by the command dryfesdale
the rest the attendants were dismissed
some to do the duty guard others to
their repose the steward himself remained
after they had all departed and roland
grseme who was alone in the apartment
was surprised to see the old soldier advance
towards him with an air greater cordiality
than he had ever before assumed towards
him but which sat ill on his scowling features

 youth he said i have done thee
some wrong it is thine own fault for thy
behaviour hath seemed as light to me as
 the abbot
the feather thou dearest in thy hat and
surely thy fantastic apparel and idle humour
 mirth and folly have made me
construe thee something harshly but i
saw this night from my casement as i
looked out to see how thou hadst disposed
 thyself in the garden i saw i say the
true efforts which thou didst make to detain
the companion the perfidy him
who is no longer worthy to be called by
his father's name but must be cut oft from
his house like a rotten branch i was just
about to come to thy assistance when the
pistol went oft and the warder a false
knave whom i suspect to be bribed for the
nonce saw himself forced to give the alarm
which perchance till then he had wilfully
withheld to atone therefore for my injustice
towards you i would willingly render
you a courtesy if you would accept 
it from my hands
 may i first crave to know what it is
replied the page
simply to carry the news this discothe
abbot ill
very to holyrood where thou mayest do
thyself much grace as well with the earl
 morton and the regent himself as with
sir william douglas seeing thou hast seen
the matter from to and borne faithful
part therein the making thine own
fortune will be thus lodged in thine own
hand when i trust thou wilt estrange thyself
from foolish vanities and learn to walk
in this world as one who thinks upon the
next
 sir steward said roland graeme i
thank you for your courtesy but i may not
do your errand i pass that i am the
queen's sworn servant and may not be 
counsel against her but setting this apart
methinks it were a bad road to sir william
 lochleven's favour to be the first to tell
him his son's defection neither would
the regent be over well pleased to hear the
infidelity his vassal nor morton to learn
the falsehood his kinsman
um said the steward making that
inarticulate sound which expresses surprise
 the abbot
mingled with displeasure nay then even
fly where ye list for giddypated as ye maybe
you know how to bear you in the world
 i will shew you my system is less selfish
than ye think for said the page for
i hold truth and mirth to be better than
gravity and cunning ay and in the 
to be a match for them you never loved
me less sir steward than you do at this
moment i know you will give me no real
confidence and i am resolved to accept no
false protestations as current coin resume
your old course suspect me as much and
watch me as close as you will i bid you
defiance you have met with your match
 by heaven young man said the steward
with a look bitter malignity if
thou dearest to attempt any treachery towards
the house lochleven thy head
shall blacken in the sun from the warder's
turret i
 he cannot commit treachery who refuses
trust said the page and for my
head it stands as securely on mine own
the abbot 
shoulders as on any turret that ever mason
built
farewell thou prating and speckled
pie said dryfesdale that art so vain 
thine idle tongue and variegated coat beware
trap and limetwig
 and fare thee well thou hoarse old raven
answered the page thy solemn
flight sable hue and deep croak are no
charms against birdbolt or hailshot and
that thou mayest find it is open war betwixt
us each for the cause our mistress
and god shew the right 
amen and defend his own people 
said the steward i will let my mistress
know what addition thou hast made to this
mess traitors good night monsieur
featherpate
 good night seignior sowersby replied
the page and when the old man departed
he betook himself to rest
 the abbot
chapter v
poison'd ill fare dead forsooth cast off
king john
howsoever weary roland graeme might
be the castle lochleven however
much he might wish that the plan for mary's
escape had been perfected i question
if he ever awoke with more pleasing feelings
than on the morning after george douglas's
plan for accomplishing her deliverance
had been frustrated in the first place
he had the clearest conviction that he had
misunderstood the inuendo the abbot
and that the affections douglas were fixed
not on catherine seyton but on the
queen and in the second place from the
sort explanation which had taken place bethe
abbot 
twixt the steward and him he felt himself
at liberty without any breach honour towards
the family lochleven to contribute
his best aid to any scheme which should
in future be formed for the queen's escape 
and independently the good will which
he himself had to the enterprize he knew
he could find no surer road to the favour 
catherine seyton he now sought but an
opportunity to inform her that he had dedicated
himself to this task and fortune was
propitious in affording him one which was
unusually favourable
at the ordinary hour breakfast it was
introduced by the steward with the usual
forms who as soon as it was placed on the
board in the inner apartment said to roland
graeme with a glance sarcastic import
 i leave you my young sir to do
the office sewer it has been too long
rendered to the lady mary by one belonging
to the house douglas
 were it the prime and principal who
 the abbot
ever bore the name said roland the office
were an honour to him
the steward departed without replying to
this bravade otherwise than by a dark look
 scorn graeme thus left alone busied
himself as one engaged in a labour love
to imitate as well as he could the grace
and courtesy with which george douglas
was wont to render his ceremonial service
at meals to the queen scotland
there was more than youthful vanity 
there was a generous devotion in the feeling
with which he took up the task as a brave
soldier assumes the place a comrade who
has fallen in the front battle i am
now he said their only champion and
come weal come woe i will be to the best
 my skill and power as faithful as trustworthy
as brave as any douglas them
all could have been
at this moment catherine seyton entered
alone contrary to her custom and
not less contrary to her custom she enterthe
abbot 
ed with her kerchief at her eyes roland
graeme approached her with beating heart
and with downcast eyes and asked her in a
low and hesitating voiccjwhether the queen
were well 
can you suppose it said catherine 
 think you her heart and body are framed
 steel and iron to endure the cruel disappointment
 yester even and the infamous
taunts yonder puritanic hag 
would to god that i were a man to aid
her more effectually 
 if those who carry pistols and batons
and poniards said the page are not men
they are at least amazons and that is as formidable

 you are welcome to the flash your
wit sir replied the damsel i am neither
in spirits to enjoy or to reply to it
 well then said the page list to mein
all serious truth and first let me say
that the gear last night had been smoother
had you taken me into your counsels
 and so we meant but who could have
 the abbot
guessed that master page should chuse to
pass all night in the garden like some moonstricken
knight in a spanish romance instead
 being in his bedroom when douglas
came to hold communication with him
on our project 
 and why said the page defer to so
late a moment so important a confidence 
because your communications with
henderson and with pardon the natural
impetuosity and fickleness your disposition
made us dread to entrust you with a
secret such consequence till the last moment

 and why at the last moment said the
page offended at this frank avowal why
at that or any other moment since i had
the misfortune to incur so much suspicion

nay now you are angry again said
catherine and to serve you aright i
should break off this talk but i will be
magnanimous and answer your question
know then our reason for trusting you was
the abbot 
twofold in the first place we could scarce
avoid it since you slept in the room through
which we had to pass in the second
place
 nay said the page you may dispense
with a second reason when the first
makes your confidence in me a case necessity

good now hold thy peace said catherine
 in the second place as i said before
there is one foolish person among us
who believes that roland graeme's heart is
warm though his head is giddy that his
blood is pure though it boils too hastilyand
that his faith and honour are true as
the loadstar though his tongue sometimes
is far less than discreet
this avowal catherine repeated in a low
tone with her eyes fixed on the floor as if
she shunned the glance roland while
she suffered it to escape her lips and
this single friend exclaimed the youth in
rapture this only one who would do 
the abbot
time to the poor roland graeme and whose
own generous heart taught her to distinguish
between follies the brain and faults
 the heart will you not tell me dearest
catherine to whom i owe my most
grateful my most heartfelt thanks 
 nay said catherine with her eyes still
fixed on the ground if your own heart
tell you not
 dearest catherine said the page seizing
upon her hand and kneeling on one
knee
if your own heart i say tell you not
said catherine gently disengaging her hand
it is very ungrateful for since the maternal
kindness the lady fleming
the page started on his feet by heaven
catherine your tongue wears as many
disguises as your person but you only
mock me cruel girl you know the lady
fleming has no more regard for any one
than hath the forlorn princess who is wrought
into yonder piece old figured courttapestry

the abbot 
it may be so said catherine seyton
but you should not speak so loud
 pshaw answered the page but at the
same time lowering his voice she cares
for no one but herself and the queen and
you know besides there is no one you
whose opinion i value if i have not your
own no not that queen mary herself

 the more shame for you if it be so
said catherine with great composure
nay but fair catherine said the page
why will you thus damp my ardour when
i am devoting myself body and soul to the
cause your mistress 
 it is because in doing so said catherine
 you debase a cause so noble by naming
along with it any baser or more selfish
motive believe me she said with kindling
eyes and while the blood mantled on
her cheek they think vilely and falsely
 women i mean those who deserve
the name who deem that they love the
vol iii f
 the abbot
gratification their vanity or the mean
purpose engrossing a lover's admiration
and affection better than they love the virtue
and honour the man they may be
brought to prefer he that serves his religion
his prince and his country with ardour
and devotion need not plead his cause
with the commonplace rant romantic
passion the woman whom he honours with
his love becomes his debtor and her corresponding
affection is engaged to repay his
glorious toil
 you hold a glorious prize for such
toil said the youth bending his eyes on
her with enthusiasm
only a heart which knows how to value
it said catherine he that should
free this injured princess from these dungeons
and set her at freedom among her
free and warlike nobles whose hearts are
burning to welcome her where is the maiden
in scotland whdife the ove such a
hero would not honour were she sprung
from the blood royal the land and he
the abbot 
the offspring the poorest cottager that
ever held a plough 
i am determined said roland to
take the adventure tell me first however
fair catherine and speak it as if you were
confessing to the priest this poor queen
i know she is unhappy but catherine do
you hold her innocent she is accused 
murder
 do i hold the lamb guilty because it
is assailed by the wolf answered catherine
 do i hold yonder sun polluted because
an earthdamp sullies his beams 
the page sighed and looked down
would my conviction were as deep as
thine but one thing is clear that in this
captivity she hath wrong she rendered
herself up on a capitulation and the terms
have been refused her i will embrace her
quarrel to the death
 will you will you indeed said catherine
taking his hand in her turn o
be but firm in mind as thou art bold indeed
and quick in resolution j keep but
 the abbot
thy plighted faith and after ages shall honour
thee as the saviour scotland
 but when i have toiled successfully to
win that leah honour thou wilt not my
catherine said the page condemn me
to a new term service for that rachel
love 
 that said catherine again extricating
her hand from his grasp we shall
have full time to speak but honour is the
elder sister and must be won the first
i may not win her answered the page 
 but i will venture fairly for her and man
can do no more and know fair catherine
for you shall see the very secret thought
 my heart that not honour only not
only that other and fairer sister whom you
frown on me for so much as mentioning 
but the stern commands duty also compel
me to aid the queen's deliverance
indeed said catherine you were
wont to have doubts on that matter
 ay but her life was not then threatened
replied roland
the abbot 
and is it now more endangered than
heretofore asked catherine seyton in
anxious terror
 be not alarmed said the page but
you heard the terms on which your royal
mistress parted with the lady lochleven

 too well but too well said catherine
 alas that she cannot rule her
princely resentment and refrain from encounters
like these 
that hath passed betwixt them said
roland for which woman never forgives
woman i saw the lady's brow turn pale
and then black when before all the menzies
and in her moment power the
queen humbled her to the dust by taxing
her with her shame and i heard the oath
 deadly resentment and revenge which
she muttered in the ear one who by his
answer will i judge be but too ready an
executioner her will
 you terrify me said catherine
 the abbot
 do not so take it call up the masculine
part your spirit we will counteract
and defeat her plans be they dangerous
as they may why do you look upon me
thus and weep 
 alas said catherine because you
stand there before me a living and breathing
man in all the adventurous glow and
enterprize youth yet still possessing the
frolic spirits childhood there you stand
full alike generous enterprize and childish
recklessness and if today tomorrow
or some such brief space you lie a mangled
and lifeless corpse upon the floor these
hateful dungeons who but catherine seyton
will be the cause your brave and
gay career being broken short as you start
from the goal alas she whom you have
chosen to twine your wreath may too probably
have to work your shroud
 and be it so catherine said the page
in the full glow youthful enthusiasm 
 and do thou vork my shroud and if thou
the abbot 
grace it with such tears as fall now at the
thought it will honour my remains more
than an earl's mantle would my living body
but shame on this faintness heart the
time craves a firmer mood be a woman
catherine or rather be a man thou canst
be a man if thou wilt
catherine dried her tears and endeavoured
to smile
 you must not ask me she said about
that which so much disturbs your mind j
you shall know all in time nay you should
know all now but that hush here comes
the queen
mary entered from her apartment paler
than usual and apparently exhausted by a
sleepless night and by the painful thoughts
which had ill supplied the place repose j
yet the languor her looks was so far front
impairing her beauty that it only substituted
the frail delicacy the lovely woman
for the majestic grace the queen contrary
to her wont her toilette had been very
hastily dispatched and her hair which was
 the abbot
usually dressed by lady fleming with great
care escaping from beneath the headtire
which had been hastily adjusted fell in long
and luxuriant tresses nature's own curling
over a neck and bosom which were
somewhat less carefully veiled than usual
as she stepped over the threshold her
apartment catherine hastily drying her
tears ran to meet her royal mistress and
having first kneeled at her feet and kissed
her hand instantly rose and placing herself
on the other side the queen seemed
anxious to divide with the lady fleming
the honour supporting and assisting her
the page on his part advanced and put in
order the chair state which she usually
occupied and having placed the cushion
and footstool for her accommodation stepped
back and stood ready for service in
the place usually occupied by his predecessor
the young seneschal mary's eye
rested an instant on him and could not
but remark the change persons her's
was not the female heart which could rethe
abbot 
fuse compassion at least to a gallant youth
who had suffered in her cause although he
had been guided in his enterprize by a too
presumptuous passion and the words poor
douglas escaped from her lips perhaps
unconsciously as she leant herself back in
her chair and put the kerchief to her eyes
yes gracious madam said catherine
assuming a cheerful manner in order to
cheer her sovereign our gallant knight
is indeed banished the adventure was not
reserved for him but he has left behind him
a youthful esquire as much devoted to your
grace's service and who by me makes you
tender his hand and sword
if they may in aught avail your grace
said roland grasme bowing profoundly
 alas said the queen what needs
this catherine why prepare new victims
to be involved in and overwhelmed by my
cruel fortune were we not better cease to
struggle and ourselves sink in the tide without
further resistance than thus drag into
destruction with us every generous heart
f 
 the abbot
which makes an effort in our favour i
have had but too much plot and intrigue
around me since i was stretched an orphan
child in my very cradle while contending
nobles strove which should rule
in the name the unconscious innocent
surely time it were that all this busy and
most dangerous coil should let me
call my prison a convent and my seclusion
a voluntary sequestration myself from
the world and its ways
speak not thus madam before your
faithful servants said catherine to discourage
their zeal at once and to break
their hearts daughter kings be not in
this hour so unkingly come roland and
let us the youngest her followers shew
ourselves worthy her cause let us kneel
before her footstool and implore her to be
her own magnanimous self and leading
roland graeme to the queen's seat they
both kneeled down before her mary raised
herself in her chair and sat erect while
extending one hand to be kissed by the
the abbot
tn
page she arranged with the other the clustering
locks which shaded the bold yet
lovely bro w the highspirited catherine
s she often called her young attendant
 that you should thus desperately
mix with my unhappy fate the fortune 
your own young lives l are they not a lovely
couple my fleming and is it not heartrending
co think that i must be their ruin 
 not so said roland greene it is
we gracious sovereign who will be your
deliverers
 tex oritur parvulorump said the queen
looking upward if it is by the mouth 
these children that heaven calls me to resume
the stately thoughts which become
my birth and my rights thou wilt grant
them thy protection and to me the power
 rewarding their zeal then turning to
fleming she instantly added thou
knowest my friend whether to make those
who have served me happy was not ever
mary's favourite pastime when i have
 the abbot
been rebuked by the stern preachers the
calvinistic heresy when i have seen the
fierce countenances my nobles averted
from me has it not been because i mixed
in the harmless pleasures the young and
gay and rather for the sake their happiness
than my own have mingled in the
masque the song or the dance with the
youth my household well i repent
not it though knox termed it sin and
morton degradation i was happy because
i saw happiness around me and woe betide
the wretched jealousy that can extract guilt
out the overflowing an unguarded
gaiety fleming if we are restored to our
throne shall we not have one blithesome
day at a blithesome bridal which we must
now name neither the bride nor the bridegroom
 but that bridegroom shall have the
barony blairgowrie a fair gift even fora
queen to give and that bride's chaplet
shall be twined with the fairest pearls that
ever were found in the depths lochlomond
j and thou thyself mary fleming
the abbot 
the best dresser tires that ever busked the
tresses a queen and who would scorn to
touch those any woman lower rank
thou thyself shalt for my love twine them
into the bride's tresses look my fleming
suppose them such clustered locks
as those our catherine they would not
put shame upon thy skill
so saying she passed her hand fondly
over the head her youthful favourite
while her more aged attendant replied despondently
 alas madam your thoughts
stray far from home
 they do my fleming said the queen
 but is it well or kind in you to call them
back god knows they have kept theperch
this night but too closely come i will recal
the gay vision were it but to punish
them yes at that bhthesome bridal mary
herself shall forget the weight sorrows
and the toil state and herself once
more lead a measure at whose wedding
was it that we last danced my fleming
 think care has troubled my 
the abbot
more yet something it i should remember
 canst thou not aid me i know thou
canst
alas madam replied the lady 
what said mary wilt thou not help
us so far this is a peevish adherence to
thine own graver opinion which holds our
talk as folly but thou art courtbred and
wilt well understand me when i say the
queen commands lady fleming to tell her
where she led the last hranur
with a face deadly pale and a mien as
if she were about to sink into the earth the
courtbred dame no longer daring to refuse
obedience faultered out gracious lady
if my memory err not it was at a masque
in holyrood at the marriage sebastian

the unhappy queen who had hitherto
listened with a melancholy smile provoked
by the reluctance with which the lady
fleming brought out her story at this illfated
word interrupted her with a shriek so
wild and loud that the vaulted apartment
the abbot 
rang and both roland and catherine
sprung to their feet in the utmost terror
and alarm meantime mary seemed by
the train horrible ideas thus suddenly excited
surprised not only beyond selfcommand
but for the moment beyond the
verge reason
traitress she said to the lady fleming
 thou wouldst slay thy sovereign
call my french guards a moi a moi 
mes francis i am beset with traitors in
mine own palace they have murdered my
husband rescue rescue for the queen
 scotland she started up from her
chair her features late so exquisitely lovely
in their paleness now inflamed with the
fury frenzy and resembling those a
bellona we will take the field ourself
she said warn the city warn lothian
and fife saddle our spanish barb and bid
french paris see ouv petronel be charged
better to die at the head our brave
scotsmen like our grandfather at flodden
 the abbot
than a broken heart like our ill starred
father
 be patient be composed dearest sovereign
said catherine and then addressing
lady fleming angrily she added how
could you say aught that reminded her 
her husband 
the word reached the ear the unhappy
princess who caught it up speaking with
great rapidity husband what husband
 not his most christian majesty he
is ill at ease he cannot mount on horseback
 not him the lennox but it was
the puke orkney thou wouldst say
for god's love madam be patient 
said the lady fleming
but the queen's excited imagination could
by no entreaty be diverted from its course
 bid him come hither to our aid she said
 and bring with him his lambs as he calls
them bowton hay tall black armis
ton and his kinsman hob fie how swart
they are and how they smell sulphur
the abbot 
what closeted with morton nay if the
douglas and the hepburn hatch the complot
together the bird when it breaks the
shell will scare scotland will it not ray
fleming 
 she grows wilder and wilder said fleming
 we have too many hearers for these
strange words
 roland said catherine in the name
 god before you cannot aid us here 
leave us to deal with her alone away 
away 
she thrust him to the door the antiroom
 yet even when he had entered that
apartment and shut the door he could still
hear the queen talk in a loud and determined
tone as if giving forth orders until at
length the voice died away in a feeble and
continued lamentation
at this crisis catherine entered the antiroom
 be not too anxious she said the
crisis is now over but keep the door fast
let no one enter until she is more coiu
posed
 the abbot
 in the name god what does this
mean said the page or what was therein
the lady fleming's words to excite so
wild a transport 
o the lady fleming the lady fleming
said catherine repeating the words
impatiently the lady fleming is a fool 
she loves her mistress yet knows so little
how to express her love that were the queen
to ask her for very poison she would deem
it a point duty not to resist her commands
i could have torn her starched headtire
from her formal head the queen
should have as soon had the heart out 
my body as the word sebastian out my
lipsthat that piece weaved tapestry
should be a woman and yet not have wit
enough to tell a lie 
and what was this story sebastian 
said the page by heaven catherine you
are all riddles alike
you are as great a fool as fleming returned
the impatient maiden know ye
not that on the night henry darnley's
the abbot 
murder and at the blowing up the kirk
 field the queen's absence was owing to
her attending on a masque at holyrood
given by her to grace the marriage this
same sebastian who himself a favoured
servant married one her female attendants
who was near to her person 
by saint giles said the page i wonder
not at her passion but only marvel by
what forgetful ness it was that she could
urge the lady fleming with such a question

i cannot account for it said catherine
 but it seems as if great and violent
grief or horror sometimes obscure the memory
and spread a cloud like that an
exploding cannon over the circumstances
with which they are accompanied but i
may not stay here where came not to moralize
with your wisdom but simply to cool
my resentment against that unwise lady
fleming which i think hath now somewhat
abated so that i shall endure her presence
 the abbot
without any desire to damage either her
curch or pasquin meanwhile keep fast
that door would not for my life that any
 these heretics saw her in the unhappy
state which brought on her as it has
been by the success their own diabolical
plotting they would not stick to call in
their snuffling cant the judgment providence

she left the apartment just as the latch
 the outward door was raised from without
but the bolt which roland had drawn
on the inside resisted the efforts the person
desirous to enter who is there 
said graeme aloud
it is i replied the harsh and yet slow
voice the steward dryfesdale
you cannot enter now returned the
youth
 and wherefore demanded clydesdale
 seeing i come but to do my duty
and enquire what mean the shrieks from
the apartments the moabitish lady wherethe
abbot 
fore i say since such is mine errand can
i not enter 
simply replied the youth because
the bolt is drawn and i have no fancy to
undo it i have the right side the door
today as you had last night
thou art illadvised thou malapert
boy replied the steward to speak to mein
such fashion but shall inform my lady
 thine insolence
 the insolence said the page is
meant for thee only in fair guerdon thy
constant discourtesy to me for thy lady's
information i have answer more courteous
you may say that the queen is ill at ease
and desires to be disturbed neither by visits
nor messages
 i conjure you in the name god
said the old man with more solemnity in
his tone than he had hitherto used to let
me know if her malady really gains power
on her 
 she will have no aid at your hand or
at your ladywhereforebegone and 
the abbot
bie us no more we neither want nor will
accept aid at your hands
with this positive reply the steward
grumbling and dissatisfied returned downstairs

it is the curse kings to be attended
by slaves who take their humours for a warrant
to break into the bloody house life
and on the winking authority
to understand a law
kitiff john
the lady lochleven sat alone in her
chamber endeavouring with sincere but
imperfect zeal to fix her eyes and her attention
on the blacklettered bible which
lay before her bound in velvet and embroidery
and adorned with massive silver
clasps and knosps but she found her utmost
efforts unable to withdraw her mind
from the resentful recollection what had
last night passed betwixt her and the queen
in which the latter had with such bitter
taunt reminded her her early and longrepented
transgression
 the abbot
why she said should i resent so deeply
that another reproaches me with that which
have never ceased to make matter blushing
to myself and yet why should this
woman who reaps at least has reaped the
fruits my folly and has jostled my son
aside from the throne why should she in
the face all my domestics and her
own dare to upbraid me with my shame
and folly is she not in my power does
she not fear me ha wily tempter i will
wrestle with thee strongly and with better
suggestions than my own evil heart can
supply
she again took up the sacred volume and
was endeavouring to fix her attention on its
contents when she was disturbed by a tap
at the door the room it opened at her
command and the steward dryfesdale entered
and stood before her with a gloomy
and perturbed expression on his brow
 what has chanced dryfesdale that thou
loosest thus said his mistress have
the abbot 
there been evil tidings my son or mj
grandchildren 
no lady replied dryfesdale but
you were deeply insulted last night and i
fear me thou art as deeply avenged this
morning where is the chaplain 
what mean you by hints so dark and
a question so sudden the chaplain as
you well know is absent at perth upon an
assembly the brethren
i care not answered the steward he
is but a priest baal
dryfesdale said the lady sternly
 what meanest thou i have ever heard
that in the low countries thou didst herd
with the anabaptist preachers those boars
which tear up the vintage but the ministry
which suits me and my house must
content my retainers
i would i had good ghostly counsel
though replied the steward not attending
tohismistres's rebuke and seeming speak
to himself this woman moab 
vol iii g
 the abbot
speak her with reverence said the
lady she is a king's daughter
 ee it so replied dryfesdale she
goes where there is little difference betwixt
her and a beggar's child mary scotland
is dying
dying and in my castle said the lady
starting up in alarm what disease or
by what accident
bear patience lady the ministry was
mme
 thine villain and traitor i how didst
thou dare 
i heard you insulted lady i heard you
demand vengeance i promised it you and
i now bring tidings it
 dryfesdale i trust thou rarest said
the lady
i rave not replied the steward that
which was written me a million years
ere i saw the light must be executed by
me she hath that in her veins that i fear
me will soon stop the springs life
the abbot 
cruel villain exclaimed the lady
 thou hast not poisoned her 
and if i had said dryfesdale what
does it so greatly merit men bane vermin
why not rid them their enemies so 
in italy they will do it for a cruizuedor
cowardly ruffian begone from my
sight 
think better my zeal lady said the
steward and judge not without looking
around you lindsay ruthven and your
kinsman morton poniard rizzio and yet
you now see no blood on their embroidery
the lord semple stabbed the lord 
farquhar does his bonnet sit a jot more
awry on his brow what noble lives in scotland
who has nothad a share for policy or revenge
in some such dealing and who imputes
it to them be not cheated with names
a dagger or a draught work to the same
 and are little unlike a glass phial imprisons
the one and a leathern sheath the
other one deals with the brain the other
 the abbot
sluices the blood yet say not i gave
aught to this lady
 what dost thou mean by thus dallying
with me said the lady as thou wouldst
gave thy neck from the rope it merits tell
me the whole truth this story thou hast
long been known a dangerous man
ay in my master's service i can be
cold and sharp as my sword be it known
to you that when last on shore i consulted
with a woman skill and power called
nicneven whom the country has rung
for this some brief time past fools asked
her for charms to make them beloved misers
for means to increase their store some
demanded to know the future an idle wish
since it cannot be altered others would
have an explanation the past idler still
since it cannot be recalled i heard their
queries with scorn and demanded the means
 avenging myself a deadly enemy for
i grow old and may trust no longer to bilboa
blade she gave me a packet mix
the abbot 
that said she with any liquid and thy vengeance
is complete
 villain and you mixed it with the
food this imprisoned lady to the dishonour
 thy master's house 
 to redeem the insulted honour my
master's house i mixed the contents the
packet with the jar succory water they
seldom fail to drain it and the woman loves
it over all
 it was a work hell said the lady
lochleven both the asking and the granting
 away wretched man let us see if aid
be yet too late 
they will not admit us madam save
we enter by force i have been twice at
the door but can obtain no entrance
 we will beat it level with the ground
if needful and hold summon randal
hither instantly randal here is a foul
and evil chance befallen send off a boat
instantly to kinross the chamberlain luke
lund in is said to have skill fetch too
 the abbot
that foul witch nicneven she shall first
counteract her own spell and then be burned
to ashes in the island saint serf
away away tell them to hoist sail and
ply oar as ever they would have good 
the douglas's hand
 mother nicneven will not be lightly
found or fetched hither on these conditions
answered dryfesdale
 then grant her full assurance safety
 look to it for thine own life must answer
for this lady's recovery
 i might have guessed that said clydesdale
sullenly j but it is my comfort i
have avenged mine own cause as well as
yours she hath scoffed and stripped at
me and encouraged her saucy minion 
a page to ridicule my stiff gait and slow
speech i felt it borne in upon me that i
was to be avenged on them
go to the western turret said the
lady and remain there in ward until we
see how this gear will terminate i know
the abbot 
thy resolved disposition thou wilt not attempt
escape
not were the walls the turret eggshells
and the lake sheeted with ice said
dryfesdale i am well taught and strong
in belief that man does nought himself 
he is but the foam on the billow which
rises bubbles and bursts not by its own
effort but by the mightier impulse fate
which urges him yet lady if i may advise
amid this zeal for the life the jezebel
 scotland forget not what is due to
thine own honour and keep the matter secret
as you may
so saying the gloomy fatalist turned from
her and stalked off vith sullen composure
to the place confinement allotted to him
his lady caught at his last hint and only
expressed her fear that the prisoner had
partaken some unwholesome food and
was dangerously ill the castle was soon
alarmed and in confusion randal was dispatched
to the shore to fetch off lundin
 the abbot
with such remedies as could counteract
poison and with farther instructions to
bring mother nineveh if she could be
found with fall power to pledge the lady
 lochleven's word for her safety
meanwhile the lady lochleven herself
held parley at the door the queen's
apartment and in vain urged the page to
undo it
 foolish boy she said thine own
life and thy lady's are at stake open i
say or we will cause the door to be broken
down
i may not open the door without my
royal mistress's orders answered roland j
she has been very ill and now she 
you wake her by using violence
let the consequence be on you and your
followers
was ever woman in a strait so fearful 
said the lady lochleven at least
thou rash boy beware that no one tastes
the food but especially the jar succorywater

the abbot 
she then hastened to the turret where
dryfesdale had composedly resigned himself
to imprisonment she found him reading
and demanded him was thy fell
potion speedy operation 
slow answered the steward the
hag asked me which i chose i told her i
loved a slow and sure revenge revenge
said i is the highestflavoured draught
which man tastes upon earth and he should
sip it by little and little not drain it up
greedily at once
 against whom unhappy man couldst
thou nourish so fell a revenge 
 i had many objects but the chief was
that insolent page
 the boy thou inhuman man exclaimed
the lady what could he do to
deserve thy malice 
 he rose in your favour and you graced
him with your commissions that was
one thing he rose in that george douglas's
also that was another he was the
g 
 the abbot
favourite the calvinistic henderson who
hated me because my spirit disowns a separated
priesthood the moabitish queen
held him dear winds from each opposing
point blew in his favour the old servitor
 your house was held lightly among ye 
above all from the first time i saw his face
i longed to destroy him
 what fiend have i nurtured in my
house replied the lady may god forgive
me the sin having given thee food
and raiment 
you might not chuse lady answered
the steward long ere this castle was
builded ay long ere the islet which sustains
it reared its head above the blue water
i was destined to be your faithful slave
and you to be my ungrateful mistress remember
you not when i plunged amid the
victorious french in the time this lady's
mother and brought offyour husband when
those who had hung at the same breasts
with him dared not attempt the rescue 
the abbot 
remember how i plunged into the lake
when your grandson's skiff was overtaken
by the tempest boarded and steered her
safe to the land lady the servant a
scottish baron is he who regards not his
own life or that any other save his master
and for the death the woman i
had tried the potion on her sooner had not
master george been her taster her death
would it not be the happiest news that
scotland ever heard is she not the
bloody russian stock whose sword was so
often red with the blood gods saints 
is she not the daughter the wretched tyrant
james whom heaven cast down from
his kingdom and his pride even as the king
 babylon was smitten 
peace villain said the lady a thousand
varied recollections thronging on her
mind at the mention her royal lover's
name peace and disturb not the ashes
 the dead the royal the unhappy
dead read thy bible and may god grant
thee to avail thyself better its contents
 the abbot
than thou hast yet done she departed
hastily and as she reached the next apartment
the tears rose to her eyes so hastily
that she was compelled to stop and use her
kerchief to dry them i expected not this
she said no more than to have drawn water
from the dry flint or sap from a withered
tree i saw with a dry eye the apostacy
and shame george douglas the hope 
my son's house the child my love j and
yet i now weep for him who has so long
lain in his grave for him to whom i owe
it that his daughter can make a scoffing ancf
a jest my name but she is ms daughter
my heart hardened against her for so
many causes relents when a glance her
eye places her father unexpectedly before
me and as often her likeness to that true
daughter the house guise her detested
mother has again confirmed my resolution
but she must not must not die in my
house and by so foul a practice thank
god the operation the potion is slow
and may be counteracted i will to her
the abbot 
apartment once more but o that hardened
villain whose fidelity we held in such
esteem and had such high proof what
miracle can unite so much wickedness and
so much truth in one bosom 
the lady lochleven was not aware
how far minds a certain gloomy and determined
cast by nature may be warped by
a keen sense petty injuries and insult
combining with the love gain and sense
 selfinterest and amalgamated with the
crude wild and undigested fanatical opinions
which this man had gathered among
the crazy sectaries germany or how far
the doctrines fatalism which he had embraced
so decidedly sear the human conscience
by representing our actions as the
result inevitable necessity
during her visit to the prisoner roland
had communicated to catherine the tenor
 the conversation he had had with her at
the door the apartment the quick intelligence
 that lively maiden instantly
comprehended the outline what was bets
the abbot
lived to have happened but her prejudices
hurried her beyond the truth
they meant to have poisoned us she
exclaimed in horror and there stands the
fatal liquor which should have done the
deed ay as soon as douglas ceased to be
our taster our food was like to be fatally
seasoned thou roland who shouldst have
made the essay wert readily doomed to die
with us o dearest lady fleming pardon
pardon for the injuries i said to you
in my anger your words were prompted
by heaven to save our lives and especially
that the injured queen but what have
we now to do that old crocodile the
lake will be presently back to shed her hypocritical
tears over our dying agonies 
lady fleming what shall we do 
our lady help us in our need i she
replied how should i tell unless we
were to make our plaint to the regent
make our plaint to the devil said catherine
impatiently and accuse his dam
at the foot his burning throne the queen
the abbot 
still sleeps we must gain time the poisoning
hag must not know her scheme has
miscarried the old envenomed spider has
but too many ways mending her broken
web the jar succory water said she
roland if thou best a man help me 
empty the jar on the chimney or from the
window make such waste among the viands
as if we had made our usual meal and
leave the fragments on cup and porringer
but taste nothing as thou lowest thy life i
will sit by the queen and tell her at her
waking in what a fearful pass we stand
her sharp wit and ready spirit will teach
us what is best to be done meanwhile till
farther notice observe roland that the
queen is in a state torpor that lady
fleming is indisposed that character
speaking in a lower tone will suit her best
and save her wits some labour in vain i
am not so much indisposed thou understands

and i said the page
 the abbot
 you replied catherine you are
quite well who thinks it worth while to
poison puppydogs or pages
 does this levity become the time 
said the page
 it does it does answered catherine
seyton if the queen approves i see
plainly how this disconcerted attempt may
do us good service
she went to work while she spoke eagerly
assisted by roland the breakfast table
soon displayed the appearance as if the ladies
had eaten their meal as usual and the
ladies retired as softly as possible into the
queen's sleeping apartment at a new
summons the lady lochleven the page
undid the door and admitted her into the
antiroom asking her pardon for having
withstood her alleging in excuse that the
queen had fallen into a heavy slumber since
she had broken her fast
she has eaten and drunken then said
the lady lochleven
the abbot ll
surely replied the page according to
her grace's ordinary custom unless upon
the fasts the church
the jar she said hastily examining
it it is empty drank the lady mary the
whole this water 
a large part madam and i heard the
lady catherine seyton jestingly upbraid
the lady mary fleming with having taken
more than a just share what remained
so that but little fell to her own lot
and are they well in health said the
lady lochleven
lady fleming said the page complains
 lethargy and looks duller than
usual and the lady catherine seyton
feels her head somewhat more giddy than
is her wont
he raised his voice a little as he said
these words to apprize the ladies the
part assigned to each them and not perhaps
without the wish conveying to the
ears catherine the pagelike jest which
lurked in the allotment
 the abbot
 i will enter the queen's chamber said
the lady lochleven my business is express

as she advanced to the door the voice
 catherine seyton was heard from within
 no one can enter here the queen
sleeps
 i will not be controuled young lady
replied the lady lochleven there is
i wot no inner bar and i will enter in
your despite
 there is indeed no inner bar answered
catherine firmly but there are the
staples where that bar should be and into
those staples have i thrust mine arm like
an ancestress your own when better
employed than the douglasseses our days
she thus defended the bedchamber her
sovereign against murderers try your
force then and see whether a seyton cannot
rival in courage a maiden the house
 douglas
i dare not attempt the pass at such
risk said the lady lochleven strange
the abbot 
that this princess with all that justly attaches
to her as blameworthy should preserve
such empire over the minds her
attendants damsel i give thee my honour
that i come for the queen's safety
and advantage awaken her if thou lowest
her and pray her leave that i may enter
i will retire from the door the whilst
 thou wilt not awaken the queen
said the lady fleming
 what choice have we said the readywitted
maiden unless you deem it better
to wait till the lady lochleven herself plays
lady the bedchamber her fit patience
will not last long and the queen
must be prepared to meet her
but thou wilt bring back her grace's
fit by thus disturbing her
 heaven forbid i replied catherine j
but if so it must pass for an effect the
poison hope better things and that the
queen will be able when she wakes to form
her own judgment in this terrible crisis
meanwhile do thou dear lady fleming
 the abbot
practise to look as dull and heavy as the
alertness thy spirit will permit
catherine kneeled by the side the
queen's bed and kissing her hand repeatedly
succeeded at last in awakening without
alarming her she seemed surprised to find
that she was ready dressed but sate up in
her bed and appeared so perfectly composed
that catherine seyton without farther
preamble judged it safe to inform her 
the predicament in which they were placed
mary turned pale and crossed herself again
and again when she heard the imminent
danger in which she had stood but like
the ulysses horner
hardly waking yet
sprung in her mind the momentary wit
and she at once understood her situation
with the dangers and advantages that attended
it
 we cannot do better she said after
her hasty conference with catherine press
the abbot lacing
her at the same time to her bosom and
kissing her forehead we cannot do better
than to follow the scheme so happily
devised by thy quick wit and bold affection
undo the door to the lady lochleven 
she shall meet her match in art though not
in perfidy fleming draw close the curtain
and get thee behind it thou art a
better tirewoman than an actress but do
but breathe heavily and if thou wilt groan
slightly and it will top thy part hark 
they come now catherine medicis
may thy spirit inspire me for a cold northern
brain is too blunt for this scene 
ushered by catherine seyton and stepping
as light as she could the lady lochleven
was ushered into the twilight apartment
and conducted to the side the
couch where mary pallid and exhausted
from a sleepless night and the subsequent
agitation the morning lay extended so
listlessly as might well confirm the worst
fears her hostess
 the abbot
now god forgive us our sins said
the lady lochleven forgettingherpride
and throwing herself on her knees by the
side the bed it is too true she is
murdered
 who is in the chamber said mary
as if awaking from a heavy sleep j seyton
fleming where are you i heard a strange
voice who waits call ourselves
alas her memory is at holyrood
though her body is at lochleven forgive
madam continued the lady if i
call your attention to me i am margaret
erskine the house mar by marriage
lady douglas lochleven
 o our gentle hostess answered the
queen who hath such care our lodgings
and our diet we cumber you too
much and too long good lady lochleven
 but we now trust your task hospitality
is well nigh ended
her words go like a knife through my
heart said the lady lochleven with
the abbot 
a breaking heart i pray your grace to tell
me what is your ailment that aid may be
had if there be yet time 
 nay my ailment replied the queen
is nothing nothing worth telling or
worth a leech's notice my limbs feel heavy
my heart feels cold a prisoner's limbs
and heart are rarely otherwise fresh air
methinks and freedom would soon revive
me but as the estates have ordered it
death alone can break my prisondoors
 were it possible madam said the lady
 that your liberty could restore your
perfect health i would myself encounter
the resentment the regent my son
sir william my whole friends rather
than you should meet your fate in this
castle
 alas madam said the lady fleming
who conceived the time propitious to shew
that her own address had been held too
lightly it is but trying what good freedom
may work upon us for myself i think
 the abbot
a free walk on the greensward would dome
much good at heart
the lady lochleven rose from the
bedside and darted a penetrating look at
the elder valetudinary are you so evildisposed
lady fleming
evildisposed indeed madam replied
the court dame and more especially since
breakfast
 help help exclaimed catherine
anxious to break off a conversation which
boded her schemes no good help i
say help the queen is about to pass away
aid her lady lochleven if you be a woman

the lady hastened to support the queen's
head who turning her eyes towards her
with an air great languor exclaimed
thanks my dearest lady lochleven 
notwithstanding some passages late i
have never misconstrued or misdoubt
your affection to our house it was proved
as i have heard before i was born
the abbot g
the lady lochleven sprung from the
floor on which she had again knelt and having
paced the apartment in great disorder
flung open the lattice as if to get air
 now our lady forgive me said catherine
to herself how deep must the
love sarcasm be implanted in the breasts
 us women since the queen with all her
sense will risk ruin rather than rein in her
wit she then adventured stooping over
the queen's person to press her arm with
her hand saying at the same time for
god's sake madam restrain yourself
thou art too forward maiden said
the queen but immediately added in a
low whisper forgive me catherine but
when i felt the hag's murderous handsbusy
about my head and neck i felt such disgust
and hatred that i must have said something
or died but i will be schooled to better
saviour only see that thou let her not
touch me
 now god be praised said the lady
vol iii h
 the abbot
lochleven withdrawing her head from the
window the boat comes as fast as sail and
oar can send wood through water it brings
the leech and a female certainly from the
appearance the very person i was in quest
 were she but well out this castle
with our honour safe i would that she were
on the top the wildest mountain in norway
or i would i had been there myself
ere i had undertaken this trust
while she thus expressed herself standing
apart at one window roland gramme
from the other watched the boat bursting
through the waters the lake which glided
from its side in ripple and in foam he
too became sensible that at the stern was
seated the medical chamberlain clad in his
black velvet cloak and that his own relative
magdalen graeme in her assumed character
 mother nicneven stood in the bow
her hands clasped together and pointed towards
the castle and her attitude even at
that distance expressing enthusiastic eagerness
to arrive at the landingplace they
the abbot 
arrived there accordingly and while the
supposed witch was detained in a room beneath
the physician was ushered to the
queen's apartment which he entered withall
due professional solemnity catherine
had in the meanwhile fallen back from the
queen's bed and taken an opportunity to
whisper to roland methinks from the
information the threadbare velvet cloak
and the solemn beard there would be little
trouble in haltering yonder ass but thy
grandmother roland thy grandmother's
zeal will ruin us if she get not a hint to dissemble

roland without reply glided toward the
door the apartment crossed the parlour
and safely entered the antichamber but
when he attempted to pass farther the word
back back echoed from one to the other
by two men armed with carabines convinced
him that the lady lochleven's suspicions
had not even in the midst her
alarms been so far lulled to sleep as to omit
the precaution stationing sentinels on
 the abbot
her prisoners he was compelled therefore
to return to the parlour or audiencechamber
in which he found the lady the
castle in conference with her learned leech
a truce with your cant phrase and
your solemn foppery lundinin such terms
she accosted the man art and let me
know instantly if thou canst tell whether
this lady hath swallowed aught that is less
than wholesome
 nay but good lady honoured patroness
 to whom i am alike bondsman in my
medical and official capacity deal reasonably
with me if this mine illustrious patient
will not answer a question saving
with sighs and moans if that other honourable
lady will do nought but yawn in my
face when i enquire after the diagnostics 
and if that other young damsel who i profess
is a comely maidens
 talk not to me comeliness or 
damsels said the lady lochleven i
say are they evildisposed in one word
man have they taken poison ay or no 
the abbot 
poisons madam said the learned leech
 are various sorts there is your animai
poison as the lepus marinus as mentioned
by dioscorides and galen there are mineral
and semimineral poisons as those compounded
 sublimate regulus antimony
vitriol and the arsenical salts there are
your poisons from herbs and vegetables as
the aqua cymbal arise opium aconitum cantharides
and the like there are also
 now out upon thee for a learned fool i
and i myself am no better for expecting an
oracle from such a log said the lady
 nay but if your ladyship will have patience
 if i knew what food they have partaken
 or could see but the remnants 
what they have last eaten for as to the external
and internal symptoms i can discover
nought like for as galen saith in his
second de antidotes
away fool said the lady j send me
that hag hither j she shall avouch what it
was that she hath given to the wretch
 the abbot
dryfesdale or the pilniewinks and thumbs
shall wrench it out her finger joints
 art hath no enemy unless the ignorant
said the mortified doctor veiling
however his remark under the latin version
and stepping apart into a corner to
watch the result
in a minute or two magdalen grasme
entered the apartment dressed as we have
described her at the revel but with her
muffler thrown back and all affectation 
disguise she was attended by two guards
 whose presence she did not seem even
to be conscious and who followed her with
an air embarrassment and timidity which
was probably owing to their belief in her
supernatural power coupled with the effect
produced by her bold and undaunted demeanour
she confronted the lady 
lochleven who seemed to endure with
high disdain the confidence her look and
manner
 wretched woman said the lady after
the abbot 
essaying for a moment to bear her down before
she addressed her by the stately severity
 her look what was that powder which
thou didst give to a servant this house
by name robert dryfesdale that he might
work out with it some slow and secret vengeance
 confess its nature and properties
or by the honour douglas i give thee
to fire and stake before the sun is lower i
 alas said magdalen graeme in reply
and when became a douglas or a douglas's
man so unfurnished his means 
revenge that he should seek them at the
hands a poor and solitary woman the
towers in which your captives pine away
into unpitied graves yet stand fast on the
foundation the crimes wrought in them
have not yet burst their vaults asunder 
your men have still their crossbows pistolets
and daggers why need you seek
to herbs or charms for the execution 
your revenges 
 hear me foul hag said the lady 
lochleven but what avails speaking to
 the abbot
thee bring drjfesdale hither and let
them be confronted together
 you may spare your retainers the labour
replied magdalen graeme i came
not here to be confronted with a base
groom nor to answer the interrogatories 
james's heretical leman i came to speak
with the queen scotland give place
there 
and while the lady lochleven stood
confounded at her boldness and at the reproach
she had cast upon her magdalen
grseme strode past her into the bedchamber
 the queen and kneeling on the floor
made a salutation as if in the oriental fashion
she meant to touch the earth with
her forehead
 hail princess she said hail daughter
 many a king but graced above them
all in that thou art called to suffer for the
true faith hail to thee the pure gold 
whose crown has been tried in the seventimes
heated furnace affliction hear the
comfort which god and our lady send
the abbot 
thee by the mouth thy unworthy servant
 but first and stooping her head
she crossed herself repeatedly and still upon
her knees appeared to be rapidly reciting
some formula devotion
 seize her and drag her to the massymore
i to the deepest dungeon with the
sorceress whose master the devil could
alone have inspired her with boldness
enough to insult the mother douglas in
his own castle
thus spoke the incensed lady lochleven
but the physician presumed to interposes

 i pray you honoured madam she
be permitted to take her course without interruption
peradventure we shall learn
something concerning the nostrum she hath
ventured contrary to law and the rules 
art to exhibit to these ladies through the
medium the steward dryfesdale
 for a fool replied the lady locris
 thou hast counselled wisely i
h a
 the abbot
will bridle ray resentment till their conference
be over
 god forbid honoured lady said doctor
lundin that you should suppress it
longer nothing may more endanger the
frame your honoured body and truly
if there be witchcraft in this matter it is
held by the vulgar and even by solid authors
on daemonology that three scruples the
ashes the witch when she hath been welland
carefully burned at a stake is a grand
catholicon in such matter even as they
prescribe crisis canis rabid a hair the
dog that bit the patient in cases hydrophobia
i warrant neither treatment being
out the regular practice the schools 
but in the present case there can be little
harm in trying the conclusion upon this old
necromancer and quacksalver a experiments
as we say in corpore vil
peace fool said the lady she is
about to speak
at that moment magdalen graeme arose
from her knees and turned her countenance
the abbot 
on the queen at the same time advancing
her foot extending her arm and assuming
the mien and attitude a sybil in frenzy
as her grey hair floated back from under
her coif and her eye gleamed fire from under
its shaggy eye brow the effect her
expressive though emaciated features was
heightened by an enthusiasm approaching
to insanity and her appearance struck with
awe all who were present her eyes for a
time glanced wildly around as if seeking
for something to aid her in collecting her
powers expression and her lips had a
nervous and quivering motion as those 
one who would fain speak yet rejects as
inadequate the words which present themselves
mary herself caught the infection
as if by a sort magnetic influence and
raising herself from her bed without being
able to withdraw her eyes from those magdalen
waited as if for the oracle a pythoness
she waited not long for no sooner had
the enthusiast collected herself than her
gaze became intensely steady her features
 the abb or
assumed a determined energy and no sooner
did she begin to speak than the words flowed
from her with a profuse fluency which
might have passed for inspiration and which
perhaps she herself mistook for such
arise she said queen france
and england arise lioness scotland
and be not dismayed though the nets 
the hunters have encircled thee stoop not
to feign with the false ones whom thou shall
soon meet in the field the issue battle
is with the god armies but by battle thy
cause shall be tried lay aside then the
arts lower mortals and assume those
which become a queen true defender 
lie only true faith the armoury heaven
is open to thee faithful daughter the
church take the keys st peter to bind
and to loose royal princess the land
take the sword saint paul to smite and
to shear there is darkness in thy destiny j 
but not in these towers not under the rule
 their haughty mistress shall that destiny
be closed in other lands the lioness may
the abbot 
crouch to the power the tigress but not
in her own not in scotland shall the queen
 scotland long remain captive nor is the
fate the royal stuart in the hands the
traitor douglas let the lady lochleven
double her bolts and deepen her dungeons
they shall not retain thee each element
shall give thee its assistance ere thou
shalt continue captive the land shall lend
its earthquakes the water its waves the air
its tempests the fire its devouring flames
to desolate this house rather than it shall
continue the place thy captivity hear
this and tremble all ye who fight against
the light for she says it to whom it hath
been assured 
she was silent and the astonished physician
said if there was ever an jenergu
mene or possessed demoniac in our days
there is a devil speaking with that woman's
tongue
 practice said the lady lochleven
recovering her surprise here is all prac
 the abbot
time and imposture to the dungeon with
her
lady lochleven said mary arising
from her bed and coming forward with her
wonted dignity ere you make arrest on
any one in our presence hear me but one
word i have done you some wrong i believed
you privy to the murderous purpose
 your vassal and i deceived you in suffering
you to believe it had taken effect i
did you wrong lady lochleven for i
perceive your purpose to aid me was sincere
we tasted not the liquid nor are
we now sick save that we languish for our
freedom
 it is avowed like mary scotland
said magdalen graeme and know besides
that had the queen drained the
draught to the dregs it was harmless as
the water from a sainted spring trow ye
proud woman she added addressing herself
to the lady lochleven that i i
would have been the wretch to put poi
the abbot 
son in the hands a servant or vassal the
house lochleven knowing whom that
house contained as soon would i have furnished
drug to slay my own daughter
 am i thus bearded in mine own castle
said the lady to the dungeon with her 
she shall able what is due to the vender 
poisons and practiser witchcraft
yet hear me for an instant lady 
lochleven said mary and do you to
magdalen be silent at my command 
your steward lady has by confession attempted
my life and those my household
and this woman hath done her best to
save them by furnishing him with what was
harmless in place the fatal drugs which
he expected methinks i propose to you
but a fair exchange when say i forgive
your vassal with all my heart and leave
vengeance to god and to his conscience
so that you also forgive the boldness this
woman in your presence for we trust you
do not hold it as a crime that she subsoil
 the abbot
tuned an innocent beverage for the mortal
poison which was to have drenched our
cup
 heaven forefend madam said the lady
 that i should account that a crime which
saved the house douglas from a foul
breach honour and hospitality we have
written to our son touching our vassals delict
and he must abide his doom which
will most likely be death touching this
woman her trade is damnable by scripture
and is mortally punished by the wise laws
 our ancestry she also must abide her
doom
and have i then said the queen no
claim on the house lochleven for the
wrong i have so nearly suffered within their
walls i ask but in requital the life a frail
and aged woman whose brain as yourself
may judge seems somewhat affected by
years and suffering
 if the lady mary replied the inflexible
lady lochleven hath been mena
the abbot 
cet with wrong in the house douglas it
may be regarded as some compensation that
her complete have cost that house the exile
 a valued son
 plead no more for me my gracious
sovereign said magdalen graeme nor
abase yourself to ask so much as a grey
hair my head at her hands i knew the
risk at which i served my church and my
queen and was ever prompt to pay my poor
life as the ransom it is a comfort to think
that in slaying me or in restraining my freedom
or even in injuring that single grey
hair the house whose honour she boasts
so highly will have filled up the measure
 their shame by the breach their solemn
written assurance safety and
taking from her bosom a paper she handed
it to the queen
 it is a solemn assurance safety in
life and limb said queen mary with
space to come and to go under the hand
and seal the chamberlain kinross
 the abbot
granted to magdalen graeme commonly
called mother nicneven in consideration
 her consenting to put herself for the
space twentyfour hours if required within
the iron gate the castle cochlea

 knave said the lady turning to the
chamberlain how dared you grant her
such a protection 
it was by your ladyship's orders transmitted
by randal as he can bear witness
replied doctor lundin j nay i am only
like the pharmacopoeia who compounds
the drugs after the order the medicines
 i remember i remember answered
the lady but i meant the assurance only
to be used in case by residing in another
jurisdiction she could not have been apprehended
under our warrant
nevertheless said the queen the
lady lochleven is bound by the action
 her deputy in granting the assurance
madam replied the lady the house
the abbot 
 douglas have never broken their safeconduct
and never will do too deeply did
they suffer by such a breach trust exercised
on themselves when your grace's ancestor
the second james in defiance the
rights hospitality and his own written
assurance safety poniard the brave
earl douglas with his own hand and
within two yards the social board at
which he had just before sat the king 
scotland's honoured guest
 methinks said the queen carelessly
 in consideration so very recent and
enormous a tragedy which i think only
chanced some six score years agone the
douglasseses should have shewn themselves
less tenacious the company their sovereigns
than you lady lochleven seem
to be mine
let randal said the lady take the hag
back to kinross and set her at full liberty
discharging her from our bounds in future
on peril her head and let your wisdom
to the chamberlain keep her 
the abbot
any and fear not for your character
though i send you in such company j for
granting her to be a witch it would be a
waste faggots to burn you for a wizard
the crestfallen chamberlain was preparing
to depart j but magdalen graeme collecting
herself was about to reply when the
queen interposed saying good mother
we heartily thank you for your unfeigned
zeal towards our person and pray you as our
liege woman that you abstain from whatever
may lead you into personal danger and
further it is our will that you depart without
a word farther parley with any one in
this castle for thy present guerdon take
this small reliquary it was given to us by
our uncle the cardinal and hath had the
benediction the holy father himself 
and now depart in peace and in silence
for you learned sir continued the queen
advancing to the doctor who made his reverence
in a manner doubly embarrassed
by the awe the queen's presence which
made him fear to do too little and by the
the abbot 
apprehension his lady's displeasure incase
he should chance to do too much 
 for you learned sir as it was not your
fault though surely our own good fortune
that we did not need your skill at this time
it would not become us however circumstanced
to suffer our leech to leave us without
such guerdon as we can offer
with these words and with the grace
which never forsook her though in the present
case there might lurk under it a little
gentle ridicule she offered a small embroidered
purse to the chamberlain who with
extended hand and arched back his learned
face stooping until a physiognomist
might have practised the microscopical
science upon it as seen from behind betwixt
his gambadoes was about to accept
 the professional recompence offered by
so fair as well as illustrious an hand but
the lady interposed and regarding the
chamberlain said aloud no servant 
our house without instantly relinquishing
 the abbot
that character and incurring withal our
highest displeasure shall dare receive any
gratuity at the hand the lady mary
sadly and slowly the chamberlain raised
his depressed stature into the perpendicular
attitude and left the apartment dejectedly
followed by magdalen graeme after
with mute but expressive gesture she had
kissed the reliquary with which the queen
had presented her and raising her clasped
hands and uplifted eyes towards heaven had
seemed to entreat a benediction upon the
royal dame as she left the castle and
went towards the quay where the boat lay
roland graeme anxious to communicate
with her if possible threw himself in her
way and might have succeeded in exchanging
a few words with her as she was guarded
only by the dejected chamberlain and
his halberdiers but she seemed to have
taken in its most strict and literal acceptation
the command to be silent which
she had received from the queen for to
the abbot 
the repeated signs her grandson she
only replied by laying her finger on her
lip dr lundin was not so reserved regret
for the handsome gratuity and for the
compulsory task selfdenial imposed on
him had grieved the spirit that worthy
officer and learned medicine even
thus my friend said he squeezing the
page's hand as he bade him farewell is
merit rewarded i came to cure this unhappy
lady and i profess she well deserves
the trouble for say what they will her
she hath a most winning manner a sweet
voice a gracious smile and a most majestic
wave her hand if she was not poisoned
say my dear master roland was
that fault mine i being ready to cure
her if she had and now i am denied the
permission to accept my wellearned honorarium

 villain i am even now about to send
off an express messenger to my son to take
order how thou shouldst be disposed 
prepare thyself for death if thou canst
 he that looks on death lady answered
dryfesdale as that which he may not
shun and which has its own fixed and certain
hour is ever prepared for it he that
is hanged in may will eat no flames in midsummer
 so there is the moan made for the
old servingman but whom pray i send
you on so fair an errand 
 there will be no lack messengers
answered his mistress
by my hand but there will replied
the old man your castle is but poorly
manned considering the watches that you
must keep having this charge there is
the warder and two others whom you discarded
for tampering with master george 
then for the warder's tower the bailie the
donjon five men mount each guard and
the rest must sleep for the most part in their
clothes to send away another man were
 the abdn
to harass the sentinels to death unthrifty
misuse for a household to take in new
soldiers were dangerous the charge requiring
tried men i see but one thing for
it i will do your errand to sir william
douglas myself
 that were indeed a resource and on
what day within twenty years would it be
done said the lady
 even with the speed man and horse
said clydesdale for though i care not
much about the latter days an old serving
man's life yet i would like to know as
soon as may be whether my neck is mine
own or the hangman's
 oldest thou thy own life so lightly j
said the lady
 else i had recked more that 
others said the predestinarian what is
death it is but ceasing to live and what
is living a weary return light and
darkness sleeping and waking being hungered
and eating your dead man needs
neither candle nor can neither fire nor
the abbot 
featherbed and the joiner's chest serves
him for an eternal freezejerkin
 wretched man believes thou not that
after the death comes the judgment 
lady answered dryfesdale as my
mistress i may not dispute your words but
as spiritually speaking you are still but a
burner bricks in egypt ignorant the
freedom the saints for as was well
shewn to me by that gifted man nicholas
schoefferbach who was martyred by the
bloody bishop munster he cannot sin
who doth but execute that which is predestined
since
silence said the lady interrupting
him answer me not with thy bold and
presumptuous blasphemy but hear me 
thou hast been long the servant our
house
 the bornservant the douglas they
have had the best me i served them
since left lockerbie i was then ten years
old and you may soon add the threescore
to it
 the abbot
thy foul attempt has miscarried so
thou art guilty only in intention it were
a deserved deed to hang thee on the warder's
tower and yet in thy present mind
it were but giving a soul to satan i take
thine offer then go hence here is my
packet i will add to it but a line to desire
him to send me a faithful servant or
two to complete the garrison let my son
deal with you as he will if thou art wise
thou wilt make for lockerbie so soon as
thy foot touches dry land and let the
packet find another bearer at all rates
look it miscarries not
nay madam replied he i was
born as i said the douglasseses servant and
i will be no corbiemessenger in mine old
age your message to your son shall be
done as truly by me as if it concerned another
man's neck i take my leave your
honour
the lady issued her commands and the
old man was ferried over to the shore to
proceed in his extraordinary pilgrimage it
is necessary the reader should accompany
the abbot 
him on his journey which providence had
determined should not be long duration
on arriving at the village the steward
although his disgrace had transpired was
readily accommodated with a horse by the
chamberlain's authority and the roads
being by no means esteemed safe he associated
himself with auchtermuchty the
common carrier in order to travel in his
company to edinburgh
the worthy waggoner according to the
established custom all carriers stagecoachmen
and other persons in such public
authority from the earliest days to the
present never wanted good reasons for
stopping upon the road as often and whereever
he would and the place which had
most captivation for him as a restingplace
was a changehouse as it was termed not
very distant from a romantic dell well
known by the name keirie crags attractions
 a kind very different from those
which arrested the progress john auch
termuchty and his pains still continue to
 the abbot
hover round this romantic spot and none
has visited its vicinity without a desire to
remain long and to return soon
arrived near his favourite howffy not all
the authority dryfesdale much diminished
indeed by the rumours his disgrace
could prevail on the carrier obstinate as
the brutes which he drove to pass on without
his accustomed halt for which the distance
he had travelled furnished little or
no pretence old keltic the landlord
who has bestowed his name on a bridge in
the neighbourhood his quondam dwelling
received the carrier with his usual festive
cordiality and adjourned with him into
the house under pretence important
business which i believe consisted in their
emptying together a mutchkin stoup usquebaugh
while the worthy host and his
guest were thus employed the discarded
steward with a double portion moroseness
in his gesture and look walked discontentedly
into the kitchen the place which
was occupied but by one guest the strange
abbot 
ger was a slight figure scarce above the age
 boyhood and in the dress a page bat
bearing an air haughty aristocratic boldness
and even insolence in his look and manner
that might have made dryfesdale conclude
he had pretensions to superior rank
had not his experience taught him how frequently
these airs superiority were assumed
by the domestics and military retainers
 the scottish nobility the pilgrim's
morning to you old sir said the youth 
 you come as i think from lochleven
castle what news our bonnie queen 
a fairer dove was never pent up in so wretched
a dovecot
 they that speak lochleven and 
those whom its walls contain answered
dryfesdale speak what concerns the
douglas and they who speak what concerns
the douglas do it at their peril
do you speak from fear them old
man or would you make a quarrel for them 
i should have deemed your age might
have cooled your blood
i 
 the abbot
 never while there are eraptypated
coxcombs at each corner to keep it warm
 the sight thy grey hairs keeps mine
cold said the boy who had risen up and
now sat down again
 it is well for thee or i had cooled it
with this hollyrod replied the steward
i think thou best one those swashbucklers
who brawl in alehouses and taverns
 and who if words were pikes and
oaths were andrew ferrara would soon
place the religion babylon in the land
once more and the woman moab upon
the throne
 now by saint bennet seyton said
the youth i will strike thee on the face
thou foulmouthed old railing heretic 
 saint bennet seyton echoed the
steward a proper warrant is saint bennet's
and for a proper nest wolfbirds
like the seytons i will arrest thee as a
traitor to king james and the good regent
ho john auchtermuchty raise aid
against the king's traitor 
the abbot 
so saying he laid his hand on the youth's
collar and drew his sword john auchter
muchty looked in but seeing the naked
weapon ran faster out thane entered keltic
the landlord stood by and helped neither
party only exclaiming gentlemen 
gentlemen for the love heaven and
so forth a struggle ensued in which the
young man chafed atdryfesdale's boldness
and unable with the ease he expected to
extricate himself from the old man's determined
grasp drew his dagger and with the
speed light dealt him three wounds in
the breast and body the least which was
mortal the old man sunk on the ground
with a deep groan and the host set up a
piteous exclamation surprise
 peace ye bawling hound said the
wounded steward are daggerstabs and
dying men such rarities in scotland that
you should cry as if the house were falling 
youth i do not forgive thee for there
is nought betwixt us to forgive thou hast
 the abbot
lone what i have done to more than one 
and i suffer what i have seen them suffer
it was all ordained to be thus and not
otherwise but i thou wouldst do me
right thou wilt send this packet safely to
the hands sir william douglas and
see that my memory suffer not as if i would
have loitered on mine errand for fear my
life
the youth whose passion had subsided
the instant he had done the deed listened
with sympathy and attention when another
person muffled in his cloak entered the
apartment and exclaimed good god 
dryfesdale and expiring 
ay and dryfesdale would that he had
been dead answered the wounded man
 rather than that his ears had heard the
words the only douglas that ever was
false but yet it is better as it is good my
murderer and the rest you stand back
a little and let me speak with this unhappy
apostate kneel down by me master
george you have heard that i failthe
abbot 
ed in my attempt to take away thatmoa
british stumblingblock and her retinue 
i gave them that which i thought would
have removed the temptation out thy
path and this though i had other reasons
to shew to thy mother and others i did
chiefly purpose for the love thee
 for the love me base poisoner 
wouldst thou have committed so horrible
so unprovoked a murder and mentioned
my name with it 
 and wherefore not george dou
glas answered dryfesdale breath is
now scarce with me but i would spend my
last gasp on this argument hast thou not
despite the honour thou west to thy parents
the faith that is due to thy religion
the truth that is due to thy king been so
carried away by the charms this beautiful
sorceress that thou wouldst have helped
her to escape from her prisonhouse and
again to ascend the throne which she had
made a place abomination nay stir not
 the abbot
from me my hand though fast stiffening
has yet force enough to hold thee what
dost thou aim at to wed this witch 
scotland i warrant thee thou mayst succeed
 her heart and hand have been oft
won at a cheaper rate than thou fool that
thou art would think thyself happy to pay
but should a servant thy father's house
have seen thee embrace the fate the
idiot darnley or the villain bothwell 
the fate the murdered fool or the
living pirate while an ounce rat's bane
would have saved thee 
think on god dry festal said george
douglas and leave the utterance those
horrors repent if thou canst if not at
least be silent seyton aid me to support
this dying wretch that he may compose
himself to better thoughts if it be possible
 seyton answered the dying man 
seyton is it by a seyton's hand that i
fall at last there is something retribution
in that since the house had nigh lost
the abbot 
a sister by my deed fixing his fading eyes
on the youth he added he hath her very
features and presence stoop down youth
and let me see thee closer i would know
thee when we meet in yonder world for homicides
will herd together there and i have
been one he pulled seyton's face in
spite some resistance closer to his own
looked at him fixedly and added thou
hast begun young thy career will be the
briefer ay thou wilt be met with and that
anon a young plant never throve that was
watered with an old man's blood yet why
blame i thee strange turns fate he
muttered ceasing to address seyton i
designed what i could not do and he has
done what he did not perchance design 
wondrous that our will should ever oppose
itself to the strong and uncontroulable tide
 destiny that we should strive with the
stream when we might drift with the current
 my brain will serve me to question
it no farther i would schoefferbach were
here yet why i am on a course which
 the abbot
the vessel can hold without a pilots farewell
george douglas i die true to thy
father's house he fell into convulsions
at these words and shortly after expired
seyton and douglas stood looking on the
dying man and when the scene was closed
the former was the first to speak as i
live douglas i meant not this and am sorry
 but he laid hands on me and compelled
me to defend my freedom as i best
might with my dagger if he were ten
times thy friend and follower i can but say
that i am sorry
i blame thee not seyton said douglas
 though i lament the chance there
is an overruling destiny above us though
not in the sense that wretched man who
beguiled by some foreign mystagogue used
the awful word as the ready apology for
whatever he chose to do eve must examine
the packet
they withdrew into an inner room and
remained deep in consultation until they
were disturbed by the entrance keltic
the abbot 
who with an embarrassed countenance asked
master george douglas's pleasure respecting
the disposal the body your
honour knows he added that i make my
bread by living men not by dead corpses 
and old mr dryfesdale who was but a sorry
customer while he was alive occupies my
public room now that he is deceased and
can neither call for ale nor brandy
tie a stone round his neck said seyton
 and when the sun is down have him
to the loch cherish heave him in and
let him alone for finding out the bottom
 under your favour sir said george
douglas it shall not be so keltic thou
art a true fellow to me and ihy having been
so shall advantage thee send or take the
body to the church ballingry and tell
what tale thou wilt his having fallen ina
brawl with some unruly guests thine
auchtermuchty knows nought else nor
are the times so peaceful as to admit close
looking into such accounts
 the abbot
 nay let him tell the truth said seyton
 so far as it harms not our scheme 
say that henry seyton met with him my
good fellow i care not a brass boodle for
the feud
a feud with the douglas was ever to
be feared however said george displeasure
mingling with his natural deep gravity
 manner
not when the best the name is on
my side replied seyton
 alas henry if thou meanest me i
am but half a douglas in this emprize 
half head half heart and half hand but i
will think on one who can never be forgotten
and be all or more than any my
ancestors was ever keltic say it was henry
seyton did the deed j but beware nota
word me let auchtermuchty carry
this packet which he had resealed with
his own signet to my father at edinburgh j
and here is to pay for the funeral expences
and thy loss custom
the abbot 
 and the washing the floor said the
landlord which will be an extraordinary
job for blood they say will scarcely ever
cleanse out
but as for your plan said george 
douglas addressing seyton as if in continuation
 what they had been before treating
 it has a good face j but under your
favour you are yourself too hot and too
young besides other reasons which are much
against your playing the part you propose
we will consult the father abbot upon
it said the youth do you ride to kinross
tonight 
 ay so i purpose answered douglas 
the night will be dark and suits a muff
r 
fled man keltie i forgot there should
be a stone laid on that man's grave recording
his name and his only merit which was
being a faithful servant to the douglas
 what religion was the man said
seyton he used words which made me
fear i have sent satan a subject before his
time
 the abbot
i can tell you little that said george
douglas he was noted for disliking both
rome and geneva and spoke lights he
had learned among the fierce sectaries 
lower germany an evil doctrine it was
if we judge by the fruits god keep us
from presumptuously judging heaven's
secrets 
amen said the young seyton and
from meeting any encounter this evening
 it is not thy wont to pray so said
george douglas
 no leave that to you replied the
youth when you are seized with scruples
 engaging with your father's vassals but
 would fain have this old man's blood off
these hands mine ere i shed more i
will confess to the abbot tonight and i
trust to have light penance for ridding the
earth such a miscreant all i sorrow for
is that he was not a score years younger
 he drew steel first however that is one
comfort
thl abbot 
chapter vii

why youngster thou mayest cheat the old dueofta

but know that i her father play the gryphon
tameless and sleepless proof to fraud or bribe

the spanish father
the tenor our tale carries us back to
the castle lochleven where we take up
the order events on the same remarkable
day on which dryfesdale had been dismissed
from the castle it was past noon the
usual hour dinner yet no preparations
seemed made for the queen's entertainment
mary herself was retired into her
own apartment where she was closely engaged
in writing her attendants were together
in the presencechamber and much
 the abbot
disposed to speculate on the delay the
dinner for it may be recollected that their
breakfast had been interrupted i believe
in my conscience said the page
 that having found the poisoning scheme
miscarry by having gone to the wrong merchant
for their deadly wares they are now
about to try how famine will work upon
us
lady fleming was somewhat alarmed at
this surmise but comforted herself by observing
that the chimney the kitchen had
reeked that whole day in a manner which
contradicted the supposition catherine
seyton presently exclaimed they were
bearing the dishes across the court marshalled
by the lady lochleven herself
dressed out in her highest and stiffest ruff
with her partlet and sleeves cyprus and
her huge oldfashioned farthingale crimson
velvet
i believe on my word said the page
approaching the window also it was in
that very farthingale that she captivated
the heart gentle king jamie which prothe
abbot 
cured our poor queen her precious bargain
 a brother
 that may hardly be master roland
answered the lady fleming who was a
great recorder the changes fashion
 since the farthingales came first in when
the queen regent went to saint andrews
after the battle pinkie and were then
called pertains
she would have proceeded farther in this
important discussion but was interrupted
by the entrance the lady lochleven
who preceded the servants bearing the
dishes and formally discharged the duty 
tasting each them lady fleming regretted
in courtly phrase that the lady
 lochleven should have undertaken so
troublesome an office
 after the strange incident this day
madam said the lady it is necessary for
my honour and that my son that i partake
whatever is offered to my involuntary
guest please to inform the lady mary
that i attend her commands
 the abbot
 her majesty replied lady fleming
with due emphasis on the word shall be
informed that the lady lochleven waits
mary appeared instantly and addressed
her hostess with courtesy which even approached
to something more cordial this
is nobly done lady lochleven she said
 for though we ourselves apprehend no
danger under your roof our ladies have
been much alarmed by this morning's
chance and our meal will be the more
cheerful for your presence and assurance
please you to sit down
the lady lochleven obeyed the queen's
commands and roland performed the office
 carver and attendant as usual but
notwithstanding what the queen had said
the meal was silent and unsocial and every
effort which mary made to excite some conversation
died away under the solemn and
chill replies the lady lochleven at
length it became plain that the queen who
had considered her advances as a condense
abbot 
ascension on her part and who piqued herself
justly on her powers pleasing became offended
at the repulsive conduct her hostess
after looking with a significant glance
at lady fleming and catherine she slightly
shrugged her shoulders and remained silent
a pause ensued at the which
the lady douglas spoke i perceive
madam i am a check on the mirth this
fair company i pray you to excuse me 
i am a widow alone here in a most perilous
charge deserted by my grandson 
betrayed by my servant i am little worthy
 the grace you do me in offering me a
seat at your table where i am aware that
wit and pastime are usually expected from
the guests
 if the lady lochleven is serious said
the queen we wonder by what simplicity
she expects our present meals to be seasoned
with mirth if she is a widow she
lives honoured and uncontrouled at the
head her late husband's household but
vol iir k
gl the abbot
i know at least one widowed woman in
the world before whom the words desertion
and betrayal ought never to be mentioned
since no one has been made so bitterly
acquainted with their import
i meant not to remind you your
misfortunes by the mention mine answered
the lady lochleven and there was
again a deep silence
mary at length addressed lady fleming
 we can commit no deadly sins here vut
tonnes where we are so well warded and
looked to but if we could this carthusian
silence might be useful as a kind penance
if thou hast adjusted my wimple amiss my
fleming or if catherine hath made a wry
stitch in her broidery when she was thinking
 something else than her work or if
roland graeme hath missed a wildduck on
the wing and broke a quarrelpane glass
in the turret window as chanced to him
a week since now is the time to think on
your sins and to repent them
 madam i speak with all reverence
the abbot 
said the lady lochleven but i am old
and claim the privilege age methinks
your followers might find fitter subjects for
repentance than the trifles you mention and
so mention once more i crave your pardon
 as if you jested with sin and with repentance
both
you have been our taster lady lochleven
said the queen i perceive you
would eke out your duty with that our
father confessor and since you chuse that
our conversation should be serious may i
ask you why the regent's promise since
your son so styles himself has not been
kept to me in that respect from time to
time this promise has been renewed and
as constantly broken methinks those who
pretend themselves to so much gravity and
sanctity should not debar from others the
religious succours which their consciences
require
 madam the earl murray was indeed
weak enough said the lady lochleven
 to give so far way to your unhappy
 the abbot
prejudices and a religion the pope
presented himself on his part at our town
 kinross but the douglas is lord 
his own castle and will not permit his
threshold to be darkened no not for a single
moment by an emissary belonging to
the bishop rome
 methinks it were well then said mary
 that my lord regent would send me
where there is less scruple and more charity

in this madam answered the lady
lochleven you mistake the nature both
 charity and religion charity giveth
to those who are in delirium the medicaments
which may avail their health but
refuses those enticing cates and liquors
which please the palate but augment the
disease
 this your charity lady lochleven is
pure cruelty under the hypocritical disguise
 friendly care i am oppressed
amongst you as if you meant the destruction
both my body and soul but heath
abbot 
even will not endure such iniquity for ever
and they who are the most active agents in
it may speedily expect their reward
at this moment landau entered the apartment
with a look so much perturbed that
the lady fleming uttered a faint scream
the queen was obviously startled and the
lady lochleven though too bold and
proud to evince any marked signs alarm
asked hastily what was the matter 
dryfesdale has been slain madam
was the reply murdered as soon as he
gained the dry landby young master henry
seyton
it was now catherine's turn to start and
grow pale has the murderer the
douglas's vassal escaped was the lady's
hasty question
there was none to challenge him but
oldkeltie and the carrier auchtermuchty
replied randal unlikely men to slay one
 the racket youths in scotland his
boldest most forward
 the abbot
years and who was sure to have friends and
partakers at no great distance
 was the deed completed said the
lady
 done and done thoroughly said randal
 a seyton seldom strikes twice but
the body was not despoiled and your ho 
your's packet goes forward to edinburgh by
auchtermuchty who leaves keltiebridge
early tomorrow marry he has drunk two
bottles aquavitfe to put the fright out 
his head and now sleeps them off beside
his cart avers t
there was a pause when this fatal tale
was told the queen and lady douglas
looked on each other as if each thought
how she could best turn the incident to her
own advantage in the controversy which
was continually kept alive betwixt them 
catherine seyton kept her kerchief at her
eyes and wept
 you see madam the bloody maxims
and practice the deluded papists said
lady lochleven
the abbot 
nay madam replied the queen
say rather you see the deserved judgment
 heaven upon a calvinistical poisoner
dryfesdale was not the church 
geneva or scotland said the lady
lochleven hastily
he was a heretic however replied
mary there is but one true and unerring
guide the others lead alike into error
well madam i trust it will reconcile
you to your retreat that this deed shews
the temper those who might wish you at
liberty bloodthirsty tyrants and cruel
manquellers are they all from the clanronald
andclantosach in the north to the
ferniherst and buccleuch in the south 
the murdering seytons in the east and
 methinks madam you forget that i
am a seyton said catherine withdrawing
her kerchief from her face which was now
coloured with indignation
if had forgot it fair mistress your
forward bearing would have reminded me
said lady lochleven
 the abbot
 if my brother has slain the villain that
would have poisoned his sovereign and his
sister said catherine am only so far
sorry that he should have spared the hangman
his proper task for aught further
had it been the best douglas in the land
he would have been honoured in falling by
the seyton's sword
farewell gay mistress said the lady
 lochleven rising to withdraw it is
such maidens as you who make giddyfashioned
revellers and deadly brawlers boys
must needs rise forsooth in the grace 
some sprightly damsel who thinks to dance
through life as through a french galliard
she then made her reverence to the queen
and added do you also madam fare you
well till curfew time when i will make
perchance more bold than welcome in attending
upon your supper board come
with me randal and tell me more this
cruel fact
tis an extraordinary chance said the
queen when she had departed and
the abbot 
villain as he was i would this man had been
spared time for repentance we will cause
something to be done for his soul if weever
attain our liberty and the church will
permit such grace to an heretic but tell
me catherine ma mignonne this brother 
thine who is ofracky as the fellow called
him bears he the same wonderful likeness
to thee as formerly 
if your grace means in temper you
know whether lam ofrack as the servingman
spoke him
nay thou art prompt enough in all
reasonable conscience replied the queen 
but thou art my own darling notwithstanding
 but i meant is this thy twinbrother
as like thee in form and features
as formerly i remember thy dear mother
alleged it as a reason for destining thee to
the veil that were ye both to go at large
thou wouldst surely get the credit some
 thy brother's mad pranks
 i believe madam said catherine
 there are some unusually simple people
k 
g the abbot
even yet who can hardly distinguish betwixt
us especially when for diversion's
sake my brother hath taken a female dress
and as she spoke she gave a quick glance
at roland grseme to whom this conversation
conveyed a ray light welcome as
ever streamed into the dungeon a captive
through the door which opened to give
him freedom 
he must be a handsome cavalier this
brother thine if he be so like you replied
mary he was in france i think
for these late years so that i saw him not
at holyrood
his looks madam have never been
much found fault with answered catherine
seyton but i would he had less 
that angry and heady spirit which evil times
have encouraged amongst our young nobles
god knows i grudge not his life in
your grace's quarrel j and love him for the
willingness with which he labours for your
rescue but wherefore should he brawl
with an old ruffianly servingman and stain
the abbot 
at once his name with such a broil and his
hands with the blood an old and ignoble
wretch 
nay be patient catherine i will not
have thee traduce my gallant young knight
with henry for my knight and roland
gramme for my trusty squire methinks i am
like a princess romance who may shortly
set at defiance the dungeons and the weapons
 all wicked sorcerers but my headaches
with the agitation the day take
me la mer des histoires and resume where
we left off on wednesday our lady help
thy head girl or rather may she help thy
heart i asked thee for the sea histories
and thou hast brought la comique
d'armurt
once embarked upon the sea histories
the queen continued her labours with her
needle while lady fleming and catherine
read to her alternately for two hours
as to roland graeme it is probable that
he continued in secret intent upon the chronicle
 love notwithstanding the censure
 the abbot
which the queen seemed to pass upon that
branch study he now remembered a
thousand circumstances voice and manner
which had his own prepossession been
less must surely have discriminated the brother
from the sister and he felt ashamed
that having as it were by heart every particular
 catherine's gestures words and
manners he should have thought her notwithstanding
her spirits and levity capable
cf assuming the bold step loud tones and
forward assurance which accorded well
enough with her brother's hasty and masculine
character he endeavoured repeatedly
to catch a glance catherine's eye
that he might judge how she was disposed
to look upon him since he had made the
discovery but he was unsuccessful for catherine
when she was not reading herself
seemed to take so much interest in the exploits
 the teutonic knights against the
heathens esthonia and livonia that he
could not surprise her eye even for a second
but when closing the the queen comthe
abbot 
landed their attendance in the garden
mary perhaps set purpose for roland's
anxiety could not escape so practised an observer
afforded him a favourable opportunity
 accosting his mistress the queen
commanded them to a little distance while
she engaged lady fleming in a particular
and private conversation the subject whereof
we learn from another authority to have
been the comparative excellence the high
standing ruff and the falling band roland
must have been duller and more sheepish
than ever was youthful lover if he had not
endeavoured to avail himself this opportunity

i have been longing this whole evening
to ask you fair catherine said the
page how foolish and unapprehensive you
must have thought me in being capable to
mistake betwixt your brother and you 
 the circumstance does indeed little honour
to my rustic manners said catherine
since those a wild young man were so
readily mistaken for mine but i shall grow
 the abbot
wiser in time and with that view i am determined
not to think your follies but
to correct my own
 it will be the lighter subject meditation
 the two said roland
 i know not that said catherine very
gravely i fear we have been both unpardonably
foolish
 i have been mad said roland unpardonably
mad but you lovely catherine

 i said catherine in the same tone 
unusual gravity have too long suffered
you to use such expressions towards me 
i fear i can permit it no longer and i blame
myself for the pain it may give you
and what can have happened so suddenly
to change our relation to each other
or alter with such sudden cruelty your
whole deportment to me 
i can hardly tell replied catherine
 unless it is that the events the day have
impressed on my mind the necessity our
observing more distance to each other a
the abbot 
chance similar to that which betrayed to you
the existence my brother may make
known to henry the terms you have used
to me and alas his whole conduct as
well as his deed this day makes me too justly
apprehensive the consequences
 fear nothing for that fair catherine
answered the page i am well able to
protect myself against risks that nature
that is to say replied she that you
would fight with my twinbrother to shew
your regard for his sister i have heard
the queen say in her sad hours that men
are in love or in hate the most selfish animals
 creation and your carelessness in
this matter looks very like it but be not
so much abashed you are no worse than
others
you do me injustice catherine replied
the page i thought but being
threatened with a sword and did not remember
in whose hand your fancy had
placed it if your brother stood before me
with his drawn weapon in his hand so like
 the abbot
as be is to you in word person an favour
he might shed my life'sblood ere i could
find in my heart to resist him to his injury
 alas said she it is not my brother j
alone but you remember only the singular
circumstances in which we have met in equality
and i may say in intimacy you think
not that whenever i reenter my father's
house there is a gulph between us you may
not pass but with peril your life your
only known relative is wild and singular
habits a hostile and broken clan the
rest your lineage unknown forgive me
that i speak what is the undeniable truth
 love my beautiful catherine despises
genealogies answered roman gramme
love may but so will not the lord
seton rejoined the damsel
the queen thy mistress and mine she
will intercede o drive me not from you
at the moment i thought myself most happy
i sand if i shall aid her deliverance said
not yourself that you and she would become
my debtors 
the abbot 
 all scotland will become your debtors
said catherine but for the active
effects you might hope from our gratitude
you must remember i am wholly subjected
to my father and the poor queen is for a
long time more likely to be dependent on
the pleasure the nobles her party
than possessed power to controul them
be it so replied roland my deeds
shall controul prejudice itself it is a bustling
world and i will have my share the
knight avenel high as he now stands
rose from as obscure an origin as mine
 ay said catherine there spoke the
doughty knight romance that will cut
his way to the imprisoned princess through
fiends and fiery dragons
 but i can set the princess at large
and procure her the freedom lier own
choice said the page where dearest catherine
will that choice alight 
 release the princess from dress and
she will tell you said the damsel j and
 the abbot
breaking off the conversation abruptly she
joined the queen so suddenly that mary
exclaimed half aloud
no more tidings evil import no dissention
i trust in my limited household 
then looking on catherine's blushing cheek
and roland's expanded brow and glancing
eye no no she said i see all is
well ma petite mignonne go to my apartment
and fetch me down let me see ay
fetch my pomander box
and having thus disposed her attendant
in the manner best qualified to hide her
confusion the queen added speaking apart
to roland should at least have two grateful
subjects catherine and you for what
sovereign but mary would aid truelove so
willingly ay you lay your hand on your
sword your petite flamherge a rien there
well short time will shew if all the good
be true that is protested to us i hear them
toll curfew from kinross to our chamber
this old dame hath promised to be with
the abbot 
us again at our evening meal were it not
for the hope speedy deliverance her presence
would drive me distracted but i
will be patient
i profess said catherine would i
could be henry with all a man's privileges
for one moment i long to throw my plate
at that confect pride and formality and
illnature
the lady fleming reprimanded her
young companion for this explosion impatience
y the queen laughed and they
went to the presencechamber where almost
immediately entered supper and the
lady the castle the queen strong in
her prudent resolutions endured her presence
with great fortitude and equanimity
until her patience was disturbed by a new
form which had hitherto made no part 
the ceremonial the castle when the
other attendant had retired randal entered
bearing the keys the castle fastened
upon a chain and announcing that the
 the abbot
watch was set and the gates locked delivered
the keys with all reverence to the
lady lochleven
the queen and her ladies exchanged
with each other a look disappointment
anger and vexation and mary said aloud
 we cannot regret the smallness our
court when we see our hostess discharge
in person so many its offices addition
to her charges principal steward 
our household and grani almoner she
has tonight done duty as captain our
guard
and will continue to do so in future
madam answered the lady lochleven
with much gravity the history scotland
may teach me how ill the duty is performed
which is done by an accredited deputy
 we have heard madam favourites
 later date and as little merit as oliver
sinclair
 o madam replied the queen my
father had his female as well as his male fathe
abbot 
favourites there were the ladies sandilandsv
and olifaiint and some others methinks 
but their names cannot survive in the memory
 so grave a person as you
the lady lochleven looked as if she
could have slain the queen on the spot but
commanded her temper and retired from
the apartment bearing in her hand the ponderous
bunch keys
now god be praised for that vioman's
youthful frailty said the queen had she
not that weak point io her character i might
waste my words on her in vain but that
stain is the very reverse what is said 
the witch's mark i can make her feel there
though she is otherwise insensible all over
but how say you girls here is a new
difficulty how are these keys to be come
by there is no deceiving or bribing this
dragon i trow
may i crave to know said roland
 whether if your grace were beyond the
walls the castle you could find means 
 the abbot
conveyance to the firm land and protection
when you are there
trust us for that roland said the
queen for to that point our scheme is
indifferent well laid
then if your grace will permit me to
speak my mind i think i could be some
use in this matter
 as how my good youth speak on
said the queen and fearlessly
 my patron the knight avenel used
to compel the youth educated in his household
to learn the use axe and hammer
and working in wood and iron he used to
speak old northern champions who forged
their own weapons and the highland
captain donald nan ord or donald
 the hammer whom he himself knew
and who used to work at the anvil with a
sledgehammer in each hand some said
he praised this art because he was himself
 churl's blood however i gained some
practice in it as the lady catherine sey ton
the abbot 
partly knows for since we were here i
wrought her a silver broach
ay replied catherine but you
should tell her grace that your workmanship
was so indifferent that it broke to pieces
next day and i flung it away
 believe her not roland said the
queen she wept when it was broken
and put the fragments into her bosom but
for your scheme could your skill avail to
forge a second set keys 
no madam because i know not the
wards but i am convinced i could make
a set so like that hateful bunch which the
lady bore off even now that could they be
exchanged against them by any means she
would never dream she was possessed the
wrong
and the good dame thank heaven is
somewhat blind said the queen but
then for a forge my boy and the means 
labouring unobserved 
 the armourer's forge at which i used
sometimes to work with him is in the round
 the abbot
vault at the bottom the turret he was
dismissed with the warder for being supposed
too much attached to george douglas
the people are accustomed to see me work
there and i will find some excuse that will
pass current with them for putting bellows
and anvil to work
 the scheme has a promising face said
the queen about it my lad with all speed
and beware the nature your work is not
discovered
nay i will take the liberty to draw the
bolt against chance visitors so that i will
have time to put away what am working
upon before i undo the door
 will not that itself attract suspicion
in a place where it is so current already 
said catherine
 not a whit replied roland j gregory
the armourer and every good hamgerman
locks himself in when he is about
some masterpiece craft besides something
must be risked
the abbot 
part we then tonight said the queen
and god bless you my children if
mary's head ever rises above water you
shall all arise along with her

 the abb or

it is a time danger not revel
when churchmen turn masquers
spanish father
the enterprize roland grseme appeared
to prosper a trinket or two which
the work did not surpass the substance for
the materials were silver supplied by the
queen were judiciously presented to those
most likely to be inquisitive into the labours
 the forge and anvil which they thus were
induced to reckon profitable to others and
harmless in itself openly the page was
seen working about such trifles in private
he forged a number keys resembling so
nearly in weight and in form those which
were presented every evening to the lady
lochleven that on a slight inspection it
would have been difficult to perceive the
the abbot 
difference he brought them to the dark
rusty colour by the use salt and water 
and in the triumph his art presented
them at length to queen mary in her 
about an hour before the
tolling the curfew she looked at them
with pleasure but at the same time with
doubts i allow she said that the
lady lochleven's eyes which are not 
the clearest may be well deceived could
we pass those keys on her in place the
real implements her tyranny but how
is this to be done and which my little
court dare attempt this tour de jongleur
with any chance success could we but
engage her in some earnest matter argument
 but those which i hold with her
always have been a kind which make her
grasp her keys the faster as if she said to
herself here i hold what sets me above
your taunts and reproaches and even for
her liberty mary stuart could not stoop to
speak the proud heretic fairwhat shall
we do shall lady fleming try her elo
 the abbot
quench in describing the last new headtire
from paris alas the good dame has
not changed the fashion her head gear
since pinkiefield for aught that i know
shall my mignonne catherine sing to her
one those touching airs which draw the
very souls out me and roland graeme 
alas dame margaret douglas would rather
hear a huguenot psalm sung to the tune 
reveilles vous helle endormie cousins and
liege counsellors what is to be done for
our wits are really astray in this matter 
must our manatarms and the champion 
our body roland graeme manfully assault
the old lady and take the keys from her
par vote du fait v
nay with your grace's permission
said roland i doubt not to manage the
matter with more discretion for though in
your grace's service i do not fear
 a host old women interrupted catherine
 each armed with rock and spindle
yet he has no fancy for pikes and partizans

the abbot 
 they that do not fear fair ladies
tongues continued the page need dread
nothing else but gracious liege i am
well nigh satisfied that i could pass the
exchange these keys on the lady lochleven
 but i dread the sentinel who is now
planted nightly in the garden which by
necessity we must traverse
our last advices from our friend on the
shore have promised us assistance in that
matter replied the queen
and is your grace well assured the
fidelity and watchfulness those without v
 for their fidelity i will answer with
my life and for their vigilance i will answer
with my lifei will give thee instant
proof my faithful roland that they are ingenious
and trusty as thyself come hither
 nay catherine attend us we carry
not so deft a page into our private chamber
alone make fast the door the parlour
fleming and warn us if you hear the
least step or stay go thou to the door
catherine in a whisper thy ears and thy
 the abbot
wits are both sharper good fleming attend
us thyself and again she whispered
her reverend presence will be as safe a
watch on roland as thine can so be not
jealous mignonne
thus speaking they were lighted by the
lady fleming into the queen's bedroom
a small apartment enlightened by a projecting
window
 look from that window roland she
said see you amongst the several lights
which begin to kindle and to glimmer palely
through the grey the evening from the
village kinross seest thou i say one
solitary spark apart from the others and
nearer it seems to the verge the water 
it is no brighter at this distance than the
torch the poor glowworm and yet my
good youth that light is more dear to mary
stuart than every star that twinkles in the
blue vault heaven by that signal i
know that more than one true heart are
plotting my deliverance and without that
consciousness and the hope freedom it
the abbot 
gives me i had long since stooped to my
fate and died a broken heart plan after
plan has been formed and abandoned but
still the light glimmers and while it glimmers
my hope lives o how many evenings
have i sat musing in despair over our
ruined schemes and scarce hoping that i
should again see that blessed signal when it
has suddenly kindled and like the lights 
saint elms in a tempest brought hope and
consolation where there was only dejection
and despair 
 if i mistake not answered roland
 tlie candle shines from the house 
the mail gardener
 thou hast a good eye said the queen 
it is there where my trusty lieges god
and the saints pour blessings on them 
hold consultation for my deliverance the
voice a wretched captive would die on
these blue waters long ere it could mingle
in their councils and yet i can hold communication
 i will confide the whole to
s the abbot
thee i am about to ask those faithful
friends if the moment for the great attempt
is nigh place the lamp in the window fleming

she obeyed and immediately withdrew
it no sooner had she done so than the
light in the cottage the gardener disappeared

 now count said queen mary for
my heart beats so thick that i cannot count
myself
the lady fleming began deliberately to
count one two three and when she had arrived
at ten the light on the shore again
shewed its pale twinkle
now our lady be praised said the
queen it was but two nights since that
the absence the light remained while i
could tell thirty the hour deliverance
approaches may god bless those who labour
in it with such truth to me alas 
with such hazard to themselves and bless
you too my children come we must to
the abbot 
the audiencechamber again our absence
might excite suspicion should they serve
the supper
they returned to the presencechamber
and the evening concluded as usual
the next morning at dinnertime an
unusual incident occurred while lacy
douglas loehleven performed her daily
duty assistant and taster at the queen's
table she was told a manetarms had arrived
recommended by her son but without
any letter or other token than what he
brought by word mouth
hath he given you that token demanded
the lady
 he reserved it as i think for your
ladyship's ear replied randal
 he doth well said the lady tell
him to wait in the hall but no with your
permission madam to the queen let him
attend me here
 since you are pleased to receive your
domestics in my presence said the queen
i cannot chuse 
l 
 the abbot
 my infirmities must plead my excuse
madam replied the lady the life i must
lead here ill suits with the years which have
passed over my head and compels me to
waive ceremonial
 o my good lady replied the queen
 i would there were nought in this your
castle more strongly compulsive than the
cobweb chains ceremony but bolts and
bars are harder matters to contend with
as she spoke the person announced by
randal entered the room and roland
gramme at once recognized in him the abbot
ambrosius
what is your name good fellow said
the lady
edward glendinning answered the
abbot with a suitable reverence
 art thou the blood the knight
 avenel said the lady lochleven
ay madam and that nearly replied
the pretended soldier
 it is likely enough said the lady for
the knight is the son his own good works
the abbot 
and has risen from obscure lineage to this
present high rank in the estate but he is
 sure truth and approved worth and his
kinsman is welcome to us you hold unquestionably
the true faith 
do not doubt it madam said the
disguised churchman
hast thou a token to me from sir william
douglas said the lady
 i have madam replied he but it
must be said in private
thou art right said the lady moving
towards the recess a window say in
what does it consist 
 in the words an old bard replied
the abbot
 repeat them answered the lady and
he uttered in a low tone the lines from an
old poem called the howlet 
o douglas douglas
tender and true
 trusty sir john holland i said the
lady douglas apostrophizing the poet
 the abbot
a kinder heart never inspired a rhine
and the douglas's honour was ever on thy
harp string we receive you among our
followers glendinning but randal see
that he keep the after ward only till we
shall hear more touching him from our son
thou dearest not the nightair blending

 in the cause the lady before whom
i stand i fear nothing madam answered
the disguised abbot
 our garrison then is stronger by one
trust worthy soldiers said the matron 
go to the buttery and let them make
much thee
when the lady lochleven had retired
the queen said to roland graeme who was
now almost constantly in her company i
spy comfort in that stranger's countenance y
i know not why it should be so but i am
well persuaded he is a friend
 your grace's penetration does not deceive
you answered the page and he informed
her that the abbot saint mary's
the abbot s
himself played the part the newly arrived
soldier
the queen crossed herself and looked
upwards unworthy sinner that i am
she said that for my sake a man so holy
and so high in spiritual office should wear
the garb a base shorter and run the risk
 dying the death a traitor 
 heaven will protect its own servant
madam said catherine seyton his aid
would bring a blessing on our undertaking
were it not already blest for its own sake
 what i admire in my spiritual father
said roland was the steady front with
which he looked on me without giving the
least sign former acquaintance i did
not think the like was possible since i have
ceased to believe that henry was the same
person with catherine
 but marked you not how studiously
the good father said the queen eluded
the questions the woman lochleven telling
her the very truth which yet she received
not as such 
t the abbot
roland thought in his heart that when
the truth was spoken for the purpose deceiving
it was little better than a lie in disguise
but it was no time to agitate such
questions conscience
and now for the signal from the shore
exclaimed catherine my bosom tells me
we shall see this night two lights instead 
one gleam from that garden eden and
then roland do you play your part manfully
and we will dance on the greensward
like midnight fairies 
catherine's conjecture misgave not nor
deceived her in the evening two beams
twinkled from the cottage instead one 
and the page heard with beating heart that
the new retainer was ordered to stand sentinel
on the outside the castle when
he intimated this news to the queen she
held her hand out to him he knelt and
when he raised it to his lips in all dutiful
homage he found it was damp and cold as
marble for god's sake madam droop
not now sink not now
the abbot 
 call upon our lady my liege said
the lady flemings call upon your tutelar
saint
 call the spirits the hundred kings
you are descended from exclaimed the
page in this hour need the resolution
 a monarch were worth the aid a hundred
saints
o roland grseme said mary in a
tone deep despondency be true tome
 many have been false to me alas i
have not always been true to myself my
mind misgives me that i shall die in bondage
and that this bold attempt will cost
all our lives it was foretold me by a soothsayer
in france that i should die in prison
and by a violent death and here comes the
hour o would to god it found me prepared

 madam said catherine seyton remember
you are a queen better we all
died in bravely attempting to gain our freedom
than remained here to be poisoned as
 the abbot
men rid them the noxious vermin that
haunt old houses
 you are right catherine said the
queen and mary will bear her like herself
but alas your young and buoyant
spirit can ill spell the causes which have
broken mine forgive me my children
and farewell for a while i will prepare
both mind and body for this awful venture

they separated till again called together
by the tolling the curfew the queen
appeared grave but firm and resolved the
lady fleming with the art an experienced
courtier knew perfectly how to disguise
her inward tremors catherine's eye
was fired as if with the boldness the project
and the half smile which dwelt upon
her beautiful mouth seemed to contemn all
the risk and all the consequences discovery
 roland who felt how much success
depended on his own address and boldness
summoned together his whole pre
the abbot st
sence mind and if he found his spirits
flag for a moment cast his eye upon catherine
whom he thought he had never
seen look so beautiful i may be foiled
he thought but with this reward in prospect
they must bring the devil to aid them
ere they cross me thus resolved he stood
like a greyhound in the slips with hand
heart eye intent upon making and seizing
opportunity for the execution their project

the keys had with the wonted ceremonial
been presented to the lady cochlea
she stood with her back to the casement
which like that the queen's apartment
commanded a view kinross with
the church which stands at some distance
fiom the town and nearer to the lake
then connected with the town by straggling
cottages with her back to this casement
then and her face to the table on
which the keys lay for an instant while she
tasted the various dishes which were placed
 the abbot
there stood the lady lochleven more
provokingly intent than usual so at least
it seemed to her prisoners upon the huge
and heavy bunch iron the implements 
their restraint just when having finished
her ceremony as taster the queen's table
she was about to take up the keys the
page who stood beside her and had handed
her the dishes in succession looked sideways
to the churchyard and exclaimed he
saw corpse candles in the churchyard the
lady lochleven was not without a touch
though a slight one the superstitions 
the time the fate her sons made her
alive to omens and a corpselight as it was
called in the family burialplace boded
death she turned her head towards the
casement saw a distant glimmering forgot
her charge for one second and in that
second were lost the whole fruits her
former vigilance the page held the forged
keys under his cloak and with great dexterity
exchanged them for the real ones
his utmost address could not prevent a
the abbot 
slight clash as he took up the latter bunch
who touches the keys said the lady 
and while the page answered that the sleeve
 his cloak had stirred them she looked
round possessed herself the bunch which
now occupied the place the genuine keys
and again turned to gaze at the supposed
corpsecandles
i hold these gleams she said after a
moment's consideration to come not
from the churchyard but from the hut 
the old gardener blinkhoolie i wonder
what thrift that churl drives that late he
hath ever had light in his house till the
night grew deep i thought him an industrious
peaceful man if he turns resented
 idle companions and nightwalkers
the place must be rid him
 he may work his baskets perchance
said the page desirous to stop the train 
her suspicion
or nets may he not answered the
lady
 the abbot
ay madam said roland for trout
and salmon
 or for fools and knaves replied the
lady but this shall be looked after tomorrow
i wish your grace and your company
a good evening randal attend us
and randal who waited in the antichamber
after having surrendered his bunch 
keys gave his escort to his mistress as usual
while leaving the queen's apartments she
retired to her own
tomorrow said the page rubbing
his hands with glee as he repeated the lady's
last words fools look to tomorrow and
wise folk use tonight may i pray you
my gracious liege to retire for one half
hour until all the castle is composed to rest
i must go and rub with oil these blessed
implements our freedom courage and
constancy and all will go well providing
our friends on the shore fail not to send the
boat you spoke 
 fear them not said catherine they
the abbot 
are true as steel if our dear mistress do
but maintain her noble and royal courage
doubt not me catherine replied the
queen a while since i was overborne
but i have recalled the spirit my earlier
and more sprightly days when i used to
accompany my armed nobles and wish to
be myself a man to know what life it was
to be in the fields with sword and buckler
jack and knapsack
 o the lark lives not a gayer life nor
sings a lighter and gayer song than the
merry soldier answered catherine your
jrace shall be in the midst them soon
and the look such a liege sovereign will
make each your host worth three in the
hour need but i must to my task
 we have but brief time said queen
mary one the two lights in the cottage
is extinguished that shows the boat is put
off
they will row very slow said the
page or kent where depth permits to
is
 the abbot
avoid noise to our several gear i will
communicate with the good father
at the dead hour midnight when all
was silent in the castle the page put the
key into the lock the wicket which opened
into the garden and which was at the
bottom a staircase that descended from
the queen's apartment now turn smooth
and softly thou good bolt said he if
ever oil softened rust and his precautions
had been so effectual that the bolt revolved
with little or no sound resistance he
ventured not to cross the threshold but exchanging
a word with the disguised abbot
asked if the boat were ready
this half hour said the sentinel she
lies beneath the wall too close under the
islet to be seen by the warder but i fear
she will hardly escape his notice in putting
off again
the darkness said the page and
our profound silence may take her off unobserved
as she came in hildebrand has
the abbot 
the watch on the tower a heavyheaded
knave who holds a can ale to be the best
headpiece upon a nightwatch he sleeps
for a wager
 then bring the queen said the abbot
and i will call henry seyton to assist
them to the boat
on tiptoe with noiseless step and suppressed
breath trembling at every rustle 
their own apparel one after another the fair
prisoners glided down the winding stair
under the guidance roland grime and
were received at the wicketgate by henry
seyton and the churchman the former
seemed instantly to take upon himself the
whole direction the enterprize my
lord abbot he said give my sister your
armi will conduct the queensland the
youth will have the honour to guide lady
fleming
this was no time to dispute the arrangement
although it was not that which roland
graeme would have chosen catherine
seyton who well knew the garden path
 the abbot
tripped on before like a sylph rather leading
the abbot than receiving assistance 
the queen her native spirit prevailing over
female fear and a thousand painful reflections
moved steadily forward by assistance
 henry seyton while the lady fleming
encumbered with her fears and her helplessness
roland graeme who followed in the
rear and who bore under the other arm a
packet necessaries belonging to the queen
the door the garden which communicated
with the shore the islet yielded to one
 the keys which roland had possessed
himself although not until he had tried several
 a moment anxious terror and expectation
the ladies were then partly led
partly carried to the side the lake where a
boat with six rowers attended them the men
couched along the bottom to secure them
from observation henry seyton placed
the queen in the stern the abbot offered
to assist catherine but she was seated by
the queen's side before he could utter his
proffer help j and roland graeme was
the abbot 
just lifting lady fleming over the boatside
when a thought suddenly occurred to
him and exclaiming forgotten forgotten
 wait me but one half minute he replaced
on the shore the helpless lady the
bedchamber threw the queen's packet into
the boat and sped back through the garden
with the noiseless speed a bird on the
wing
 by heaven he is false at last said
seyton i ever feared it 
 he is as true said catherine as
heaven itself and that i will maintain
 be silent minion said her brother
for shame if not for fear fellows put off
and row for your lives
help me help me on board i said the
deserted lady fleming and that louder
than prudence warranted
put off put off cried henry seyton 
leave all behind so the queen is safe
will you permit this madam said
catherine imploringly you leave your
deliverer to death
vol ni m
 the abbot
i will not said the queen seton
i command you to stay at every risk
 pardon me madam if i disobey said
the intractable young man and with one
hand lifting in lady fleming he begun
himself to push off the boat
she was two fathoms length from the
shore and the rowers were getting her
head round when roland graeme arriving
bounded from the beach and attained the
boat overturning seyton on whom he
lighted the youth swore a deep but suppressed
oath and stopping grseme as he
stepped towards the stern said your
place is not with highborn dames keep at
the head and trim the vessel now give
way give way row for god and the
queen 
the rowers obeyed and began to puh
vigorously
why did ye not muffle the oars said
island graeme the dash must awaken
the sentinel row lads and get out 
shot for had not old hildebrand the warthe
abbot 
dep supped upon poppyporridge this
whispering must have waked him
 it was all thine own delay said seyton
 thou shalt reckon with me hereafter
for that and other matters
but roland's apprehension was verified
too instantly to permit him to reply the
dentine whose slumbering had withstood
the whispering was alarmed by the dash 
the oars his challenge was instantly
heard a boat a boat bring to or i
shoot and as they continued to ply their
oar he called aloud treason treason 
rung the bell the castle and discharged
his marquess at the boat the ladies
crowded on each other like startled wildfowl
at the flash and report the piece
while the men urged the rowers to the utmost
speed they heard more than one
ball whiz along the surface the lake at
no great distance from their httle bark and
from the lights which glanced like meteors
from window to window it was evident
 the abbot
the whole castle was alarmed and their escape
discovered
pull again exclaimed seyton stretch
to your oars or i will spur you to the task
with my dagger they will launch a boat
immediately
that is cared for said roland i
locked gate and wicket on them when i
went back and no boat will stir from the
island this night if doors good oak and
bolts iron can keep men within stonewalls
 and now i resign my office 
porter lochleven and give the keys to
the kelpie's keeping
as the heavy keys plunged in the lake
the abbot who till then had been repeating
his prayers exclaimed now bless
thee my son for thy ready prudence puts
shame on us all
 knew said mary drawing her breath
more freely as they were now out reach
 the musketry knew my squire's
truth promptitude and sagacity i must
the abbot 
have him dear friends with my no less
true knights douglas and seaton but
where then is douglas 
 here madam answered the deep and
melancholy voice the boatman who sate
next her and who acted as steersman
alas was it you who stretched your
body before me said the queen when
the balls were raining around us 
 believe you said he in a low tone
that douglas would have resigned to anyone
the chance protecting his queen's
life with his own
the dialogue was here interrupted by a
shot or two from one those small pieces
 artillery called falconets then used in
defending castles the shot was too vague
to have any effect but the broader flash
the deeper sound the louder return which
was made by the midnight echoes benparty
terrified and imposed silence on the
liberated prisoners the boat was alongside
 a rude quay or landing place running
out from a garden considerable 
the abbot
tent ere any them again attempted to
speak they landed and while the abbot
returned thanks aloud to heaven which
had thus far favoured their enterprise douglas
enjoyed the best reward his desperate
undertaking in conducting the queen
to the house the gardener yet not unmindful
 roland graeme even in that
moment terror and exhaustion mary
expressly commanded seyton to give his
assistance to fleming while catherine voluntarily
and without bidding took the arm
 the page seyton presently resigned
lady fleming to the care the abbot
alleging he must look after their horses 
and his attendants disencumbering themselves
 their boatcloaks hastened to assist
him
while mary spent in the gardener's cottage
the few minutes which were necessary
to prepare the steeds for their departure
she perceived in a corner the old man to
whom the garden belonged and called him
th abbot 
ta approach he came as it were with reluctance

 how brother said the abbot so slow
to welcome thy royal queen and mistress
to liberty and to her kingdom 
the old man thus admonished came forward
and in good terms speech gave
her grace joy her deliverance the
queen returned him thanks in the most
gracious manner and added it will remain
to us to after some immediate reward
for your fidelity for we wot well your hous
has been long the refuge in which our trusty
servants have met to concert measures for
our freedom so saying she offered gold
and added we will consider your services
more fully hereafter
kneel brother said the abbot kneel
instantly and thank her grace's kindness
 good brother that wert once a few
steps under me and art still many years
younger replied the gardener pettishly
 let me do mine acknowledgments in my
own way queens have knelt to me ere
 the abbot
now and in truth my knees are too old and
stiff to bend even to this lovelyfaced lady
may it please your grace if your grace's
servants have occupied my house so that i
could not call it mine own if they have
trodden down my flowers in the zeal 
their midnight comings and goings and destroyed
the hope the fruit season by
bringing their warhorses into my garden i
do but crave your grace in requital
that you will chuse your residence as far
from me as possible i am an old man
who would willingly creep to my grave as
easily as he can in peace good will and
quiet labour
 and
with whom art thou brawling unless my
n
 the abbot
eyes spell that token false it is with the
very youth who aided me so gallantly in
the skirmish with the leslie let me look
fair youth at the medal which thou dearest
in thy cap by saint bennet it is the
same henry i command thee to forbear
him as thou lowest my blessing
and as you honour my command said
the queen good service hath he done
me
ay madam replied young seyton
as when he carried the billet inclosed in
the swordsheath to lochleven marry the
good youth knew no more than a packhorse
what he was carrying
but i who dedicated him to this great
work said magdalen grasme i by
whose advice and agency this just heir hath
been unloosed from her thraldom i who
spared not the last remaining hope a falling
house in this great action i at least
knew and counselled and what merit maybe
mine let the reward most gracious
queen descend upon this youth my mithe
abbot 
ministry here is ended you are free a sovereign
princess at the head a gallant
army surrounded by valiant barons my
service could avail you no farther but
might well prejudice you your fortune
now rests upon men's hearts and men's
swords may they prove as trusty as the
faith women 
you will not leave us mother said
the queen you whose practices in our
favour were so powerful who dared so
many dangers and wore so many disguises
to blind our enemies and to confirm our
friends you will not leave us in the dawn
 our reviving fortunes ere we have time
to know and to thank you 
you cannot know her answered magdalen
greene who knows not herself 
there are times when in this woman's frame
 mine there is the strength him 
gath in this overtoiled brain the wisdom
 the most sage counsellor and again the
mist is on me and my strength is veak
 the abbot
ness my wisdom folly i have spoken before
princes and cardinals ay noble princess
even before the princes thine own
house lorraine and i know not whence
the words persuasion came which flowed
from my lips and were drunk in by
their ears and now even when i most
need words persuasion there is something
which choaks my voice and robs me
 utterance
if there be aught in my power to do
thee pleasure said the queen the barely
naming it shall avail as well as all thine
eloquence
 sovereign lady replied the enthusiast
 it shames me that at this high moment
something human frailty should
cling to one whose vows the saints have
heard whose labours in the rightful cause
heaven has prospered but it will be thus
while the living spirit is shrine in the clay
 mortality i will yield to the folly she
said weeping as she spoke and it shall
the abbot 
be the last then seizing roland's hand
she led him to the queen's feet kneeling
herself upon one knee and causing him to
kneel on both mighty princess she
said look on this flower it was found
by a kindly stranger on a bloody field 
battle and long it was ere my anxious eyes
saw and my arms pressed all that was left
 my only daughter for your sake and
for that the holy faith we both profess
i could leave this plant while it was yet
tender to the nurture strangers ay
 enemies to whom perchance his blood
would have been as wine had the heretic
glendinning known that he had in his
house the heir julian avenel since
then i have seen him only in a few hours
 doubt and dread and now i part with
the child my love for ever for ever 
o for every weary step i have made in
your rightful cause in this and in foreign
lands give protection to the child whom i
must no more call mine 
 the abbot
i swear to you mother said the
queen deeply affected that for your
sake and his own his happiness and fortunes
shall be our charge 
i thank you daughter princes said
magdalen and pressed her lips first to the
queen's hand then to the brow her
grandson and now she said drying
her tears and rising with dignity earth
has had its own and heaven claims the
rest lioness scotland go forth and
conquer and if the prayers a devoted
votaress can avail thee they will rise in
many a land and from many a distant
shrine i will glide like a ghost from land
to land from temple to temple and where
the very name my country is unknown
the priests shall ask who is the queen 
that distant northern land for whom the
aged pilgrim was so fervent in prayer farewell
 honour be thine and earthly prosperity
if it be the will god if not may
the penance thou shalt do here ensure thee
the abbot 
happiness hereafter let no one speak or
follow me my resolution is taken my
vow cannot be cancelled
she glided from their presence as she
spoke and her last look was upon her beloved
grandchild he would have risen
and followed but the queen and lord
seyton interfered
press not on her now said lord seyton
 if you would not lose her for ever
many a time have we seen the sainted mother
and often at the most needful moment
 but to press on her privacy or to
thwart her purpose is a crime which she
cannot pardon i trust we shall yet see herat
her need a holy woman she is for certain
and dedicated wholly to prayer and
penance and hence the heretics hold her
as distracted while catholics deem her a
saint
let me then hope said the queen
that you my lord will aid me in the execution
 her last request
 the abbot
what in the protection my young
second cheerfully that is in all that your
majesty can think it fitting to ask me 
henry give thy hand ripon the instant to
roland avenel for so i presume he must
now be called
and shall be lord the barony
said the queen if god prosper our rightful
arms
it can only be to restore it to my kind
protectress who now holds it said young
avenel i would rather be landless all
my life than she lost a rood ground by
me
nay said the queen looking to lord
seyton his mind matches his birth 
henry thou hast not yet given thy hand
it is his said henry giving it with
some appearance courtesy but whispering
roland at the same time for all
this thou hast not my sister's
may it please your grace said lord
seyton now that these passages are over
the abbot 
to honour our poor meal time it were
that our banners were reflected in the
clyde we must to horse with as little
stop as may be
 the abbot
chapter x
ay sir our ancient crown in these wild times
oft stood upon a cast the gamester's ducat
so often staked and lost and then regain'd
scarce knew so many hazards
the spanish father
it is not our object to enter into the historical
part the reign the illfated mary
or to recount how during the week which
succeeded her flight from lochleven her
partizans mustered around her with their
followers forming a gallant army amounting
to six thousand men so much light
has been lately thrown on the most minute
details the period by mr chalmers in his
valuable history queen mary that the
reader may be safely referred to it for the
most full information which ancient records
afford concerning that interesting time it
the abbot 
is sufficient for our purpose to say that
while mary's headquarters were at hamilton
the regent and his adherents had in
the king's name assembled a host at glasgow
inferior indeed to that the queen
in numbers but formidable from the military
talents murray morton the laird
 grange and others who had been trained
from their youth in foreign and domestic
wars
in these circumstances it was the obvious
policy queen mary to avoid a conflict
secure that were her person once in
safety the number her adherents must
daily increase whereas the forces those
opposed to her must as had frequentlyhap
opened in the previous history her reign
have diminished and their spirits become
broken and so evident was this to her
counsellors that they resolved their first
step should be to place the queen in the
strong castle dumbarton there to await
the course events the arrival succours
from france and the levies which
a the abbot
were made by her adherents in every province
 scotland accordingly orders
were given that all men should be on horseback
or on foot apparelled in their armour
and ready to follow the queen's standard
in array battle the avowed determination
being to escort her to the castle 
dumbarton in defiance her enemies
the muster was made upon hamiltonmoor
and rhe march commenced in all the
pomp feudal times military music sounded
banners and pennons waved armour
glittered far and wide and spears glanced
and twinkled like stars in a frosty sky the
gallant spectacle warlike parade was ou
this occasion dignified by the presence 
the queen herself who with a fair retinue
 ladies and household attendants and a
special guard gentlemen amongst whom
young seyton and roland were distinguished
gave grace at once and confidence to
the army which spread its ample filesbefore
around and behind her many churchmen
also joined the cavalcade most whom did
the abbot 
not scruple to assume arms and declare
their intention wielding them in defence
 mary and the catholic faith not so the
abbot saint mary's roland lead not
seen this prelate since the night their
escape from lochleven and he now beheld
him robed in the dress his order assume
his station near the queen's person roland
hastened to pull off his basket and beseech
the abbot's blessing
thou hast it my son said the priest 
i see thee now under thy true name and
in thy rightful garb the helmet with the
holly branch befits your brows well i have
long waited for the hour thou shouldst assume
it
 then you knew my descent my
good father said roland
 i did so but it was under seal confession
from thy grandmother nor was i
at liberty to tell the secret till she herself
should make it known
 her reason for such secrecy my father
 said roland avenel
 the abbot
 fear perchance my brother amistaken
fear for halbert would not to ensure
himself a kingdom wrong an orphan j
besides that your title in quiet times even
had your father done your mother that justice
which i well hope he did could not
have competed with that my brother's
wife the child julian's elder brother
they need fear no competition from
mesaidavenel scotland is wide enough
and there are many manors to win without
plundering my benefactor but prove tome
my reverend father that my father was
just to my mother shew me that i may
call myself a legitimate avenel and make
me your bounden slave for ever
 ay replied the abbot i hear the
seytons hold thee cheap for that stain on
thy shield something however i have
learnt from the late abbot boniface which
if it prove sooth may redeem that reproach

tell me that blessed news said roland
 and the future service my life
the abbot 
rash boy said the abbot i should
but madden thine impatient temper by exciting
hopes that may never be fulfilled 
and is this a time for them think on what
perilous march we are bound and if thou
hast a sin unconfessed neglect not the only
leisure which heaven may perchance afford
thee for confession and absolution
there will be time enough for both i
trust when we reach dumbarton answered
the page
ay said the abbot thou lowest
as loudly as the rest but we are not yet at
dumbarton and there is a lion in the path
mean you murray morton and the
other rebels at glasgow my reverend father
tush they dare not look on the royal
banner
even so replied the abbot speak
many those who are wiser than thou i
have returned from the southern shires
where i left many a chief name arming
in the queen's interest i left the lords
 the abbot
here wise and considerate men i find them
madmen on my return they are willing for
mere pride and vain glory to brave the
enemy and to carry the queen as it were
in triumph past the walls glasgow and
under the beards the adverse army 
seldom does heaven smile on such mistimed
confidence we shall be encountered
and that to the purpose
 and so much the better replied roland
 the field battle was my cradle
 beware it be not thy dyingbed said
the abbot but what avails it whispering
to young wolves the dangers the chace 
you will know perchance ere this day is
out what yonder men are whom you hold
in rash contempt
why what are they said henry seyton
who now joined them have they sinews
 wire and flesh iron will lead
pierce and steel cut them if so reverent
father we have little to fear
they are evil men said the abbot
the abbot s
but the trade war demands no saints
murray and morton are known to be the
best generals in scotland no one ever saw
lindsay or ruthven's back kirkaldy 
grange was named by the constable montmorency
the first soldier in europe my
brother too good a name for such a cause
has been far and wide known for a soldier
 the better the better said seyton
triumphantly we shall have all these traitors
 rank and name in a fair field before
us our cause is the best our numbers are
the strongest our hearts and limbs match
theirs saint bennet and set on 
the abbot made no reply but seemed
lost in reflection and his anxiety in some
measure communicated itself to roland
avenel who ever as their line march led
over a ridge or an eminence cast an anxious
look towards the towers glasgow as
if he expected to see symptoms the enemy
issuing forth it was not that he feared
the fight but the issue was such deep
vol iii o
 the abbot
import to his country and to himself that
the natural fire his spirit burned with a
less lively though with a more intense glow
love honour fame fortune all seemed to
depend on the issue one field rashly hazarded
perhaps but now likely to become
unavoidable
when at length their march came to be
nearly parallel with the city glasgow
roland became sensible that the high
grounds before them were already in part
occupied by a force shewing like their own
the royal banner scotland and on the
point being supported by columns infantry
and squadrons horse which the
city gates had poured forth and which hastily
advanced to sustain those troops who
already possessed the ground in front the
queen's army horseman after horseman
galloped in from the advanced guard with
tidings that murray had taken the field
with his whole army that his object was to
intercept the queen's march and his purpose
unquestionable to hazard a battle it
the abbot 
was now that the tempers men were subjected
to a sudden and a severe trial and
that those who had too presumptuously concluded
that they would pass without combat
were something disconcerted when at
once and with little time to deliberate
they found themselves placed in front a
resolute enemy their chiefs immediately
assembled around the queen and held a
hasty council war mary's quivering lip
confessed the fear which she endeavoured
to conceal under a bold and dignified demeanour
but her efforts were overcome
by painful recollections the disastrous
issue her last appearance in arras at 
 and when she meant to have
asked them their advice for ordering the
battle she involuntarily enquired whether
there were no means escaping without
an engagement
 escaping answered the lord seyton
 when i stand as one to ten your highness's
enemies i may think escape but
never while i stand with three to two
 the abbot
battle battle exclaimed the assembled
lords we will drive the rebels from
their vantage ground as the hound turns
the hare on the hill side
 methinks my noble lords said the
abbot it were as well to prevent his
gaining that advantage our road lies
through yonder hamlet on the brow and
whichever party hath the luck to possess
it with its little gardens and enclosures
will attain a post great defence
the reverend father is right said the
queen o haste thee seyton haste and
get thither before them they are marching
like the wind
seyton bowed low and turned his horse's
head your highness honours me he
said i will instantly press forward and
seize the pass
 not before me my lord whose charge
is the command the van guard said
the lord arbroath
before you or any hamilton in scotthe
abbot 
land said the ssy ton having the q been's
command follow me gentlemen my vassals
and kinsmen saint bennet and seton
i
and follow me said arbroath my
noble kinsmen and brave mentenants we
will see which will first reach the post 
danger for god and queen mary 
illomened haste and most unhappy
strife said the abbot who saw them and
their followers rush hastily and emulously
to ascend the height without waiting till
their men were placed in order and
you gentlemen he continued addressing
roland and seyton who were each
about to follow those who hastened thus disorderly
to the conflict will you leave the
queen's person unguarded 
o leave me not gentlemen said the
queen roland and seyton do not leave
me there are enough arms to strike in
this fell combat withdraw not those to
whom i trust for my safety
s the abbot
we may not leave her grace said roland
looking at seyton and turning his
horse
 i ever looked when thou wouldst find
out that rejoined the fiery youth
roland made no answer but bit his lip
till the blood came and spurring his horse
up to the side catherine sey ton's palfrey
he whispered in a low voice i never
thought to have done aught to deserve you 
but this day i have heard myself upbraided
with cowardice and my sword remained
still sheathed and all for the love you
there is madness among us all said
the damsel my father my brother and
you are all alike bereft reason ye should
think only this poor queen and you are
all inspired by your own absurd jealousies
the monk is the only soldier and man
 sense amongst you all my lord abbot
she cried aloud were it not better
we should draw to the westward and wait
the event that god shall send us instead
 remaining here in the highway endan
the abbot 
gearing the queen's person and cumbering
the troops in their advance 
you say well my daughter replied the
abbot had we but one to guide us where
the queen's person may be in safety our
nobles hurry to the conflict without casting
a thought on the very cause the
war
follow me said a knight or manatarms
well mounted and attired completely
in black armour but having the visor 
his helmet closed and bearing no crest on
his helmet or device upon his shield
 we will follow no stranger said the
abbot without some warrant his
truth
 i am a stranger and in your hands
said the horseman if you wish to know
more me the queen herself will be your
warrant
the queen had remained fixed to the
spot as if disabled by fear yet mechanically
smiang bowing and waving her hand
 the abba
as banners were lowered and spears depressed
before her while emulating the strife
betwixt seyton and arbroath band on band
pressed forward their march towards the
enemy scarce however had the black
rider whispered something in her ear than
she assented to what he said and when
he spoke aloud and with an air command
 gentlemen it is the queen's pleasure
that you should follow me mary uttered
with something like eagerness the
word yes
all were in motion in an instant for the
black horseman throwing off a sort apathy
 manner which his first appearance indicated
spurred his horse to and fro making
him take such active bounds and short turns
as shewed the rider master the animal 
and getting thequeen's little retinue some
order for marching he led them to the left
directing his course towards a castle which
crowning a gentle yet commanding eminence
presented an extensive view over
the abbot 
the country beneath and in particular
commanded a view those heights which
both armies hastened to occupy and which
it was now apparent must almost instantly
be the scene struggle and dispute
yonder towers said the abbot questioning
the sable horseman to whom do
they belong and are they now in the
hands friends
they are untenanted replied the
stranger or at least they have no hostile
inmates but urge these youths sir abbot
to make more haste this is but an
evil time to satisfy their idle curiosity by
peering out upon the battle in which they
are to take no share
 the worse luck mine said henry
seyton who overheard him i would rather
be under my father's banner at this
moment than be made chamberlain 
for this my present duty peaceful
ward well and patiently discharged
your place under your father's banner
o 
 the abbot
will shortly be right dangerous said roland
avenel who pressing his horse towards
the westward had still his look reverted
to the armies for i see yonder
body cavalry which presses from the
eastward will reach the village ere lord
seyton can gain it
they are but cavalry said seyton
looking attentively they cannot hold the
village without shot marquess
look more closely said roland you
will see that each these horsemen who
advance so rapidly from glasgow carries a
a footman behind him
now by heaven he speaks well said
the black cavalier one you two must
go carry the news to lord seyton and lord
arbroath that they hasten not their horsemen
on before the foot but advance more
regularly
be that my errand said roland for
i first marked the stratagem the enemy
but by your leave said seyton
the abbot 
yonder is my father's banner engaged
and it best becomes me to go to the rescue
i will stand by the queen's decision
said roland avenel
what new appeal what new quarrel 
said queen mary are there not in yonder
dark host enemies enough to mary
stuart but must her very friends turn enemies
to each other 
nay madam said roland the young
master seyton and i did but dispute
who should leave your person to do a most
needful message to the host he thought
his rank entitled him and i deemed that
the person least consequence being myself
were better perilled
not so said the queen if one
must leave me be it seyton
henry seyton bowed till the white plumes
on his helmet mixed with the flowing mane
 his gallant warhorse then placed himself
firm in the saddle shook his lance aloft
with an air triumph and determination
and striking his horse with the spurs made
s the abbot
towards his father's banner which was still
advancing up the hill and dashed his steed
over every obstacle that occurred in his
headlong path
my brother my father exclaimed
catherine with an expression agonized
apprehension they are in the midst 
peril and i in safety 
would to god said roland that i
were with them and could ransom every
drop their blood by two mine i
do i not know thou dost wish it
said catherine can a woman say to a
man what i have well nigh said to thee
and yet think that he could harbour fear
or faintness heart there is that in
yon distant sound approaching battle
that pleases me even while it affright me
i would i were a man that i might feel
that stern delight without the mixture 
terror i
ride up ride up lady catherine seyton
cried the abbot as they still swept
on at a rapid pace and were now close bethe
abbot 
neath the walls the castle ride up
and aid lady fleming to support the queen
she gives way more and more
they halted and lifted mary from the
saddle and were about to support her towards
the castle when she said faintly
 not there not there these walls will i
never enter more 
be a queen madam said the abbot
and forget that you are a woman
o i must forget much much more answered
the unfortunate mary in an undertone
 ere i can look with steady eyes on
these wellknown scenes i must forget the
days which i spent here as the bride the
lost the murthered 
 thesis the castle crookstone said
the lady fleming in which the queen
held her first court after she was married
to darnley
heaven said the abbot thy hand
is upon us bear yet up madam your
foes are the foes holy church and god
 the abbot
will this day decide whether scotland shall
be catholic or heretic
a heavy and continued fire cannon
and musketry bore a tremendous burthen
to his words and seemed far more than
they to recal the spirits the queen 
to yonder tree she said pointing to
a yew tree which grew on a small mount
close to the castle i know it well 
from thence you may see a prospect wide
as from the peaks schehallion
and freeing herself from her assistants
she walked with a determined yet somewhat
wild step up to the stem the noble
yew the abbot catherine and roland
avenel followed her while lady fleming
kept back the inferior persons her train
the black horseman also followed the
queen waiting on her as closely as the
shadow upon the light but ever remaining
at the distance two or three yards he
folded his arms on his bosom turned his
back to the battle and seemed solely occur
abbot 
pied by gazing on mary through the bars
 his closed vizor the queen regarded
him not but fixed her eyes upon the spreading
yew
 ay fair and stately tree she said as
if at the sight it she had been rapt away
from the present scene and had overcome
the horror which had oppressed her at the
first approach to crookstone there thou
stances gay and goodly as ever though
thou hearest the sounds war instead 
the vows love all is gone since i last
greeted thee love and lover vows and
vower king and kingdom how goes the
field my lord abbot with us i trustyet
what but evil can mary's eyes witness
from this spot i
her attendants eagerly bent their eyes
on the field battle but could discover
nothing more than that it was obstinately
debated the small inclosures and cottage
gardens in the village vhich they had a
full and commanding view and which lately
lay with their lines sycamore and ashsis
the abbot
trees so still and quiet in the mild light 
a may sun were now each converted into
a line fire canopied by smoke and the
sustained and constant report the musketry
and cannon mingled with the shouts
 the meeting combatants shewed that as
yet neither party had given ground
 many a soul finds its final departure to
heaven or hell in these awful thunders
said the abbot let those that believe in
the holy church join me in orisons for
victory in this dreadful combat
 not here not here said the unfortunate
queen pray not here father or
pray in silence my mind is too much torn
between the past and the present to dare
to approach the heavenly throne or if ye
will pray be it for one whose fondest affections
have been her greatest crimes and
who has ceased to be a queen only because
she was a deceived and a tenderhearted
woman
were it not well said roland that
the abbot 
i rode somewhat nearer the hosts and saw
the fate the day 
 do so in the name god said the
abbot for if our friends are scattered
our flight must be hasty but beware thou
approach not too nigh the conflict there is
more than thine own life depends on thy
safe return
 o go not too nigh said catherine j
but fail not to see how the seytons fight
and how they bear themselves
 fear nothing i will be on my guard
said ronald avenel and without waiting
further answer rode towards the scene 
conflict keeping as he rode the higher
and uninclosed ground and ever looking
cautiously around him for fear involving
himself in some hostile party as he approached
the shots rung sharp and more
sharply on his ear the shouts came wilder
and wilder and he felt that thick beating
 the heart that mixture natural apprehension
intense curiosity and anxiety for
the dubious event which even the bravest
 the abbot
experience when they approach alone to a
scene interest and danger
at length he drew so close that from a
bank screened by bushes and underwood he
could distinctly see where the struggle was
most keenly maintained this was in a hollow
way leading to the village up which the
queen's vanguard had marched with more
hasty courage than well advised conduct
for the purpose possessing themselves 
that post vantage but they found the
hedges and inclosures already occupied by
the enemy led by the celebrated kirkcaldy
 grange and the earl morton and
not small was the loss which they sustained
while struggling forward to come to close
with the menatarms on the other side
but as the queen's followers were chiefly
noblemen and barons with their kinsmen
and followers they had pressed onwards
contemning obstacles and danger and had
when roland arrived on the ground met
hand to hand at the gorge the pass with
the regent's vanguard and endeavoured to
the abbot 
bear them out the village at the spearpoint
 while their foes equally determined
to keep the advantage which they had attained
struggled with the like obstinacy to
drive back the assailants
both parties were on foot and armed in
proof so that when the long lances the
front ranks were fixed in each other's shields
corslet and breastplates the struggle resembled
that two bulls who fixing their
frontlets hard against each other remain in
that posture for hours until the superior
strength or obstinacy the one compels
the other to take to flight or bears him
down to the earth thus locked together
in the deadly struggle which swayed slowly
to and fro as one or other party gained
the advantage those who fell were trampled
on alike by friends and foes those whose
weapons were broken retired from the front
rank and had their place supplied by others 
while the rearward ranks unable otherwise
to take share in the combat fired their 
the abbot
told and hurled their daggers and the
points and truncheons the broken weapons
like javelins against the enemy
 god and the queen resounded from
the one party god and the king thundered
from the other while in the name 
their sovereign fellowsubjects shed each
other's blood and in the name their
creator defaced his image amid the tumult
was often heard the voices the captains
shouting their commands leaders
and chiefs crying their gathering words j
 groans and shrieks from the falling and
the dying
the strife had lasted nearly an hour the
strength both parties seemed exhausted
but their rage was unabated and their obstinacy
unsubdued when roland who
turned eye and ear to all around him saw
a column infantry headed by a few horsemen
wheel round the base the bank
where he had stationed himself and levelling
their long lances attack the flank 
the abbot 
the queen's vanguard closely engaged as
they were with the conflict on their front
the very first glance shewed him that the
leader who directed this movement was
the knight avenel his ancient master
and the next convinced him that its effect
would be decisive the result the attack
 fresh and unbroken forces upon the
flank those already wearied with a long
and obstinate struggle was indeed instantaneous

the column the assailants which had
hitherto shewn one dark dense and united
line helmets surmounted with plumage
was at once broken and hurled in confusion
down the hill which they had so long endeavoured
to gain in vain were the leaders
heard calling upon their followers to stand
to the combat and seen personally resisting
when all resistance was evidently vain
they were slain or felled to the earth or
hurried backwards by the mingled tide 
flight and pursuit what were roland's
feelings on beholding the rout and feeling
 the abbot
that all that remained for him was to turn
bridle and endeavour to ensure the safety
 the queen's person yet keen as his
grief and shame might be they were both
forgotten when almost close beneath the
bank which he occupied he saw henry
seyton forced away from his own party in
the tumult covered with dust and blood
and defending himself desperately against
several the enemy who had gathered
around him attracted by his gay armour
roland paused not a moment but pushing
his steed down the bank leaped him amongst
the hostile party dealt three or four blows
amongst them which struck down two and
made the rest stand aloof then reaching
seyton his hand he exhorted him to seize
fast on his horse's mane
we live or die together this day said
he keep but fast hold till we are out 
the press and then my horse is yours
seyton heard and exerted his remaining
strength and by their joint efforts roland
brought him out danger and behind the
the abbot 
spot from whence he had witnessed the disastrous
conclusion the fight but no
sooner were they under shelter the trees
than seyton let go his hold and in spite 
roland's efforts to support him fell at length
on the turf trouble yourself no more
with me he said this is my first and my
last battle and i have already seen too
much it to wish to see the close hasten
to save the queen and commend me to
catherine she will never more be mistaken
for me nor i for her the last swordstroke
has made an eternal distinction
 let me aid you to mount my horse
said roland eagerly and you may yet
be saved i can find my own way on foot 
turn but my horse's head westward and he
will carry you fleet and easy as the wind
i will never mount steed more said
the youth farewell i love thee better
dying than ever thought to have done
while in life i would that old man's blood
were not on my hand sancti benedicite
 the abbot
ora pro me stand not to look on a dying
man but haste to save the queen
these words were spoken with the last
effort his voice and scarce were they
uttered ere the speaker was no more they
recalled roland to the sense the duty
which he had wellnigh forgotten but they
did not reach his ears only
the queen where is the queen 
said halbert glendinning who followed
by two or three horsemen appeared at this
instant roland made no answer but turning
his horse and confiding in his speed
gave him at once rein and spur and rode
over height and hollow towards the castle
 crookstone more heavily armed and
mounted upon a horse less speed sir
halbert glendinning followed with couched
lance calling out as he rode sir with
the hollybranch halt and shew your right
to bear that badge fly not thus cowardly
nor dishonour the cognizance thou deserves
not to wear halt sir coward or by heath
abbot 
even i will strike thee with my lance on the
back and slay thee like a dastard i am
the knight avenel i am halbert glendining

but roland who had no purpose encountering
his old master and who besides
knew the queen's safety depended on his
making the best speed he could answered
not a word to the defiances and reproaches
which sir halbert continued to throw out
against him but making the best use his
spurs rode yet harder than before and had
gained about a hundred yards upon his
pursuer when coming near to the yew tree
where he had left the queen he saw them
already getting to horse and cried out as
loud as he could foes foes ride for
if fair ladies brave gentlemen do your
devoir to protect them
so saying he wheeled his horse and
avoiding th shock sir halbert blending
charged one his folio wers who was
nearly on a line with him so rudely with
vol iii p
 the abbot
his lance that he overthrew horse and man
he then drew his sword and attacked the
second while the black manatarms throwing
himself in the way glendinning they
rushed on each other so fiercely that both
horses were overthrown and the riders lay
rolling on the plain neither was able to
arise for the black horseman was pierced
through with glendinning's lance and the
knight avenel oppressed with the
weight his own horse and sorely bruised
besides seemed in little better plight than
he whom he had mortally wounded
yield thee sir knight avenel rescue
or no rescue said roland who had
put a second antagonist out condition to
combat and hastened to prevent blending
from renewing the conflict
 may not chuse but yield said sir
halbert since i can no longer fight but
it shames me to speak such a word to a
coward like thee
call me not coward said roland
lifting his visor and helping his prisoner to
the abbot 
rise since but for old kindness at thy
hand and yet more at thy lady's i had
met thee as a brave man should
 the favourite page my wife said
sir halbert astonished ah wretched
boy i have heard thy treason at lochleven

reproach him not my brother said
the abbot he was but an agent in the
hands heaven
 to horse to horse said catherine
seyton mount and be gone or we are all
lost i see our gallant army flying for many
a league to horse my lord abbot to
horse roland my gracious liege to
horse ere this we should have ridden a
mile
 look on these features said mary
pointing to the dying knight who had been
unheeded by some compassionate hand 
 look there and tell me if she who ruins
all who love her ought to fly a foot farther
to save her wretched life
the reader must have long anticipated
 the abbot
the discovery which the queen's feelings
had made before her eyes confirmed it it
was the features the unhappy george
douglas on which death was stamping his
mark
 look look at him well said the
queen thus has it been with all who loved
mary stuart the royalty francis
the wit chaplet the power and gallantry
 the gay gordon the melody rizzio
the portly form and youthful grace darnley
the bold address and courtly manners
 bothwell and now the deepdevoted
passion the noble douglas nought could
save them they looked on the wretched
mary and to have loved her was crime
enough to deserve early death no sooner
had the victim formed a kind thought me
than the poisoned cup the axe and block
the dagger the mine were ready to punish
them for casting away affection on such a
wretch as i am importune me not i will
fly no farther i can die but once and i
will die here
the abbot 
while she spoke her tears fell fast on
the face the dying man who continued
to fix his eyes on her with an eagerness 
passion which death itself could hardly
subdue mourn not for me he said
faintly but care for your own safety i
die a douglas and i die pitied by mary
stuart i
he expired with these words and without
withdrawing his eyes from her face and
the queen whose heart was that soft
and gentle mould which in domestic life
and with a more suitable partner than darnley
might have made her happy remained
weeping by the dead man until recalled to
herself by the abbot who found it necessary
to use a style unusual remonstrance
 we also madam he said we your
grace's devoted followers have friends and
relatives to weep for i leave a brother in
eminent jeopardy the husband the lady
fleming the father and brothers the
lady catherine are all in yonder bloody
field slain it is to be feared or prisoners
 the abbot
we forget the fate our own nearest and
dearest to wait on our queen and she is
too much occupied with her own sorrows
to give one thought to ours
 i deserve not your reproach father
said the queen checking her tears but
i am docile to it where must we go 
what must we do 
 we must fly and that instantly said
the abbot whither is not so easily answered
but we may dispute it upon the
road lift her to her saddle and set forward

they set off accordingly roland lingered
a moment to command the attendants
 the knight avenel to the castle
 crookstone and to say that he demanded
from him no other condition liberty than
his word that he and his followers would
keep secret the direction in which the
queen fled as he turned his rein to depart
the honest countenance adam woodcock
stared upon him with an expression
 surprise which at another time would
the abbot 
have excited his hearty mirth he had
been one the followers who had experienced
the weight roland's arm and they
now knew each other roland having put
up his vizor and the good yeoman having
thrown away his barret cap with the iron
bars in front that he might the more readily
assist his master into this barretcap as
it lay on the ground roland forgot not
to drop a few gold pieces fruits the
queen's liberality and with a signal 
kind recollection and enduring friendship
he departed at full gallop to overtake the
queen the dust raised by her train being
already far down the hill
it is not fairymoney said honest
adam weighing and handling the gold 
and it is master roland himself that is
a certain thing the same open hand and
by our lady shrugging his shoulders
the same ready fist my lady will hear
 this gladly for she mourns for him as if
he were her son and to see how gay he
is but these light lads are as sure to be
 the abbot
uppermost as the froth to be on the top 
the quartpot your man solid parts remains
ever a falconer so saying he went
to aid his comrades who had now come up
in greater numbers to carry his master into
the castle crookstone
the abbot s
chapter xi
my native land good night
byron
many a bitter tear was shed during the
hasty flight queen mary over fallen
hopes future prospects and slaughtered
friends the deaths the brave douglas
and the fiery but gallant young seyton
seemed to affect the queen as much as the
fall from the throne on which she had so
nearly been again seated catherine seyton
devoured in secret her own grief anxious
to support the broken spirits her
mistress and the abbot bending his anxious
thoughts upon futurity endeavoured in
vain to form some plan which had a shadow
 hope the spirit young roland for
p
 the abbot
he also mingled in the hasty debates held
by the companions the queen's flight
continued unchecked and unbroken
your majesty he said has lost a battle
 your ancestor bruce lost seven successively
ere he sat triumphant on the
scottish throne and proclaimed with the
voice a victor in the field bannockburn
the independence his country are
not these heaths which we may traverse at
will better than the locked guarded and
lake moaned castle lochleven we are
free in that one word there is comfort for
all our losses
he struck a bold note but the heart 
mary made no response
 better she said i had still been in
lochleven than seen the slaughter made
by my rebels among the subjects who offered
themselves to death for my sake speak
not to me further efforts they would
only cost the lives you the friends who
recommend them i would not again unthe
abbot 
tergo what i felt when i saw from yonder
mount the swords the fell horsemen 
morton raging among the faithful seytons
and hamiltons for their loyalty to their
queen i would not again feel what i felt
when douglas's lifeblood stained my mantle
for his love to mary stuart not to be
empress all that britain's seas enclose
find for me some place where i can hide
my unhappy head which brings destruction
on all who love it it is the last favour that
mary asks her faithful followers
in this dejected mood but still pursuing
her flight with unabated rapidity the unfortunate
mary after having been joined
by lord berries and a few followers at
length halted for the first time at the abbey
 dundrennan nearly sixty miles dig
tant from the field battle in this remote
corner galloway the reformation
not having yet been strictly enforced against
the monks a few still lingered in their cells
unmolested j and the prior with tears and
 the abbot
reverence received the fugitive queen at
the gate his convent
i bring you ruin my good father said
the queen as she was lifted from her palfrey

 it is welcome said the prior if it
comes in the train duty
placed on the ground and supported by
her ladies the queen looked for an instant
at her palfrey which jaded and drooping
its head seemed as if it mourned the distresses
 its mistress
 good roland said the queen whispering
let rosabelle be cared for ask thy
heart and it will tell thee why i make this
little request even in this awful hour
she was conducted to her apartment and
in the hurried consultation her attendants
the fatal resolution the retreat to
england was finally adopted in the morning
it received her approbation and a messenger
was dispatched to the english warden
to pray him fox safeconduct and los
the abbot 
vitality on the part the queen scotland
on the next day the abbot walked
in the garden the abbey with roland
to whom he expressed his disapprobation
 the course pursued it is madness and
ruin he said better commit herself to
the savage highlanders or wildbordermen
than to the faith elizabeth a woman to
a rival woman a presumptive successor to
the keeping a jealous queen roland
berries is true and loyal but his counsel
has ruined his mistress
ay ruin follows us every where said
an old man with a spade in his hand and
dressed like a laybrother whose presence
in the vehemence his exclamation
the abbot had not been aware gaze
not on me with such wonder i am he
who was the abbot boniface at kenna
quhair who was the gardener blinkhoolie at
lochleven hunted round to the place in
which i served my noviciate and now yeare
come to rouse me up againa weary
 the abbot
life i have had for one to whom peace was
ever the dearest blessing 
we will soon rid you our company
good father said the abbot and the
queen will i fear me trouble your retreat
no more
nay you said as much before said the
querulous old man rand yet i was put forth
from kinross and pillaged by troopers on
the road they took from me the certificate
that you wot that the baron 
ay he was a mosstrooper like themselves
you asked me it and i could never find
it but they found it it shewed the marriage
 my memory fails me now
see how men differ father nicholas would
have told you an hundred tales the abbot
ingram on whose soul god have mercy
 he was i warrant you fourscore and
six and i am not more than let me see
was not avenel the name you seek
my good father said roland impatiently
yet moderating his tone for fear alarming
or offending the infirm old man
the abbot 
ay right avenel julian avenel 
you are perfect in the name i kept all the
special confessions judging it held with my
vow to do so i could not find it when my
successor ambrosius spoke on't but the
troopers found it and the knight struck
his breast till the target clattered like an
empty wateringcan
saintmary said the abbot ein whom
could such a paper excite such interest 
what was the appearance the knight his
arms his colours 
ye distract me with your questions i
dared hardly look at him they charged me
with bearing letters for the queen and
searched my mail this was all along your
doings at lochleven
 i trust in god said the abbot to roland
who stood beside him shivering and
trembling with impatience the paper has
fallen into the hands my brother i heard
he had been with his followers on the scout
betwixt stirling and glasgow bore not
 the abbot
the knight a holly bough in his helmet 
canst thou not remember 
o remember remember said the
old man pettishly count as many years
as i do if your plots will let you and see
what and how much you remember 
why i scarce remember the pearmains
which i grained here with my own hands
some fifty years since
at this moment a bugle sounded loudly
from the beach
 it is the deathblast to queen mary's
royalty said ambrosius the english
warden's answer has been received favourable
doubtless for when was the door 
the trap closed against the prey which it was
set for droop not roland this matter
shall be sifted to the bottom but we must
not now leave the queen follow me et
us do our duty and trust the issue with god
farewell good father i will visit thee
again soon
he was about to leave the garden fou 
the abbot 
lowed by roland with halfreluctant steps
the ex abbot resumed his spade
i could be sorry for these men he
said ay and for that poor queen but
what avail earthly sorrows to a man fourscore
 and it is a rare dropping morning
for the early colewort
 he is stricken with age said ambrosial
as he dragged roland down to the seabeach
y we must let him take his time to
collectively nothing now can be thought
on but the fate the queen
they soon arrived where she stood surrounded
by her little train and by her side
the sheriff cumberland a gentleman 
the house other richly dressed and
accompanied by soldiers the aspect 
the queen exhibited a singular mixture 
alacrity and reluctance to depart her language
and gestures spoke hope and consolation
to her attendants and she seemed
desirous to persuade even herself that the
step she adopted was secure and that the
assurance she had received kind recept
the abbot
tion was altogether satisfactory but her
quivering lip and unsettled eye betrayed
at once her anguish at departing from scotland
and her fears confiding herself to
the doubtful faith england
welcome my lord abbot said she 
and you roland avenel we have joyful
news for you our loving sister's officer
proffers us in her name a safe asylum from
the rebels who have driven us from our
own only it grieves me we must here part
from you for a short space
 part from us madam said the abbot
j is your welcome in england then
to commence with the abridgment your
train and dismissal your counsellors 
take it not thus good father said
mary the warden and the sheriff faithful
servants our royal sister deem it
necessary to obey her instructions in the
present case even to the letter and can
only admit me with my female attendants
an express will instantly be dispatched
from london assigning me a place rethe
abbot 
silence and i will speedily send to all 
you whenever my court shall be formed
your court formed in england and
while elizabeth lives and reigns said the
abbot that will be when we shall see
two suns in one heaven 
do not think so replied the queen 
 we are well assured our sister's good
faith elizabeth loves fame and not all
that she has won by her power and her wisdom
will equal that which she will acquire
by extending her hospitality to a distressed
sister not all that she may hereafter do
 good wise and great would blot out
the reproach abusing our confidence
farewell my page now my knight farewell
for a brief season i will dry the tears
 catherine or i will weep with her till
neither us can weep longer she held
out her hand to roland who flinging himself
on his knees kissed it with much emotion
he was about to render the same
homage to catherine when the queen assc
the abbot
suing an air sprightliness said her
lips thou foolish boy and catherine coy
it not these english gentlemen should see
that even in our cold clime beauty knows
how to reward bravery and fidelity 
we are not now to learn the force 
scottish beauty or the mettle scottish
valour said the sheriff cumberland
courteously would it were in my power
to bid these attendants upon her who is
herself the mistress scottish beauty as
welcome to england as my poor cares would
make them but our queen's orders are
positive in case such an emergence and
they must not be disputed by her subject
may i remind your majesty that the tide
ebbs fast 
the sheriff took the queen's hand and
she had already placed her foot on the gangway
by which she was to enter the skiff
when the abbot starting from a trance 
grief and astonishment at the words the
sheriff rushed into the water and seized
upon her mantle
the abbot 
she foresaw it she foresaw it he
exclaimed she foresaw your flight into
her realm and foreseeing it gave orders
you should be thus received blinded deceived
doomed princess your fate is sealed
when you quit this strand queen 
scotland thou shalt not leave thine heritage
 he continued holding a still firmer
grasp upon her mantle true men shall
turn rebels to thy will that they may save
thee from captivity or death fear not the
bills and bows whom that gay man has at
his beck we will withstand him by force
o for the arm my warlike brother 
england avenel draw thy sword
the queen stood irresolute and frightened
 one foot upon the plank the other
on the sand her native shore which she
was quitting for ever
 what needs this violence sir priest
said the sheriff cumberland i came
hither at your queen's command to do her
service and i will depart at her least order
if she rejects such aid as i can offer no
 the abbot
marvel is it if our queen's wisdom foresaw
that such chance as this might happen
amidst the turmoils your unsettled state 
and while willing to afford fair hospitality
to her royal sister deemed it wise to prohibit
the entrance a broken army her
followers into the english frontier
you hear said queen mary gently
unloosing her robe from the abbot's grasp
 that we exercise full liberty choice in
leaving this shore and questionless the
choice will remain free to us in going to
france or returning to our own dominions
as we shall determine besides it is
too late your blessing father and godspeed
thee 
may he have mercy on thee and speed
thee also said the abbot retreating
but my soul tells me i look on thee for
the last time 
the sails were hoisted the oars were
plied the vessel went freshly on her way
through the faith which divides the shores
 cumberland from those galloway 
the abbot 
but not till the vessel diminished to the
size a child's frigate did the doubtful
and dejected and dismissed followers the
queen cease to linger on the sands and
long long could they discern the kerchief
 mary as she waved the oftrepeated signal
 adieu to her faithful adherents and
to the shores scotland
if good tidings a private nature could
have consoled roland for parting with his
mistress and for the distresses his sovereign
he received such comfort some days
subsequent to the queen's leaving dunduenna
a breathless post no other than
adam woodcock brought dispatches from
sir halbert glendinning to the abbot
whom he found with roland still residing
at dundrennan and in vain torturing boniface
with fresh interrogations the 
the abbot
et bore an earnest invitation to his brother
to make avenel castle for a time
his residence the clemency the
regent said the writer has extended
pardon both to roland and to you upon
condition your remaining a time under
my wardship and i have that to communicate
respecting the parentage roland
which not only you will willingly listen to
but which will be also found to afford meas
the husband his nearest relative
some interest in the future course his
life
the abbot read this letter and paused
as if considering what were best for him todo
meanwhile woodcock took roland
aside and addressed him as follows 
 now look mr roland that you do not
let any papist nonsense lure either the priest
or you from the right quarry see you
you ever bore yourself as a bit a gentleman
read that and thank god that
threw old abbot boniface in our way as
two the seyton's men were conveying
the abbot 
toward dundrennan here we searched
him for intelligence concerning that fair
exploit your's at lochleven that has
cost many a man his life and me a set 
sore bones and we found what is better
for your purpose than our's
the paper which he gave was indeed
an attestation by father philip subscribing
himself unworthy sacristan and brother 
the house saint mary's stating that
under a vow secrecy he had united in the
holy sacrament marriage julian avenel
and catherine graeme but that julian having
repented his union he father
philip had been sinfully prevailed on by
him to conceal and disguise the same according
to a complot devised betwixt him
and the said julian avenel whereby the
poor damsel was induced to believe that
the ceremony had been performed by one
not in holy orders and having no authority
to that effect which sinful concealment
the undersigned conceived to be the cause
vol iii q
 the abbot
why he was abandoned to the misguiding
 a water fiend whereby he had been under
a spell besides being sorely afflicted
with rheumatic pains ever after wherefore
he had deposited this certificate and
confession with the day and date the
said marriage with his lawful superior boniface
abbot saint mary's sui simili
confessions
it appeared by a letter from julian folded
carefully up with the certificate that the
abbot boniface had in effect bestirred
himself in the affair and obtained from the
baron a promise to avow his marriage but
the death both julian and his injured
bride together with the abbot's resignation
his ignorance the fate their unhappy
offspring and above all his listless and inactive
disposition had suffered the matter
to become totally forgotten until it was
recalled by some accidental conversation
with the abbot ambrosius concerning the
fortunes the avenel family at the rethe
abbot 
quest his successor he searched for it 
but as he would receive no assistance in
looking among the few records spiritual
experiences and important confessions
which he had conscientiously treasured
it might have remained for ever hidden
amongst them but for the more active researches
 sir halbert glendinning
so that you are like to be heir 
at last master roland after my lord
and lady have gone to their place said
adam and as i have but one boon to
ask i trust you will not nick me with
nay
not if it be in my power to say yes
my trusty friend
why then i must needs if i live to see
that day keep on feeding the classes with
unwashed flesh said woodcock sturdily
yet as if doubting the reception that his
request might meet with
 thou shalt feed them with what you
list for me said roland laughing i am
not many months older than when i left
s the abbot
the castle but i trust i have gathered wit
enough to cross no man skill in his own
vocation
 then i would not change places with
the king's falconer said adam woodcock
nor with the queen's neither but they
say she will be mewed up and never need
one i see it grieves you to think it and
i could grieve for company but what help
for it fortune will fly her own flight let a
man hollo himself hoarse
the abbot and roland journeyed to
avenel where the former was tenderly received
by his brother while the lady wept
for joy to find that in her favourite orphan
she had protected the sole surviving branch
 her own family sir halbert blending
and his household were not a little
surprised at the change which a brief acquaintance
with the world had produced in
their former inmate and rejoiced to find
in the petted spoiled and presuming page
a modest and unassuming young mean too
much acquainted with his own expectations
the abbot 
and character to be hot or petulant in demanding
the consideration which was readily
and voluntarily yielded to him the
old major domo innate was the first to
sing his praises to which mrs lilies bore a
loud echo always hoping that god would
teach him the true gospel
to the true gospel the heart roland
had secretly long inclined and the departure
 the good abbot for france with
the purpose entering into some house 
his order in that kingdom removed his
chief objection to renouncing the catholic
faith another might have existed in the
duty which he owed to magdalen graeme
both by birth and from gratitude but he
learned ere he had been long a resident in
avenel that his grandmother had died at
cologne in the performance a penance
too severe for her age which she had taken
upon herself in behalf the queen and
church scotland so soon as she heard
 the defeat at languid the zeal the
s the abbot
abbot ambrosius was more regulated but
he retired into the scottish convent 
and so lived there that the fraternity
were inclined to claim for him the
honours canonization but he guessed
their purpose and prayed them on his
deathbed to do no honours to the body 
one as sinful as themselves but to send his
body and his heart to be buried in avenel
burialaisle in the monastery saint mary's
that the last abbot that celebrated
house devotion might sleep among its
 ruins
long before that period arrived roland
avenel was wedded to catherine seyton
who after two years residence with her unhappy
mistress was dismissed upon her being
subjected to closer restraint than had
been at first exercised she returned to
her father's house and as roland was acknowledged
for the successor and lawful
heir the ancient house avenel greatly
increased as the estate was by the providence
 sir halbert glendinning there
the abbot 
occurred no objections to the match on the
part her family her mother was recently
dead when she first entered the convent
 and her father in the unsettled times
which followed queen mary's flight to
england was not averse to an alliance with
a youth who himself loyal to queen mary
still held some influence through means 
sir halbert glendinning vith the party in
power
roland and catherine therefore were
united spite their differing faiths and
the white lady whose apparition had been
infrequent when the house avenel seemed
verging to extinction was seen to sport
by her haunted well with a zone gold
around her bosom as broad as the baldric
ofan earl

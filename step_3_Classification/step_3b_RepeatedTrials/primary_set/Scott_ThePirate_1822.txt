editor's introduction to the pirate


the circumstances in which the pirate was composed have for the editor
a peculiar interest he has many times scribbled at the old bureau in
chiefswood whereon sir walter worked at his novel and sat in summer
weather beneath the great tree on the lawn where erskine used to read
the fresh chapters to lockhart and his wife while the burn murmured by
from the rhymer's glen so little altered is the cottage of chiefswood
by the addition of a gabled wing in the same red stone as the older
portion so charmed a quiet has the place in the shelter of eildon
hill that there one can readily beget the golden time again and think
oneself back into the day when mustard and spice running down the shady
glen might herald the coming of the sheriff himself happy hours and
gone like that summer of whereof lockhart speaks with an emotion
the more touching because it is so rare 

 the first of several seasons which will ever dwell on my memory
 as the happiest of my life we were near enough abbotsford to
 partake as often as we liked of its brilliant society yet could
 do so without being exposed to the worry and exhaustion of spirit
 which the daily reception of new visitors entailed upon all the
 society except sir walter himself but in truth even he was not
 always proof against the annoyances connected with such a style of
 open-house-keeping even his temper sank sometimes under the
 solemn applause of learned dulness the vapid raptures of painted
 and periwigged dowagers the horse-leech avidity with which
 underbred foreigners urged their questions and the pompous
 simpers of condescending magnates when sore beset in this way he
 would every now and then discover that he had some very particular
 business to attend to on an outlying part of his estate and
 craving the indulgence of his guests overnight appear at the
 cabin in the glen before its inhabitants were astir in the
 morning the clatter of sibyl grey's hoofs the yelping of mustard
 and spice and his own joyous shout of reveillée under our
 window were the signal that he had burst his bonds and meant for
 that day to take his ease in his inn after breakfast he would
 take possession of a dressing-room upstairs and write a chapter
 of the pirate and then having made up and dispatched his
 parcel for mr ballantyne away to join purdie where the foresters
 were at work

 the constant and eager delight with which erskine watched the
 progress of the tale has left a deep impression on my memory and
 indeed i heard so many of its chapters first read from the ms by
 him that i can never open the book now without thinking i hear
 his voice sir walter used to give him at breakfast the pages he
 had written that morning and very commonly while he was again at
 work in his study erskine would walk over to chiefswood that he
 might have the pleasure of reading them aloud to my wife and me
 under our favourite tree

the tree is living yet this long quotation from a book but too little
read in general may be excused for its interest as bearing on the
composition of the pirate in the early autumn of in the
pirate scott fell back on his recollections of the orcades as seen by
him in a tour with the commissioners of light houses in august 
immediately after the publication of waverley they were accompanied
by mr stevenson the celebrated engineer a most gentlemanlike and
modest man and well known by his scientific skill it is understood
that mr stevenson also kept a diary and that it is to be published by
the care of his distinguished grandson mr robert louis stevenson
author of kidnapped the master of ballantrae and other novels in
which scott would have recognised a not alien genius

sir walter's diary read in company with the pirate offers a most
curious study of his art in composition it may be said that he scarcely
noted a natural feature a monument a custom a superstition or a
legend in zetland and orkney which he did not weave into the magic web
of his romance in the diary all those matters appear as very ordinary
in the pirate they are transfigured in the light of fancy history
gives scott the career of gow and his betrothal to an island lady
observation gives him a few headlands picts houses ruined towers and
old stone monuments and his characters gather about these in rhythmic
array like the dancers in the sword-dance we may conceive that
cleveland like gow was originally meant to die and that minna like
margaret in the ballad of clerk saunders was to recover her troth from
the hand of her dead lover but if scott intended this he was
good-natured and relented

taking the incidents in the diary in company with the novel we find in
the very first page of the pirate mention of the roost or rost of
sumburgh the running current of tidal water which he hated so because
it made him so sea-sick all the landsmen sicker than sick and our
viceroy stevenson qualmish it is proposed to have a light on sumburgh
head fitful head is higher but is to the west from which quarter few
vessels come as for sumburgh head scott climbed it rolled down a
rock from the summit and found it a fine situation to compose an ode
to the genius of sumburgh head or an elegy upon a cormorant or to have
written or spoken madness of any kind in prose or poetry but i gave
vent to my excited feelings in a more simple way and sitting gently
down on the steep green slope which led to the beach i e'en slid down a
few hundred feet and found the exercise quite an adequate vent to my
enthusiasm

sir walter was certainly not what he found mrs hemans too poetical

in the first chapter his giffords scotts of scotstarvet the
fifeshire house not of the border clan and mouats are the very gentry
who entertained him on his tour his plantie cruives in the novel
had been noted in the diary lockhart iv pate stewart the
oppressive earl is chronicled at length in the diary his huge tower
remains wild and desolate its chambers filled with sand and its rifted
walls and dismantled battlements giving unrestrained access to the
roaring sea-blast so scott wrote in his last review for the
quarterly a criticism of pitcairn's scotch criminal trials 
the trows or drows the fairy dwarfs he studied on the spot and
connects the name with dwerg though trolls seem rather to be their
spiritual and linguistic ancestors the affair of the clergyman who was
taken for a pecht or pict actually occurred during the tour and mr
stevenson who had met the poor pecht before was able to clear his
character in the same place the kraken is mentioned he had been
visible for nearly a fortnight but no sailor dared go near him

 he lay in the offing a fortnight or more
 but the devil a zetlander put from the shore
 if your grace thinks i'm writing the thing that is not
 you may ask at a namesake of ours mr scott

sir walter wrote to the duke of buccleugh he paid a visit to an old
lady who like norna and æolus in the odyssey kept the winds in a
bag and could sell a fair breeze she was a miserable figure upwards
of ninety she told me and dried up like a mummy a sort of
clay-coloured cloak folded over her head corresponded in colour to her
corpse-like complexion fine light-blue eyes and nose and chin that
almost met and a ghastly expression of cunning gave her quite the
effect of hecate she told us she remembered gow the pirate betrothed
to a miss gordon so here are the germs of norna cleveland and
minna all sown in good ground to bear fruit in seven years
- triptolemus yellowley is entirely derived from the diary
and is an anachronism the lowland scots factors and ploughs were only
coming in while scott was in the isles he himself saw the absurd little
mills vol i ch xi and the one stilted plough which needed two
women to open the furrows a feebler plough than the virgilian specimens
which one still remarks in tuscany when this precious machine was in
motion it was dragged by four little bullocks yoked abreast and as
many ponies harnessed or rather strung to the plough by ropes and
thongs of raw hide an antiquary might be of opinion that this was
the very model of the original plough invented by triptolemus son of
the eleusinian king who sheltered demeter in her wanderings the
sword-dance was not danced for scott's entertainment but he heard of
the pupa dancers and got a copy of the accompanying chant and was
presented with examples of the flint and bronze celts which norna
treasured all over the world as in zetland they were regarded as
thunder stones diary lockhart iv the bridal of norna by
clasping of hands through odin's stone ring was still practised as a
form of betrothal lockhart iv some island people were
despised as by magnus troil as poor sneaks who ate limpets the
last of human meannesses the wells or smooth wave-currents were
also noted and the garland of the whalers often alluded to in the
tale the stones of stennis were visited and the dwarfie stone of hoy
where norna like some eskimo angekok met her familiar demon scott
held that the stone probably was meant as the temple of some northern
edition of the dii manes they conceive that the dwarf may be seen
sometimes sitting at the door of his abode but he vanishes on a nearer
approach the dwelling of norna a pict's house with an overhanging
story shaped like a dice-box is the ancient castle of mousa the
strange incantation of norna the dropping of molten lead into water is
also described usually the lead was poured through the wards of a key
in affections of the heart like minna's a triangular stone probably a
neolithic arrow-head was usually employed as an amulet lockhart iv
 even the story of the pirate's insolent answer to the provost is
adapted from a recent occurrence two whalers were accused of stealing a
sheep the first denied the charge but said he had seen the animal
carried off by a fellow with a red nose and a black wig don't you
think he was like his honour tom by god jack i believe it was the
very man diary lockhart iv the pirate vol ii ch xiv
the goldless northern ophir was also visited in brief scott scarcely
made a remark on his tour which he did not manage to transmute into the
rare metal of his romance it is no wonder that the orcadians at once
detected his authorship a trifling anecdote of the cruise has recently
been published scott presented a lady in the isles with a piano which
it seems is still capable of producing a melancholy jingling tune

lockhart says as to the reception of the pirate dec the
wild freshness of the atmosphere of this splendid romance the beautiful
contrast of minna and brenda and the exquisitely drawn character of
captain cleveland found the reception which they deserved the wild
freshness of the atmosphere is indeed magically transfused and
breathes across the pages as it blows over the fitful head the
skerries the desolate moors the plain of the standing stones of
stennis the air is keen and salt and fragrant of the sea yet sydney
smith was greatly disappointed i am afraid this novel will depend upon
the former reputation of the author and will add nothing to it it may
sell and another may half sell but that is all unless he comes out
with something vigorous and redeems himself i do not blame him for
writing himself out if he knows he is doing so and has done his
best and his all if the native land of scotland will supply no
more scenes and characters for he is always best in scotland though he
was very good in england the time he was there but pray wherever the
scene is laid no more meg merrilies and dominie sampsons very good the
first and second times but now quite worn out and always recurring
archibald constable iii 

it was smith's grammar that gave out and produced no apodosis to his
phrase scott could not write himself out before his brain was affected
by disease had his age been miraculously prolonged with health it
could never be said that all the stories have been told and he would
have delighted mankind unceasingly

scott himself was a little nettled by the criticisms of norna as a
replica of meg merrilies she is indeed something distinct from the
dumfriesshire gipsy in truth she rather resembles the ulrica of
ivanhoe like her she is haunted by the memory of an awful crime an
insane version of a mere accident like her she is a votaress of the
dead gods of the older world thor and odin and the spirits of the
tempest scott's imagination lived so much in the past that the ancient
creeds never ceased to allure him like heine he felt the fascination
of the banished deities not of greece but of the north thus norna
crazed by her terrible mischance dwells among them worships the red
beard as outlying descendants of the aztecs yet retain some faith in
their old monstrous pantheon even minna keeps in her girlish
enthusiasm some touch of freydis in the saga of eric the red for her
the old gods and the old years are not wholly exiled and impotent all
this is most characteristic of the antiquary and the poet in scott who
lingers fondly over what has been and stirs the last faint embers of
fallen fires it is of a piece with the harmless jacobitism of his
festivals when they sang

 here's to the king boys
 ye ken wha i mean boys

in the singularly feeble and provincial vulgarities which borrow
launches in the appendix to lavengro against the memory of scott
the charge of reviving catholicism is the most bitter that rowdy
evangelist might as well have charged scott with a desire to restore the
worship of odin and to sacrifice human victims on the stone altar of
stennis he saw in orkney the ruined fanes of the norse deities as at
melrose of the virgin and his loyal heart could feel for all that was
old and lost for all into which men had put their hearts and faiths
had made and had unmade in the secular quest for the divine like a
later poet he might have said 

 not as their friend or child i speak
 but as on some far northern strand
 thinking of his own gods a greek
 in pity and mournful awe might stand
 beside some fallen runic stone
 for both were gods and both are gone

and surely no creed is more savage cruel and worthy of death than
borrow's belief in a god who knew where to strike and deliberately
struck scott by inducing robinson to speculate in hops and so bring
down his edinburgh associate constable and with him sir walter such
was the religion which borrow expressed in the style of a writer in a
fourth-rate country newspaper we might prefer the frank heathenism of
the red beard to the religion of the author of the bible in spain

there is no denying that scott had in his imagination a certain mould of
romance into which his ideas when he wrote most naturally and most
for his own pleasure were apt to run it is one of the charms of the
pirate that here he is manifestly writing for his own pleasure with a
certain boyish eagerness had we but the plot of one of the tales which
he told as a lad to his friend irving we might find that it turned on
a romantic mystery a clue in the hands of some witch or wise woman of
some one who was always appearing in the nick of time was always round
the corner when anything was to be heard this is a standing
characteristic of the tales now it is edie ochiltree now
flibbertigibbet now meg merrilies now norna who holds the thread of
the plot but these characters are all well differentiated again he
had types especially the pedantic type which attracted him but they
vary as much as yellowley and dugald dalgetty the antiquary and
dominie sampson yellowley is rather more repressed than some of scott's
bores but then he is not the only bore for claud halcro with all his
merits is a professed proser swift had exactly described the
character the episodical narrator in a passage parallel to one in
theophrastus in writing to morritt scott says november i
sympathise with you for the dole you are dreeing under the
inflictions of your honest proser of all the boring machines ever
devised your regular and determined story-teller is the most peremptory
and powerful in his operations

with what perfect placidity he submitted to be bored even by bores of
the first water says lockhart the species is one which we all have
many opportunities of studying but it may be admitted that scott
produced his studies of bores with a certain complacency yet they are
all different bores and the gay kind scald halcro is very unlike
master mumblasen or dominie sampson

for a hero mordaunt may be called almost sprightly and individual his
mysterious father occasionally suggests the influence of byron
occasionally of mrs radcliffe the udaller is as individual and genial
as dandie dinmont himself or again he is the cedric of thule though
much more sympathetic than cedric to most readers his affection for his
daughters is characteristic and deserved many a pair of sisters blonde
and brune have we met in fiction since minna and brenda but none have
been their peers and like mordaunt in early years we know not to
which of them our hearts are given they are l'allegro and il
penseroso of the north and it is probable that all men would fall in
love with minna if they had the chance and marry brenda if they could
minna is indeed the ideal youth of poetry and brenda of the practical
life the innocent illusions of minna her love of all that is old her
championship of the forlorn cause her beauty her tenderness her
truth her passionate waywardness of sorrow make her one of scott's
most original and delightful heroines she believes and trembles not
like bertram in rokeby brenda trembles but does not believe in
norna's magic and in the spirits of ancient saga as for cleveland
scott managed to avoid byron's lara-like pirates and produced a
freebooter as sympathetic as any hostis humani generis can be while
frederick altamont thackeray borrowed the name for his romantic
crossing-sweeper has a place among the marischals and bucklaws of
romance scott's minute studies in dryden come to the aid of his local
observations and so out of not very promising materials and out of
the contrast of lowland scot and orcadian the romance is spun probably
the psychological analysis which most interested the author is the
double consciousness of norna the occasional intrusions of the rational
self on her dreams of supernatural powers that double consciousness
indeed exists in all of us occasionally the self in which we believe
has a vision of the real underlying self and shudders from the sight
like the pair who met themselves in the celebrated drawing

the pirate can scarcely be placed in the front rank of scott's novels
but it has a high and peculiar place in the second and probably will
always be among the special favourites of those who being young are
fortunate enough not to be critical

scott's novels at this time came forth so frequently that the lumbering
quarterlies toiled after them in vain they adopted the plan of
reviewing them in batches and the quarterly may be said to have
omitted the pirate altogether about this time gifford began to find
that the person who spoke of a dark dialect of anglified erse was not
a competent critic and mr senior noticed several of the tales in a
more judicious manner as to the pirate the edinburgh review
found the character and story of mertoun at once commonplace and
extravagant cleveland disappoints by turning out so much better
than we had expected and yet substantially so ill nothing can
be more beautiful than the description of the sisters norna is
a new incarnation of meg merrilies and palpably the same in the
spirit but far above the rank of a mere imitated or borrowed
character the work on the whole opens up a new world to our
curiosity and affords another proof of the extreme pliability
as well as vigour of the author's genius

introduction to the pirate

 quoth he there was a ship


this brief preface may begin like the tale of the ancient mariner since
it was on shipboard that the author acquired the very moderate degree of
local knowledge and information both of people and scenery which he
has endeavoured to embody in the romance of the pirate

in the summer and autumn of the author was invited to join a party
of commissioners for the northern light-house service who proposed
making a voyage round the coast of scotland and through its various
groups of islands chiefly for the purpose of seeing the condition of
the many lighthouses under their direction edifices so important
whether regarding them as benevolent or political institutions among
the commissioners who manage this important public concern the sheriff
of each county of scotland which borders on the sea holds ex-officio a
place at the board these gentlemen act in every respect gratuitously
but have the use of an armed yacht well found and fitted up when they
choose to visit the lighthouses an excellent engineer mr robert
stevenson is attached to the board to afford the benefit of his
professional advice the author accompanied this expedition as a guest
for selkirkshire though it calls him sheriff has not like the kingdom
of bohemia in corporal trim's story a seaport in its circuit nor its
magistrate of course any place at the board of commissioners a
circumstance of little consequence where all were old and intimate
friends bred to the same profession and disposed to accommodate each
other in every possible manner

the nature of the important business which was the principal purpose of
the voyage was connected with the amusement of visiting the leading
objects of a traveller's curiosity for the wild cape or formidable
shelve which requires to be marked out by a lighthouse is generally at
no great distance from the most magnificent scenery of rocks caves and
billows our time too was at our own disposal and as most of us were
freshwater sailors we could at any time make a fair wind out of a foul
one and run before the gale in quest of some object of curiosity which
lay under our lee

with these purposes of public utility and some personal amusement in
view we left the port of leith on the th july ran along the
east coast of scotland viewing its different curiosities stood over to
zetland and orkney where we were some time detained by the wonders of a
country which displayed so much that was new to us and having seen what
was curious in the ultima thule of the ancients where the sun hardly
thought it worth while to go to bed since his rising was at this season
so early we doubled the extreme northern termination of scotland and
took a rapid survey of the hebrides where we found many kind friends
there that our little expedition might not want the dignity of danger
we were favoured with a distant glimpse of what was said to be an
american cruiser and had opportunity to consider what a pretty figure
we should have made had the voyage ended in our being carried captive
to the united states after visiting the romantic shores of morven and
the vicinity of oban we made a run to the coast of ireland and visited
the giant's causeway that we might compare it with staffa which we had
surveyed in our course at length about the middle of september we
ended our voyage in the clyde at the port of greenock

and thus terminated our pleasant tour to which our equipment gave
unusual facilities as the ship's company could form a strong boat's
crew independent of those who might be left on board the vessel which
permitted us the freedom to land wherever our curiosity carried us let
me add while reviewing for a moment a sunny portion of my life that
among the six or seven friends who performed this voyage together some
of them doubtless of different tastes and pursuits and remaining for
several weeks on board a small vessel there never occurred the
slightest dispute or disagreement each seeming anxious to submit his
own particular wishes to those of his friends by this mutual
accommodation all the purposes of our little expedition were obtained
while for a time we might have adopted the lines of allan cunningham's
fine sea-song

 the world of waters was our home
 and merry men were we

but sorrow mixes her memorials with the purest remembrances of pleasure
on returning from the voyage which had proved so satisfactory i found
that fate had deprived her country most unexpectedly of a lady
qualified to adorn the high rank which she held and who had long
admitted me to a share of her friendship the subsequent loss of one of
those comrades who made up the party and he the most intimate friend i
had in the world casts also its shade on recollections which but for
these embitterments would be otherwise so pleasing

i may here briefly observe that my business in this voyage so far as i
could be said to have any was to endeavour to discover some localities
which might be useful in the lord of the isles a poem with which i
was then threatening the public and was afterwards printed without
attaining remarkable success but as at the same time the anonymous
novel of waverley was making its way to popularity i already augured
the possibility of a second effort in this department of literature and
i saw much in the wild islands of the orkneys and zetland which i
judged might be made in the highest degree interesting should these
isles ever become the scene of a narrative of fictitious events i
learned the history of gow the pirate from an old sibyl the subject of
a note p of this volume whose principal subsistence was by a
trade in favourable winds which she sold to mariners at stromness
nothing could be more interesting than the kindness and hospitality of
the gentlemen of zetland which was to me the more affecting as several
of them had been friends and correspondents of my father

i was induced to go a generation or two farther back to find materials
from which i might trace the features of the old norwegian udaller the
scottish gentry having in general occupied the place of that primitive
race and their language and peculiarities of manner having entirely
disappeared the only difference now to be observed betwixt the gentry
of these islands and those of scotland in general is that the wealth
and property is more equally divided among our more northern countrymen
and that there exists among the resident proprietors no men of very
great wealth whose display of its luxuries might render the others
discontented with their own lot from the same cause of general
equality of fortunes and the cheapness of living which is its natural
consequence i found the officers of a veteran regiment who had
maintained the garrison at fort charlotte in lerwick discomposed at
the idea of being recalled from a country where their pay however
inadequate to the expenses of a capital was fully adequate to their
wants and it was singular to hear natives of merry england herself
regretting their approaching departure from the melancholy isles of the
ultima thule

such are the trivial particulars attending the origin of that
publication which took place several years later than the agreeable
journey from which it took its rise

the state of manners which i have introduced in the romance was
necessarily in a great degree imaginary though founded in some measure
on slight hints which showing what was seemed to give reasonable
indication of what must once have been the tone of the society in these
sequestered but interesting islands

in one respect i was judged somewhat hastily perhaps when the
character of norna was pronounced by the critics a mere copy of meg
merrilees that i had fallen short of what i wished and desired to
express is unquestionable otherwise my object could not have been so
widely mistaken nor can i yet think that any person who will take the
trouble of reading the pirate with some attention can fail to trace in
norna the victim of remorse and insanity and the dupe of her own
imposture her mind too flooded with all the wild literature and
extravagant superstitions of the north something distinct from the
dumfries-shire gipsy whose pretensions to supernatural powers are not
beyond those of a norwood prophetess the foundations of such a
character may be perhaps traced though it be too true that the
necessary superstructure cannot have been raised upon them otherwise
these remarks would have been unnecessary there is also great
improbability in the statement of norna's possessing power and
opportunity to impress on others that belief in her supernatural gifts
which distracted her own mind yet amid a very credulous and ignorant
population it is astonishing what success may be attained by an
impostor who is at the same time an enthusiast it is such as to
remind us of the couplet which assures us that

 the pleasure is as great
 in being cheated as to cheat

indeed as i have observed elsewhere the professed explanation of a
tale where appearances or incidents of a supernatural character are
referred to natural causes has often in the winding up of the story a
degree of improbability almost equal to an absolute goblin narrative
even the genius of mrs radcliffe could not always surmount this
difficulty

advertisement


the purpose of the following narrative is to give a detailed and
accurate account of certain remarkable incidents which took place in the
orkney islands concerning which the more imperfect traditions and
mutilated records of the country only tell us the following erroneous
particulars 

in the month of january - a vessel called the revenge bearing
twenty large guns and six smaller commanded by john gow or goffe or
smith came to the orkney islands and was discovered to be a pirate by
various acts of insolence and villainy committed by the crew these were
for some time submitted to the inhabitants of these remote islands not
possessing arms nor means of resistance and so bold was the captain of
these banditti that he not only came ashore and gave dancing parties
in the village of stromness but before his real character was
discovered engaged the affections and received the troth-plight of a
young lady possessed of some property a patriotic individual james
fea younger of clestron formed the plan of securing the buccanier
which he effected by a mixture of courage and address in consequence
chiefly of gow's vessel having gone on shore near the harbour of
calfsound on the island of eda not far distant from a house then
inhabited by mr fea in the various stratagems by which mr fea
contrived finally at the peril of his life they being well armed and
desperate to make the whole pirates his prisoners he was much aided
by mr james laing the grandfather of the late malcolm laing esq the
acute and ingenious historian of scotland during the th century

gow and others of his crew suffered by sentence of the high court of
admiralty the punishment their crimes had long deserved he conducted
himself with great audacity when before the court and from an account
of the matter by an eye-witness seems to have been subjected to some
unusual severities in order to compel him to plead the words are
these john gow would not plead for which he was brought to the bar
and the judge ordered that his thumbs should be squeezed by two men
with a whip-cord till it did break and then it should be doubled till
it did again break and then laid threefold and that the executioners
should pull with their whole strength which sentence gow endured with a
great deal of boldness the next morning th may when he had
seen the terrible preparations for pressing him to death his courage
gave way and he told the marshal of court that he would not have given
so much trouble had he been assured of not being hanged in chains he
was then tried condemned and executed with others of his crew

it is said that the lady whose affections gow had engaged went up to
london to see him before his death and that arriving too late she had
the courage to request a sight of his dead body and then touching the
hand of the corpse she formally resumed the troth-plight which she had
bestowed without going through this ceremony she could not according
to the superstition of the country have escaped a visit from the ghost
of her departed lover in the event of her bestowing upon any living
suitor the faith which she had plighted to the dead this part of the
legend may serve as a curious commentary on the fine scottish ballad
which begins

 there came a ghost to margaret's door ca

the common account of this incident farther bears that mr fea the
spirited individual by whose exertions gow's career of iniquity was cut
short was so far from receiving any reward from government that he
could not obtain even countenance enough to protect him against a
variety of sham suits raised against him by newgate solicitors who
acted in the name of gow and others of the pirate crew and the various
expenses vexatious prosecutions and other legal consequences in which
his gallant exploit involved him utterly ruined his fortune and his
family making his memory a notable example to all who shall in future
take pirates on their own authority

it is to be supposed for the honour of george the first's government
that the last circumstance as well as the dates and other particulars
of the commonly received story are inaccurate since they will be found

chapter i

 the storm had ceased its wintry roar
 hoarse dash the billows of the sea
 but who on thule's desert shore
 cries have i burnt my harp for thee

 macniel


that long narrow and irregular island usually called the mainland of
zetland because it is by far the largest of that archipelago
terminates as is well known to the mariners who navigate the stormy
seas which surround the thule of the ancients in a cliff of immense
height entitled sumburgh-head which presents its bare scalp and naked
sides to the weight of a tremendous surge forming the extreme point of
the isle to the south-east this lofty promontory is constantly exposed
to the current of a strong and furious tide which setting in betwixt
the orkney and zetland islands and running with force only inferior to
that of the pentland frith takes its name from the headland we have
mentioned and is called the roost of sumburgh roost being the phrase
assigned in those isles to currents of this description

on the land side the promontory is covered with short grass and slopes
steeply down to a little isthmus upon which the sea has encroached in
creeks which advancing from either side of the island gradually work
their way forward and seem as if in a short time they would form a
junction and altogether insulate sumburgh-head when what is now a
cape will become a lonely mountain islet severed from the mainland of
which it is at present the terminating extremity

man however had in former days considered this as a remote or unlikely
event for a norwegian chief of other times or as other accounts said
and as the name of jarlshof seemed to imply an ancient earl of the
orkneys had selected this neck of land as the place for establishing a
mansion-house it has been long entirely deserted and the vestiges only
can be discerned with difficulty for the loose sand borne on the
tempestuous gales of those stormy regions has overblown and almost
buried the ruins of the buildings but in the end of the seventeenth
century a part of the earl's mansion was still entire and habitable it
was a rude building of rough stone with nothing about it to gratify the
eye or to excite the imagination a large old-fashioned narrow house
with a very steep roof covered with flags composed of grey sandstone
would perhaps convey the best idea of the place to a modern reader the
windows were few very small in size and distributed up and down the
building with utter contempt of regularity against the main structure
had rested in former times certain smaller co-partments of the
mansion-house containing offices or subordinate apartments necessary
for the accommodation of the earl's retainers and menials but these had
become ruinous and the rafters had been taken down for fire-wood or
for other purposes the walls had given way in many places and to
complete the devastation the sand had already drifted amongst the
ruins and filled up what had been once the chambers they contained to
the depth of two or three feet

amid this desolation the inhabitants of jarlshof had contrived by
constant labour and attention to keep in order a few roods of land
which had been enclosed as a garden and which sheltered by the walls
of the house itself from the relentless sea-blast produced such
vegetables as the climate could bring forth or rather as the sea-gale
would permit to grow for these islands experience even less of the
rigour of cold than is encountered on the mainland of scotland but
unsheltered by a wall of some sort or other it is scarce possible to
raise even the most ordinary culinary vegetables and as for shrubs or
trees they are entirely out of the question such is the force of the
sweeping sea-blast

at a short distance from the mansion and near to the sea-beach just
where the creek forms a sort of imperfect harbour in which lay three or
four fishing-boats there were a few most wretched cottages for the
inhabitants and tenants of the township of jarlshof who held the whole
district of the landlord upon such terms as were in those days usually
granted to persons of this description and which of course were hard
enough the landlord himself resided upon an estate which he possessed
in a more eligible situation in a different part of the island and
seldom visited his possessions at sumburgh-head he was an honest plain
zetland gentleman somewhat passionate the necessary result of being
surrounded by dependents and somewhat over-convivial in his habits the
consequence perhaps of having too much time at his disposal but
frank-tempered and generous to his people and kind and hospitable to
strangers he was descended also of an old and noble norwegian family a
circumstance which rendered him dearer to the lower orders most of whom
are of the same race while the lairds or proprietors are generally of
scottish extraction who at that early period were still considered as
strangers and intruders magnus troil who deduced his descent from the
very earl who was supposed to have founded jarlshof was peculiarly of
this opinion

the present inhabitants of jarlshof had experienced on several
occasions the kindness and good will of the proprietor of the
territory when mr mertoun such was the name of the present inhabitant
of the old mansion first arrived in zetland some years before the
story commences he had been received at the house of mr troil with
that warm and cordial hospitality for which the islands are
distinguished no one asked him whence he came where he was going what
was his purpose in visiting so remote a corner of the empire or what
was likely to be the term of his stay he arrived a perfect stranger
yet was instantly overpowered by a succession of invitations and in
each house which he visited he found a home as long as he chose to
accept it and lived as one of the family unnoticed and unnoticing
until he thought proper to remove to some other dwelling this apparent
indifference to the rank character and qualities of their guest did
not arise from apathy on the part of his kind hosts for the islanders
had their full share of natural curiosity but their delicacy deemed it
would be an infringement upon the laws of hospitality to ask questions
which their guest might have found it difficult or unpleasing to answer
and instead of endeavouring as is usual in other countries to wring
out of mr mertoun such communications as he might find it agreeable to
withhold the considerate zetlanders contented themselves with eagerly
gathering up such scraps of information as could be collected in the
course of conversation

but the rock in an arabian desert is not more reluctant to afford water
than mr basil mertoun was niggard in imparting his confidence even
incidentally and certainly the politeness of the gentry of thule was
never put to a more severe test than when they felt that good-breeding
enjoined them to abstain from enquiring into the situation of so
mysterious a personage

all that was actually known of him was easily summed up mr mertoun had
come to lerwick then rising into some importance but not yet
acknowledged as the principal town of the island in a dutch vessel
accompanied only by his son a handsome boy of about fourteen years old
his own age might exceed forty the dutch skipper introduced him to some
of the very good friends with whom he used to barter gin and gingerbread
for little zetland bullocks smoked geese and stockings of lambs-wool
and although meinheer could only say that meinheer mertoun hab bay his
bassage like one gentlemans and hab given a kreitz-dollar beside to the
crew this introduction served to establish the dutchman's passenger in
a respectable circle of acquaintances which gradually enlarged as it
appeared that the stranger was a man of considerable acquirements

this discovery was made almost per force for mertoun was as unwilling
to speak upon general subjects as upon his own affairs but he was
sometimes led into discussions which showed as it were in spite of
himself the scholar and the man of the world and at other times as
if in requital of the hospitality which he experienced he seemed to
compel himself against his fixed nature to enter into the society of
those around him especially when it assumed the grave melancholy or
satirical cast which best suited the temper of his own mind upon such
occasions the zetlanders were universally of opinion that he must have
had an excellent education neglected only in one striking particular
namely that mr mertoun scarce knew the stem of a ship from the stern
and in the management of a boat a cow could not be more ignorant it
seemed astonishing such gross ignorance of the most necessary art of
life in the zetland isles at least should subsist along with his
accomplishments in other respects but so it was

unless called forth in the manner we have mentioned the habits of basil
mertoun were retired and gloomy from loud mirth he instantly fled and
even the moderated cheerfulness of a friendly party had the invariable
effect of throwing him into deeper dejection than even his usual
demeanour indicated

women are always particularly desirous of investigating mystery and of
alleviating melancholy especially when these circumstances are united
in a handsome man about the prime of life it is possible therefore
that amongst the fair-haired and blue-eyed daughters of thule this
mysterious and pensive stranger might have found some one to take upon
herself the task of consolation had he shown any willingness to accept
such kindly offices but far from doing so he seemed even to shun the
presence of the sex to which in our distresses whether of mind or
body we generally apply for pity and comfort

to these peculiarities mr mertoun added another which was particularly
disagreeable to his host and principal patron magnus troil this
magnate of zetland descended by the father's side as we have already
said from an ancient norwegian family by the marriage of its
representative with a danish lady held the devout opinion that a cup of
geneva or nantz was specific against all cares and afflictions whatever
these were remedies to which mr mertoun never applied his drink was
water and water alone and no persuasion or entreaties could induce him
to taste any stronger beverage than was afforded by the pure spring now
this magnus troil could not tolerate it was a defiance to the ancient
northern laws of conviviality which for his own part he had so
rigidly observed that although he was wont to assert that he had never
in his life gone to bed drunk that is in his own sense of the word
it would have been impossible to prove that he had ever resigned himself
to slumber in a state of actual and absolute sobriety it may be
therefore asked what did this stranger bring into society to compensate
the displeasure given by his austere and abstemious habits he had in
the first place that manner and self-importance which mark a person of
some consequence and although it was conjectured that he could not be
rich yet it was certainly known by his expenditure that neither was he
absolutely poor he had besides some powers of conversation when as
we have already hinted he chose to exert them and his misanthropy or
aversion to the business and intercourse of ordinary life was often
expressed in an antithetical manner which passed for wit when better
was not to be had above all mr mertoun's secret seemed impenetrable
and his presence had all the interest of a riddle which men love to
read over and over because they cannot find out the meaning of it

notwithstanding these recommendations mertoun differed in so many
material points from his host that after he had been for some time a
guest at his principal residence magnus troil was agreeably surprised
when one evening after they had sat two hours in absolute silence
drinking brandy and water that is magnus drinking the alcohol and
mertoun the element the guest asked his host's permission to occupy
as his tenant this deserted mansion of jarlshof at the extremity of
the territory called dunrossness and situated just beneath
sumburgh-head i shall be handsomely rid of him quoth magnus to
himself and his kill-joy visage will never again stop the bottle in
its round his departure will ruin me in lemons however for his mere
look was quite sufficient to sour a whole ocean of punch

yet the kind-hearted zetlander generously and disinterestedly
remonstrated with mr mertoun on the solitude and inconveniences to
which he was about to subject himself there were scarcely he said
even the most necessary articles of furniture in the old house there
was no society within many miles for provisions the principal article
of food would be sour sillocks and his only company gulls and
gannets

my good friend replied mertoun if you could have named a
circumstance which would render the residence more eligible to me than
any other it is that there would be neither human luxury nor human
society near the place of my retreat a shelter from the weather for my
own head and for the boy's is all i seek for so name your rent mr
troil and let me be your tenant at jarlshof

rent answered the zetlander why no great rent for an old house
which no one has lived in since my mother's time god rest her and as
for shelter the old walls are thick enough and will bear many a bang
yet but heaven love you mr mertoun think what you are purposing
for one of us to live at jarlshof were a wild scheme enough but you
who are from another country whether english scotch or irish no one
can tell  

nor does it greatly matter said mertoun somewhat abruptly

not a herring's scale answered the laird only that i like you the
better for being no scot as i trust you are not one hither they have
come like the clack-geese every chamberlain has brought over a flock of
his own name and his own hatching for what i know and here they roost
for ever catch them returning to their own barren highlands or
lowlands when once they have tasted our zetland beef and seen our
bonny voes and lochs no sir here magnus proceeded with great
animation sipping from time to time the half-diluted spirit which at
the same time animated his resentment against the intruders and enabled
him to endure the mortifying reflection which it suggested no sir
the ancient days and the genuine manners of these islands are no more
for our ancient possessors our patersons our feas our
schlagbrenners our thorbiorns have given place to giffords scotts
mouats men whose names bespeak them or their ancestors strangers to the
soil which we the troils have inhabited long before the days of
turf-einar who first taught these isles the mystery of burning peat for
fuel and who has been handed down to a grateful posterity by a name
which records the discovery

this was a subject upon which the potentate of jarlshof was usually very
diffuse and mertoun saw him enter upon it with pleasure because he
knew he should not be called upon to contribute any aid to the
conversation and might therefore indulge his own saturnine humour while
the norwegian zetlander declaimed on the change of times and
inhabitants but just as magnus had arrived at the melancholy
conclusion how probable it was that in another century scarce a
merk scarce even an ure of land would be in the possession of the
norse inhabitants the true udallers of zetland he recollected the
circumstances of his guest and stopped suddenly short i do not say
all this he added interrupting himself as if i were unwilling that
you should settle on my estate mr mertoun but for jarlshof the place
is a wild one come from where you will i warrant you will say like
other travellers you came from a better climate than ours for so say
you all and yet you think of a retreat which the very natives run away
from will you not take your glass this was to be considered as
interjectional then here's to you

my good sir answered mertoun i am indifferent to climate if there
is but air enough to fill my lungs i care not if it be the breath of
arabia or of lapland

air enough you may have answered magnus no lack of that somewhat
damp strangers allege it to be but we know a corrective for
that here's to you mr mertoun you must learn to do so and to
smoke a pipe and then as you say you will find the air of zetland
equal to that of arabia but have you seen jarlshof

the stranger intimated that he had not

then replied magnus you have no idea of your undertaking if you
think it a comfortable roadstead like this with the house situated on
the side of an inland voe that brings the herrings up to your door
you are mistaken my heart at jarlshof you will see nought but the wild
waves tumbling on the bare rocks and the roost of sumburgh running at
the rate of fifteen knots an-hour

i shall see nothing at least of the current of human passions replied
mertoun

you will hear nothing but the clanging and screaming of scarts
sheer-waters and seagulls from daybreak till sunset

i will compound my friend replied the stranger so that i do not
hear the chattering of women's tongues

ah said the norman that is because you hear just now my little
minna and brenda singing in the garden with your mordaunt now i would
rather listen to their little voices than the skylark which i once
heard in caithness or the nightingale that i have read of what will
the girls do for want of their playmate mordaunt

they will shift for themselves answered mertoun younger or elder
they will find playmates or dupes but the question is mr troil will
you let to me as your tenant this old mansion of jarlshof

gladly since you make it your option to live in a spot so desolate

and as for the rent continued mertoun

the rent replied magnus hum why you must have the bit of plantie
cruive which they once called a garden and a right in the
scathold and a sixpenny merk of land that the tenants may fish for
you eight lispunds of butter and eight shillings sterling
yearly is not too much

mr mertoun agreed to terms so moderate and from thenceforward resided
chiefly at the solitary mansion which we have described in the beginning
of this chapter conforming not only without complaint but as it
seemed with a sullen pleasure to all the privations which so wild and
desolate a situation necessarily imposed on its inhabitant

 the udallers are the allodial possessors of zetland who hold
their possessions under the old norwegian law instead of the feudal
tenures introduced among them from scotland

permits any person who has occasion for such a convenience to select
out of the unenclosed moorland a small patch which he surrounds with a
drystone wall and cultivates as a kailyard till he exhausts the soil
with cropping and then he deserts it and encloses another this
liberty is so far from inferring an invasion of the right of proprietor
and tenant that the last degree of contempt is inferred of an
avaricious man when a zetlander says he would not hold a plantie

 tis not alone the scene the man anselmo
 the man finds sympathies in these wild wastes
 and roughly tumbling seas which fairer views
 and smoother waves deny him

 ancient arama


the few inhabitants of the township of jarlshof had at first heard with
alarm that a person of rank superior to their own was come to reside in
the ruinous tenement which they still called the castle in those days
for the present times are greatly altered for the better the presence
of a superior in such a situation was almost certain to be attended
with additional burdens and exactions for which under one pretext or
another feudal customs furnished a thousand apologies by each of
these a part of the tenants hard-won and precarious profits was
diverted for the use of their powerful neighbour and superior the
tacksman as he was called but the sub-tenants speedily found that no
oppression of this kind was to be apprehended at the hands of basil
mertoun his own means whether large or small were at least fully
adequate to his expenses which so far as regarded his habits of life
were of the most frugal description the luxuries of a few books and
some philosophical instruments with which he was supplied from london
as occasion offered seemed to indicate a degree of wealth unusual in
those islands but on the other hand the table and the accommodations
at jarlshof did not exceed what was maintained by a zetland proprietor
of the most inferior description

the tenants of the hamlet troubled themselves very little about the
quality of their superior as soon as they found that their situation
was rather to be mended than rendered worse by his presence and once
relieved from the apprehension of his tyrannizing over them they laid
their heads together to make the most of him by various petty tricks of
overcharge and extortion which for a while the stranger submitted to
with the most philosophic indifference an incident however occurred
which put his character in a new light and effectually checked all
future efforts at extravagant imposition

a dispute arose in the kitchen of the castle betwixt an old governante
who acted as housekeeper to mr mertoun and sweyn erickson as good a
zetlander as ever rowed a boat to the haaf fishing which dispute
as is usual in such cases was maintained with such increasing heat and
vociferation as to reach the ears of the master as he was called
who secluded in a solitary turret was deeply employed in examining the
contents of a new package of books from london which after long
expectation had found its way to hull from thence by a whaling vessel
to lerwick and so to jarlshof with more than the usual thrill of
indignation which indolent people always feel when roused into action on
some unpleasant occasion mertoun descended to the scene of contest and
so suddenly peremptorily and strictly enquired into the cause of
dispute that the parties notwithstanding every evasion which they
attempted became unable to disguise from him that their difference
respected the several interests to which the honest governante and no
less honest fisherman were respectively entitled in an overcharge of
about one hundred per cent on a bargain of rock-cod purchased by the
former from the latter for the use of the family at jarlshof

when this was fairly ascertained and confessed mr mertoun stood
looking upon the culprits with eyes in which the utmost scorn seemed to
contend with awakening passion hark you ye old hag said he at
length to the housekeeper avoid my house this instant and know that i
dismiss you not for being a liar a thief and an ungrateful
quean for these are qualities as proper to you as your name of
woman but for daring in my house to scold above your breath and
for you you rascal who suppose you may cheat a stranger as you would
flinch a whale know that i am well acquainted with the rights
which by delegation from your master magnus troil i can exercise over
you if i will provoke me to a certain pitch and you shall learn to
your cost i can break your rest as easily as you can interrupt my
leisure i know the meaning of scat and wattle and hawkhen and
hagalefb and every other exaction by which your lords in
ancient and modern days have wrung your withers nor is there one of
you that shall not rue the day that you could not be content with
robbing me of my money but must also break in on my leisure with your
atrocious northern clamour that rivals in discord the screaming of a
flight of arctic gulls

nothing better occurred to sweyn in answer to this objurgation than
the preferring a humble request that his honour would be pleased to
keep the cod-fish without payment and say no more about the matter but
by this time mr mertoun had worked up his passions into an ungovernable
rage and with one hand he threw the money at the fisherman's head
while with the other he pelted him out of the apartment with his own
fish which he finally flung out of doors after him

there was so much of appalling and tyrannic fury in the stranger's
manner on this occasion that sweyn neither stopped to collect the money
nor take back his commodity but fled at a precipitate rate to the small
hamlet to tell his comrades that if they provoked master mertoun any
farther he would turn an absolute pate stewart on their hand and
head and hang without either judgment or mercy

hither also came the discarded housekeeper to consult with her
neighbours and kindred for she too was a native of the village what
she should do to regain the desirable situation from which she had been
so suddenly expelled the old ranzellaar of the village who had the
voice most potential in the deliberations of the township after hearing
what had happened pronounced that sweyn erickson had gone too far in
raising the market upon mr mertoun and that whatever pretext the
tacksman might assume for thus giving way to his anger the real
grievance must have been the charging the rock cod-fish at a penny
instead of a half-penny a-pound he therefore exhorted all the community
never to raise their exactions in future beyond the proportion of
threepence upon the shilling at which rate their master at the castle
could not reasonably be expected to grumble since as he was disposed
to do them no harm it was reasonable to think that in a moderate way
he had no objection to do them good and three upon twelve said the
experienced ranzellaar is a decent and moderate profit and will bring
with it god's blessing and saint ronald's

proceeding upon the tariff thus judiciously recommended to them the
inhabitants of jarlshof cheated mertoun in future only to the moderate
extent of twenty-five per cent a rate to which all nabobs
army-contractors speculators in the funds and others whom recent and
rapid success has enabled to settle in the country upon a great scale
ought to submit as very reasonable treatment at the hand of their
rustic neighbours mertoun at least seemed of that opinion for he gave
himself no farther trouble upon the subject of his household expenses

the conscript fathers of jarlshof having settled their own matters
took next under their consideration the case of swertha the banished
matron who had been expelled from the castle whom as an experienced
and useful ally they were highly desirous to restore to her office of
housekeeper should that be found possible but as their wisdom here
failed them swertha in despair had recourse to the good offices of
mordaunt mertoun with whom she had acquired some favour by her
knowledge in old norwegian ballads and dismal tales concerning the
trows or drows the dwarfs of the scalds with whom superstitious eld
had peopled many a lonely cavern and brown dale in dunrossness as in
every other district of zetland swertha said the youth i can do
but little for you but you may do something for yourself my father's
passion resembles the fury of those ancient champions those berserkars
you sing songs about

ay ay fish of my heart replied the old woman with a pathetic
whine the berserkarsc were champions who lived before the blessed
days of saint olave and who used to run like madmen on swords and
spears and harpoons and muskets and snap them all into pieces as a
finner would go through a herring-net and then when the fury went
off they were as weak and unstable as water

that's the very thing swertha said mordaunt now my father never
likes to think of his passion after it is over and is so much of a
berserkar that let him be desperate as he will to-day he will not
care about it to-morrow therefore he has not filled up your place in
the household at the castle and not a mouthful of warm food has been
dressed there since you went away and not a morsel of bread baked but
we have lived just upon whatever cold thing came to hand now swertha
i will be your warrant that if you go boldly up to the castle and
enter upon the discharge of your duties as usual you will never hear a
single word from him

swertha hesitated at first to obey this bold counsel she said to her
thinking mr mertoun when he was angry looked more like a fiend than
any berserkar of them all that the fire flashed from his eyes and the
foam flew from his lips and that it would be a plain tempting of
providence to put herself again in such a venture

but on the encouragement which she received from the son she
determined at length once more to face the parent and dressing herself
in her ordinary household attire for so mordaunt particularly
recommended she slipped into the castle and presently resuming the
various and numerous occupations which devolved on her seemed as deeply
engaged in household cares as if she had never been out of office

the first day of her return to her duty swertha made no appearance in
presence of her master but trusted that after his three days diet on
cold meat a hot dish dressed with the best of her simple skill might
introduce her favourably to his recollection when mordaunt had reported
that his father had taken no notice of this change of diet and when she
herself observed that in passing and repassing him occasionally her
appearance produced no effect upon her singular master she began to
imagine that the whole affair had escaped mr mertoun's memory and was
active in her duty as usual neither was she convinced of the contrary
until one day when happening somewhat to elevate her tone in a dispute
with the other maid-servant her master who at that time passed the
place of contest eyed her with a strong glance and pronounced the
single word remember in a tone which taught swertha the government
of her tongue for many weeks after

if mertoun was whimsical in his mode of governing his household he
seemed no less so in his plan of educating his son he showed the youth
but few symptoms of parental affection yet in his ordinary state of
mind the improvement of mordaunt's education seemed to be the utmost
object of his life he had both books and information sufficient to
discharge the task of tutor in the ordinary branches of knowledge and
in this capacity was regular calm and strict not to say severe in
exacting from his pupil the attention necessary for his profiting but
in the perusal of history to which their attention was frequently
turned as well as in the study of classic authors there often occurred
facts or sentiments which produced an instant effect upon mertoun's
mind and brought on him suddenly what swertha sweyn and even
mordaunt came to distinguish by the name of his dark hour he was
aware in the usual case of its approach and retreated to an inner
apartment into which he never permitted even mordaunt to enter here he
would abide in seclusion for days and even weeks only coming out at
uncertain times to take such food as they had taken care to leave
within his reach which he used in wonderfully small quantities at
other times and especially during the winter solstice when almost
every person spends the gloomy time within doors in feasting and
merriment this unhappy man would wrap himself in a dark-coloured
sea-cloak and wander out along the stormy beach or upon the desolate
heath indulging his own gloomy and wayward reveries under the inclement
sky the rather that he was then most sure to wander unencountered and
unobserved

as mordaunt grew older he learned to note the particular signs which
preceded these fits of gloomy despondency and to direct such
precautions as might ensure his unfortunate parent from ill-timed
interruption which had always the effect of driving him to fury
while at the same time full provision was made for his subsistence
mordaunt perceived that at such periods the melancholy fit of his father
was greatly prolonged if he chanced to present himself to his eyes
while the dark hour was upon him out of respect therefore to his
parent as well as to indulge the love of active exercise and of
amusement natural to his period of life mordaunt used often to absent
himself altogether from the mansion of jarlshof and even from the
district secure that his father if the dark hour passed away in his
absence would be little inclined to enquire how his son had disposed of
his leisure so that he was sure he had not watched his own weak
moments that being the subject on which he entertained the utmost
jealousy

at such times therefore all the sources of amusement which the country
afforded were open to the younger mertoun who in these intervals of
his education had an opportunity to give full scope to the energies of
a bold active and daring character he was often engaged with the
youth of the hamlet in those desperate sports to which the dreadful
trade of the samphire-gatherer is like a walk upon level ground often
joined those midnight excursions upon the face of the giddy cliffs to
secure the eggs or the young of the sea-fowl and in these daring
adventures displayed an address presence of mind and activity which
in one so young and not a native of the country astonished the oldest
fowlers

at other times mordaunt accompanied sweyn and other fishermen in their
long and perilous expeditions to the distant and deep sea learning
under their direction the management of the boat in which they equal
or exceed perhaps any natives of the british empire this exercise had
charms for mordaunt independently of the fishing alone

at this time the old norwegian sagas were much remembered and often
rehearsed by the fishermen who still preserved among themselves the
ancient norse tongue which was the speech of their forefathers in the
dark romance of those scandinavian tales lay much that was captivating
to a youthful ear and the classic fables of antiquity were rivalled at
least if not excelled in mordaunt's opinion by the strange legends of
berserkars of sea-kings of dwarfs giants and sorcerers which he
heard from the native zetlanders often the scenes around him were
assigned as the localities of the wild poems which half recited half
chanted by voices as hoarse if not so loud as the waves over which
they floated pointed out the very bay on which they sailed as the scene
of a bloody sea-fight the scarce-seen heap of stones that bristled over
the projecting cape as the dun or castle of some potent earl or noted
pirate the distant and solitary grey stone on the lonely moor as
marking the grave of a hero the wild cavern up which the sea rolled in
heavy broad and unbroken billows as the dwelling of some noted
sorceress

the ocean also had its mysteries the effect of which was aided by the
dim twilight through which it was imperfectly seen for more than half
the year its bottomless depths and secret caves contained according to
the account of sweyn and others skilled in legendary lore such wonders
as modern navigators reject with disdain in the quiet moonlight bay
where the waves came rippling to the shore upon a bed of smooth sand
intermingled with shells the mermaid was still seen to glide along the
waters and mingling her voice with the sighing breeze was often heard
to sing of subterranean wonders or to chant prophecies of future
events the kraken that hugest of living things was still supposed to
cumber the recesses of the northern ocean and often when some fog-bank
covered the sea at a distance the eye of the experienced boatman saw
the horns of the monstrous leviathan welking and waving amidst the
wreaths of mist and bore away with all press of oar and sail lest the
sudden suction occasioned by the sinking of the monstrous mass to the
bottom should drag within the grasp of its multifarious feelers his own
frail skiff the sea-snake was also known which arising out of the
depths of ocean stretches to the skies his enormous neck covered with
a mane like that of a war-horse and with its broad glittering eyes
raised mast-head high looks out as it seems for plunder or for
victims

many prodigious stories of these marine monsters and of many others
less known were then universally received among the zetlanders whose
descendants have not as yet by any means abandoned faith in them

such legends are indeed everywhere current amongst the vulgar but
the imagination is far more powerfully affected by them on the deep and
dangerous seas of the north amidst precipices and headlands many
hundred feet in height amid perilous straits and currents and
eddies long sunken reefs of rock over which the vivid ocean foams and
boils dark caverns to whose extremities neither man nor skiff has
ever ventured lonely and often uninhabited isles and occasionally
the ruins of ancient northern fastnesses dimly seen by the feeble light
of the arctic winter to mordaunt who had much of romance in his
disposition these superstitions formed a pleasing and interesting
exercise of the imagination while half doubting half inclined to
believe he listened to the tales chanted concerning these wonders of
nature and creatures of credulous belief told in the rude but
energetic language of the ancient scalds

but there wanted not softer and lighter amusement that might seem
better suited to mordaunt's age than the wild tales and rude exercises
which we have already mentioned the season of winter when from the
shortness of the daylight labour becomes impossible is in zetland the
time of revel feasting and merriment whatever the fisherman has been
able to acquire during summer was expended and often wasted in
maintaining the mirth and hospitality of his hearth during this period
while the landholders and gentlemen of the island gave double loose to
their convivial and hospitable dispositions thronged their houses with
guests and drove away the rigour of the season with jest glee and
song the dance and the wine-cup

amid the revels of this merry though rigorous season no youth added
more spirit to the dance or glee to the revel than the young stranger
mordaunt mertoun when his father's state of mind permitted or indeed
required his absence he wandered from house to house a welcome guest
whereever he came and lent his willing voice to the song and his foot
to the dance a boat or if the weather as was often the case
permitted not that convenience one of the numerous ponies which
straying in hordes about the extensive moors may be said to be at any
man's command who can catch them conveyed him from the mansion of one
hospitable zetlander to that of another none excelled him in performing
the warlike sword-dance a species of amusement which had been derived
from the habits of the ancient norsemen he could play upon the gue
and upon the common violin the melancholy and pathetic tunes peculiar
to the country and with great spirit and execution could relieve their
monotony with the livelier airs of the north of scotland when a party
set forth as maskers or as they are called in scotland guizards to
visit some neighbouring laird or rich udaller it augured well of the
expedition if mordaunt mertoun could be prevailed upon to undertake the
office of skudler or leader of the band upon these occasions full
of fun and frolic he led his retinue from house to house bringing
mirth where he went and leaving regret when he departed mordaunt
became thus generally known and beloved as generally through most of
the houses composing the patriarchal community of the main isle but his
visits were most frequently and most willingly paid at the mansion of
his father's landlord and protector magnus troil

it was not entirely the hearty and sincere welcome of the worthy old
magnate nor the sense that he was in effect his father's patron which
occasioned these frequent visits the hand of welcome was indeed
received as eagerly as it was sincerely given while the ancient
udaller raising himself in his huge chair whereof the inside was lined
with well-dressed sealskins and the outside composed of massive oak
carved by the rude graving-tool of some hamburgh carpenter shouted
forth his welcome in a tone which might in ancient times have hailed
the return of ioul the highest festival of the goths there was metal
yet more attractive and younger hearts whose welcome if less loud
was as sincere as that of the jolly udaller but this is matter which
ought not to be discussed at the conclusion of a chapter

we have already mentioned minna and brenda the daughters of magnus
troil their mother had been dead for many years and they were now two
beautiful girls the eldest only eighteen which might be a year or two
younger than mordaunt mertoun the second about seventeen they were
the joy of their father's heart and the light of his old eyes and
although indulged to a degree which might have endangered his comfort
and their own they repaid his affection with a love into which even
blind indulgence had not introduced slight regard or feminine caprice
the difference of their tempers and of their complexions was singularly
striking although combined as is usual with a certain degree of
family resemblance

the mother of these maidens had been a scottish lady from the highlands
of sutherland the orphan of a noble chief who driven from his own
country during the feuds of the seventeenth century had found shelter
in those peaceful islands which amidst poverty and seclusion were
thus far happy that they remained unvexed by discord and unstained by
civil broil the father his name was saint clair pined for his native
glen his feudal tower his clansmen and his fallen authority and died
not long after his arrival in zetland the beauty of his orphan
daughter despite her scottish lineage melted the stout heart of magnus
troil he sued and was listened to and she became his bride but dying
in the fifth year of their union left him to mourn his brief period of
domestic happiness

from her mother minna inherited the stately form and dark eyes the
raven locks and finely-pencilled brows which showed she was on one
side at least a stranger to the blood of thule her cheek 

 o call it fair not pale

was so slightly and delicately tinged with the rose that many thought
the lily had an undue proportion in her complexion but in that
predominance of the paler flower there was nothing sickly or languid
it was the true natural colour of health and corresponded in a peculiar
degree with features which seemed calculated to express a contemplative
and high-minded character when minna troil heard a tale of woe or of
injustice it was then her blood rushed to her cheeks and showed
plainly how warm it beat notwithstanding the generally serious
composed and retiring disposition which her countenance and demeanour
seemed to exhibit if strangers sometimes conceived that these fine
features were clouded by melancholy for which her age and situation
could scarce have given occasion they were soon satisfied upon
further acquaintance that the placid mild quietude of her disposition
and the mental energy of a character which was but little interested in
ordinary and trivial occurrences was the real cause of her gravity and
most men when they knew that her melancholy had no ground in real
sorrow and was only the aspiration of a soul bent on more important
objects than those by which she was surrounded might have wished her
whatever could add to her happiness but could scarce have desired that
graceful as she was in her natural and unaffected seriousness she
should change that deportment for one more gay in short
notwithstanding our wish to have avoided that hackneyed simile of an
angel we cannot avoid saying there was something in the serious beauty
of her aspect in the measured yet graceful ease of her motions in the
music of her voice and the serene purity of her eye that seemed as if
minna troil belonged naturally to some higher and better sphere and was
only the chance visitant of a world that was not worthy of her

the scarcely less beautiful equally lovely and equally innocent
brenda was of a complexion as differing from her sister as they
differed in character taste and expression her profuse locks were of
that paly brown which receives from the passing sunbeam a tinge of gold
but darkens again when the ray has passed from it her eye her mouth
the beautiful row of teeth which in her innocent vivacity were
frequently disclosed the fresh yet not too bright glow of a healthy
complexion tinging a skin like the drifted snow spoke her genuine
scandinavian descent a fairy form less tall than that of minna but
still more finely moulded into symmetry a careless and almost
childish lightness of step an eye that seemed to look on every object
with pleasure from a natural and serene cheerfulness of disposition
attracted even more general admiration than the charms of her sister
though perhaps that which minna did excite might be of a more intense as
well as more reverential character

the dispositions of these lovely sisters were not less different than
their complexions in the kindly affections neither could be said to
excel the other so much were they attached to their father and to each
other but the cheerfulness of brenda mixed itself with the every-day
business of life and seemed inexhaustible in its profusion the less
buoyant spirit of her sister appeared to bring to society a contented
wish to be interested and pleased with what was going forward but was
rather placidly carried along with the stream of mirth and pleasure
than disposed to aid its progress by any efforts of her own she endured
mirth rather than enjoyed it and the pleasures in which she most
delighted were those of a graver and more solitary cast the knowledge
which is derived from books was beyond her reach zetland afforded few
opportunities in those days of studying the lessons bequeathed

 by dead men to their kind

and magnus troil such as we have described him was not a person within
whose mansion the means of such knowledge were to be acquired but the
book of nature was before minna that noblest of volumes where we are
ever called to wonder and to admire even when we cannot understand
the plants of those wild regions the shells on the shores and the
long list of feathered clans which haunt their cliffs and eyries were
as well known to minna troil as to the most experienced fowlers her
powers of observation were wonderful and little interrupted by other
tones of feeling the information which she acquired by habits of
patient attention was indelibly riveted in a naturally powerful memory
she had also a high feeling for the solitary and melancholy grandeur of
the scenes in which she was placed the ocean in all its varied forms
of sublimity and terror the tremendous cliffs that resound to the
ceaseless roar of the billows and the clang of the sea-fowl had for
minna a charm in almost every state in which the changing seasons
exhibited them with the enthusiastic feelings proper to the romantic
race from which her mother descended the love of natural objects was to
her a passion capable not only of occupying but at times of agitating
her mind scenes upon which her sister looked with a sense of transient
awe or emotion which vanished on her return from witnessing them
continued long to fill minna's imagination not only in solitude and in
the silence of the night but in the hours of society so that sometimes
when she sat like a beautiful statue a present member of the domestic
circle her thoughts were far absent wandering on the wild sea-shore
and among the yet wilder mountains of her native isles and yet when
recalled to conversation and mingling in it with interest there were
few to whom her friends were more indebted for enhancing its enjoyments
and although something in her manners claimed deference notwithstanding
her early youth as well as affection even her gay lovely and
amiable sister was not more generally beloved than the more retired and
pensive minna

indeed the two lovely sisters were not only the delight of their
friends but the pride of those islands where the inhabitants of a
certain rank were blended by the remoteness of their situation and the
general hospitality of their habits into one friendly community a
wandering poet and parcel-musician who after going through various
fortunes had returned to end his days as he could in his native
islands had celebrated the daughters of magnus in a poem which he
entitled night and day and in his description of minna might almost be
thought to have anticipated though only in a rude outline the
exquisite lines of lord byron 

 she walks in beauty like the night
 of cloudless climes and starry skies
 and all that's best of dark and bright
 meet in her aspect and her eyes
 thus mellow'd to that tender light
 which heaven to gaudy day denies

their father loved the maidens both so well that it might be difficult
to say which he loved best saving that perchance he liked his graver
damsel better in the walk without doors and his merry maiden better by
the fireside that he more desired the society of minna when he was sad
and that of brenda when he was mirthful and what was nearly the same
thing preferred minna before noon and brenda after the glass had
circulated in the evening

but it was still more extraordinary that the affections of mordaunt
mertoun seemed to hover with the same impartiality as those of their
father betwixt the two lovely sisters from his boyhood as we have
noticed he had been a frequent inmate of the residence of magnus at
burgh-westra although it lay nearly twenty miles distant from jarlshof
the impassable character of the country betwixt these places extending
over hills covered with loose and quaking bog and frequently
intersected by the creeks or arms of the sea which indent the island on
either side as well as by fresh-water streams and lakes rendered the
journey difficult and even dangerous in the dark season yet as soon
as the state of his father's mind warned him to absent himself
mordaunt at every risk and under every difficulty was pretty sure to
be found the next day at burgh-westra having achieved his journey in
less time than would have been employed perhaps by the most active
native

he was of course set down as a wooer of one of the daughters of magnus
by the public of zetland and when the old udaller's great partiality to
the youth was considered nobody doubted that he might aspire to the
hand of either of those distinguished beauties with as large a share of
islets rocky moorland and shore-fishings as might be the fitting
portion of a favoured child and with the presumptive prospect of
possessing half the domains of the ancient house of troil when their
present owner should be no more this seemed all a reasonable
speculation and in theory at least better constructed than many that
are current through the world as unquestionable facts but alas all
that sharpness of observation which could be applied to the conduct of
the parties failed to determine the main point to which of the young
persons namely the attentions of mordaunt were peculiarly devoted he
seemed in general to treat them as an affectionate and attached
brother might have treated two sisters so equally dear to him that a
breath would have turned the scale of affection or if at any time
which often happened the one maiden appeared the more especial object
of his attention it seemed only to be because circumstances called her
peculiar talents and disposition into more particular and immediate
exercise

both the sisters were accomplished in the simple music of the north and
mordaunt who was their assistant and sometimes their preceptor when
they were practising this delightful art might be now seen assisting
minna in the acquisition of those wild solemn and simple airs to
which scalds and harpers sung of old the deeds of heroes and presently
found equally active in teaching brenda the more lively and complicated
music which their father's affection caused to be brought from the
english or scottish capital for the use of his daughters and while
conversing with them mordaunt who mingled a strain of deep and ardent
enthusiasm with the gay and ungovernable spirits of youth was equally
ready to enter into the wild and poetical visions of minna or into the
lively and often humorous chat of her gayer sister in short so little
did he seem to attach himself to either damsel exclusively that he was
sometimes heard to say that minna never looked so lovely as when her
lighthearted sister had induced her for the time to forget her
habitual gravity or brenda so interesting as when she sat listening a
subdued and affected partaker of the deep pathos of her sister minna

the public of the mainland were therefore to use the hunter's phrase
at fault in their farther conclusions and could but determine after
long vacillating betwixt the maidens that the young man was positively
to marry one of them but which of the two could only be determined when
his approaching manhood or the interference of stout old magnus the
father should teach master mordaunt mertoun to know his own mind it
was a pretty thing indeed they usually concluded that he no native
born and possessed of no visible means of subsistence that is known to
any one should presume to hesitate or affect to have the power of
selection and choice betwixt the two most distinguished beauties of
zetland if they were magnus troil they would soon be at the bottom of
the matter and so forth all which remarks were only whispered for
the hasty disposition of the udaller had too much of the old norse fire
about it to render it safe for any one to become an unauthorized
intermeddler with his family affairs and thus stood the relation of
mordaunt mertoun to the family of mr troil of burgh-westra when the
following incidents took place




chapter iv

 this is no pilgrim's morning yon grey mist
 lies upon hill and dale and field and forest
 like the dun wimple of a new-made widow
 and by my faith although my heart be soft
 i'd rather hear that widow weep and sigh
 and tell the virtues of the dear departed
 than when the tempest sends his voice abroad
 be subject to its fury

 the double nuptials


the spring was far advanced when after a week spent in sport and
festivity at burgh-westra mordaunt mertoun bade adieu to the family
pleading the necessity of his return to jarlshof the proposal was
combated by the maidens and more decidedly by magnus himself he saw no
occasion whatever for mordaunt returning to jarlshof if his father
desired to see him which by the way magnus did not believe mr
mertoun had only to throw himself into the stern of sweyn's boat or
betake himself to a pony if he liked a land journey better and he
would see not only his son but twenty folk besides who would be most
happy to find that he had not lost the use of his tongue entirely during
his long solitude although i must own added the worthy udaller
that when he lived among us nobody ever made less use of it

mordaunt acquiesced both in what respected his father's taciturnity and
his dislike to general society but suggested at the same time that
the first circumstance rendered his own immediate return more
necessary as he was the usual channel of communication betwixt his
father and others and that the second corroborated the same necessity
since mr mertoun's having no other society whatever seemed a weighty
reason why his son's should be restored to him without loss of time as
to his father's coming to burgh-westra they might as well he said
expect to see sumburgh cape come thither

and that would be a cumbrous guest said magnus but you will stop
for our dinner to-day there are the families of muness quendale
thorslivoe and i know not who else are expected and besides the
thirty that were in house this blessed night we shall have as many more
as chamber and bower and barn and boat-house can furnish with beds or
with barley-straw and you will leave all this behind you

and the blithe dance at night added brenda in a tone betwixt
reproach and vexation and the young men from the isle of paba that are
to dance the sword-dance whom shall we find to match them for the
honour of the main

there is many a merry dancer on the mainland brenda replied
mordaunt even if i should never rise on tiptoe again and where good
dancers are found brenda troil will always find the best partner i
must trip it to-night through the wastes of dunrossness

do not say so mordaunt said minna who during this conversation
had been looking from the window something anxiously go not to-day at
least through the wastes of dunrossness

and why not to-day minna said mordaunt laughing any more than
to-morrow

o the morning mist lies heavy upon yonder chain of isles nor has it
permitted us since daybreak even a single glimpse of fitful-head the
lofty cape that concludes yon splendid range of mountains the fowl are
winging their way to the shore and the shelldrake seems through the
mist as large as the scart see the very sheerwaters and bonxies
are making to the cliffs for shelter

and they will ride out a gale against a king's frigate said her
father there is foul weather when they cut and run

stay then with us said minna to her friend the storm will be
dreadful yet it will be grand to see it from burgh-westra if we have
no friend exposed to its fury see the air is close and sultry though
the season is yet so early and the day so calm that not a windlestraw
moves on the heath stay with us mordaunt the storm which these signs
announce will be a dreadful one

i must be gone the sooner was the conclusion of mordaunt who could
not deny the signs which had not escaped his own quick observation if
the storm be too fierce i will abide for the night at stourburgh

what said magnus will you leave us for the new chamberlain's new
scotch tacksman who is to teach all us zetland savages new ways take
your own gate my lad if that is the song you sing

nay said mordaunt i had only some curiosity to see the new
implements he has brought

ay ay ferlies make fools fain i would like to know if his new plough
will bear against a zetland rock answered magnus

i must not pass stourburgh on the journey said the youth deferring
to his patron's prejudice against innovation if this boding weather
bring on tempest but if it only break in rain as is most probable i
am not likely to be melted in the wetting

it will not soften into rain alone said minna see how much heavier
the clouds fall every moment and see these weather-gaws that streak the
lead-coloured mass with partial gleams of faded red and purple

i see them all said mordaunt but they only tell me i have no time
to tarry here adieu minna i will send you the eagle's feathers if an
eagle can be found on fair-isle or foulah and fare thee well my pretty
brenda and keep a thought for me should the paba men dance ever so
well

take care of yourself since go you will said both sisters together

old magnus scolded them formally for supposing there was any danger to
an active young fellow from a spring gale whether by sea or land yet
ended by giving his own caution also to mordaunt advising him seriously
to delay his journey or at least to stop at stourburgh for said he
second thoughts are best and as this scottishman's howf lies right
under your lee why take any port in a storm but do not be assured to
find the door on latch let the storm blow ever so hard there are such
matters as bolts and bars in scotlande though thanks to saint
ronald they are unknown here save that great lock on the old castle
of scalloway that all men run to see may be they make part of this
man's improvements but go mordaunt since go you will you should
drink a stirrup-cup now were you three years older but boys should
never drink excepting after dinner i will drink it for you that good
customs may not be broken or bad luck come of it here is your bonally
my lad and so saying he quaffed a rummer glass of brandy with as much
impunity as if it had been spring-water thus regretted and cautioned on
all hands mordaunt took leave of the hospitable household and looking
back at the comforts with which it was surrounded and the dense smoke
that rolled upwards from its chimneys he first recollected the
guestless and solitary desolation of jarlshof then compared with the
sullen and moody melancholy of his father's temper the warm kindness of
those whom he was leaving and could not refrain from a sigh at the
thoughts which forced themselves on his imagination

the signs of the tempest did not dishonour the predictions of minna
mordaunt had not advanced three hours on his journey before the wind
which had been so deadly still in the morning began at first to wail
and sigh as if bemoaning beforehand the evils which it might perpetrate
in its fury like a madman in the gloomy state of dejection which
precedes his fit of violence then gradually increasing the gale
howled raged and roared with the full fury of a northern storm it
was accompanied by showers of rain mixed with hail that dashed with the
most unrelenting rage against the hills and rocks with which the
traveller was surrounded distracting his attention in spite of his
utmost exertions and rendering it very difficult for him to keep the
direction of his journey in a country where there is neither road nor
even the slightest track to direct the steps of the wanderer and where
he is often interrupted by brooks as well as large pools of water
lakes and lagoons all these inland waters were now lashed into sheets
of tumbling foam much of which carried off by the fury of the
whirlwind was mingled with the gale and transported far from the waves
of which it had lately made a part while the salt relish of the drift
which was pelted against his face showed mordaunt that the spray of the
more distant ocean disturbed to frenzy by the storm was mingled with
that of the inland lakes and streams

amidst this hideous combustion of the elements mordaunt mertoun
struggled forward as one to whom such elemental war was familiar and
who regarded the exertions which it required to withstand its fury but
as a mark of resolution and manhood he felt even as happens usually to
those who endure great hardships that the exertion necessary to subdue
them is in itself a kind of elevating triumph to see and distinguish
his path when the cattle were driven from the hill and the very fowls
from the firmament was but the stronger proof of his own superiority
they shall not hear of me at burgh-westra said he to himself as
they heard of old doited ringan ewenson's boat that foundered betwixt
roadstead and key i am more of a cragsman than to mind fire or water
wave by sea or quagmire by land thus he struggled on buffeting with
the storm supplying the want of the usual signs by which travellers
directed their progress for rock mountain and headland were
shrouded in mist and darkness by the instinctive sagacity with which
long acquaintance with these wilds had taught him to mark every minute
object which could serve in such circumstances to regulate his course
thus we repeat he struggled onward occasionally standing still or
even lying down when the gust was most impetuous making way against it
when it was somewhat lulled by a rapid and bold advance even in its
very current or when this was impossible by a movement resembling
that of a vessel working to windward by short tacks but never yielding
one inch of the way which he had fought so hard to gain

yet notwithstanding mordaunt's experience and resolution his situation
was sufficiently uncomfortable and even precarious not because his
sailor's jacket and trowsers the common dress of young men through
these isles when on a journey were thoroughly wet for that might have
taken place within the same brief time in any ordinary day in this
watery climate but the real danger was that notwithstanding his
utmost exertions he made very slow way through brooks that were sending
their waters all abroad through morasses drowned in double deluges of
moisture which rendered all the ordinary passes more than usually
dangerous and repeatedly obliged the traveller to perform a
considerable circuit which in the usual case was unnecessary thus
repeatedly baffled notwithstanding his youth and strength mordaunt
after maintaining a dogged conflict with wind rain and the fatigue of
a prolonged journey was truly happy when not without having been more
than once mistaken in his road he at length found himself within sight
of the house of stourburgh or harfra for the names were indifferently
given to the residence of mr triptolemus yellowley who was the chosen
missionary of the chamberlain of orkney and zetland a speculative
person who designed through the medium of triptolemus to introduce
into the ultima thule of the romans a spirit of improvement which at
that early period was scarce known to exist in scotland itself

at length and with much difficulty mordaunt reached the house of this
worthy agriculturist the only refuge from the relentless storm which he
could hope to meet with for several miles and going straight to the
door with the most undoubting confidence of instant admission he was
not a little surprised to find it not merely latched which the weather
might excuse but even bolted a thing which as magnus troil has
already intimated was almost unknown in the archipelago to knock to
call and finally to batter the door with staff and stones were the
natural resources of the youth who was rendered alike impatient by the
pelting of the storm and by encountering such most unexpected and
unusual obstacles to instant admission as he was suffered however for
many minutes to exhaust his impatience in noise and clamour without
receiving any reply we will employ them in informing the reader who
triptolemus yellowley was and how he came by a name so singular

old jasper yellowley the father of triptolemus though born at the
foot of roseberry-topping had been come over by a certain noble
scottish earl who proving too far north for canny yorkshire had
persuaded him to accept of a farm in the mearns where it is
unnecessary to add he found matters very different from what he had
expected it was in vain that the stout farmer set manfully to work to
counterbalance by superior skill the inconveniences arising from a
cold soil and a weeping climate these might have been probably
overcome but his neighbourhood to the grampians exposed him eternally
to that species of visitation from the plaided gentry who dwelt within
their skirts which made young norval a warrior and a hero but only
converted jasper yellowley into a poor man this was indeed balanced
in some sort by the impression which his ruddy cheek and robust form had
the fortune to make upon miss barbara clinkscale daughter to the
umquhile and sister to the then existing clinkscale of that ilk

this was thought a horrid and unnatural union in the neighbourhood
considering that the house of clinkscale had at least as great a share
of scottish pride as of scottish parsimony and was amply endowed with
both but miss babie had her handsome fortune of two thousand marks at
her own disposal was a woman of spirit who had been major and sui
juris as the writer who drew the contract assured her for full
twenty years so she set consequences and commentaries alike at
defiance and wedded the hearty yorkshire yeoman her brother and her
more wealthy kinsmen drew off in disgust and almost disowned their
degraded relative but the house of clinkscale was allied like every
other family in scotland at the time to a set of relations who were not
so nice tenth and sixteenth cousins who not only acknowledged their
kinswoman babie after her marriage with yellowley but even condescended
to eat beans and bacon though the latter was then the abomination of
the scotch as much as of the jews with her husband and would
willingly have cemented the friendship by borrowing a little cash from
him had not his good lady who understood trap as well as any woman in
the mearns put a negative on this advance to intimacy indeed she knew
how to make young deilbelicketf old dougald baresword the laird of
bandybrawl and others pay for the hospitality which she did not think
proper to deny them by rendering them useful in her negotiations with
the lighthanded lads beyond the cairn who finding their late object of
plunder was now allied to kend folks and owned by them at kirk and
market became satisfied on a moderate yearly composition to desist
from their depredations

this eminent success reconciled jasper to the dominion which his wife
began to assume over him and which was much confirmed by her proving to
be let me see what is the prettiest mode of expressing it in the
family way on this occasion mrs yellowley had a remarkable dream as
is the usual practice of teeming mothers previous to the birth of an
illustrious offspring she was a-dreamed as her husband expressed it
that she was safely delivered of a plough drawn by three yoke of
angus-shire oxen and being a mighty investigator into such portents
she sat herself down with her gossips to consider what the thing might
mean honest jasper ventured with much hesitation to intimate his own
opinion that the vision had reference rather to things past than things
future and might have been occasioned by his wife's nerves having been
a little startled by meeting in the loan above the house his own great
plough with the six oxen which were the pride of his heart but the
good cummers raised such a hue and cry against this exposition
that jasper was fain to put his fingers in his ears and to run out of
the apartment

hear to him said an old whigamore carline hear to him wi his
owsen that are as an idol to him even as the calf of bethel na
na it's nae pleugh of the flesh that the bonny lad-bairn for a lad it
sall be sall e'er striddle between the stilts o it's the pleugh of
the spirit and i trust mysell to see him wag the head o him in a
pu'pit or what's better on a hill-side

now the deil's in your whiggery said the old lady glenprosing wad
ye hae our cummer's bonny lad-bairn wag the head aff his shouthers like
your godly mess james guthrieg that ye hald such a clavering
about na na he sall walk a mair siccar path and be a dainty
curate and say he should live to be a bishop what the waur wad he be

the gauntlet thus fairly flung down by one sibyl was caught up by
another and the controversy between presbytery and episcopacy raged
roared or rather screamed a round of cinnamon-water serving only like
oil to the flame till jasper entered with the plough-staff and by the
awe of his presence and the shame of misbehaving before the stranger
man imposed some conditions of silence upon the disputants

i do not know whether it was impatience to give to the light a being
destined to such high and doubtful fates or whether poor dame yellowley
was rather frightened at the hurly-burly which had taken place in her
presence but she was taken suddenly ill and contrary to the formula
in such cases used and provided was soon reported to be a good deal
worse than was to be expected she took the opportunity having still
all her wits about her to extract from her sympathetic husband two
promises first that he would christen the child whose birth was like
to cost her so dear by a name indicative of the vision with which she
had been favoured and next that he would educate him for the ministry
the canny yorkshireman thinking she had a good title at present to
dictate in such matters subscribed to all she required a man-child was
accordingly born under these conditions but the state of the mother did
not permit her for many days to enquire how far they had been complied
with when she was in some degree convalescent she was informed that
as it was thought fit the child should be immediately christened it had
received the name of triptolemus the curate who was a man of some
classical skill conceiving that this epithet contained a handsome and
classical allusion to the visionary plough with its triple yoke of
oxen mrs yellowley was not much delighted with the manner in which her
request had been complied with but grumbling being to as little purpose
as in the celebrated case of tristram shandy she e'en sat down
contented with the heathenish name and endeavoured to counteract the
effects it might produce upon the taste and feelings of the nominee by
such an education as might put him above the slightest thought of sacks
coulters stilts mould-boards or any thing connected with the servile
drudgery of the plough

jasper sage yorkshireman smiled slyly in his sleeve conceiving that
young trippie was likely to prove a chip of the old block and would
rather take after the jolly yorkshire yeoman than the gentle but
somewhat aigre blood of the house of clinkscale he remarked with
suppressed glee that the tune which best answered the purpose of a
lullaby was the ploughman's whistle and the first words the infant
learned to stammer were the names of the oxen moreover that the bern
preferred home-brewed ale to scotch twopenny and never quitted hold of
the tankard with so much reluctance as when there had been by some
manoeuvre of jasper's own device a double straik of malt allowed to the
brewing above that which was sanctioned by the most liberal recipe of
which his dame's household thrift admitted besides this when no other
means could be fallen upon to divert an occasional fit of squalling his
father observed that trip could be always silenced by jingling a bridle
at his ear from all which symptoms he used to swear in private that
the boy would prove true yorkshire and mother and mother's kin would
have small share of him

meanwhile and within a year after the birth of triptolemus mrs
yellowley bore a daughter named after herself barbara who even in
earliest infancy exhibited the pinched nose and thin lips by which the
clinkscale family were distinguished amongst the inhabitants of the
mearns and as her childhood advanced the readiness with which she
seized and the tenacity wherewith she detained the playthings of
triptolemus besides a desire to bite pinch and scratch on slight or
no provocation were all considered by attentive observers as proofs
that miss babie would prove her mother over again malicious people
did not stick to say that the acrimony of the clinkscale blood had not
on this occasion been cooled and sweetened by that of old england
that young deilbelicket was much about the house and they could not but
think it odd that mrs yellowley who as the whole world knew gave
nothing for nothing should be so uncommonly attentive to heap the
trencher and to fill the caup of an idle blackguard ne'er-do-weel but
when folk had once looked upon the austere and awfully virtuous
countenance of mrs yellowley they did full justice to her propriety of
conduct and deilbelicket's delicacy of taste

meantime young triptolemus having received such instructions as the
curate could give him for though dame yellowley adhered to the
persecuted remnant her jolly husband edified by the black gown and
prayer-book still conformed to the church as by law established was
in due process of time sent to saint andrews to prosecute his studies
he went it is true but with an eye turned back with sad remembrances
on his father's plough his father's pancakes and his father's ale for
which the small-beer of the college commonly there termed
thorough-go-nimble furnished a poor substitute yet he advanced in
his learning being found however to show a particular favour to such
authors of antiquity as had made the improvement of the soil the object
of their researches he endured the bucolics of virgil the georgics he
had by heart but the æneid he could not away with and he was
particularly severe upon the celebrated line expressing a charge of
cavalry because as he understood the word putrem he opined that
the combatants in their inconsiderate ardour galloped over a
new-manured ploughed field cato the roman censor was his favourite
among classical heroes and philosophers not on account of the
strictness of his morals but because of his treatise de re rustica
he had ever in his mouth the phrase of cicero jam neminem antepones
catoni he thought well of palladius and of terentius varro but
columella was his pocket-companion to these ancient worthies he added
the more modern tusser hartlib and other writers on rural economics
not forgetting the lucubrations of the shepherd of salisbury plain and
such of the better-informed philomaths who instead of loading their
almanacks with vain predictions of political events pretended to see
what seeds would grow and what would not and direct the attention of
their readers to that course of cultivation from which the production of
good crops may be safely predicted modest sages in fine who careless
of the rise and downfall of empires content themselves with pointing
out the fit seasons to reap and sow with a fair guess at the weather
which each month will be likely to present as for example that if
heaven pleases we shall have snow in january and the author will stake
his reputation that july proves on the whole a month of sunshine now
although the rector of saint leonard's was greatly pleased in general
with the quiet laborious and studious bent of triptolemus yellowley
and deemed him in so far worthy of a name of four syllables having a
latin termination yet he relished not by any means his exclusive
attention to his favourite authors it savoured of the earth he said
if not of something worse to have a man's mind always grovelling in
mould stercorated or unstercorated and he pointed out but in vain
history and poetry and divinity as more elevating subjects of
occupation triptolemus yellowley was obstinate in his own course of
the battle of pharsalia he thought not as it affected the freedom of
the world but dwelt on the rich crop which the emathian fields were
likely to produce the next season in vernacular poetry triptolemus
could scarce be prevailed upon to read a single couplet excepting old
tusser as aforesaid whose hundred points of good husbandry he had got
by heart and excepting also piers ploughman's vision which charmed
with the title he bought with avidity from a packman but after reading
the two first pages flung it into the fire as an impudent and misnamed
political libel as to divinity he summed that matter up by reminding
his instructors that to labour the earth and win his bread with the
toil of his body and sweat of his brow was the lot imposed upon fallen
man and for his part he was resolved to discharge to the best of his
abilities a task so obviously necessary to existence leaving others to
speculate as much as they would upon the more recondite mysteries of
theology

with a spirit so much narrowed and limited to the concerns of rural
life it may be doubted whether the proficiency of triptolemus in
learning or the use he was like to make of his acquisitions would have
much gratified the ambitious hope of his affectionate mother it is
true he expressed no reluctance to embrace the profession of a
clergyman which suited well enough with the habitual personal indolence
which sometimes attaches to speculative dispositions he had views to
speak plainly i wish they were peculiar to himself of cultivating
the glebe six days in the week preaching on the seventh with due
regularity and dining with some fat franklin or country laird with
whom he could smoke a pipe and drink a tankard after dinner and mix in
secret conference on the exhaustless subject

 quid faciat lætas segetes

now this plan besides that it indicated nothing of what was then
called the root of the matter implied necessarily the possession of a
manse and the possession of a manse inferred compliance with the
doctrines of prelacy and other enormities of the time there was some
question how far manse and glebe stipend both victual and money might
have outbalanced the good lady's predisposition towards presbytery but
her zeal was not put to so severe a trial she died before her son had
completed his studies leaving her afflicted spouse just as disconsolate
as was to be expected the first act of old jasper's undivided
administration was to recall his son from saint andrews in order to
obtain his assistance in his domestic labours and here it might have
been supposed that our triptolemus summoned to carry into practice what
he had so fondly studied in theory must have been to use a simile
which he would have thought lively like a cow entering upon a clover
park alas mistaken thoughts and deceitful hopes of mankind

a laughing philosopher the democritus of our day once in a moral
lecture compared human life to a table pierced with a number of holes
each of which has a pin made exactly to fit it but which pins being
stuck in hastily and without selection chance leads inevitably to the
most awkward mistakes for how often do we see the orator
pathetically concluded how often i say do we see the round man
stuck into the three-cornered hole this new illustration of the
vagaries of fortune set every one present into convulsions of laughter
excepting one fat alderman who seemed to make the case his own and
insisted that it was no jesting matter to take up the simile however
which is an excellent one it is plain that triptolemus yellowley had
been shaken out of the bag at least a hundred years too soon if he had
come on the stage in our own time that is if he had flourished at any
time within these thirty or forty years he could not have missed to
have held the office of vice-president of some eminent agricultural
society and to have transacted all the business thereof under the
auspices of some noble duke or lord who as the matter might happen
either knew or did not know the difference betwixt a horse and a cart
and a cart-horse he could not have missed such preferment for he was
exceedingly learned in all those particulars which being of no
consequence in actual practice go of course a great way to constitute
the character of a connoisseur in any art and especially in
agriculture but alas triptolemus yellowley had as we already have
hinted come into the world at least a century too soon for instead of
sitting in an arm-chair with a hammer in his hand and a bumper of port
before him giving forth the toast to breeding in all its branches
his father planted him betwixt the stilts of a plough and invited him
to guide the oxen on whose beauties he would in our day have
descanted and whose rumps he would not have goaded but have carved
old jasper complained that although no one talked so well of common and
several wheat and rape fallow and lea as his learned son whom he
always called tolimus yet dang it added the seneca nought
thrives wi un nought thrives wi un it was still worse when jasper
becoming frail and ancient was obliged as happened in the course of a
few years gradually to yield up the reins of government to the
academical neophyte

as if nature had meant him a spite he had got one of the dourest and
most intractable farms in the mearns to try conclusions withal a place
which seemed to yield every thing but what the agriculturist wanted for
there were plenty of thistles which indicates dry land and store of
fern which is said to intimate deep land and nettles which show where
lime hath been applied and deep furrows in the most unlikely spots
which intimated that it had been cultivated in former days by the
peghts as popular tradition bore there was also enough of stones to
keep the ground warm according to the creed of some farmers and great
abundance of springs to render it cool and sappy according to the
theory of others it was in vain that acting alternately on these
opinions poor triptolemus endeavoured to avail himself of the supposed
capabilities of the soil no kind of butter that might be churned could
be made to stick upon his own bread any more than on that of poor
tusser whose hundred points of good husbandry so useful to others of
his day were never to himself worth as many pennies

in fact excepting an hundred acres of infield to which old jasper had
early seen the necessity of limiting his labours there was not a
corner of the farm fit for any thing but to break plough-graith and
kill cattle and then as for the part which was really tilled with some
profit the expense of the farming establishment of triptolemus and his
disposition to experiment soon got rid of any good arising from the
cultivation of it the carles and the cart-avers he confessed with a
sigh speaking of his farm-servants and horses make it all and the
carles and cart-avers eat it all a conclusion which might sum up the
year-book of many a gentleman farmer

matters would have soon been brought to a close with triptolemus in the
present day he would have got a bank-credit manoeuvred with
wind-bills dashed out upon a large scale and soon have seen his crop
and stock sequestered by the sheriff but in those days a man could not
ruin himself so easily the whole scottish tenantry stood upon the same
level flat of poverty so that it was extremely difficult to find any
vantage ground by climbing up to which a man might have an opportunity
of actually breaking his neck with some eclat they were pretty much in
the situation of people who being totally without credit may indeed
suffer from indigence but cannot possibly become bankrupt besides
notwithstanding the failure of triptolemus's projects there was to be
balanced against the expenditure which they occasioned all the savings
which the extreme economy of his sister barbara could effect and in
truth her exertions were wonderful she might have realized if any one
could the idea of the learned philosopher who pronounced that sleeping
was a fancy and eating but a habit and who appeared to the world to
have renounced both until it was unhappily discovered that he had an
intrigue with the cook-maid of the family who indemnified him for his
privations by giving him private entrée to the pantry and to a share of
her own couch but no such deceptions were practised by barbara
yellowley she was up early and down late and seemed to her
over-watched and over-tasked maidens to be as wakerife as the cat
herself then for eating it appeared that the air was a banquet to
her and she would fain have made it so to her retinue her brother
who besides being lazy in his person was somewhat luxurious in his
appetite would willingly now and then have tasted a mouthful of animal
food were it but to know how his sheep were fed off but a proposal to
eat a child could not have startled mistress barbara more and being of
a compliant and easy disposition triptolemus reconciled himself to the
necessity of a perpetual lent too happy when he could get a scrap of
butter to his oaten cake or as they lived on the banks of the esk
escape the daily necessity of eating salmon whether in or out of
season six days out of the seven

but although mrs barbara brought faithfully to the joint stock all
savings which her awful powers of economy accomplished to scrape
together and although the dower of their mother was by degrees
expended or nearly so in aiding them upon extreme occasions the term
at length approached when it seemed impossible that they could sustain
the conflict any longer against the evil star of triptolemus as he
called it himself or the natural result of his absurd speculations as
it was termed by others luckily at this sad crisis a god jumped down
to their relief out of a machine in plain english the noble lord who
owned their farm arrived at his mansion-house in their neighbourhood
with his coach and six and his running footmen in the full splendour
of the seventeenth century

this person of quality was the son of the nobleman who had brought the
ancient jasper into the country from yorkshire and he was like his
father a fanciful and scheming man he had schemed well for
himself however amid the mutations of the time having obtained for a
certain period of years the administration of the remote islands of
orkney and zetland for payment of a certain rent with the right of
making the most of whatever was the property or revenue of the crown in
these districts under the title of lord chamberlain now his lordship
had become possessed with a notion in itself a very true one that much
might be done to render this grant available by improving the culture
of the crown lands both in orkney and zetland and then having some
acquaintance with our friend triptolemus he thought rather less
happily that he might prove a person capable of furthering his schemes
he sent for him to the great hallhouse and was so much edified by the
way in which our friend laid down the law upon every given subject
relating to rural economy that he lost no time in securing the
co-operation of so valuable an assistant the first step being to
release him from his present unprofitable farm

the terms were arranged much to the mind of triptolemus who had already
been taught by many years experience a dark sort of notion that
without undervaluing or doubting for a moment his own skill it would be
quite as well that almost all the trouble and risk should be at the
expense of his employer indeed the hopes of advantage which he held
out to his patron were so considerable that the lord chamberlain
dropped every idea of admitting his dependent into any share of the
expected profits for rude as the arts of agriculture were in scotland
they were far superior to those known and practised in the regions of
thule and triptolemus yellowley conceived himself to be possessed of a
degree of insight into these mysteries far superior to what was
possessed or practised even in the mearns the improvement therefore
which was to be expected would bear a double proportion and the lord
chamberlain was to reap all the profit deducting a handsome salary for
his steward yellowley together with the accommodation of a house and
domestic farm for the support of his family joy seized the heart of
mistress barbara at hearing this happy termination of what threatened
to be so very bad an affair as the lease of cauldacres

if we cannot she said provide for our own house when all is coming
in and nothing going out surely we must be worse than infidels

triptolemus was a busy man for some time huffing and puffing and
eating and drinking in every changehouse while he ordered and collected
together proper implements of agriculture to be used by the natives of
these devoted islands whose destinies were menaced with this formidable
change singular tools these would seem if presented before a modern
agricultural society but every thing is relative nor could the heavy
cartload of timber called the old scots plough seem less strange to a
scottish farmer of this present day than the corslets and casques of
the soldiers of cortes might seem to a regiment of our own army yet the
latter conquered mexico and undoubtedly the former would have been a
splendid improvement on the state of agriculture in thule

we have never been able to learn why triptolemus preferred fixing his
residence in zetland to becoming an inhabitant of the orkneys perhaps
he thought the inhabitants of the latter archipelago the more simple and
docile of the two kindred tribes or perhaps he considered the situation
of the house and farm he himself was to occupy which was indeed a
tolerable one as preferable to that which he had it in his power to
have obtained upon pomona so the main island of the orkneys is
entitled at harfra or as it was sometimes called stourburgh from
the remains of a pictish fort which was almost close to the
mansion-house the factor settled himself in the plenitude of his
authority determined to honour the name he bore by his exertions in
precept and example to civilize the zetlanders and improve their very
confined knowledge in the primary arts of human life

 if it shouldna be barr'd this hundred years

 old song


we can only hope that the gentle reader has not found the latter part of
the last chapter extremely tedious but at any rate his impatience
will scarce equal that of young mordaunt mertoun who while the
lightning came flash after flash while the wind veering and shifting
from point to point blew with all the fury of a hurricane and while
the rain was dashed against him in deluges stood hammering calling
and roaring at the door of the old place of harfra impatient for
admittance and at a loss to conceive any position of existing
circumstances which could occasion the exclusion of a stranger
especially during such horrible weather at length finding his noise
and vociferation were equally in vain he fell back so far from the
front of the house as was necessary to enable him to reconnoitre the
chimneys and amidst storm and shade could discover to the increase
of his dismay that though noon then the dinner hour of these islands
was now nearly arrived there was no smoke proceeding from the tunnels
of the vents to give any note of preparation within

mordaunt's wrathful impatience was now changed into sympathy and alarm
for so long accustomed to the exuberant hospitality of the zetland
islands he was immediately induced to suppose some strange and
unaccountable disaster had befallen the family and forthwith set
himself to discover some place at which he could make forcible entry in
order to ascertain the situation of the inmates as much as to obtain
shelter from the still increasing storm his present anxiety was
however as much thrown away as his late clamorous importunities for
admittance had been triptolemus and his sister had heard the whole
alarm without and had already had a sharp dispute on the propriety of
opening the door

mrs baby as we have described her was no willing renderer of the
rites of hospitality in their farm of cauldacres in the mearns she
had been the dread and abhorrence of all gaberlunzie men and travelling
packmen gipsies long remembered beggars and so forth nor was there
one of them so wily as she used to boast as could ever say they had
heard the clink of her sneck in zetland where the new settlers were
yet strangers to the extreme honesty and simplicity of all classes
suspicion and fear joined with frugality in her desire to exclude all
wandering guests of uncertain character and the second of these motives
had its effect on triptolemus himself who though neither suspicious
nor penurious knew good people were scarce good farmers scarcer and
had a reasonable share of that wisdom which looks towards
self-preservation as the first law of nature these hints may serve as
a commentary on the following dialogue which took place betwixt the
brother and sister

now good be gracious to us said triptolemus as he sat thumbing his
old school-copy of virgil here is a pure day for the bear seed well
spoke the wise mantuan ventis surgentibus and then the groans of the
mountains and the long-resounding shores but where's the woods baby
tell me i say where we shall find the nemorum murmur sister baby
in these new seats of ours

what's your foolish will said baby popping her head from out of a
dark recess in the kitchen where she was busy about some nameless deed
of housewifery

her brother who had addressed himself to her more from habit than
intention no sooner saw her bleak red nose keen grey eyes with the
sharp features thereunto conforming shaded by the flaps of the loose
toy which depended on each side of her eager face than he bethought
himself that his query was likely to find little acceptation from her
and therefore stood another volley before he would resume the topic

i say mr yellowley said sister baby coming into the middle of the
room what for are ye crying on me and me in the midst of my
housewifeskep

nay for nothing at all baby answered triptolemus saving that i
was saying to myself that here we had the sea and the wind and the
rain sufficient enough but where's the wood where's the wood baby
answer me that

the wood replied baby were i no to take better care of the wood
than you brother there would soon be no more wood about the town than
the barber's block that's on your own shoulders triptolemus if ye be
thinking of the wreck-wood that the callants brought in yesterday there
was six ounces of it gaed to boil your parritch this morning though i
trow a carefu man wad have ta'en drammock if breakfast he behoved to
have rather than waste baith meltith and fuel in the same morning

that is to say baby replied triptolemus who was somewhat of a dry
joker in his way that when we have fire we are not to have food and
when we have food we are not to have fire these being too great
blessings to enjoy both in the same day good luck you do not propose
we should starve with cold and starve with hunger unico contextu but
to tell you the truth i could never away with raw oatmeal slockened
with water in all my life call it drammock or crowdie or just what
ye list my vivers must thole fire and water

the mair gowk you said baby can ye not make your brose on the
sunday and sup them cauld on the monday since ye're sae dainty mony
is the fairer face than yours that has licked the lip after such a
cogfu

mercy on us sister said triptolemus at this rate it's a finished
field with me i must unyoke the pleugh and lie down to wait for the
dead-thraw here is that in this house wad hold all zetland in meal for
a twelvemonth and ye grudge a cogfu of warm parritch to me that has
sic a charge

whisht haud your silly clavering tongue said baby looking round
with apprehension ye are a wise man to speak of what is in the house
and a fitting man to have the charge of it hark as i live by bread
i hear a tapping at the outer yett

go and open it then baby said her brother glad at any thing that
promised to interrupt the dispute

go and open it said he echoed baby half angry half frightened and
half triumphant at the superiority of her understanding over that of her
brother go and open it said he indeed is it to lend robbers a
chance to take all that is in the house

robbers echoed triptolemus in his turn there are no more robbers
in this country than there are lambs at yule i tell you as i have told
you an hundred times there are no highlandmen to harry us here this is
a land of quiet and honesty o fortunati nimium

and what good is saint rinian to do ye tolimus said his sister
mistaking the quotation for a catholic invocation besides if there be
no highlandmen there may be as bad i saw sax or seven as ill-looking
chields gang past the place yesterday as ever came frae beyont
clochna-ben ill-fa'red tools they had in their hands whaaling knives
they ca'ed them but they looked as like dirks and whingers as ae bit
airn can look like anither there is nae honest men carry siccan tools

here the knocking and shouts of mordaunt were very audible betwixt every
swell of the horrible blast which was careering without the brother and
sister looked at each other in real perplexity and fear if they have
heard of the siller said baby her very nose changing with terror from
red to blue we are but gane folk

who speaks now when they should hold their tongue said triptolemus
go to the shot-window instantly and see how many there are of them
while i load the old spanish-barrelled duck-gun go as if you were
stepping on new-laid eggs

baby crept to the window and reported that she saw only one young
chield clattering and roaring as gin he were daft how many there might
be out of sight she could not say

out of sight nonsense said triptolemus laying aside the ramrod
with which he was loading the piece with a trembling hand i will
warrant them out of sight and hearing both this is some poor fellow
catched in the tempest wants the shelter of our roof and a little
refreshment open the door baby it's a christian deed

but is it a christian deed of him to come in at the window then said
baby setting up a most doleful shriek as mordaunt mertoun who had
forced open one of the windows leaped down into the apartment dripping
with water like a river god triptolemus in great tribulation
presented the gun which he had not yet loaded while the intruder
exclaimed hold hold what the devil mean you by keeping your doors
bolted in weather like this and levelling your gun at folk's heads as
you would at a sealgh's

and who are you friend and what want you said triptolemus lowering
the but of his gun to the floor as he spoke and so recovering his arms

what do i want said mordaunt i want every thing i want meat
drink and fire a bed for the night and a sheltie for to-morrow
morning to carry me to jarlshof

and ye said there were nae caterans or sorners here said baby to the
agriculturist reproachfully heard ye ever a breekless loon frae
lochaber tell his mind and his errand mair deftly come come friend
she added addressing herself to mordaunt put up your pipes and gang
your gate this is the house of his lordship's factor and no place of
reset for thiggers or sorners

mordaunt laughed in her face at the simplicity of the request leave
built walls he said and in such a tempest as this what take you me
for a gannet or a scart do you think i am that your clapping your
hands and skirling at me like a madwoman should drive me from the
shelter into the storm

and so you propose young man said triptolemus gravely to stay in
my house volens nolens that is whether we will or no

will said mordaunt what right have you to will any thing about it
do you not hear the thunder do you not hear the rain do you not see
the lightning and do you not know this is the only house within i wot
not how many miles come my good master and dame this may be scottish
jesting but it sounds strange in zetland ears you have let out the
fire too and my teeth are dancing a jig in my head with cold but i'll
soon put that to rights

he seized the fire-tongs raked together the embers upon the hearth
broke up into life the gathering-peat which the hostess had calculated
should have preserved the seeds of fire without giving them forth for
many hours then casting his eye round saw in a corner the stock of
drift-wood which mistress baby had served forth by ounces and
transferred two or three logs of it at once to the hearth which
conscious of such unwonted supply began to transmit to the chimney
such a smoke as had not issued from the place of harfra for many a day

while their uninvited guest was thus making himself at home baby kept
edging and jogging the factor to turn out the intruder but for this
undertaking triptolemus yellowley felt neither courage nor zeal nor
did circumstances seem at all to warrant the favourable conclusion of
any fray into which he might enter with the young stranger the sinewy
limbs and graceful form of mordaunt mertoun were seen to great advantage
in his simple sea-dress and with his dark sparkling eye finely formed
head animated features close curled dark hair and bold free looks
the stranger formed a very strong contrast with the host on whom he had
intruded himself triptolemus was a short clumsy duck-legged disciple
of ceres whose bottle-nose turned up and handsomely coppered at the
extremity seemed to intimate something of an occasional treaty with
bacchus it was like to be no equal mellay betwixt persons of such
unequal form and strength and the difference betwixt twenty and fifty
years was nothing in favour of the weaker party besides the factor was
an honest good-natured fellow at bottom and being soon satisfied that
his guest had no other views than those of obtaining refuge from the
storm it would despite his sister's instigations have been his last
act to deny a boon so reasonable and necessary to a youth whose exterior
was so prepossessing he stood therefore considering how he could most
gracefully glide into the character of the hospitable landlord out of
that of the churlish defender of his domestic castle against an
unauthorized intrusion when baby who had stood appalled at the extreme
familiarity of the stranger's address and demeanour now spoke up for
herself

my troth lad said she to mordaunt ye are no blate to light on at
that rate and the best of wood too nane of your sharney peats but
good aik timber nae less maun serve ye

you come lightly by it dame said mordaunt carelessly and you
should not grudge to the fire what the sea gives you for nothing these
good ribs of oak did their last duty upon earth and ocean when they
could hold no longer together under the brave hearts that manned the
bark

and that's true too said the old woman softening this maun be
awsome weather by sea sit down and warm ye since the sticks are
a-low

ay ay said triptolemus it is a pleasure to see siccan a bonny
bleeze i havena seen the like o't since i left cauldacres

and shallna see the like o't again in a hurry said baby unless the
house take fire or there suld be a coal-heugh found out

and wherefore should not there be a coal-heugh found out said the
factor triumphantly i say wherefore should not a coal-heugh be found
out in zetland as well as in fife now that the chamberlain has a
far-sighted and discreet man upon the spot to make the necessary
perquisitions they are baith fishing-stations i trow

i tell you what it is tolemus yellowley answered his sister who had
practical reasons to fear her brother's opening upon any false scent
if you promise my lord sae mony of these bonnie-wallies we'll no be
weel hafted here before we are found out and set a-trotting again if
ane was to speak to ye about a gold mine i ken weel wha would promise
he suld have portugal pieces clinking in his pouch before the year gaed
by

and why suld i not said triptolemus maybe your head does not know
there is a land in orkney called ophir or something very like it and
wherefore might not solomon the wise king of the jews have sent
thither his ships and his servants for four hundred and fifty talents i
trow he knew best where to go or send and i hope you believe in your
bible baby

baby was silenced by an appeal to scripture however mal à propos and
only answered by an inarticulate humph of incredulity or scorn while
her brother went on addressing mordaunt yes you shall all of you see
what a change shall coin introduce even into such an unpropitious
country as yours ye have not heard of copper i warrant nor of
iron-stone in these islands neither mordaunt said he had heard there
was copper near the cliffs of konigsburgh ay and a copper scum is
found on the loch of swana too young man but the youngest of you
doubtless thinks himself a match for such as i am

baby who during all this while had been closely and accurately
reconnoitring the youth's person now interposed in a manner by her
brother totally unexpected ye had mair need mr yellowley to give
the young man some dry clothes and to see about getting something for
him to eat than to sit there bleezing away with your lang tales as if
the weather were not windy enow without your help and maybe the lad
would drink some bland or sic-like if ye had the grace to ask him

while triptolemus looked astonished at such a proposal considering the
quarter it came from mordaunt answered he should be very glad to
have dry clothes but begged to be excused from drinking until he had
eaten somewhat

triptolemus accordingly conducted him into another apartment and
accommodating him with a change of dress left him to his arrangements
while he himself returned to the kitchen much puzzled to account for
his sister's unusual fit of hospitality she must be fey he
said and in that case has not long to live and though i fall heir to
her tocher-good i am sorry for it for she has held the house-gear well
together drawn the girth over tight it may be now and then but the
saddle sits the better

when triptolemus returned to the kitchen he found his suspicions
confirmed for his sister was in the desperate act of consigning to the
pot a smoked goose which with others of the same tribe had long hung
in the large chimney muttering to herself at the same time it maun
be eaten sune or syne and what for no by the puir callant

what is this of it sister said triptolemus you have on the girdle
and the pot at ance what day is this wi you

e'en such a day as the israelites had beside the flesh-pots of egypt
billie triptolemus but ye little ken wha ye have in your house this
blessed day

troth and little do i ken said triptolemus as little as i would
ken the naig i never saw before i would take the lad for a jagger
but he has rather ower good havings and he has no pack

ye ken as little as ane of your ain bits o nowt man retorted sister
baby if ye ken na him do ye ken tronda dronsdaughter

tronda dronsdaughter echoed triptolemus how should i but ken her
when i pay her twal pennies scots by the day for working in the house
here i trow she works as if the things burned her fingers i had better
give a scots lass a groat of english siller

and that's the maist sensible word ye have said this blessed
morning weel but tronda kens this lad weel and she has often spoke
to me about him they call his father the silent man of sumburgh and
they say he's uncanny

hout hout nonsense nonsense they are aye at sic trash as that
said the brother when you want a day's wark out of them they have
stepped ower the tangs or they have met an uncanny body or they have
turned about the boat against the sun and then there's nought to be
done that day

weel weel brother ye are so wise said baby because ye knapped
latin at saint andrews and can your lair tell me then what the lad
has round his halse

a barcelona napkin as wet as a dishclout and i have just lent him one
of my own overlays said triptolemus

a barcelona napkin said baby elevating her voice and then suddenly
lowering it as from apprehension of being overheard i say a gold
chain

a gold chain said triptolemus

in troth is it hinny and how like you that the folk say here as
tronda tells me that the king of the drows gave it to his father the
silent man of sumburgh

i wish you would speak sense or be the silent woman said
triptolemus the upshot of it all is then that this lad is the rich
stranger's son and that you are giving him the goose you were to keep
till michaelmas

troth brother we maun do something for god's sake and to make
friends and the lad added baby for even she was not altogether
above the prejudices of her sex in favour of outward form the lad has
a fair face of his ain

ye would have let mony a fair face said triptolemus pass the door
pining if it had not been for the gold chain

nae doubt nae doubt replied barbara ye wadna have me waste our
substance on every thigger or sorner that has the luck to come by the
door in a wet day but this lad has a fair and a wide name in the
country and tronda says he is to be married to a daughter of the rich
udaller magnus troil and the marriage-day is to be fixed whenever he
makes choice set him up between the twa lasses and so it wad be as
much as our good name is worth and our quiet forby to let him sit
unserved although he does come unsent for

the best reason in life said triptolemus for letting a man into a
house is that you dare not bid him go by however since there is a man
of quality amongst them i will let him know whom he has to do with in
my person then advancing to the door he exclaimed heus tibi
dave

adsum answered the youth entering the apartment

hem said the erudite triptolemus not altogether deficient in his
humanities i see i will try him further canst thou aught of
husbandry young gentleman

troth sir not i answered mordaunt i have been trained to plough
upon the sea and to reap upon the crag

plough the sea said triptolemus that's a furrow requires small
harrowing and for your harvest on the crag i suppose you mean these
scowries or whatever you call them it is a sort of ingathering which
the ranzelman should stop by the law nothing more likely to break an
honest man's bones i profess i cannot see the pleasure men propose by
dangling in a rope's-end betwixt earth and heaven in my case i had as
lief the other end of the rope were fastened to the gibbet i should be
sure of not falling at least

now i would only advise you to try it replied mordaunt trust me
the world has few grander sensations than when one is perched in midair
between a high-browed cliff and a roaring ocean the rope by which you
are sustained seeming scarce stronger than a silken thread and the
stone on which you have one foot steadied affording such a breadth as
the kittywake might rest upon to feel and know all this with the full
confidence that your own agility of limb and strength of head can
bring you as safe off as if you had the wing of the gosshawk this is
indeed being almost independent of the earth you tread on

triptolemus stared at this enthusiastic description of an amusement
which had so few charms for him and his sister looking at the glancing
eye and elevated bearing of the young adventurer answered by
ejaculating my certie lad but ye are a brave chield

a brave chield returned yellowley i say a brave goose to be
flichtering and fleeing in the wind when he might abide upon terra
firma but come here's a goose that is more to the purpose when once
it is well boiled get us trenchers and salt baby but in truth it will
prove salt enough a tasty morsel it is but i think the zetlanders be
the only folk in the world that think of running such risks to catch
geese and then boiling them when they have done

to be sure replied his sister it was the only word they had agreed
in that day it would be an unco thing to bid ony gudewife in angus or
a the mearns boil a goose while there was sic things as spits in the
warld but wha's this neist she added looking towards the entrance
with great indignation my certie open doors and dogs come in and
wha opened the door to him

i did to be sure replied mordaunt you would not have a poor devil
stand beating your deaf door-cheeks in weather like this here goes
something though to help the fire he added drawing out the sliding
bar of oak with which the door had been secured and throwing it on the
hearth whence it was snatched by dame baby in great wrath she
exclaiming at the same time 

it's sea-borne timber as there's little else here and he dings it
about as if it were a fir-clog and who be you an it please you she
added turning to the stranger a very hallanshaker loon as ever
crossed my twa een

i am a jagger if it like your ladyship replied the uninvited guest
a stout vulgar little man who had indeed the humble appearance of a
pedlar called jagger in these islands never travelled in a waur
day or was more willing to get to harbourage heaven be praised for
fire and house-room

so saying he drew a stool to the fire and sat down without further
ceremony dame baby stared wild as grey gosshawk and was meditating
how to express her indignation in something warmer than words for which
the boiling pot seemed to offer a convenient hint when an old
half-starved serving-woman the tronda already mentioned the sharer of
barbara's domestic cares who had been as yet in some remote corner of
the mansion now hobbled into the room and broke out into exclamations
which indicated some new cause of alarm

o master and o mistress were the only sounds she could for some
time articulate and then followed them up with the best in the
house the best in the house set a on the board and a will be little
aneugh there is auld norna of fitful-head the most fearful woman in
all the isles

where can she have been wandering said mordaunt not without some
apparent sympathy with the surprise if not with the alarm of the old
domestic but it is needless to ask the worse the weather the more
likely is she to be a traveller

what new tramper is this echoed the distracted baby whom the quick
succession of guests had driven wellnigh crazy with vexation i'll soon
settle her wandering i sall warrant if my brother has but the saul of
a man in him or if there be a pair of jougs at scalloway

the iron was never forged on stithy that would hauld her said the old
maid-servant she comes she comes god's sake speak her fair and
canny or we will have a ravelled hasp on the yarn-windles

as she spoke a woman tall enough almost to touch the top of the door
with her cap stepped into the room signing the cross as she entered
and pronouncing with a solemn voice the blessing of god and saint
ronald on the open door and their broad malison and mine upon
close-handed churls

and wha are ye that are sae bauld wi your blessing and banning in
other folk's houses what kind of country is this that folk cannot sit
quiet for an hour and serve heaven and keep their bit gear thegither
without gangrel men and women coming thigging and sorning ane after
another like a string of wild-geese

this speech the understanding reader will easily saddle on mistress
baby and what effects it might have produced on the last stranger can
only be matter of conjecture for the old servant and mordaunt applied
themselves at once to the party addressed in order to deprecate her
resentment the former speaking to her some words of norse in a tone of
intercession and mordaunt saying in english they are strangers
norna and know not your name or qualities they are unacquainted too
with the ways of this country and therefore we must hold them excused
for their lack of hospitality

i lack no hospitality young man said triptolemus miseris
succurrere disco the goose that was destined to roost in the chimney
till michaelmas is boiling in the pot for you but if we had twenty
geese i see we are like to find mouths to eat them every feather this
must be amended

what must be amended sordid slave said the stranger norna turning
at once upon him with an emphasis that made him start what must be
amended bring hither if thou wilt thy new-fangled coulters spades
and harrows alter the implements of our fathers from the ploughshare to
the mouse-trap but know thou art in the land that was won of old by the
flaxen-haired kempions of the north and leave us their hospitality at
least to show we come of what was once noble and generous i say to you
beware while norna looks forth at the measureless waters from the
crest of fitful-head something is yet left that resembles power of
defence if the men of thule have ceased to be champions and to spread
the banquet for the raven the women have not forgotten the arts that
lifted them of yore into queens and prophetesses

the woman who pronounced this singular tirade was as striking in
appearance as extravagantly lofty in her pretensions and in her
language she might well have represented on the stage so far as
features voice and stature were concerned the bonduca or boadicea of
the britons or the sage velleda aurinia or any other fated pythoness
who ever led to battle a tribe of the ancient goths her features were
high and well formed and would have been handsome but for the ravages
of time and the effects of exposure to the severe weather of her
country age and perhaps sorrow had quenched in some degree the fire
of a dark-blue eye whose hue almost approached to black and had
sprinkled snow on such parts of her tresses as had escaped from under
her cap and were dishevelled by the rigour of the storm her upper
garment which dropped with water was of a coarse dark-coloured stuff
called wadmaal then much used in the zetland islands as also in
iceland and norway but as she threw this cloak back from her
shoulders a short jacket of dark-blue velvet stamped with figures
became visible and the vest which corresponded to it was of crimson
colour and embroidered with tarnished silver her girdle was plated
with silver ornaments cut into the shape of planetary signs her blue
apron was embroidered with similar devices and covered a petticoat of
crimson cloth strong thick enduring shoes of the half-dressed leather
of the country were tied with straps like those of the roman buskins
over her scarlet stockings she wore in her belt an ambiguous-looking
weapon which might pass for a sacrificing knife or dagger as the
imagination of the spectator chose to assign to the wearer the character
of a priestess or of a sorceress in her hand she held a staff squared
on all sides and engraved with runic characters and figures forming
one of those portable and perpetual calendars which were used among the
ancient natives of scandinavia and which to a superstitious eye might
have passed for a divining rod

such were the appearance features and attire of norna of the
fitful-head upon whom many of the inhabitants of the island looked with
observance many with fear and almost all with a sort of veneration
less pregnant circumstances of suspicion would in any other part of
scotland have exposed her to the investigation of those cruel
inquisitors who were then often invested with the delegated authority
of the privy council for the purpose of persecuting torturing and
finally consigning to the flames those who were accused of witchcraft
or sorcery but superstitions of this nature pass through two stages ere
they become entirely obsolete those supposed to be possessed of
supernatural powers are venerated in the earlier stages of society as
religion and knowledge increase they are first held in hatred and
horror and are finally regarded as impostors scotland was in the
second state the fear of witchcraft was great and the hatred against
those suspected of it intense zetland was as yet a little world by
itself where among the lower and ruder classes so much of the ancient
northern superstition remained as cherished the original veneration for
those affecting supernatural knowledge and power over the elements
which made a constituent part of the ancient scandinavian creed at
least if the natives of thule admitted that one class of magicians
performed their feats by their alliance with satan they devoutly
believed that others dealt with spirits of a different and less odious
class the ancient dwarfs called in zetland trows or drows the
modern fairies and so forth

among those who were supposed to be in league with disembodied spirits
this norna descended from and representative of a family which had
long pretended to such gifts was so eminent that the name assigned to
her which signifies one of those fatal sisters who weave the web of
human fate had been conferred in honour of her supernatural powers the
name by which she had been actually christened was carefully concealed
by herself and her parents for to its discovery they superstitiously
annexed some fatal consequences in those times the doubt only
occurred whether her supposed powers were acquired by lawful means in
our days it would have been questioned whether she was an impostor or
whether her imagination was so deeply impressed with the mysteries of
her supposed art that she might be in some degree a believer in her
own pretensions to supernatural knowledge certain it is that she
performed her part with such undoubting confidence and such striking
dignity of look and action and evinced at the same time such strength
of language and energy of purpose that it would have been difficult
for the greatest sceptic to have doubted the reality of her enthusiasm
though he might smile at the pretensions to which it gave rise

chapter vi

   if by your art you have
 put the wild waters in this roar allay them

 tempest


the storm had somewhat relaxed its rigour just before the entrance of
norna otherwise she must have found it impossible to travel during the
extremity of its fury but she had hardly added herself so unexpectedly
to the party whom chance had assembled at the dwelling of triptolemus
yellowley when the tempest suddenly resumed its former vehemence and
raged around the building with a fury which made the inmates insensible
to any thing except the risk that the old mansion was about to fall
above their heads

mistress baby gave vent to her fears in loud exclamations of the lord
guide us this is surely the last day what kind of a country of
guisards and gyre-carlines is this and you ye fool carle she added
turning on her brother for all her passions had a touch of acidity in
them to quit the bonny mearns land to come here where there is
naething but sturdy beggars and gaberlunzies within ane's house and
heaven's anger on the outside on't

i tell you sister baby answered the insulted agriculturist that
all shall be reformed and amended excepting he added betwixt his
teeth the scaulding humours of an ill-natured jaud that can add
bitterness to the very storm

the old domestic and the pedlar meanwhile exhausted themselves in
entreaties to norna of which as they were couched in the norse
language the master of the house understood nothing

she listened to them with a haughty and unmoved air and replied at
length aloud and in english i will not what if this house be strewed
in ruins before morning where would be the world's want in the crazed
projector and the niggardly pinch-commons by which it is inhabited
they will needs come to reform zetland customs let them try how they
like a zetland storm you that would not perish quit this house

the pedlar seized on his little knapsack and began hastily to brace it
on his back the old maid-servant cast her cloak about her shoulders
and both seemed to be in the act of leaving the house as fast as they
could

triptolemus yellowley somewhat commoved by these appearances asked
mordaunt with a voice which faltered with apprehension whether he
thought there was any that is so very much danger

i cannot tell answered the youth i have scarce ever seen such a
storm norna can tell us better than any one when it will abate for no
one in these islands can judge of the weather like her

and is that all thou thinkest norna can do said the sibyl thou
shalt know her powers are not bounded within such a narrow space hear
me mordaunt youth of a foreign land but of a friendly heart dost
thou quit this doomed mansion with those who now prepare to leave it

i do not i will not norna replied mordaunt i know not your motive
for desiring me to remove and i will not leave upon these dark
threats the house in which i have been kindly received in such a
tempest as this if the owners are unaccustomed to our practice of
unlimited hospitality i am the more obliged to them that they have
relaxed their usages and opened their doors in my behalf

he is a brave lad said mistress baby whose superstitious feelings
had been daunted by the threats of the supposed sorceress and who
amidst her eager narrow and repining disposition had like all who
possess marked character some sparks of higher feeling which made her
sympathize with generous sentiments though she thought it too expensive
to entertain them at her own cost he is a brave lad she again
repeated and worthy of ten geese if i had them to boil for him or
roast either i'll warrant him a gentleman's son and no churl's blood

hear me young mordaunt said norna and depart from this house fate
has high views on you you shall not remain in this hovel to be crushed
amid its worthless ruins with the relics of its more worthless
inhabitants whose life is as little to the world as the vegetation of
the house-leek which now grows on their thatch and which shall soon be
crushed amongst their mangled limbs

i i i will go forth said yellowley who despite of his bearing
himself scholarly and wisely was beginning to be terrified for the
issue of the adventure for the house was old and the walls rocked
formidably to the blast

to what purpose said his sister i trust the prince of the power of
the air has not yet such-like power over those that are made in god's
image that a good house should fall about our heads because a randy
quean here she darted a fierce glance at the pythoness should boast
us with her glamour as if we were sae mony dogs to crouch at her
bidding

i was only wanting said triptolemus ashamed of his motion to look
at the bear-braird which must be sair laid wi this tempest but if
this honest woman like to bide wi us i think it were best to let us a
sit doun canny thegither till it's working weather again

honest woman echoed baby foul warlock thief aroint ye ye
limmer she added addressing norna directly out of an honest house
or shame fa me but i'll take the bittle to you

norna cast on her a look of supreme contempt then stepping to the
window seemed engaged in deep contemplation of the heavens while the
old maid-servant tronda drawing close to her mistress implored for
the sake of all that was dear to man or woman do not provoke norna of
fitful-head you have no sic woman on the mainland of scotland she can
ride on one of these clouds as easily as man ever rode on a sheltie

i shall live to see her ride on the reek of a fat tar-barrel said
mistress baby and that will be a fit pacing palfrey for her

again norna regarded the enraged mrs baby yellowley with a look of that
unutterable scorn which her haughty features could so well express and
moving to the window which looked to the north-west from which quarter
the gale seemed at present to blow she stood for some time with her
arms crossed looking out upon the leaden-coloured sky obscured as it
was by the thick drift which coming on in successive gusts of tempest
left ever and anon sad and dreary intervals of expectation betwixt the
dying and the reviving blast

norna regarded this war of the elements as one to whom their strife was
familiar yet the stern serenity of her features had in it a cast of
awe and at the same time of authority as the cabalist may be supposed
to look upon the spirit he has evoked and which though he knows how to
subject him to his spell bears still an aspect appalling to flesh and
blood the attendants stood by in different attitudes expressive of
their various feelings mordaunt though not indifferent to the risk in
which they stood was more curious than alarmed he had heard of norna's
alleged power over the elements and now expected an opportunity of
judging for himself of its reality triptolemus yellowley was confounded
at what seemed to be far beyond the bounds of his philosophy and if
the truth must be spoken the worthy agriculturist was greatly more
frightened than inquisitive his sister was not in the least curious on
the subject but it was difficult to say whether anger or fear
predominated in her sharp eyes and thin compressed lips the pedlar and
old tronda confident that the house would never fall while the
redoubted norna was beneath its roof held themselves ready for a start
the instant she should take her departure

having looked on the sky for some time in a fixed attitude and with the
most profound silence norna at once yet with a slow and elevated
gesture extended her staff of black oak towards that part of the
heavens from which the blast came hardest and in the midst of its fury
chanted a norwegian invocation still preserved in the island of uist
under the name of the song of the reimkennar though some call it the
song of the tempest the following is a free translation it being
impossible to render literally many of the elliptical and metaphorical
terms of expression peculiar to the ancient northern poetry 




 stern eagle of the far north-west
 thou that bearest in thy grasp the thunderbolt
 thou whose rushing pinions stir ocean to madness
 thou the destroyer of herds thou the scatterer of navies
 thou the breaker down of towers
 amidst the scream of thy rage
 amidst the rushing of thy onward wings
 though thy scream be loud as the cry of a perishing nation
 though the rushing of thy wings be like the roar of ten thousand waves
 yet hear in thine ire and thy haste
 hear thou the voice of the reim-kennar




 thou hast met the pine-trees of drontheim
 their dark-green heads lie prostrate beside their uprooted stems
 thou hast met the rider of the ocean
 the tall the strong bark of the fearless rover
 and she has struck to thee the topsail
 that she had not veiled to a royal armada
 thou hast met the tower that hears its crest among the clouds
 the battled massive tower of the jarl of former days
 and the cope-stone of the turret
 is lying upon its hospitable hearth
 but thou too shalt stoop proud compeller of clouds
 when thou hearest the voice of the reim-kennar




 there are verses that can stop the stag in the forest
 ay and when the dark-coloured dog is opening on his track
 there are verses can make the wild hawk pause on the wing
 like the falcon that wears the hood and the jesses
 and who knows the shrill whistle of the fowler
 thou who canst mock at the scream of the drowning mariner
 and the crash of the ravaged forest
 and the groan of the overwhelmed crowds
 when the church hath fallen in the moment of prayer
 there are sounds which thou also must list
 when they are chanted by the voice of the reim-kennar




 enough of woe hast thou wrought on the ocean
 the widows wring their hands on the beach
 enough of woe hast thou wrought on the land
 the husbandman folds his arms in despair
 cease thou the waving of thy pinions
 let the ocean repose in her dark strength
 cease thou the flashing of thine eye
 let the thunderbolt sleep in the armoury of odin
 be thou still at my bidding viewless racer of the north-western heaven
 sleep thou at the voice of norna the reim-kennar

we have said that mordaunt was naturally fond of romantic poetry and
romantic situation it is not therefore surprising that he listened with
interest to the wild address thus uttered to the wildest wind of the
compass in a tone of such dauntless enthusiasm but though he had heard
so much of the runic rhyme and of the northern spell in the country
where he had so long dwelt he was not on this occasion so credulous as
to believe that the tempest which had raged so lately and which was
now beginning to decline was subdued before the charmed verse of norna
certain it was that the blast seemed passing away and the apprehended
danger was already over but it was not improbable that this issue had
been for some time foreseen by the pythoness through signs of the
weather imperceptible to those who had not dwelt long in the country or
had not bestowed on the meteorological phenomena the attention of a
strict and close observer of norna's experience he had no doubt and
that went a far way to explain what seemed supernatural in her
demeanour yet still the noble countenance half-shaded by dishevelled
tresses the air of majesty with which in a tone of menace as well as
of command she addressed the viewless spirit of the tempest gave him a
strong inclination to believe in the ascendency of the occult arts over
the powers of nature for if a woman ever moved on earth to whom such
authority over the ordinary laws of the universe could belong norna of
fitful-head judging from bearing figure and face was born to that
high destiny

the rest of the company were less slow in receiving conviction to
tronda and the jagger none was necessary they had long believed in the
full extent of norna's authority over the elements but triptolemus and
his sister gazed at each other with wondering and alarmed looks
especially when the wind began perceptibly to decline as was remarkably
visible during the pauses which norna made betwixt the strophes of her
incantation a long silence followed the last verse until norna
resumed her chant but with a changed and more soothing modulation of
voice and tune

 eagle of the far north-western waters
 thou hast heard the voice of the reim-kennar
 thou hast closed thy wide sails at her bidding
 and folded them in peace by thy side
 my blessing be on thy retiring path
 when thou stoopest from thy place on high
 soft be thy slumbers in the caverns of the unknown ocean
 rest till destiny shall again awaken thee
 eagle of the north-west thou hast heard the voice of the reim-kennar

a pretty sang that would be to keep the corn from shaking in har'st
whispered the agriculturist to his sister we must speak her fair
baby she will maybe part with the secret for a hundred pund scots

an hundred fules heads replied baby bid her five merks of ready
siller i never knew a witch in my life but she was as poor as job

norna turned towards them as if she had guessed their thoughts it may
be that she did so she passed them with a look of the most sovereign
contempt and walking to the table on which the preparations for mrs
barbara's frugal meal were already disposed she filled a small wooden
quaigh from an earthen pitcher which contained bland a subacid liquor
made out of the serous part of the milk she broke a single morsel from
a barley-cake and having eaten and drunk returned towards the churlish
hosts i give you no thanks she said for my refreshment for you
bid me not welcome to it and thanks bestowed on a churl are like the
dew of heaven on the cliffs of foulah where it finds nought that can
be refreshed by its influences i give you no thanks she said again
but drawing from her pocket a leathern purse that seemed large and
heavy she added i pay you with what you will value more than the
gratitude of the whole inhabitants of hialtland say not that norna of
fitful-head hath eaten of your bread and drunk of your cup and left you
sorrowing for the charge to which she hath put your house so saying
she laid on the table a small piece of antique gold coin bearing the
rude and half-defaced effigies of some ancient northern king

triptolemus and his sister exclaimed against this liberality with
vehemence the first protesting that he kept no public and the other
exclaiming is the carline mad heard ye ever of ony of the gentle
house of clinkscale that gave meat for siller

or for love either muttered her brother haud to that tittie

what are ye whittie-whattieing about ye gowk said his gentle sister
who suspected the tenor of his murmurs gie the ladie back her
bonnie-die there and be blithe to be sae rid on't it will be a
sclate-stane the morn if not something worse

the honest factor lifted the money to return it yet could not help
being struck when he saw the impression and his hand trembled as he
handed it to his sister

yes said the pythoness again as if she read the thoughts of the
astonished pair you have seen that coin before beware how you use it
it thrives not with the sordid or the mean-souled it was won with
honourable danger and must be expended with honourable liberality the
treasure which lies under a cold hearth will one day like the hidden
talent bear witness against its avaricious possessors

this last obscure intimation seemed to raise the alarm and the wonder of
mrs baby and her brother to the uttermost the latter tried to stammer
out something like an invitation to norna to tarry with them all night
or at least to take share of the dinner so he at first called it but
looking at the company and remembering the limited contents of the pot
he corrected the phrase and hoped she would take some part of the
snack which would be on the table ere a man could loose a pleugh

i eat not here i sleep not here replied norna nay i relieve you
not only of my own presence but i will dismiss your unwelcome
guests mordaunt she added addressing young mertoun the dark fit
is past and your father looks for you this evening

do you return in that direction said mordaunt i will but eat a
morsel and give you my aid good mother on the road the brooks must
be out and the journey perilous

our roads lie different answered the sibyl and norna needs not
mortal arm to aid her on the way i am summoned far to the east by
those who know well how to smooth my passage for thee bryce
snailsfoot she continued speaking to the pedlar speed thee on to
sumburgh the roost will afford thee a gallant harvest and worthy the
gathering in much goodly ware will ere now be seeking a new owner and
the careful skipper will sleep still enough in the deep haaf and care
not that bale and chest are dashing against the shores

na na good mother answered snailsfoot i desire no man's life for
my private advantage and am just grateful for the blessing of
providence on my sma trade but doubtless one man's loss is another's
gain and as these storms destroy a thing on land it is but fair they
suld send us something by sea sae taking the freedom like yoursell
mother to borrow a lump of barley-bread and a draught of bland i will
bid good-day and thank you to this good gentleman and lady and e'en
go on my way to jarlshof as you advise

ay replied the pythoness where the slaughter is the eagles will be
gathered and where the wreck is on the shore the jagger is as busy to
purchase spoil as the shark to gorge upon the dead

this rebuke if it was intended for such seemed above the comprehension
of the travelling merchant who bent upon gain assumed the knapsack
and ellwand and asked mordaunt with the familiarity permitted in a
wild country whether he would not take company along with him

i wait to eat some dinner with mr yellowley and mrs baby answered
the youth and will set forward in half an hour

then i'll just take my piece in my hand said the pedlar accordingly
he muttered a benediction and without more ceremony helped himself to
what in mrs baby's covetous eyes appeared to be two-thirds of the
bread took a long pull at the jug of bland seized on a handful of the
small fish called sillocks which the domestic was just placing on the
board and left the room without farther ceremony

my certie said the despoiled mrs baby there is the chapman's
drouth and his hunger baith as folk say if the laws against
vagrants be executed this gate it's no that i wad shut the door against
decent folk she said looking to mordaunt more especially in such
judgment-weather but i see the goose is dished poor thing

this she spoke in a tone of affection for the smoked goose which
though it had long been an inanimate inhabitant of her chimney was far
more interesting to mrs baby in that state than when it screamed
amongst the clouds mordaunt laughed and took his seat then turned to
look for norna but she had glided from the apartment during the
discussion with the pedlar

i am glad she is gane the dour carline said mrs baby though she
has left that piece of gowd to be an everlasting shame to us

whisht mistress for the love of heaven said tronda dronsdaughter
wha kens where she may be this moment we are no sure but she may hear
us though we cannot see her

mistress baby cast a startled eye around and instantly recovering
herself for she was naturally courageous as well as violent said i
bade her aroint before and i bid her aroint again whether she sees me
or hears me or whether she's ower the cairn and awa and you ye silly
sumph she said to poor yellowley what do ye stand glowering there
for you a saunt andrew's student you studied lair and latin
humanities as ye ca them and daunted wi the clavers of an auld
randie wife say your best college grace man and witch or nae witch
we'll eat our dinner and defy her and for the value of the gowden
piece it shall never be said i pouched her siller i will gie it to
some poor body that is i will test upon it at my death and keep
it for a purse-penny till that day comes and that's no using it in the
way of spending siller say your best college grace man and let us eat
and drink in the meantime

ye had muckle better say an oraamus to saint ronald and fling a
saxpence ower your left shouther master said tronda

that ye may pick it up ye jaud said the implacable mistress baby
it will be lang or ye win the worth of it ony other gate sit down
triptolemus and mindna the words of a daft wife

daft or wise replied yellowley very much disconcerted she kens
more than i would wish she kend it was awfu to see sic a wind fa at
the voice of flesh and blood like oursells and then yon about the
hearth-stane i cannot but think  

if ye cannot but think said mrs baby very sharply at least ye can
haud your tongue

the agriculturist made no reply but sate down to their scanty meal and
did the honours of it with unusual heartiness to his new guest the
first of the intruders who had arrived and the last who left them the
sillocks speedily disappeared and the smoked goose with its
appendages took wing so effectually that tronda to whom the polishing
of the bones had been destined found the task accomplished or nearly
so to her hand after dinner the host produced his bottle of brandy
but mordaunt whose general habits were as abstinent almost as those of
his father laid a very light tax upon this unusual exertion of
hospitality

during the meal they learned so much of young mordaunt and of his
father that even baby resisted his wish to reassume his wet garments
and pressed him at the risk of an expensive supper being added to the
charges of the day to tarry with them till the next morning but what
norna had said excited the youth's wish to reach home nor however far
the hospitality of stourburgh was extended in his behalf did the house
present any particular temptations to induce him to remain there longer
he therefore accepted the loan of the factor's clothes promising to
return them and send for his own and took a civil leave of his host
and mistress baby the latter of whom however affected by the loss of
her goose could not but think the cost well bestowed since it was to
be expended at all upon so handsome and cheerful a youth

chapter vii

 she does no work by halves yon raving ocean
 engulfing those she strangles her wild womb

 their death at once and sepulchre

 old play


there were ten lang scots miles betwixt stourburgh and jarlshof and
though the pedestrian did not number all the impediments which crossed
tam o shanter's path for in a country where there are neither hedges
nor stone enclosures there can be neither slaps nor stiles yet the
number and nature of the mosses and waters which he had to cross in
his peregrination was fully sufficient to balance the account and to
render his journey as toilsome and dangerous as tam o shanter's
celebrated retreat from ayr neither witch nor warlock crossed
mordaunt's path however the length of the day was already
considerable and he arrived safe at jarlshof by eleven o'clock at
night all was still and dark round the mansion and it was not till he
had whistled twice or thrice beneath swertha's window that she replied
to the signal

at the first sound swertha fell into an agreeable dream of a young
whale-fisher who some forty years before used to make such a signal
beneath the window of her hut at the second she waked to remember that
johnnie fea had slept sound among the frozen waves of greenland for this
many a year and that she was mr mertoun's governante at jarlshof at
the third she arose and opened the window

whae is that she demanded at sic an hour of the night

it is i said the youth

and what for comena ye in the door's on the latch and there is a
gathering peat on the kitchen fire and a spunk beside it ye can light
your ain candle

all well replied mordaunt but i want to know how my father is

just in his ordinary gude gentleman asking for you maister mordaunt
ye are ower far and ower late in your walks young gentleman

then the dark hour has passed swertha

in troth has it maister mordaunt answered the governante and your
father is very reasonably good-natured for him poor gentleman i spake
to him twice yesterday without his speaking first and the first time he
answered me as civil as you could do and the neist time he bade me no
plague him and then thought i three times were aye canny so i spake
to him again for luck's-sake and he called me a chattering old devil
but it was quite and clean in a civil sort of way

enough enough swertha answered mordaunt and now get up and find
me something to eat for i have dined but poorly

then you have been at the new folk's at stourburgh for there is no
another house in a the isles but they wad hae gi'en ye the best share
of the best they had saw ye aught of norna of the fitful-head she went
to stourburgh this morning and returned to the town at night

returned then she is here how could she travel three leagues and
better in so short a time

wha kens how she travels replied swertha but i heard her tell the
ranzelman wi my ain lugs that she intended that day to have gone on to
burgh-westra to speak with minna troil but she had seen that at
stourburgh indeed she said at harfra for she never calls it by the
other name of stourburgh that sent her back to our town but gang your
ways round and ye shall have plenty of supper ours is nae toom pantry
and still less a locked ane though my master be a stranger and no just
that tight in the upper rigging as the ranzelman says

mordaunt walked round to the kitchen accordingly where swertha's care
speedily accommodated him with a plentiful though coarse meal which
indemnified him for the scanty hospitality he had experienced at
stourburgh

in the morning some feelings of fatigue made young mertoun later than
usual in leaving his bed so that contrary to what was the ordinary
case he found his father in the apartment where they eat and which
served them indeed for every common purpose save that of a bedchamber
or of a kitchen the son greeted the father in mute reverence and
waited until he should address him

you were absent yesterday mordaunt said his father mordaunt's
absence had lasted a week and more but he had often observed that his
father never seemed to notice how time passed during the period when he
was affected with his sullen vapours he assented to what the elder mr
mertoun had said

and you were at burgh-westra as i think continued his father

yes sir replied mordaunt

the elder mertoun was then silent for some time and paced the floor in
deep silence with an air of sombre reflection which seemed as if he
were about to relapse into his moody fit suddenly turning to his son
however he observed in the tone of a query magnus troil has two
daughters they must be now young women they are thought handsome of
course

very generally sir answered mordaunt rather surprised to hear his
father making any enquiries about the individuals of a sex which he
usually thought so light of a surprise which was much increased by the
next question put as abruptly as the former

which think you the handsomest

i sir replied his son with some wonder but without
embarrassment i really am no judge i never considered which was
absolutely the handsomest they are both very pretty young women

you evade my question mordaunt perhaps i have some very particular
reason for my wish to be acquainted with your taste in this matter i am
not used to waste words for no purpose i ask you again which of magnus
troil's daughters you think most handsome

really sir replied mordaunt but you only jest in asking me such a
question

young man replied mertoun with eyes which began to roll and sparkle
with impatience i never jest i desire an answer to my question

then upon my word sir said mordaunt it is not in my power to form
a judgment betwixt the young ladies they are both very pretty but by
no means like each other minna is dark-haired and more grave than her
sister more serious but by no means either dull or sullen

um replied his father you have been gravely brought up and this
minna i suppose pleases you most

no sir really i can give her no preference over her sister brenda
who is as gay as a lamb in a spring morning less tall than her sister
but so well formed and so excellent a dancer  

that she is best qualified to amuse the young man who has a dull home
and a moody father said mr mertoun

nothing in his father's conduct had ever surprised mordaunt so much as
the obstinacy with which he seemed to pursue a theme so foreign to his
general train of thought and habits of conversation but he contented
himself with answering once more that both the young ladies were
highly admirable but he had never thought of them with the wish to do
either injustice by ranking her lower than her sister that others
would probably decide between them as they happened to be partial to a
grave or a gay disposition or to a dark or fair complexion but that he
could see no excellent quality in the one that was not balanced by
something equally captivating in the other

it is possible that even the coolness with which mordaunt made this
explanation might not have satisfied his father concerning the subject
of investigation but swertha at this moment entered with breakfast and
the youth notwithstanding his late supper engaged in that meal with an
air which satisfied mertoun that he held it matter of more grave
importance than the conversation which they had just had and that he
had nothing more to say upon the subject explanatory of the answers he
had already given he shaded his brow with his hand and looked long
fixedly upon the young man as he was busied with his morning meal there
was neither abstraction nor a sense of being observed in any of his
motions all was frank natural and open

he is fancy-free muttered mertoun to himself so young so lively
and so imaginative so handsome and so attractive in face and person
strange that at his age and in his circumstances he should have
avoided the meshes which catch all the world beside

when the breakfast was over the elder mertoun instead of proposing as
usual that his son who awaited his commands should betake himself to
one branch or other of his studies assumed his hat and staff and
desired that mordaunt should accompany him to the top of the cliff
called sumburgh-head and from thence look out upon the state of the
ocean agitated as it must still be by the tempest of the preceding day
mordaunt was at the age when young men willingly exchange sedentary
pursuits for active exercise and started up with alacrity to comply
with his father's desire and in the course of a few minutes they were
mounting together the hill which ascending from the land side in a
long steep and grassy slope sinks at once from the summit to the sea
in an abrupt and tremendous precipice

the day was delightful there was just so much motion in the air as to
disturb the little fleecy clouds which were scattered on the horizon
and by floating them occasionally over the sun to chequer the landscape
with that variety of light and shade which often gives to a bare and
unenclosed scene for the time at least a species of charm approaching
to the varieties of a cultivated and planted country a thousand
flitting hues of light and shade played over the expanse of wild moor
rocks and inlets which as they climbed higher and higher spread in
wide and wider circuit around them

the elder mertoun often paused and looked round upon the scene and for
some time his son supposed that he halted to enjoy its beauties but as
they ascended still higher up the hill he remarked his shortened breath
and his uncertain and toilsome step and became assured with some
feelings of alarm that his father's strength was for the moment
exhausted and that he found the ascent more toilsome and fatiguing than
usual to draw close to his side and offer him in silence the
assistance of his arm was an act of youthful deference to advanced age
as well as of filial reverence and mertoun seemed at first so to
receive it for he took in silence the advantage of the aid thus
afforded him

it was but for two or three minutes however that the father availed
himself of his son's support they had not ascended fifty yards farther
ere he pushed mordaunt suddenly if not rudely from him and as if
stung into exertion by some sudden recollection began to mount the
acclivity with such long and quick steps that mordaunt in his turn
was obliged to exert himself to keep pace with him he knew his father's
peculiarity of disposition he was aware from many slight circumstances
that he loved him not even while he took much pains with his education
and while he seemed to be the sole object of his care upon earth but
the conviction had never been more strongly or more powerfully forced
upon him than by the hasty churlishness with which mertoun rejected from
a son that assistance which most elderly men are willing to receive
from youths with whom they are but slightly connected as a tribute
which it is alike graceful to yield and pleasing to receive mertoun
however did not seem to perceive the effect which his unkindness had
produced upon his son's feelings he paused upon a sort of level terrace
which they had now attained and addressed his son with an indifferent
tone which seemed in some degree affected

since you have so few inducements mordaunt to remain in these wild
islands i suppose you sometimes wish to look a little more abroad into
the world

by my word sir replied mordaunt i cannot say i ever have a thought
on such a subject

and why not young man demanded his father it were but natural i
think at your age at your age the fair and varied breadth of britain
could not gratify me much less the compass of a sea-girdled peat-moss

i have never thought of leaving zetland sir replied the son i am
happy here and have friends you yourself sir would miss me unless
indeed  

why thou wouldst not persuade me said his father somewhat hastily
that you stay here or desire to stay here for the love of me

why should i not sir answered mordaunt mildly it is my duty and
i hope i have hitherto performed it

o ay repeated mertoun in the same tone your duty your duty so it
is the duty of the dog to follow the groom that feeds him

and does he not do so sir said mordaunt

ay said his father turning his head aside but he fawns only on
those who caress him

i hope sir replied mordaunt i have not been found deficient

say no more on't say no more on't said mertoun abruptly we have
both done enough by each other we must soon part let that be our
comfort if our separation should require comfort

i shall be ready to obey your wishes said mordaunt not altogether
displeased at what promised him an opportunity of looking farther abroad
into the world i presume it will be your pleasure that i commence my
travels with a season at the whale-fishing

whale-fishing replied mertoun that were a mode indeed of seeing the
world but thou speakest but as thou hast learned enough of this for
the present tell me where you had shelter from the storm yesterday

at stourburgh the house of the new factor from scotland

a pedantic fantastic visionary schemer said mertoun and whom saw
you there

his sister sir replied mordaunt and old norna of the fitful-head

what the mistress of the potent spell answered mertoun with a
sneer she who can change the wind by pulling her curch on one side as
king erick used to do by turning his cap the dame journeys far from
home how fares she does she get rich by selling favourable winds to
those who are port-bound

i really do not know sir said mordaunt whom certain recollections
prevented from freely entering into his father's humour

you think the matter too serious to be jested with or perhaps esteem
her merchandise too light to be cared after continued mertoun in the
same sarcastic tone which was the nearest approach he ever made to
cheerfulness but consider it more deeply every thing in the universe
is bought and sold and why not wind if the merchant can find
purchasers the earth is rented from its surface down to its most
central mines the fire and the means of feeding it are currently
bought and sold the wretches that sweep the boisterous ocean with
their nets pay ransom for the privilege of being drowned in it what
title has the air to be exempted from the universal course of traffic
all above the earth under the earth and around the earth has its
price its sellers and its purchasers in many countries the priests
will sell you a portion of heaven in all countries men are willing to
buy in exchange for health wealth and peace of conscience a full
allowance of hell why should not norna pursue her traffic

nay i know no reason against it replied mordaunt only i wish she
would part with the commodity in smaller quantities yesterday she was a
wholesale dealer whoever treated with her had too good a pennyworth

it is even so said his father pausing on the verge of the wild
promontory which they had attained where the huge precipice sinks
abruptly down on the wide and tempestuous ocean and the effects are
still visible

the face of that lofty cape is composed of the soft and crumbling stone
called sand-flag which gradually becomes decomposed and yields to the
action of the atmosphere and is split into large masses that hang
loose upon the verge of the precipice and detached from it by the
violence of the tempests often descend with great fury into the vexed
abyss which lashes the foot of the rock numbers of these huge fragments
lie strewed beneath the rocks from which they have fallen and amongst
these the tide foams and rages with a fury peculiar to those latitudes

at the period when mertoun and his son looked from the verge of the
precipice the wide sea still heaved and swelled with the agitation of
yesterday's storm which had been far too violent in its effects on the
ocean to subside speedily the tide therefore poured on the headland
with a fury deafening to the ear and dizzying to the eye threatening
instant destruction to whatever might be at the time involved in its
current the sight of nature in her magnificence or in her beauty or
in her terrors has at all times an overpowering interest which even
habit cannot greatly weaken and both father and son sat themselves down
on the cliff to look out upon that unbounded war of waters which rolled
in their wrath to the foot of the precipice

at once mordaunt whose eyes were sharper and probably his attention
more alert than that of his father started up and exclaimed god in
heaven there is a vessel in the roost

mertoun looked to the north-westward and an object was visible amid the
rolling tide she shows no sail he observed and immediately added
after looking at the object through his spy-glass she is dismasted
and lies a sheer hulk upon the water

and is drifting on the sumburgh-head exclaimed mordaunt struck with
horror without the slightest means of weathering the cape

she makes no effort answered his father she is probably deserted by
her crew

and in such a day as yesterday replied mordaunt when no open boat
could live were she manned with the best men ever handled an oar all
must have perished

it is most probable said his father with stern composure and one
day sooner or later all must have perished what signifies whether the
fowler whom nothing escapes caught them up at one swoop from yonder
shattered deck or whether he clutched them individually as chance gave
them to his grasp what signifies it the deck the battlefield are
scarce more fatal to us than our table and our bed and we are saved
from the one merely to drag out a heartless and wearisome existence
till we perish at the other would the hour were come that hour which
reason would teach us to wish for were it not that nature has implanted
the fear of it so strongly within us you wonder at such a reflection
because life is yet new to you ere you have attained my age it will be
the familiar companion of your thoughts

surely sir replied mordaunt such distaste to life is not the
necessary consequence of advanced age

to all who have sense to estimate that which it is really worth said
mertoun those who like magnus troil possess so much of the animal
impulses about them as to derive pleasure from sensual gratification
may perhaps like the animals feel pleasure in mere existence

mordaunt liked neither the doctrine nor the example he thought a man
who discharged his duties towards others as well as the good old
udaller had a better right to have the sun shine fair on his setting
than that which he might derive from mere insensibility but he let the
subject drop for to dispute with his father had always the effect of
irritating him and again he adverted to the condition of the wreck

the hulk for it was little better was now in the very midst of the
current and drifting at a great rate towards the foot of the precipice
upon whose verge they were placed yet it was a long while ere they had
a distinct view of the object which they had at first seen as a black
speck amongst the waters and then at a nearer distance like a whale
which now scarce shows its back-fin above the waves now throws to view
its large black side now however they could more distinctly observe
the appearance of the ship for the huge swelling waves which bore her
forward to the shore heaved her alternately high upon the surface and
then plunged her into the trough or furrow of the sea she seemed a
vessel of two or three hundred tons fitted up for defence for they
could see her port-holes she had been dismasted probably in the gale of
the preceding day and lay water-logged on the waves a prey to their
violence it appeared certain that the crew finding themselves unable
either to direct the vessel's course or to relieve her by pumping had
taken to their boats and left her to her fate all apprehensions were
therefore unnecessary so far as the immediate loss of human lives was
concerned and yet it was not without a feeling of breathless awe that
mordaunt and his father beheld the vessel that rare masterpiece by
which human genius aspires to surmount the waves and contend with the
winds upon the point of falling a prey to them

onward she came the large black hulk seeming larger at every fathom's
length she came nearer until she bestrode the summit of one tremendous
billow which rolled on with her unbroken till the wave and its burden
were precipitated against the rock and then the triumph of the elements
over the work of human hands was at once completed one wave we have
said made the wrecked vessel completely manifest in her whole bulk as
it raised her and bore her onward against the face of the precipice
but when that wave receded from the foot of the rock the ship had
ceased to exist and the retiring billow only bore back a quantity of
beams planks casks and similar objects which swept out to the
offing to be brought in again by the next wave and again precipitated
upon the face of the rock

it was at this moment that mordaunt conceived he saw a man floating on a
plank or water-cask which drifting away from the main current seemed
about to go ashore upon a small spot of sand where the water was
shallow and the waves broke more smoothly to see the danger and to
exclaim he lives and may yet be saved was the first impulse of the
fearless mordaunt the next was after one rapid glance at the front of
the cliff to precipitate himself such seemed the rapidity of his
movement from the verge and to commence by means of slight fissures
projections and crevices in the rock a descent which to a spectator
appeared little else than an act of absolute insanity

stop i command you rash boy said his father the attempt is death
stop and take the safer path to the left but mordaunt was already
completely engaged in his perilous enterprise

why should i prevent him said his father checking his anxiety with
the stern and unfeeling philosophy whose principles he had adopted
should he die now full of generous and high feeling eager in the
cause of humanity happy in the exertion of his own conscious activity
and youthful strength should he die now will he not escape
misanthropy and remorse and age and the consciousness of decaying
powers both of body and mind i will not look upon it however i will
not i cannot behold his young light so suddenly quenched

he turned from the precipice accordingly and hastening to the left for
more than a quarter of a mile he proceeded towards a riva or cleft
in the rock containing a path called erick's steps neither safe
indeed nor easy but the only one by which the inhabitants of jarlshof
were wont for any purpose to seek access to the foot of the precipice

but long ere mertoun had reached even the upper end of the pass his
adventurous and active son had accomplished his more desperate
enterprise he had been in vain turned aside from the direct line of
descent by the intervention of difficulties which he had not seen from
above his route became only more circuitous but could not be
interrupted more than once large fragments to which he was about to
intrust his weight gave way before him and thundered down into the
tormented ocean and in one or two instances such detached pieces of
rock rushed after him as if to bear him headlong in their course a
courageous heart a steady eye a tenacious hand and a firm foot
carried him through his desperate attempt and in the space of seven
minutes he stood at the bottom of the cliff from the verge of which
he had achieved his perilous descent

the place which he now occupied was the small projecting spot of stones
sand and gravel that extended a little way into the sea which on the
right hand lashed the very bottom of the precipice and on the left was
scarce divided from it by a small wave-worn portion of beach that
extended as far as the foot of the rent in the rocks called erick's
steps by which mordaunt's father proposed to descend

when the vessel split and went to pieces all was swallowed up in the
ocean which had after the first shock been seen to float upon the
waves excepting only a few pieces of wreck casks chests and the
like which a strong eddy formed by the reflux of the waves had
landed or at least grounded upon the shallow where mordaunt now stood
amongst these his eager eye discovered the object that had at first
engaged his attention and which now seen at nigher distance proved to
be in truth a man and in a most precarious state his arms were still
wrapt with a close and convulsive grasp round the plank to which he had
clung in the moment of the shock but sense and the power of motion were
fled and from the situation in which the plank lay partly grounded
upon the beach partly floating in the sea there was every chance that
it might be again washed off shore in which case death was inevitable
just as he had made himself aware of these circumstances mordaunt
beheld a huge wave advancing and hastened to interpose his aid ere it
burst aware that the reflux might probably sweep away the sufferer

he rushed into the surf and fastened on the body with the same
tenacity though under a different impulse with that wherewith the
hound seizes his prey the strength of the retiring wave proved even
greater than he had expected and it was not without a struggle for his
own life as well as for that of the stranger that mordaunt resisted
being swept off with the receding billow when though an adroit
swimmer the strength of the tide must either have dashed him against
the rocks or hurried him out to sea he stood his ground however and
ere another such billow had returned he drew up upon the small slip of
dry sand both the body of the stranger and the plank to which he
continued firmly attached but how to save and to recall the means of
ebbing life and strength and how to remove into a place of greater
safety the sufferer who was incapable of giving any assistance towards
his own preservation were questions which mordaunt asked himself
eagerly but in vain

he looked to the summit of the cliff on which he had left his father
and shouted to him for his assistance but his eye could not distinguish
his form and his voice was only answered by the scream of the
sea-birds he gazed again on the sufferer a dress richly laced
according to the fashion of the times fine linen and rings upon his
fingers evinced he was a man of superior rank and his features showed
youth and comeliness notwithstanding they were pallid and disfigured
he still breathed but so feebly that his respiration was almost
imperceptible and life seemed to keep such slight hold of his frame
that there was every reason to fear it would become altogether
extinguished unless it were speedily reinforced to loosen the
handkerchief from his neck to raise him with his face towards the
breeze to support him with his arms was all that mordaunt could do for
his assistance whilst he anxiously looked for some one who might lend
his aid in dragging the unfortunate to a more safe situation

at this moment he beheld a man advancing slowly and cautiously along the
beach he was in hopes at first it was his father but instantly
recollected that he had not had time to come round by the circuitous
descent to which he must necessarily have recourse and besides he saw
that the man who approached him was shorter in stature

as he came nearer mordaunt was at no loss to recognise the pedlar whom
the day before he had met with at harfra and who was known to him
before upon many occasions he shouted as loud as he could bryce
hollo bryce come hither but the merchant intent upon picking up
some of the spoils of the wreck and upon dragging them out of reach of
the tide paid for some time little attention to his shouts

when he did at length approach mordaunt it was not to lend him his aid
but to remonstrate with him on his rashness in undertaking the
charitable office are you mad said he you that have lived sae lang
in zetland to risk the saving of a drowning man wot ye not if you
bring him to life again he will be sure to do you some capital
injury come master mordaunt bear a hand to what's mair to the
purpose help me to get ane or twa of these kists ashore before any body
else comes and we shall share like good christians what god sends us
and be thankful

mordaunt was indeed no stranger to this inhuman superstition current at
a former period among the lower orders of the zetlanders and the more
generally adopted perhaps that it served as an apology for refusing
assistance to the unfortunate victims of shipwreck while they made
plunder of their goods at any rate the opinion that to save a
drowning man was to run the risk of future injury from him formed a
strange contradiction in the character of these islanders who
hospitable generous and disinterested on all other occasions were
sometimes nevertheless induced by this superstition to refuse their
aid in those mortal emergencies which were so common upon their rocky
and stormy coasts we are happy to add that the exhortation and example
of the proprietors have eradicated even the traces of this inhuman
belief of which there might be some observed within the memory of those
now alive it is strange that the minds of men should have ever been
hardened towards those involved in a distress to which they themselves
were so constantly exposed but perhaps the frequent sight and
consciousness of such danger tends to blunt the feelings to its
consequences whether affecting ourselves or others

bryce was remarkably tenacious of this ancient belief the more so
perhaps that the mounting of his pack depended less upon the warehouses
of lerwick or kirkwall than on the consequences of such a north-western
gale as that of the day preceding for which being a man who in his
own way professed great devotion he seldom failed to express his
grateful thanks to heaven it was indeed said of him that if he had
spent the same time in assisting the wrecked seamen which he had
employed in rifling their bales and boxes he would have saved many
lives and lost much linen he paid no sort of attention to the
repeated entreaties of mordaunt although he was now upon the same slip
of sand with him it was well known to bryce as a place on which the
eddy was likely to land such spoils as the ocean disgorged and to
improve the favourable moment he occupied himself exclusively in
securing and appropriating whatever seemed most portable and of greatest
value at length mordaunt saw the honest pedlar fix his views upon a
strong sea-chest framed of some indian wood well secured by brass
plates and seeming to be of a foreign construction the stout lock
resisted all bryce's efforts to open it until with great composure he
plucked from his pocket a very neat hammer and chisel and began forcing
the hinges

incensed beyond patience at his assurance mordaunt caught up a wooden
stretcher which lay near him and laying his charge softly on the sand
approached bryce with a menacing gesture and exclaimed you
cold-blooded inhuman rascal either get up instantly and lend me your
assistance to recover this man and bear him out of danger from the
surf or i will not only beat you to a mummy on the spot but inform
magnus troil of your thievery that he may have you flogged till your
bones are bare and then banish you from the mainland

the lid of the chest had just sprung open as this rough address saluted
bryce's ears and the inside presented a tempting view of wearing
apparel for sea and land shirts plain and with lace ruffles a silver
compass a silver-hilted sword and other valuable articles which the
pedlar well knew to be such as stir in the trade he was half-disposed
to start up draw the sword which was a cut-and-thrust and darraign
battaile as spenser says rather than quit his prize or brook
interruption being though short a stout square-made personage and
not much past the prime of life having besides the better weapon he
might have given mordaunt more trouble than his benevolent
knight-errantry deserved

already as with vehemence he repeated his injunctions that bryce should
forbear his plunder and come to the assistance of the dying man the
pedlar retorted with a voice of defiance dinna swear sir dinna
swear sir i will endure no swearing in my presence and if you lay a
finger on me that am taking the lawful spoil of the egyptians i will
give ye a lesson ye shall remember from this day to yule

mordaunt would speedily have put the pedlar's courage to the test but a
voice behind him suddenly said forbear it was the voice of norna of
the fitful-head who during the heat of their altercation had
approached them unobserved forbear she repeated and bryce do
thou render mordaunt the assistance he requires it shall avail thee
more and it is i who say the word than all that you could earn to-day
besides

it is se'enteen hundred linen said the pedlar giving a tweak to one
of the shirts in that knowing manner with which matrons and judges
ascertain the texture of the loom it's se'enteen hundred linen and
as strong as an it were dowlas nevertheless mother your bidding is to
be done and i would have done mr mordaunt's bidding too he added
relaxing from his note of defiance into the deferential whining tone
with which he cajoled his customers if he hadna made use of profane
oaths which made my very flesh grew and caused me in some sort to
forget myself he then took a flask from his pocket and approached
the shipwrecked man it's the best of brandy he said and if that
doesna cure him i ken nought that will so saying he took a
preliminary gulp himself as if to show the quality of the liquor and
was about to put it to the man's mouth when suddenly withholding his
hand he looked at norna you ensure me against all risk of evil from
him if i am to render him my help ye ken yoursell what folk say
mother

for all other answer norna took the bottle from the pedlar's hand and
began to chafe the temples and throat of the shipwrecked man directing
mordaunt how to hold his head so as to afford him the means of
disgorging the sea-water which he had swallowed during his immersion

the pedlar looked on inactive for a moment and then said to be sure
there is not the same risk in helping him now he is out of the water
and lying high and dry on the beach and to be sure the principal
danger is to those that first touch him and to be sure it is a
world's pity to see how these rings are pinching the puir creature's
swalled fingers they make his hand as blue as a partan's back before
boiling so saying he seized one of the man's cold hands which had
just by a tremulous motion indicated the return of life and began his
charitable work of removing the rings which seemed to be of some value

as you love your life forbear said norna sternly or i will lay
that on you which shall spoil your travels through the isles

now for mercy's sake mother say nae mair about it said the pedlar
and i'll e'en do your pleasure in your ain way i did feel a
rheumatize in my back-spauld yestreen and it wad be a sair thing for
the like of me to be debarred my quiet walk round the country in the
way of trade making the honest penny and helping myself with what
providence sends on our coasts

peace then said the woman peace as thou wouldst not rue it and
take this man on thy broad shoulders his life is of value and you will
be rewarded

i had muckle need said the pedlar pensively looking at the lidless
chest and the other matters which strewed the sand for he has come
between me and as muckle spreacherie as wad hae made a man of me for the
rest of my life and now it maun lie here till the next tide sweep it a
doun the roost after them that aught it yesterday morning

fear not said norna it will come to man's use see there come
carrion-crows of scent as keen as thine own

she spoke truly for several of the people from the hamlet of jarlshof
were now hastening along the beach to have their share in the spoil
the pedlar beheld them approach with a deep groan ay ay he said
the folk of jarlshof they will make clean wark they are kend for that
far and wide they winna leave the value of a rotten ratlin and what's
waur there isna ane o them has mense or sense eneugh to give thanks
for the mercies when they have gotten them there is the auld ranzelman
neil ronaldson that canna walk a mile to hear the minister but he will
hirple ten if he hears of a ship embayed

norna however seemed to possess over him so complete an ascendency
that he no longer hesitated to take the man who now gave strong
symptoms of reviving existence upon his shoulders and assisted by
mordaunt trudged along the sea-beach with his burden without farther
remonstrance ere he was borne off the stranger pointed to the chest
and attempted to mutter something to which norna replied enough it
shall be secured

advancing towards the passage called erick's steps by which they were
to ascend the cliffs they met the people from jarlshof hastening in the
opposite direction man and woman as they passed reverently made room
for norna and saluted her not without an expression of fear upon some
of their faces she passed them a few paces and then turning back
called aloud to the ranzelman who though the practice was more common
than legal was attending the rest of the hamlet upon this plundering
expedition neil ronaldson she said mark my words there stands
yonder a chest from which the lid has been just prized off look it be
brought down to your own house at jarlshof just as it now is beware of
moving or touching the slightest article he were better in his grave
that so much as looks at the contents i speak not for nought nor in
aught will i be disobeyed

your pleasure shall be done mother said ronaldson i warrant we
will not break bulk since sic is your bidding

far behind the rest of the villagers followed an old woman talking to
herself and cursing her own decrepitude which kept her the last of the
party yet pressing forward with all her might to get her share of the
spoil

when they met her mordaunt was astonished to recognise his father's old
housekeeper how now he said swertha what make you so far from
home

just e'en daikering out to look after my auld master and your honour
replied swertha who felt like a criminal caught in the manner for on
more occasions than one mr mertoun had intimated his high
disapprobation of such excursions as she was at present engaged in

but mordaunt was too much engaged with his own thoughts to take much
notice of her delinquency have you seen my father he said

and that i have replied swertha the gude gentleman was ganging to
hirsel himsell doun erick's steps whilk would have been the ending of
him that is in no way a cragsman sae i e'en gat him wiled away
hame and i was just seeking you that you may gang after him to the
hall-house for to my thought he is far frae weel

my father unwell said mordaunt remembering the faintness he had
exhibited at the commencement of that morning's walk

far frae weel far frae weel groaned out swertha with a piteous
shake of the head white o the gills white o the gills and him to
think of coming down the riva

return home mordaunt said norna who was listening to what had
passed i will see all that is necessary done for this man's relief
and you will find him at the ranzelman's when you list to enquire you
cannot help him more than you already have done

mordaunt felt this was true and commanding swertha to follow him
instantly betook himself to the path homeward

swertha hobbled reluctantly after her young master in the same
direction until she lost sight of him on his entering the cleft of the
rock then instantly turned about muttering to herself haste home in
good sooth haste home and lose the best chance of getting a new
rokelay and owerlay that i have had these ten years by my certie
na it's seldom sic rich godsends come on our shore no since the jenny
and james came ashore in king charlie's time

so saying she mended her pace as well as she could and a willing mind
making amends for frail limbs posted on with wonderful dispatch to put
in for her share of the spoil she soon reached the beach where the
ranzelman stuffing his own pouches all the while was exhorting the
rest to part things fair and be neighbourly and to give to the auld
and helpless a share of what was going which he charitably remarked
would bring a blessing on the shore and send them mair wrecks ere
winter

chapter viii

 he was a lovely youth i guess
 the panther in the wilderness
 was not so fair as he
 and when he chose to sport and play
 no dolphin ever was so gay
 upon the tropic sea

 wordsworth


the light foot of mordaunt mertoun was not long of bearing him to
jarlshof he entered the house hastily for what he himself had observed
that morning corresponded in some degree with the ideas which swertha's
tale was calculated to excite he found his father however in the
inner apartment reposing himself after his fatigue and his first
question satisfied him that the good dame had practised a little
imposition to get rid of them both

where is this dying man whom you have so wisely ventured your own neck
to relieve said the elder mertoun to the younger

norna sir replied mordaunt has taken him under her charge she
understands such matters

and is quack as well as witch said the elder mertoun with all my
heart it is a trouble saved but i hasted home on swertha's hint to
look out for lint and bandages for her speech was of broken bones

mordaunt kept silence well knowing his father would not persevere in
his enquiries upon such a matter and not willing either to prejudice
the old governante or to excite his father to one of those excesses of
passion into which he was apt to burst when contrary to his wont he
thought proper to correct the conduct of his domestic

it was late in the day ere old swertha returned from her expedition
heartily fatigued and bearing with her a bundle of some bulk
containing it would seem her share of the spoil mordaunt instantly
sought her out to charge her with the deceits she had practised on both
his father and himself but the accused matron lacked not her reply

by her troth she said she thought it was time to bid mr mertoun
gang hame and get bandages when she had seen with her ain twa een
mordaunt ganging down the cliff like a wild-cat it was to be thought
broken bones would be the end and lucky if bandages wad do any
good and by her troth she might weel tell mordaunt his father was
puirly and him looking sae white in the gills whilk she wad die upon
it was the very word she used and it was a thing that couldna be
denied by man at this very moment

but swertha said mordaunt as soon as her clamorous defence gave him
time to speak in reply how came you that should have been busy with
your housewifery and your spinning to be out this morning at erick's
steps in order to take all this unnecessary care of my father and
me and what is in that bundle swertha for i fear swertha you have
been transgressing the law and have been out upon the wrecking system

fair fa your sonsy face and the blessing of saint ronald upon you
said swertha in a tone betwixt coaxing and jesting would you keep a
puir body frae mending hersell and sae muckle gear lying on the loose
sand for the lifting hout maister mordaunt a ship ashore is a sight
to wile the minister out of his very pu'pit in the middle of his
preaching muckle mair a puir auld ignorant wife frae her rock and her
tow and little did i get for my day's wark just some rags o cambric
things and a bit or twa of coorse claith and sic like the strong and
the hearty get a thing in this warld

yes swertha replied mordaunt and that is rather hard as you must
have your share of punishment in this world and the next for robbing
the poor mariners

hout callant wha wad punish an auld wife like me for a wheen
duds folk speak muckle black ill of earl patrick but he was a freend
to the shore and made wise laws against ony body helping vessels that
were like to gang on the breakers and the mariners i have heard
bryce jagger say lose their right frae the time keel touches sand and
moreover they are dead and gane poor souls dead and gane and care
little about warld's wealth now nay nae mair than the great jarls and
sea-kings in the norse days did about the treasures that they buried
in the tombs and sepulchres auld langsyne did i ever tell you the sang
maister mordaunt how olaf tryguarson garr'd hide five gold crowns in
the same grave with him

no swertha said mordaunt who took pleasure in tormenting the
cunning old plunderer you never told me that but i tell you that the
stranger whom norna has taken down to the town will be well enough
to-morrow to ask where you have hidden the goods that you have stolen
from the wreck

but wha will tell him a word about it hinnie said swertha looking
slyly up in her young master's face the mair by token since i maun
tell ye that i have a bonny remnant of silk amang the lave that will
make a dainty waistcoat to yoursell the first merry-making ye gang to

mordaunt could no longer forbear laughing at the cunning with which the
old dame proposed to bribe off his evidence by imparting a portion of
her plunder and desiring her to get ready what provision she had made
for dinner he returned to his father whom he found still sitting in
the same place and nearly in the same posture in which he had left
him

when their hasty and frugal meal was finished mordaunt announced to his
father his purpose of going down to the town or hamlet to look after
the shipwrecked sailor

the elder mertoun assented with a nod

he must be ill accommodated there sir added his son a hint which
only produced another nod of assent he seemed from his appearance
pursued mordaunt to be of very good rank and admitting these poor
people do their best to receive him in his present weak state yet  

i know what you would say said his father interrupting him we you
think ought to do something towards assisting him go to him then if
he lacks money let him name the sum and he shall have it but for
lodging the stranger here and holding intercourse with him i neither
can nor will do so i have retired to this farthest extremity of the
british isles to avoid new friends and new faces and none such shall
intrude on me either their happiness or their misery when you have
known the world half a score of years longer your early friends will
have given you reason to remember them and to avoid new ones for the
rest of your life go then why do you stop rid the country of the
man let me see no one about me but those vulgar countenances the
extent and character of whose petty knavery i know and can submit to
as to an evil too trifling to cause irritation he then threw his purse
to his son and signed to him to depart with all speed

mordaunt was not long before he reached the village in the dark abode
of neil ronaldson the ranzelman he found the stranger seated by the
peat-fire upon the very chest which had excited the cupidity of the
devout bryce snailsfoot the pedlar the ranzelman himself was absent
dividing with all due impartiality the spoils of the wrecked vessel
amongst the natives of the community listening to and redressing their
complaints of inequality and if the matter in hand had not been from
beginning to end utterly unjust and indefensible discharging the part
of a wise and prudent magistrate in all the details for at this time
and probably until a much later period the lower orders of the
islanders entertained an opinion common to barbarians also in the same
situation that whatever was cast on their shores became their
indisputable property

margery bimbister the worthy spouse of the ranzelman was in the charge
of the house and introduced mordaunt to her guest saying with no
great ceremony this is the young tacksman you will maybe tell him
your name though you will not tell it to us if it had not been for
his four quarters it's but little you would have said to any body sae
lang as life lasted

the stranger arose and shook mordaunt by the hand observing he
understood that he had been the means of saving his life and his chest
the rest of the property he said is i see walking the plank for
they are as busy as the devil in a gale of wind

and what was the use of your seamanship then said margery that you
couldna keep off the sumburgh-head it would have been lang ere
sumburgh-head had come to you

leave us for a moment good margery bimbister said mordaunt i wish
to have some private conversation with this gentleman

gentleman said margery with an emphasis not but the man is well
enough to look at she added again surveying him but i doubt if
there is muckle of the gentleman about him

mordaunt looked at the stranger and was of a different opinion he was
rather above the middle size and formed handsomely as well as strongly
mordaunt's intercourse with society was not extensive but he thought
his new acquaintance to a bold sunburnt handsome countenance which
seemed to have faced various climates added the frank and open manners
of a sailor he answered cheerfully the enquiries which mordaunt made
after his health and maintained that one night's rest would relieve him
from all the effects of the disaster he had sustained but he spoke with
bitterness of the avarice and curiosity of the ranzelman and his spouse

that chattering old woman said the stranger has persecuted me the
whole day for the name of the ship i think she might be contented with
the share she has had of it i was the principal owner of the vessel
that was lost yonder and they have left me nothing but my wearing
apparel is there no magistrate or justice of the peace in this wild
country that would lend a hand to help one when he is among the
breakers

mordaunt mentioned magnus troil the principal proprietor as well as
the fowd or provincial judge of the district as the person from whom
he was most likely to obtain redress and regretted that his own youth
and his father's situation as a retired stranger should put it out of
their power to afford him the protection he required

nay for your part you have done enough said the sailor but if i
had five out of the forty brave fellows that are fishes food by this
time the devil a man would i ask to do me the right that i could do for
myself

forty hands said mordaunt you were well manned for the size of the
ship

not so well as we needed to be we mounted ten guns besides chasers
but our cruise on the main had thinned us of men and lumbered us up
with goods six of our guns were in ballast hands if i had had enough
of hands we would never have miscarried so infernally the people were
knocked up with working the pumps and so took to their boats and left
me with the vessel to sink or swim but the dogs had their pay and i
can afford to pardon them the boat swamped in the current all were
lost and here am i

you had come north about then from the west indies said mordaunt

ay ay the vessel was the good hope of bristol a letter of marque
she had fine luck down on the spanish main both with commerce and
privateering but the luck's ended with her now my name is clement
cleveland captain and part owner as i said before i am a bristol man
born my father was well known on the tollsell old clem cleveland of
the college-green

mordaunt had no right to enquire farther and yet it seemed to him as if
his own mind was but half satisfied there was an affectation of
bluntness a sort of defiance in the manner of the stranger for which
circumstances afforded no occasion captain cleveland had suffered
injustice from the islanders but from mordaunt he had only received
kindness and protection yet he seemed as if he involved all the
neighbourhood in the wrongs he complained of mordaunt looked down and
was silent doubting whether it would be better to take his leave or to
proceed farther in his offers of assistance cleveland seemed to guess
at his thoughts for he immediately added in a conciliating manner i
am a plain man master mertoun for that i understand is your name and
i am a ruined man to boot and that does not mend one's good manners
but you have done a kind and friendly part by me and it may be i think
as much of it as if i thanked you more and so before i leave this
place i'll give you my fowlingpiece she will put a hundred swan-shot
through a dutchman's cap at eighty paces she will carry ball too i
have hit a wild bull within a hundred-and-fifty yards but i have two
pieces that are as good or better so you may keep this for my sake

that would be to take my share of the wreck answered mordaunt
laughing

no such matter said cleveland undoing a case which contained several
guns and pistols you see i have saved my private arm-chest as well
as my clothes that the tall old woman in the dark rigging managed for
me and between ourselves it is worth all i have lost for he added
lowering his voice and looking round when i speak of being ruined in
the hearing of these landsharks i do not mean ruined stock and block
no here is something will do more than shoot sea-fowl so saying he
pulled out a great ammunition-pouch marked swan-shot and showed
mordaunt hastily that it was full of spanish pistoles and portagues
as the broad portugal pieces were then called no no he added
with a smile i have ballast enough to trim the vessel again and now
will you take the piece

since you are willing to give it me said mordaunt laughing with
all my heart i was just going to ask you in my father's name he
added showing his purse whether you wanted any of that same ballast

thanks but you see i am provided take my old acquaintance and may
she serve you as well as she has served me but you will never make so
good a voyage with her you can shoot i suppose

tolerably well said mordaunt admiring the piece which was a
beautiful spanish-barrelled gun inlaid with gold small in the bore
and of unusual length such as is chiefly used for shooting sea-fowl
and for ball-practice

with slugs continued the donor never gun shot closer and with
single ball you may kill a seal two hundred yards at sea from the top
of the highest peak of this iron-bound coast of yours but i tell you
again that the old rattler will never do you the service she has done
me

i shall not use her so dexterously perhaps said mordaunt

umph perhaps not replied cleveland but that is not the question
what say you to shooting the man at the wheel just as we run aboard of
a spaniard so the don was taken aback and we laid him athwart the
hawse and carried her cutlass in hand and worth the while she
was stout brigantine el santo francisco bound for porto bello with
gold and negroes that little bit of lead was worth twenty thousand
pistoles

i have shot at no such game as yet said mordaunt

well all in good time we cannot weigh till the tide makes but you
are a tight handsome active young man what is to ail you to take a
trip after some of this stuff laying his hand on the bag of gold

my father talks of my travelling soon replied mordaunt who born to
hold men-of-wars-men in great respect felt flattered by this invitation
from one who appeared a thorough-bred seaman

i respect him for the thought said the captain and i will visit him
before i weigh anchor i have a consort off these islands and be cursed
to her she'll find me out somewhere though she parted company in the
bit of a squall unless she is gone to davy jones too well she was
better found than we and not so deep loaded she must have weathered
it we'll have a hammock slung for you aboard and make a sailor and a
man of you in the same trip

i should like it well enough said mordaunt who eagerly longed to
see more of the world than his lonely situation had hitherto permitted
but then my father must decide

your father pooh said captain cleveland but you are very right
he added checking himself gad i have lived so long at sea that i
cannot imagine any body has a right to think except the captain and the
master but you are very right i will go up to the old gentleman this
instant and speak to him myself he lives in that handsome
modern-looking building i suppose that i see a quarter of a mile off

in that old half-ruined house said mordaunt he does indeed live
but he will see no visitors

then you must drive the point yourself for i can't stay in this
latitude since your father is no magistrate i must go to see this same
magnus how call you him who is not justice of peace but something
else that will do the turn as well these fellows have got two or three
things that i must and will have back let them keep the rest and be
d  d to them will you give me a letter to him just by way of
commission

it is scarce needful said mordaunt it is enough that you are
shipwrecked and need his help but yet i may as well furnish you with
a letter of introduction

there said the sailor producing a writing-case from his chest are
your writing-tools meantime since bulk has been broken i will nail
down the hatches and make sure of the cargo

while mordaunt accordingly was engaged in writing to magnus troil a
letter setting forth the circumstances in which captain cleveland had
been thrown upon their coast the captain having first selected and
laid aside some wearing apparel and necessaries enough to fill a
knapsack took in hand hammer and nails employed himself in securing
the lid of his sea-chest by fastening it down in a workmanlike manner
and then added the corroborating security of a cord twisted and knotted
with nautical dexterity i leave this in your charge he said all
except this showing the bag of gold and these pointing to a
cutlass and pistols which may prevent all further risk of my parting
company with my portagues

you will find no occasion for weapons in this country captain
cleveland replied mordaunt a child might travel with a purse of gold
from sumburgh-head to the scaw of unst and no soul would injure him

and that's pretty boldly said young gentleman considering what is
going on without doors at this moment

o replied mordaunt a little confused what comes on land with the
tide they reckon their lawful property one would think they had
studied under sir arthegal who pronounces 

 for equal right in equal things doth stand
 and what the mighty sea hath once possess'd
 and plucked quite from all possessors hands
 or else by wrecks that wretches have distress'd
 he may dispose by his resistless might
 as things at random left to whom he list

i shall think the better of plays and ballads as long as i live for
these very words said captain cleveland and yet i have loved them
well enough in my day but this is good doctrine and more men than one
may trim their sails to such a breeze what the sea sends is ours
that's sure enough however in case that your good folks should think
the land as well as the sea may present them with waiffs and strays i
will make bold to take my cutlass and pistols will you cause my chest
to be secured in your own house till you hear from me and use your
influence to procure me a guide to show me the way and to carry my
kit

will you go by sea or land said mordaunt in reply

by sea exclaimed cleveland what in one of these cockleshells and
a cracked cockleshell to boot no no land land unless i knew my
crew my vessel and my voyage

they parted accordingly captain cleveland being supplied with a guide
to conduct him to burgh-westra and his chest being carefully removed to
the mansion-house at jarlshof

chapter ix

 this is a gentle trader and a prudent
 he's no autolycus to blear your eye
 with quips of worldly gauds and gamesomeness
 but seasons all his glittering merchandise
 with wholesome doctrines suited to the use

 old play


on the subsequent morning mordaunt in answer to his father's
enquiries began to give him some account of the shipwrecked mariner
whom he had rescued from the waves but he had not proceeded far in
recapitulating the particulars which cleveland had communicated when
mr mertoun's looks became disturbed he arose hastily and after
pacing twice or thrice across the room he retired into the inner
chamber to which he usually confined himself while under the influence
of his mental malady in the evening he re-appeared without any traces
of his disorder but it may be easily supposed that his son avoided
recurring to the subject which had affected him

mordaunt mertoun was thus left without assistance to form at his
leisure his own opinion respecting the new acquaintance which the sea
had sent him and upon the whole he was himself surprised to find the
result less favourable to the stranger than he could well account for
there seemed to mordaunt to be a sort of repelling influence about the
man true he was a handsome man of a frank and prepossessing manner
but there was an assumption of superiority about him which mordaunt did
not quite so much like although he was so keen a sportsman as to be
delighted with his acquisition of the spanish-barrelled gun and
accordingly mounted and dismounted it with great interest paying the
utmost attention to the most minute parts about the lock and ornaments
yet he was upon the whole inclined to have some scruples about the
mode in which he had acquired it

i should not have accepted it he thought perhaps captain cleveland
might give it me as a sort of payment for the trifling service i did
him and yet it would have been churlish to refuse it in the way it was
offered i wish he had looked more like a man whom one would have chosen
to be obliged to

but a successful day's shooting reconciled him to his gun and he became
assured like most young sportsmen in similar circumstances that all
other pieces were but pop-guns in comparison but then to be doomed to
shoot gulls and seals when there were frenchmen and spaniards to be
come at when there were ships to be boarded and steersmen to be marked
off seemed but a dull and contemptible destiny his father had
mentioned his leaving these islands and no other mode of occupation
occurred to his inexperience save that of the sea with which he had
been conversant from his infancy his ambition had formerly aimed no
higher than at sharing the fatigues and dangers of a greenland fishing
expedition for it was in that scene that the zetlanders laid most of
their perilous adventures but war was again raging the history of sir
francis drake captain morgan and other bold adventurers an account of
whose exploits he had purchased from bryce snailsfoot had made much
impression on his mind and the offer of captain cleveland to take him
to sea frequently recurred to him although the pleasure of such a
project was somewhat damped by a doubt whether in the long run he
should not find many objections to his proposed commander thus much he
already saw that he was opinionative and might probably prove
arbitrary and that since even his kindness was mingled with an
assumption of superiority his occasional displeasure might contain a
great deal more of that disagreeable ingredient than could be palatable
to those who sailed under him and yet after counting all risks could
his father's consent be obtained with what pleasure he thought would
he embark in quest of new scenes and strange adventures in which he
proposed to himself to achieve such deeds as should be the theme of many
a tale to the lovely sisters of burgh-westra tales at which minna
should weep and brenda should smile and both should marvel and this
was to be the reward of his labours and his dangers for the hearth of
magnus troil had a magnetic influence over his thoughts and however
they might traverse amid his day-dreams it was the point where they
finally settled

there were times when mordaunt thought of mentioning to his father the
conversation he had held with captain cleveland and the seaman's
proposal to him but the very short and general account which he had
given of that person's history upon the morning after his departure
from the hamlet had produced a sinister effect on mr mertoun's mind
and discouraged him from speaking farther on any subject connected with
it it would be time enough he thought to mention captain cleveland's
proposal when his consort should arrive and when he should repeat his
offer in a more formal manner and these he supposed events likely very
soon to happen

but days grew to weeks and weeks were numbered into months and he
heard nothing from cleveland and only learned by an occasional visit
from bryce snailsfoot that the captain was residing at burgh-westra as
one of the family mordaunt was somewhat surprised at this although the
unlimited hospitality of the islands which magnus troil both from
fortune and disposition carried to the utmost extent made it almost a
matter of course that he should remain in the family until he disposed
of himself otherwise still it seemed strange he had not gone to some of
the northern isles to enquire after his consort or that he did not
rather choose to make lerwick his residence where fishing vessels often
brought news from the coasts and ports of scotland and holland again
why did he not send for the chest he had deposited at jarlshof and
still farther mordaunt thought it would have been but polite if the
stranger had sent him some sort of message in token of remembrance

these subjects of reflection were connected with another still more
unpleasant and more difficult to account for until the arrival of this
person scarce a week had passed without bringing him some kind
greeting or token of recollection from burgh-westra and pretences
were scarce ever wanting for maintaining a constant intercourse minna
wanted the words of a norse ballad or desired to have for her various
collections feathers or eggs or shells or specimens of the rarer
sea-weeds or brenda sent a riddle to be resolved or a song to be
learned or the honest old udaller in a rude manuscript which might
have passed for an ancient runic inscription sent his hearty greetings
to his good young friend with a present of something to make good
cheer and an earnest request he would come to burgh-westra as soon and
stay there as long as possible these kindly tokens of remembrance were
often sent by special message besides which there was never a
passenger or a traveller who crossed from the one mansion to the other
who did not bring to mordaunt some friendly greeting from the udaller
and his family of late this intercourse had become more and more
infrequent and no messenger from burgh-westra had visited jarlshof for
several weeks mordaunt both observed and felt this alteration and it
dwelt on his mind while he questioned bryce as closely as pride and
prudence would permit to ascertain if possible the cause of the
change yet he endeavoured to assume an indifferent air while he asked
the jagger whether there were no news in the country

great news the jagger replied and a gay mony of them that
crackbrained carle the new factor is for making a change in the
bismars and the lispunds and our worthy fowd magnus troil has
sworn that sooner than change them for the still-yard or aught else
he'll fling factor yellowley from brassa-craig

is that all said mordaunt very little interested

all and eneugh i think replied the pedlar how are folks to buy
and sell if the weights are changed on them

very true replied mordaunt but have you heard of no strange vessels
on the coast

six dutch doggers off brassa and as i hear a high-quartered galliot
thing with a gaff mainsail lying in scalloway bay she will be from
norway

no ships of war or sloops

none replied the pedlar since the kite tender sailed with the
impress men if it was his will and our men were out of her i wish the
deep sea had her

were there no news at burgh-westra were the family all well

a weel and weel to do out-taken it may be something ower muckle
daffing and laughing dancing ilk night they say wi the stranger
captain that's living there him that was ashore on sumburgh-head the
tother day less daffing served him then

daffing dancing every night said mordaunt not particularly well
satisfied whom does captain cleveland dance with

ony body he likes i fancy said the jagger at ony rate he gars a
body yonder dance after his fiddle but i ken little about it for i am
no free in conscience to look upon thae flinging fancies folk should
mind that life is made but of rotten yarn

i fancy that it is to keep them in mind of that wholesome truth that
you deal in such tender wares bryce replied mordaunt dissatisfied as
well with the tenor of the reply as with the affected scruples of the
respondent

that's as muckle as to say that i suld hae minded you was a flinger
and a fiddler yoursell maister mordaunt but i am an auld man and maun
unburden my conscience but ye will be for the dance i sall warrant
that's to be at burgh-westra on john's even saunt john's as the
blinded creatures ca him and nae doubt ye will be for some warldly
braws hose waistcoats or sic like i hae pieces frae flanders with
that he placed his movable warehouse on the table and began to unlock
it

dance repeated mordaunt dance on st john's even were you desired
to bid me to it bryce

na but ye ken weel eneugh ye wad be welcome bidden or no bidden this
captain how ca ye him is to be skudler as they ca't the first of
the gang like

the devil take him said mordaunt in impatient surprise

a in gude time replied the jagger hurry no man's cattle the devil
will hae his due i warrant ye or it winna be for lack of seeking but
it's true i'm telling you for a ye stare like a wild-cat and this
same captain i watna his name bought ane of the very waistcoats that
i am ganging to show ye purple wi a gowd binding and bonnily
broidered and i have a piece for you the neighbour of it wi a green
grund and if ye mean to streek yoursell up beside him ye maun e'en buy
it for it's gowd that glances in the lasses een now-a-days see look
till't he added displaying the pattern in various points of view
look till it through the light and till the light through
it wi the grain and against the grain it shows ony gate cam
frae antwerp a the gate four dollars is the price and yon captain was
sae weel pleased that he flang down a twenty shilling jacobus and bade
me keep the change and be d  d poor silly profane creature i pity
him

without enquiring whether the pedlar bestowed his compassion on the
worldly imprudence or the religious deficiencies of captain cleveland
mordaunt turned from him folded his arms and paced the apartment
muttering to himself not asked a stranger to be king of the
feast words which he repeated so earnestly that bryce caught a part
of their import

as for asking i am almaist bauld to say that ye will be asked
maister mordaunt

did they mention my name then said mordaunt

i canna preceesely say that said bryce snailsfoot but ye needna
turn away your head sae sourly like a sealgh when he leaves the shore
for do you see i heard distinctly that a the revellers about are to
be there and is't to be thought they would leave out you an auld kend
freend and the lightest foot at sic frolics heaven send you a better
praise in his ain gude time that ever flang at a fiddle-squeak
between this and unst sae i consider ye altogether the same as
invited and ye had best provide yourself wi a waistcoat for brave and
brisk will every man be that's there the lord pity them

he thus continued to follow with his green glazen eyes the motions of
young mordaunt mertoun who was pacing the room in a very pensive
manner which the jagger probably misinterpreted as he thought like
claudio that if a man is sad it must needs be because he lacks money
bryce therefore after another pause thus accosted him ye needna be
sad about the matter maister mordaunt for although i got the just
price of the article from the captain-man yet i maun deal freendly wi
you as a kend freend and customer and bring the price as they say
within your purse-mouth or it's the same to me to let it lie ower till
martinmas or e'en to candlemas i am decent in the warld maister
mordaunt forbid that i should hurry ony body far mair a freend that
has paid me siller afore now or i wad be content to swap the garment
for the value in feathers or sea-otters skins or ony kind of
peltrie nane kens better than yoursell how to come by sic ware and i
am sure i hae furnished you wi the primest o powder i dinna ken if i
tell'd ye it was out o the kist of captain plunket that perished on
the scaw of unst wi the armed brig mary sax years syne he was a
prime fowler himself and luck it was that the kist came ashore dry i
sell that to nane but gude marksmen and so i was saying if ye had ony
wares ye liked to coup for the waistcoat i wad be ready to trock
wi you for assuredly ye will be wanted at burgh-westra on saint
john's even and ye wadna like to look waur than the captain that wadna
be setting

i will be there at least whether wanted or not said mordaunt
stopping short in his walk and taking the waistcoat-piece hastily out
of the pedlar's hand and as you say will not disgrace them

haud a care haud a care maister mordaunt exclaimed the pedlar ye
handle it as it were a bale of coarse wadmaal ye'll fray't to bits ye
might weel say my ware is tender and ye'll mind the price is four
dollars sall i put ye in my book for it

no said mordaunt hastily and taking out his purse he flung down
the money

grace to ye to wear the garment said the joyous pedlar and to me
to guide the siller and protect us from earthly vanities and earthly
covetousness and send you the white linen raiment whilk is mair to be
desired than the muslins and cambrics and lawns and silks of this
world and send me the talents which avail more than much fine spanish
gold or dutch dollars either and but god guide the callant what for
is he wrapping the silk up that gate like a wisp of hay

at this moment old swertha the housekeeper entered to whom as if
eager to get rid of the subject mordaunt threw his purchase with
something like careless disdain and telling her to put it aside
snatched his gun which stood in the corner threw his shooting
accoutrements about him and without noticing bryce's attempt to enter
into conversation upon the braw seal-skin as saft as doe-leather
which made the sling and cover of his fowlingpiece he left the
apartment abruptly

the jagger with those green goggling and gain-descrying kind of
optics which we have already described continued gazing for an instant
after the customer who treated his wares with such irreverence

swertha also looked after him with some surprise the callant's in a
creel quoth she

in a creel echoed the pedlar he will be as wowf as ever his father
was to guide in that gate a bargain that cost him four dollars very
very fifish as the east-country fisher-folk say

four dollars for that green rag said swertha catching at the words
which the jagger had unwarily suffered to escape that was a bargain
indeed i wonder whether he is the greater fule or you the mair rogue
bryce snailsfoot

i didna say it cost him preceesely four dollars said snailsfoot but
if it had the lad's siller's his ain i hope and he is auld eneugh to
make his ain bargains mair by token the gudes are weel worth the money
and mair

mair by token said swertha coolly i will see what his father
thinks about it

ye'll no be sae ill-natured mrs swertha said the jagger that will
be but cauld thanks for the bonny owerlay that i hae brought you a the
way frae lerwick

and a bonny price ye'll be setting on't said swertha for that's the
gate your good deeds end

ye sall hae the fixing of the price yoursell or it may lie ower till
ye're buying something for the house or for your master and it can
make a ae count

troth and that's true bryce snailsfoot i am thinking we'll want some
napery sune for it's no to be thought we can spin and the like as if
there was a mistress in the house and sae we make nane at hame

and that's what i ca walking by the word said the jagger go unto
those that buy and sell there's muckle profit in that text

there is a pleasure in dealing wi a discreet man that can make profit
of ony thing said swertha and now that i take another look at that
daft callant's waistcoat piece i think it is honestly worth four
dollars

any sudden cause for anxious and mortifying reflection which in
advanced age occasions sullen and pensive inactivity stimulates youth
to eager and active exertion as if like the hurt deer they
endeavoured to drown the pain of the shaft by the rapidity of motion
when mordaunt caught up his gun and rushed out of the house of
jarlshof he walked on with great activity over waste and wild without
any determined purpose except that of escaping if possible from the
smart of his own irritation his pride was effectually mortified by the
report of the jagger which coincided exactly with some doubts he had
been led to entertain by the long and unkind silence of his friends at
burgh-westra

if the fortunes of cæsar had doomed him as the poet suggests to have
been

 but the best wrestler on the green

it is nevertheless to be presumed that a foil from a rival in that
rustic exercise would have mortified him as much as a defeat from a
competitor when he was struggling for the empery of the world and even
so mordaunt mertoun degraded in his own eyes from the height which he
had occupied as the chief amongst the youth of the island felt vexed
and irritated as well as humbled the two beautiful sisters also
whose smiles all were so desirous of acquiring with whom he had lived
on terms of such familiar affection that with the same ease and
innocence there was unconsciously mixed a shade of deeper though
undefined tenderness than characterises fraternal love they also
seemed to have forgotten him he could not be ignorant that in the
universal opinion of all dunrossness nay of the whole mainland he
might have had every chance of being the favoured lover of either and
now at once and without any failure on his part he was become so
little to them that he had lost even the consequence of an ordinary
acquaintance the old udaller too whose hearty and sincere character
should have made him more constant in his friendships seemed to have
been as fickle as his daughters and poor mordaunt had at once lost the
smiles of the fair and the favour of the powerful these were
uncomfortable reflections and he doubled his pace that he might
outstrip them if possible

without exactly reflecting upon the route which he pursued mordaunt
walked briskly on through a country where neither hedge wall nor
enclosure of any kind interrupts the steps of the wanderer until he
reached a very solitary spot where embosomed among steep heathy hills
which sunk suddenly down on the verge of the water lay one of those
small fresh-water lakes which are common in the zetland isles whose
outlets form the sources of the small brooks and rivulets by which the
country is watered and serve to drive the little mills which
manufacture their grain

it was a mild summer day the beams of the sun as is not uncommon in
zetland were moderated and shaded by a silvery haze which filled the
atmosphere and destroying the strong contrast of light and shade gave
even to noon the sober livery of the evening twilight the little lake
not three-quarters of a mile in circuit lay in profound quiet its
surface undimpled save when one of the numerous water-fowl which
glided on its surface dived for an instant under it the depth of the
water gave the whole that cerulean tint of bluish green which
occasioned its being called the green loch and at present it formed so
perfect a mirror to the bleak hills by which it was surrounded and
which lay reflected on its bosom that it was difficult to distinguish
the water from the land nay in the shadowy uncertainty occasioned by
the thin haze a stranger could scarce have been sensible that a sheet
of water lay before him a scene of more complete solitude having all
its peculiarities heightened by the extreme serenity of the weather the
quiet grey composed tone of the atmosphere and the perfect silence of
the elements could hardly be imagined the very aquatic birds who
frequented the spot in great numbers forbore their usual flight and
screams and floated in profound tranquillity upon the silent water

without taking any determined aim without having any determined
purpose without almost thinking what he was about mordaunt presented
his fowlingpiece and fired across the lake the large swan shot dimpled
its surface like a partial shower of hail the hills took up the noise
of the report and repeated it again and again and again to all their
echoes the water-fowl took to wing in eddying and confused wheel
answering the echoes with a thousand varying screams from the deep note
of the swabie or swartback to the querulous cry of the tirracke and
kittiewake

mordaunt looked for a moment on the clamorous crowd with a feeling of
resentment which he felt disposed at the moment to apply to all nature
and all her objects animate or inanimate however little concerned with
the cause of his internal mortification

ay ay he said wheel dive scream and clamour as you will and
all because you have seen a strange sight and heard an unusual sound
there is many a one like you in this round world but you at least
shall learn he added as he reloaded his gun that strange sights and
strange sounds ay and strange acquaintances to boot have sometimes a
little shade of danger connected with them but why should i wreak my
own vexation on these harmless sea-gulls he subjoined after a
moment's pause they have nothing to do with the friends that have
forgotten me i loved them all so well and to be so soon given up for
the first stranger whom chance threw on the coast

as he stood resting upon his gun and abandoning his mind to the course
of these unpleasant reflections his meditations were unexpectedly
interrupted by some one touching his shoulder he looked around and saw
norna of the fitful-head wrapped in her dark and ample mantle she had
seen him from the brow of the hill and had descended to the lake
through a small ravine which concealed her until she came with
noiseless step so close to him that he turned round at her touch

mordaunt mertoun was by nature neither timorous nor credulous and a
course of reading more extensive than usual had in some degree
fortified his mind against the attacks of superstition but he would
have been an actual prodigy if living in zetland in the end of the
seventeenth century he had possessed the philosophy which did not exist
in scotland generally until at least two generations later he doubted
in his own mind the extent nay the very existence of norna's
supernatural attributes which was a high flight of incredulity in the
country where they were universally received but still his incredulity
went no farther than doubts she was unquestionably an extraordinary
woman gifted with an energy above others acting upon motives peculiar
to herself and apparently independent of mere earthly considerations
impressed with these ideas which he had imbibed from his youth it was
not without something like alarm that he beheld this mysterious female
standing on a sudden so close beside him and looking upon him with such
sad and severe eyes as those with which the fatal virgins who
according to northern mythology were called the valkyriur or
choosers of the slain were supposed to regard the young champions
whom they selected to share the banquet of odin

it was indeed reckoned unlucky to say the least to meet with norna
suddenly alone and in a place remote from witnesses and she was
supposed on such occasions to have been usually a prophetess of evil
as well as an omen of misfortune to those who had such a rencontre
there were few or none of the islanders however familiarized with her
occasional appearance in society that would not have trembled to meet
her on the solitary banks of the green loch

i bring you no evil mordaunt mertoun she said reading perhaps
something of this superstitious feeling in the looks of the young man
evil from me you never felt and never will

nor do i fear any said mordaunt exerting himself to throw aside an
apprehension which he felt to be unmanly why should i mother you
have been ever my friend

yet mordaunt thou art not of our region but to none of zetland
blood no not even to those who sit around the hearth-stone of magnus
troil the noble descendants of the ancient jarls of orkney am i more a
well-wisher than i am to thee thou kind and brave-hearted boy when i
hung around thy neck that gifted chain which all in our isles know was
wrought by no earthly artist but by the drows in the secret
recesses of their caverns thou wert then but fifteen years old yet thy
foot had been on the maiden-skerrie of northmaven known before but to
the webbed sole of the swartback and thy skiff had been in the deepest
cavern of brinnastir where the haaf-fish had before slumbered in
dark obscurity therefore i gave thee that noble gift and well thou
knowest that since that day every eye in these isles has looked on
thee as a son or as a brother endowed beyond other youths and the
favoured of those whose hour of power is when the night meets with the
day

alas mother said mordaunt your kind gift may have given me favour
but it has not been able to keep it for me or i have not been able to
keep it for myself what matters it i shall learn to set as little by
others as they do by me my father says that i shall soon leave these
islands and therefore mother norna i will return to you your fairy
gift that it may bring more lasting luck to some other than it has done
to me

despise not the gift of the nameless race said norna frowning then
suddenly changing her tone of displeasure to that of mournful solemnity
she added despise them not but o mordaunt court them not sit down
on that grey stone thou art the son of my adoption and i will doff as
far as i may those attributes that sever me from the common mass of
humanity and speak with you as a parent with a child

there was a tremulous tone of grief which mingled with the loftiness of
her language and carriage and was calculated to excite sympathy as
well as to attract attention mordaunt sat down on the rock which she
pointed out a fragment which with many others that lay scattered
around had been torn by some winter storm from the precipice at the
foot of which it lay upon the very verge of the water norna took her
own seat on a stone at about three feet distance adjusted her mantle so
that little more than her forehead her eyes and a single lock of her
grey hair were seen from beneath the shade of her dark wadmaal cloak
and then proceeded in a tone in which the imaginary consequence and
importance so often assumed by lunacy seemed to contend against the
deep workings of some extraordinary and deeply-rooted mental affliction

i was not always she said that which i now am i was not always the
wise the powerful the commanding before whom the young stand abashed
and the old uncover their grey heads there was a time when my
appearance did not silence mirth when i sympathized with human passion
and had my own share in human joy or sorrow it was a time of
helplessness it was a time of folly it was a time of idle and
unfruitful laughter it was a time of causeless and senseless
tears and yet with its follies and its sorrows and its weaknesses
what would norna of fitful-head give to be again the unmarked and happy
maiden that she was in her early days hear me mordaunt and bear with
me for you hear me utter complaints which have never sounded in mortal
ears and which in mortal ears shall never sound again i will be what i
ought she continued starting up and extending her lean and withered
arm the queen and protectress of these wild and neglected isles i
will be her whose foot the wave wets not save by her permission ay
even though its rage be at its wildest madness whose robe the whirlwind
respects when it rends the house-rigging from the roof-tree bear me
witness mordaunt mertoun you heard my words at harfra you saw the
tempest sink before them speak bear me witness

to have contradicted her in this strain of high-toned enthusiasm would
have been cruel and unavailing even had mordaunt been more decidedly
convinced than he was that an insane woman not one of supernatural
power stood before him

i heard you sing he replied and i saw the tempest abate

abate exclaimed norna striking the ground impatiently with her staff
of black oak thou speakest it but half it sunk at once sunk in
shorter space than the child that is hushed to silence by the
nurse enough you know my power but you know not mortal man knows
not and never shall know the price which i paid to attain it no
mordaunt never for the widest sway that the ancient norsemen boasted
when their banners waved victorious from bergen to palestine never for
all that the round world contains do thou barter thy peace of mind for
such greatness as norna's she resumed her seat upon the rock drew the
mantle over her face rested her head upon her hands and by the
convulsive motion which agitated her bosom appeared to be weeping
bitterly

good norna said mordaunt and paused scarce knowing what to say that
might console the unhappy woman good norna he again resumed if
there be aught in your mind that troubles it were you not best to go to
the worthy minister at dunrossness men say you have not for many years
been in a christian congregation that cannot be well or right you are
yourself well known as a healer of bodily disease but when the mind is
sick we should draw to the physician of our souls

norna had raised her person slowly from the stooping posture in which
she sat but at length she started up on her feet threw back her
mantle extended her arm and while her lip foamed and her eye
sparkled exclaimed in a tone resembling a scream me did you
speak me did you bid seek out a priest would you kill the good man
with horror me in a christian congregation would you have the roof
to fall on the sackless assembly and mingle their blood with their
worship i i seek to the good physician would you have the fiend
claim his prey openly before god and man

the extreme agitation of the unhappy speaker naturally led mordaunt to
the conclusion which was generally adopted and accredited in that
superstitious country and period wretched woman he said if indeed
thou hast leagued thyself with the powers of evil why should you not
seek even yet for repentance but do as thou wilt i cannot dare not
as a christian abide longer with you and take again your gift he
said offering back the chain good can never come of it if indeed
evil hath not come already

be still and hear me thou foolish boy said norna calmly as if she
had been restored to reason by the alarm and horror which she perceived
in mordaunt's countenance hear me i say i am not of those who have
leagued themselves with the enemy of mankind or derive skill or power
from his ministry and although the unearthly powers were propitiated
by a sacrifice which human tongue can never utter yet god knows my
guilt in that offering was no more than that of the blind man who falls
from the precipice which he could neither see nor shun o leave me
not shun me not in this hour of weakness remain with me till the
temptation be passed or i will plunge myself into that lake and rid
myself at once of my power and my wretchedness

mordaunt who had always looked up to this singular woman with a sort of
affection occasioned no doubt by the early kindness and distinction
which she had shown to him was readily induced to reassume his seat
and listen to what she had further to say in hopes that she would
gradually overcome the violence of her agitation it was not long ere
she seemed to have gained the victory her companion expected for she
addressed him in her usual steady and authoritative manner

it was not of myself mordaunt that i purposed to speak when i beheld
you from the summit of yonder grey rock and came down the path to meet
with you my fortunes are fixed beyond change be it for weal or for
woe for myself i have ceased to feel much but for those whom she
loves norna of the fitful-head has still those feelings which link her
to her kind mark me there is an eagle the noblest that builds in
these airy precipices and into that eagle's nest there has crept an
adder wilt thou lend thy aid to crush the reptile and to save the
noble brood of the lord of the north sky

you must speak more plainly norna said mordaunt if you would have
me understand or answer you i am no guesser of riddles

in plain language then you know well the family of burgh-westra the
lovely daughters of the generous old udaller magnus troil minna and
brenda i mean you know them and you love them

i have known them mother replied mordaunt and i have loved
them none knows it better than yourself

to know them once said norna emphatically is to know them always
to love them once is to love them for ever

to have loved them once is to wish them well for ever replied the
youth but it is nothing more to be plain with you norna the family
at burgh-westra have of late totally neglected me but show me the means
of serving them i will convince you how much i have remembered old
kindness how little i resent late coldness

it is well spoken and i will put your purpose to the proof replied
norna magnus troil has taken a serpent into his bosom his lovely
daughters are delivered up to the machinations of a villain

you mean the stranger cleveland said mordaunt

the stranger who so calls himself replied norna the same whom we
found flung ashore like a waste heap of sea-weed at the foot of the
sumburgh-cape i felt that within me that would have prompted me to let
him lie till the tide floated him off as it had floated him on shore i
repent me i gave not way to it

but said mordaunt i cannot repent that i did my duty as a christian
man and what right have i to wish otherwise if minna brenda magnus
and the rest like that stranger better than me i have no title to be
offended nay i might well be laughed at for bringing myself into
comparison

it is well and i trust they merit thy unselfish friendship

but i cannot perceive said mordaunt in what you can propose that i
should serve them i have but just learned by bryce the jagger that
this captain cleveland is all in all with the ladies at burgh-westra
and with the udaller himself i would like ill to intrude myself where i
am not welcome or to place my home-bred merit in comparison with
captain cleveland's he can tell them of battles when i can only speak
of birds nests can speak of shooting frenchmen when i can only tell
of shooting seals he wears gay clothes and bears a brave countenance
i am plainly dressed and plainly nurtured such gay gallants as he can
noose the hearts of those he lives with as the fowler nooses the
guillemot with his rod and line

you do wrong to yourself replied norna wrong to yourself and
greater wrong to minna and brenda and trust not the reports of
bryce he is like the greedy chaffer-whale that will change his course
and dive for the most petty coin which a fisher can cast at him certain
it is that if you have been lessened in the opinion of magnus troil
that sordid fellow hath had some share in it but let him count his
vantage for my eye is upon him

and why mother said mordaunt do you not tell to magnus what you
have told to me

because replied norna they who wax wise in their own conceit must
be taught a bitter lesson by experience it was but yesterday that i
spoke with magnus and what was his reply good norna you grow old
and this was spoken by one bounden to me by so many and such close
ties by the descendant of the ancient norse earls this was from magnus
troil to me and it was said in behalf of one whom the sea flung forth
as wreck-weed since he despises the counsel of the aged he shall be
taught by that of the young and well that he is not left to his own
folly go therefore to burgh-westra as usual upon the baptist's
festival

i have had no invitation said mordaunt i am not wanted not wished
for not thought of perhaps i shall not be acknowledged if i go
thither and yet mother to confess the truth thither i had thought to
go

it was a good thought and to be cherished replied norna we seek
our friends when they are sick in health why not when they are sick in
mind and surfeited with prosperity do not fail to go it may be we
shall meet there meanwhile our roads lie different farewell and speak
not of this meeting

they parted and mordaunt remained standing by the lake with his eyes
fixed on norna until her tall dark form became invisible among the
windings of the valley down which she wandered and mordaunt returned to
his father's mansion determined to follow counsel which coincided so
well with his own wishes

the festal day approached and still no invitation arrived for that
guest without whom but a little space since no feast could have been
held in the island while on the other hand such reports as reached
them on every side spoke highly of the favour which captain cleveland
enjoyed in the good graces of the old udaller of burgh-westra swertha
and the ranzelman shook their heads at these mutations and reminded
mordaunt by many a half-hint and innuendo that he had incurred this
eclipse by being so imprudently active to secure the safety of the
stranger when he lay at the mercy of the next wave beneath the cliffs
of sumburgh-head it is best to let saut water take its gate said
swertha luck never came of crossing it

in troth said the ranzelman they are wise folks that let wave and
withy haud their ain luck never came of a half-drowned man or a
half-hanged ane either who was't shot will paterson off the noss the
dutchman that he saved from sinking i trow to fling a drowning man a
plank or a tow may be the part of a christian but i say keep hands
aff him if ye wad live and thrive free frae his danger

ye are a wise man ranzelman and a worthy echoed swertha with a
groan and ken how and whan to help a neighbour as well as ony man
that ever drew a net

in troth i have seen length of days answered the ranzelman and i
have heard what the auld folk said to each other anent sic matters and
nae man in zetland shall go farther than i will in any christian service
to a man on firm land but if he cry help out of the saut waves
that's another story

and yet to think of this lad cleveland standing in our maister
mordaunt's light said swertha and with magnus troil that thought
him the flower of the island but on whitsunday last and magnus too
that's both held when he's fresh honest man the wisest and wealthiest
of zetland

he canna win by it said the ranzelman with a look of the deepest
sagacity there's whiles swertha that the wisest of us as i am sure
i humbly confess mysell not to be may be little better than gulls and
can no more win by doing deeds of folly than i can step over
sumburgh-head it has been my own case once or twice in my life but we
shall see soon what ill is to come of all this for good there cannot
come

and swertha answered with the same tone of prophetic wisdom na na
gude can never come on it and that is ower truly said

these doleful predictions repeated from time to time had some effect
upon mordaunt he did not indeed suppose that the charitable action of
relieving a drowning man had subjected him as a necessary and fatal
consequence to the unpleasant circumstances in which he was placed yet
he felt as if a sort of spell were drawn around him of which he neither
understood the nature nor the extent that some power in short beyond
his own control was acting upon his destiny and as it seemed with no
friendly influence his curiosity as well as his anxiety was highly
excited and he continued determined at all events to make his
appearance at the approaching festival when he was impressed with the
belief that something uncommon was necessarily to take place which
should determine his future views and prospects in life

as the elder mertoun was at this time in his ordinary state of health
it became necessary that his son should intimate to him his intended
visit to burgh-westra he did so and his father desired to know the
especial reason of his going thither at this particular time

it is a time of merry-making replied the youth and all the country
are assembled

and you are doubtless impatient to add another fool to the
number go but beware how you walk in the path which you are about to
tread a fall from the cliffs of foulah were not more fatal

may i ask the reason of your caution sir replied mordaunt breaking
through the reserve which ordinarily subsisted betwixt him and his
singular parent

magnus troil said the elder mertoun has two daughters you are of
the age when men look upon such gauds with eyes of affection that they
may afterwards learn to curse the day that first opened their eyes upon
heaven i bid you beware of them for as sure as that death and sin
came into the world by woman so sure are their soft words and softer
looks the utter destruction and ruin of all who put faith in them

mordaunt had sometimes observed his father's marked dislike to the
female sex but had never before heard him give vent to it in terms so
determined and precise he replied that the daughters of magnus troil
were no more to him than any other females in the islands they were
even of less importance he said for they had broken off their
friendship with him without assigning any cause

and you go to seek the renewal of it answered his father silly
moth that hast once escaped the taper without singeing thy wings are
you not contented with the safe obscurity of these wilds but must
hasten back to the flame which is sure at length to consume thee but
why should i waste arguments in deterring thee from thy inevitable
fate go where thy destiny calls thee

on the succeeding day which was the eve of the great festival mordaunt
set forth on his road to burgh-westra pondering alternately on the
injunctions of norna on the ominous words of his father on the
inauspicious auguries of swertha and the ranzelman of jarlshof and not
without experiencing that gloom with which so many concurring
circumstances of ill omen combined to oppress his mind

it bodes me but a cold reception at burgh-westra said he but my
stay shall be the shorter i will but find out whether they have been
deceived by this seafaring stranger or whether they have acted out of
pure caprice of temper and love of change of company if the first be
the case i will vindicate my character and let captain cleveland look
to himself if the latter why then good-night to burgh-westra and
all its inmates

as he mentally meditated this last alternative hurt pride and a return
of fondness for those to whom he supposed he was bidding farewell for
ever brought a tear into his eye which he dashed off hastily and
indignantly as mending his pace he continued on his journey

the weather being now serene and undisturbed mordaunt made his way with
an ease that formed a striking contrast to the difficulties which he had
encountered when he last travelled the same route yet there was a less
pleasing subject for comparison within his own mind

my breast he said to himself was then against the wind but my
heart within was serene and happy i would i had now the same careless
feelings were they to be bought by battling with the severest storm
that ever blew across these lonely hills

with such thoughts he arrived about noon at harfra the habitation as
the reader may remember of the ingenious mr yellowley our traveller
had upon the present occasion taken care to be quite independent of
the niggardly hospitality of this mansion which was now become infamous
on that account through the whole island by bringing with him in his
small knapsack such provisions as might have sufficed for a longer
journey in courtesy however or rather perhaps to get rid of his own
disquieting thoughts mordaunt did not fail to call at the mansion
which he found in singular commotion triptolemus himself invested
with a pair of large jack-boots went clattering up and down stairs
screaming out questions to his sister and his serving-woman tronda who
replied with shriller and more complicated screeches at length mrs
baby herself made her appearance her venerable person endued with what
was then called a joseph an ample garment which had once been green
but now betwixt stains and patches had become like the vesture of the
patriarch whose name it bore a garment of divers colours a
steeple-crowned hat the purchase of some long-past moment in which
vanity had got the better of avarice with a feather which had stood as
much wind and rain as if it had been part of a seamew's wing made up
her equipment save that in her hand she held a silver-mounted whip of
antique fashion this attire as well as an air of determined bustle in
the gait and appearance of mrs barbara yellowley seemed to bespeak
that she was prepared to take a journey and cared not as the saying
goes who knew that such was her determination

she was the first that observed mordaunt on his arrival and she greeted
him with a degree of mingled emotion be good to us she exclaimed
if here is not the canty callant that wears yon thing about his neck
and that snapped up our goose as light as if it had been a
sandie-lavrock the admiration of the gold chain which had formerly
made so deep an impression on her mind was marked in the first part of
her speech the recollection of the untimely fate of the smoked goose
was commemorated in the second clause i will lay the burden of my
life she instantly added that he is ganging our gate

i am bound for burgh-westra mrs yellowley said mordaunt

and blithe will we be of your company she added it's early day to
eat but if you liked a barley scone and a drink of bland natheless it
is ill travelling on a full stomach besides quelling your appetite for
the feast that is biding you this day for all sort of prodigality there
will doubtless be

mordaunt produced his own stores and explaining that he did not love
to be burdensome to them on this second occasion invited them to
partake of the provisions he had to offer poor triptolemus who seldom
saw half so good a dinner as his guest's luncheon threw himself upon
the good cheer like sancho on the scum of camacho's kettle and even
the lady herself could not resist the temptation though she gave way to
it with more moderation and with something like a sense of shame she
had let the fire out she said for it was a pity wasting fuel in so
cold a country and so she had not thought of getting any thing ready
as they were to set out so soon and so she could not but say that the
young gentleman's nacket looked very good and besides she had some
curiosity to see whether the folks in that country cured their beef in
the same way they did in the north of scotland under which combined
considerations dame baby made a hearty experiment on the refreshments
which thus unexpectedly presented themselves

when their extemporary repast was finished the factor became solicitous
to take the road and now mordaunt discovered that the alacrity with
which he had been received by mistress baby was not altogether
disinterested neither she nor the learned triptolemus felt much
disposed to commit themselves to the wilds of zetland without the
assistance of a guide and although they could have commanded the aid of
one of their own labouring folks yet the cautious agriculturist
observed that it would be losing at least one day's work and his
sister multiplied his apprehensions by echoing back one day's
work ye may weel say twenty for set ane of their noses within the
smell of a kail-pot and their lugs within the sound of a fiddle and
whistle them back if ye can

now the fortunate arrival of mordaunt in the very nick of time not to
mention the good cheer which he brought with him made him as welcome as
any one could possibly be to a threshold which on all ordinary
occasions abhorred the passage of a guest nor was mr yellowley
altogether insensible of the pleasure he promised himself in detailing
his plans of improvement to his young companion and enjoying what his
fate seldom assigned him the company of a patient and admiring
listener

as the factor and his sister were to prosecute their journey on
horseback it only remained to mount their guide and companion a thing
easily accomplished where there are such numbers of shaggy
long-backed short-legged ponies running wild upon the extensive moors
which are the common pasturage for the cattle of every township where
shelties geese swine goats sheep and little zetland cows are
turned out promiscuously and often in numbers which can obtain but
precarious subsistence from the niggard vegetation there is indeed a
right of individual property in all these animals which are branded or
tattooed by each owner with his own peculiar mark but when any
passenger has occasional use for a pony he never scruples to lay hold
of the first which he can catch puts on a halter and having rode him
as far as he finds convenient turns the animal loose to find his way
back again as he best can a matter in which the ponies are sufficiently
sagacious

although this general exercise of property was one of the enormities
which in due time the factor intended to abolish yet like a wise man
he scrupled not in the meantime to avail himself of so general a
practice which he condescended to allow was particularly convenient
for those who as chanced to be his own present case had no ponies of
their own on which their neighbours could retaliate three shelties
therefore were procured from the hill little shagged animals more
resembling wild bears than any thing of the horse tribe yet possessed
of no small degree of strength and spirit and able to endure as much
fatigue and indifferent usage as any creatures in the world

two of these horses were already provided and fully accoutred for the
journey one of them destined to bear the fair person of mistress baby
was decorated with a huge side-saddle of venerable antiquity a mass as
it were of cushion and padding from which depended on all sides a
housing of ancient tapestry which having been originally intended for
a horse of ordinary size covered up the diminutive palfrey over which
it was spread from the ears to the tail and from the shoulder to the
fetlock leaving nothing visible but its head which looked fiercely out
from these enfoldments like the heraldic representation of a lion
looking out of a bush mordaunt gallantly lifted up the fair mistress
yellowley and at the expense of very slight exertion placed her upon
the summit of her mountainous saddle it is probable that on feeling
herself thus squired and attended upon and experiencing the long
unwonted consciousness that she was attired in her best array some
thoughts dawned upon mistress baby's mind which checkered for an
instant those habitual ideas about thrift that formed the daily and
all-engrossing occupation of her soul she glanced her eye upon her
faded joseph and on the long housings of her saddle as she observed
with a smile to mordaunt that travelling was a pleasant thing in fine
weather and agreeable company if she added glancing a look at a
place where the embroidery was somewhat frayed and tattered it was not
sae wasteful to ane's horse-furniture

meanwhile her brother stepped stoutly to his steed and as he chose
notwithstanding the serenity of the weather to throw a long red cloak
over his other garments his pony was even more completely enveloped in
drapery than that of his sister it happened moreover to be an animal
of an high and contumacious spirit bouncing and curvetting occasionally
under the weight of triptolemus with a vivacity which notwithstanding
his yorkshire descent rather deranged him in the saddle gambols which
as the palfrey itself was not visible except upon the strictest
inspection had at a little distance an effect as if they were the
voluntary movements of the cloaked cavalier without the assistance of
any other legs than those with which nature had provided him and to
any who had viewed triptolemus under such a persuasion the gravity and
even distress announced in his countenance must have made a ridiculous
contrast to the vivacious caprioles with which he piaffed along the
moor

mordaunt kept up with this worthy couple mounted according to the
simplicity of the time and country on the first and readiest pony which
they had been able to press into the service with no other accoutrement
of any kind than the halter which served to guide him while mr
yellowley seeing with pleasure his guide thus readily provided with a
steed privately resolved that this rude custom of helping travellers
to horses without leave of the proprietor should not be abated in
zetland until he came to possess a herd of ponies belonging in property
to himself and exposed to suffer in the way of retaliation

but to other uses or abuses of the country triptolemus yellowley showed
himself less tolerant long and wearisome were the discourses he held
with mordaunt or to speak much more correctly the harangues which he
inflicted upon him concerning the changes which his own advent in these
isles was about to occasion unskilled as he was in the modern arts by
which an estate may be improved to such a high degree that it shall
altogether slip through the proprietor's fingers triptolemus had at
least the zeal if not the knowledge of a whole agricultural society in
his own person nor was he surpassed by any who has followed him in
that noble spirit which scorns to balance profit against outlay but
holds the glory of effecting a great change on the face of the land to
be like virtue in a great degree its own reward

no part of the wild and mountainous region over which mordaunt guided
him but what suggested to his active imagination some scheme of
improvement and alteration he would make a road through yon scarce
passable glen where at present nothing but the sure-footed creatures on
which they were mounted could tread with any safety he would substitute
better houses for the skeoes or sheds built of dry stones in which the
inhabitants cured or manufactured their fish they should brew good ale
instead of bland they should plant forests where tree never grew and
find mines of treasure where a danish skilling was accounted a coin of a
most respectable denomination all these mutations with many others
did the worthy factor resolve upon speaking at the same time with the
utmost confidence of the countenance and assistance which he was to
receive from the higher classes and especially from magnus troil

i will impart some of my ideas to the poor man he said before we
are both many hours older and you will mark how grateful he will be to
the instructor who brings him knowledge which is better than wealth

i would not have you build too strongly on that said mordaunt by way
of caution magnus troil's boat is kittle to trim he likes his own
ways and his country-ways and you will as soon teach your sheltie to
dive like a sealgh as bring magnus to take a scottish fashion in the
place of a norse one and yet if he is steady to his old customs he
may perhaps be as changeable as another in his old friendships

heus tu inepte said the scholar of saint andrews steady or
unsteady what can it matter am not i here in point of trust and in
point of power and shall a fowd by which barbarous appellative this
magnus troil still calls himself presume to measure judgment and weigh
reasons with me who represent the full dignity of the chamberlain of
the islands of orkney and zetland

still said mordaunt i would advise you not to advance too rashly
upon his prejudices magnus troil from the hour of his birth to this
day never saw a greater man than himself and it is difficult to bridle
an old horse for the first time besides he has at no time in his life
been a patient listener to long explanations so it is possible that he
may quarrel with your purposed reformation before you can convince him
of its advantages

how mean you young man said the factor is there one who dwells in
these islands who is so wretchedly blind as not to be sensible of their
deplorable defects can a man he added rising into enthusiasm as he
spoke or even a beast look at that thing there which they have the
impudence to call a corn-mill without trembling to think that corn
should be intrusted to such a miserable molendinary the wretches are
obliged to have at least fifty in each parish each trundling away upon
its paltry mill-stone under the thatch of a roof no bigger than a
bee-skep instead of a noble and seemly baron's mill of which you would
hear the clack through the haill country and that casts the meal
through the mill-eye by forpits at a time

ay ay brother said his sister that's spoken like your wise sell
the mair cost the mair honour that's your word ever mair can it no
creep into your wise head man that ilka body grinds their ain nievefu
of meal in this country without plaguing themsells about barons mills
and thirls and sucken and the like trade how mony a time have i
heard you bell-the-cat with auld edie netherstane the miller at
grindleburn and wi his very knave too about in-town and out-town
multures lock gowpen and knaveshipi and a the lave o't and now
naething less will serve you than to bring in the very same fashery on a
wheen puir bodies that big ilk ane a mill for themselves sic as it
is

dinna tell me of gowpen and knaveship exclaimed the indignant
agriculturist better pay the half of the grist to the miller to have
the rest grund in a christian manner than put good grain into a bairn's
whirligig look at it for a moment baby bide still ye cursed imp
this interjection was applied to his pony which began to be extremely
impatient while its rider interrupted his journey to point out
all the weak points of the zetland mill look at it i say it's
just one degree better than a hand-quern it has neither wheel nor
trindle neither cog nor happer bide still there's a canny
beast it canna grind a bickerfu of meal in a quarter of an hour
and that will be mair like a mash for horse than a meltith for man's
use wherefore bide still i say wherefore wherefore the deil's in
the beast and nae good i think

as he uttered the last words the shelty which had pranced and
curvetted for some time with much impatience at length got its head
betwixt its legs and at once canted its rider into the little rivulet
which served to drive the depreciated engine he was surveying then
emancipating itself from the folds of the cloak fled back towards its
own wilderness neighing in scorn and flinging out its heels at every
five yards

laughing heartily at his disaster mordaunt helped the old man to arise
while his sister sarcastically congratulated him on having fallen rather
into the shallows of a zetland rivulet than the depths of a scottish
mill-pond disdaining to reply to this sarcasm triptolemus so soon as
he had recovered his legs shaken his ears and found that the folds of
his cloak had saved him from being much wet in the scanty streamlet
exclaimed aloud i will have cussers from lanarkshire brood mares from
ayrshire i will not have one of these cursed abortions left on the
islands to break honest folk's necks i say baby i will rid the land
of them

ye had better wring your ain cloak triptolemus answered baby

mordaunt meanwhile was employed in catching another pony from a herd
which strayed at some distance and having made a halter out of twisted
rushes he seated the dismayed agriculturist in safety upon a more
quiet though less active steed than that which he had at first
bestrode

but mr yellowley's fall had operated as a considerable sedative upon
his spirits and for the full space of five miles travel he said
scarce a word leaving full course to the melancholy aspirations and
lamentations which his sister baby bestowed on the old bridle which the
pony had carried off in its flight and which she observed after
having lasted for eighteen years come martinmas might now be considered
as a castaway thing finding she had thus the field to herself the old
lady launched forth into a lecture upon economy according to her own
idea of that virtue which seemed to include a system of privations
which though observed with the sole purpose of saving money might if
undertaken upon other principles have ranked high in the history of a
religious ascetic

she was but little interrupted by mordaunt who conscious he was now on
the eve of approaching burgh-westra employed himself rather in the task
of anticipating the nature of the reception he was about to meet with
there from two beautiful young women than with the prosing of an old
one however wisely she might prove that small-beer was more wholesome
than strong ale and that if her brother had bruised his ankle bone in
his tumble cumfrey and butter was better to bring him round again than
all the doctor's drugs in the world

but now the dreary moorlands over which their path had hitherto lain
were exchanged for a more pleasant prospect opening on a salt-water
lake or arm of the sea which ran up far inland and was surrounded by
flat and fertile ground producing crops better than the experienced eye
of triptolemus yellowley had as yet witnessed in zetland in the midst
of this goshen stood the mansion of burgh-westra screened from the
north and east by a ridge of heathy hills which lay behind it and
commanding an interesting prospect of the lake and its parent ocean as
well as the islands and more distant mountains from the mansion
itself as well as from almost every cottage in the adjacent hamlet
arose such a rich cloud of vapoury smoke as showed that the
preparations for the festival were not confined to the principal
residence of magnus himself but extended through the whole vicinage

my certie said mrs baby yellowley ane wad think the haill town was
on fire the very hill-side smells of their wastefulness and a hungry
heart wad scarce seek better kitchen to a barley scone than just
to waft it in the reek that's rising out of yon lums

chapter xii

   thou hast described
 a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius
 when love begins to sicken and decay
 it useth an enforced ceremony
 there are no tricks in plain and simple faith

 julius cæsar


if the smell which was wafted from the chimneys of burgh-westra up to
the barren hills by which the mansion was surrounded could as mistress
barbara opined have refreshed the hungry the noise which proceeded
from thence might have given hearing to the deaf it was a medley of all
sounds and all connected with jollity and kind welcome nor were the
sights associated with them less animating

troops of friends were seen in the act of arriving their dispersed
ponies flying to the moors in every direction to recover their own
pastures in the best way they could such as we have already said
being the usual mode of discharging the cavalry which had been levied
for a day's service at a small but commodious harbour connected with
the house and hamlet those visitors were landing from their boats who
living in distant islands and along the coast had preferred making
their journey by sea mordaunt and his companions might see each party
pausing frequently to greet each other and strolling on successively to
the house whose ever open gate received them alternately in such
numbers that it seemed the extent of the mansion though suited to the
opulence and hospitality of the owner was scarce on this occasion
sufficient for the guests

among the confused sounds of mirth and welcome which arose at the
entrance of each new company mordaunt thought he could distinguish the
loud laugh and hearty salutation of the sire of the mansion and began
to feel more deeply than before the anxious doubt whether that cordial
reception which was distributed so freely to all others would be on
this occasion extended to him as they came on they heard the voluntary
scrapings and bravura effusions of the gallant fiddlers who impatiently
flung already from their bows those sounds with which they were to
animate the evening the clamour of the cook's assistants and the loud
scolding tones of the cook himself were also to be heard sounds of
dissonance at any other time but which subdued with others and by
certain happy associations form no disagreeable part of the full chorus
which always precedes a rural feast

meanwhile the guests advanced each full of their own thoughts
mordaunt's we have already noticed baby was wrapt up in the melancholy
grief and surprise excited by the positive conviction that so much
victuals had been cooked at once as were necessary to feed all the
mouths which were clamouring around her an enormity of expense which
though she was no way concerned in bearing it affected her nerves as
the beholding a massacre would touch those of the most indifferent
spectator however well assured of his own personal safety she
sickened in short at the sight of so much extravagance like
abyssinian bruce when he saw the luckless minstrels of gondar hacked to
pieces by the order of ras michael as for her brother they being now
arrived where the rude and antique instruments of zetland agriculture
lay scattered in the usual confusion of a scottish barn-yard his
thoughts were at once engrossed in the deficiencies of the one-stilted
plough of the twiscar with which they dig peats of the sledges on
which they transport commodities of all and every thing in short in
which the usages of the islands differed from those of the mainland of
scotland the sight of these imperfect instruments stirred the blood of
triptolemus yellowley as that of the bold warrior rises at seeing the
arms and insignia of the enemy he is about to combat and faithful to
his high emprise he thought less of the hunger which his journey had
occasioned although about to be satisfied by such a dinner as rarely
fell to his lot than upon the task which he had undertaken of
civilizing the manners and improving the cultivation of zetland

jacta est alea he muttered to himself this very day shall prove
whether the zetlanders are worthy of our labours or whether their minds
are as incapable of cultivation as their peat-mosses yet let us be
cautious and watch the soft time of speech i feel by my own
experience that it were best to let the body in its present state
take the place of the mind a mouthful of that same roast-beef which
smells so delicately will form an apt introduction to my grand plan for
improving the breed of stock

by this time the visitors had reached the low but ample front of magnus
troil's residence which seemed of various dates with large and
ill-imagined additions hastily adapted to the original building as the
increasing estate or enlarged family of successive proprietors
appeared to each to demand beneath a low broad and large porch
supported by two huge carved posts once the head-ornaments of vessels
which had found shipwreck upon the coast stood magnus himself intent
on the hospitable toil of receiving and welcoming the numerous guests
who successively approached his strong portly figure was well adapted
to the dress which he wore a blue coat of an antique cut lined with
scarlet and laced and looped with gold down the seams and button-holes
and along the ample cuffs strong and masculine features rendered ruddy
and brown by frequent exposure to severe weather a quantity of most
venerable silver hair which fell in unshorn profusion from under his
gold-laced hat and was carelessly tied with a ribbon behind expressed
at once his advanced age his hasty yet well-conditioned temper and
his robust constitution as our travellers approached him a shade of
displeasure seemed to cross his brow and to interrupt for an instant
the honest and hearty burst of hilarity with which he had been in the
act of greeting all prior arrivals when he approached triptolemus
yellowley he drew himself up so as to mix as it were some share of
the stately importance of the opulent udaller with the welcome afforded
by the frank and hospitable landlord

you are welcome mr yellowley was his address to the factor you
are welcome to westra the wind has blown you on a rough coast and we
that are the natives must be kind to you as we can this i believe is
your sister mistress barbara yellowley permit me the honour of a
neighbourly salute and so saying with a daring and self-devoted
courtesy which would find no equal in our degenerate days he actually
ventured to salute the withered cheek of the spinster who relaxed so
much of her usual peevishness of expression as to receive the courtesy
with something which approached to a smile he then looked full at
mordaunt mertoun and without offering his hand said in a tone
somewhat broken by suppressed agitation you too are welcome master
mordaunt

did i not think so said mordaunt naturally offended by the coldness
of his host's manner i had not been here and it is not yet too late
to turn back

young man replied magnus you know better than most that from these
doors no man can turn without an offence to their owner i pray you
disturb not my guests by your ill-timed scruples when magnus troil says
welcome all are welcome who are within hearing of his voice and it is
an indifferent loud one walk on my worthy guests and let us see what
cheer my lasses can make you within doors

so saying and taking care to make his manner so general to the whole
party that mordaunt should not be able to appropriate any particular
portion of the welcome to himself nor yet to complain of being excluded
from all share in it the udaller ushered the guests into his house
where two large outer rooms which on the present occasion served the
purpose of a modern saloon were already crowded with guests of every
description

the furniture was sufficiently simple and had a character peculiar to
the situation of those stormy islands magnus troil was indeed like
most of the higher class of zetland proprietors a friend to the
distressed traveller whether by sea or land and had repeatedly exerted
his whole authority in protecting the property and persons of
shipwrecked mariners yet so frequent were wrecks upon that tremendous
coast and so many unappropriated articles were constantly flung ashore
that the interior of the house bore sufficient witness to the ravages of
the ocean and to the exercise of those rights which the lawyers term
flotsome and jetsome the chairs which were arranged around the
walls were such as are used in cabins and many of them were of foreign
construction the mirrors and cabinets which were placed against the
walls for ornament or convenience had it was plain from their form
been constructed for ship-board and one or two of the latter were of
strange and unknown wood even the partition which separated the two
apartments seemed constructed out of the bulkhead of some large vessel
clumsily adapted to the service which it at present performed by the
labour of some native joiner to a stranger these evident marks and
tokens of human misery might at the first glance form a contrast with
the scene of mirth with which they were now associated but the
association was so familiar to the natives that it did not for a moment
interrupt the course of their glee

to the younger part of these revellers the presence of mordaunt was like
a fresh charm of enjoyment all came around him to marvel at his
absence and all by their repeated enquiries plainly showed that they
conceived it had been entirely voluntary on his side the youth felt
that this general acceptation relieved his anxiety on one painful point
whatever prejudice the family of burgh-westra might have adopted
respecting him it must be of a private nature and at least he had not
the additional pain of finding that he was depreciated in the eyes of
society at large and his vindication when he found opportunity to make
one would not require to be extended beyond the circle of a single
family this was consoling though his heart still throbbed with anxiety
at the thought of meeting with his estranged but still beloved friends
laying the excuse of his absence on his father's state of health he
made his way through the various groups of friends and guests each of
whom seemed willing to detain him as long as possible and having by
presenting them to one or two families of consequence got rid of his
travelling companions who at first stuck fast as burs he reached at
length the door of a small apartment which opening from one of the
large exterior rooms we have mentioned minna and brenda had been
permitted to fit up after their own taste and to call their peculiar
property

mordaunt had contributed no small share of the invention and mechanical
execution employed in fitting up this favourite apartment and in
disposing its ornaments it was indeed during his last residence at
burgh-westra as free to his entrance and occupation as to its proper
mistresses but now so much were times altered that he remained with
his finger on the latch uncertain whether he should take the freedom to
draw it until brenda's voice pronounced the words come in then in
the tone of one who is interrupted by an unwelcome disturber who is to
be heard and dispatched with all the speed possible

at this signal mertoun entered the fanciful cabinet of the sisters
which by the addition of many ornaments including some articles of
considerable value had been fitted up for the approaching festival the
daughters of magnus at the moment of mordaunt's entrance were seated
in deep consultation with the stranger cleveland and with a little
slight-made old man whose eye retained all the vivacity of spirit
which had supported him under the thousand vicissitudes of a changeful
and precarious life and which accompanying him in his old age
rendered his grey hairs less awfully reverend perhaps but not less
beloved than would a more grave and less imaginative expression of
countenance and character there was even a penetrating shrewdness
mingled in the look of curiosity with which as he stepped for an
instant aside he seemed to watch the meeting of mordaunt with the two
lovely sisters

the reception the youth met with resembled in general character that
which he had experienced from magnus himself but the maidens could not
so well cover their sense of the change of circumstances under which
they met both blushed as rising and without extending the hand far
less offering the cheek as the fashion of the times permitted and
almost exacted they paid to mordaunt the salutation due to an ordinary
acquaintance but the blush of the elder was one of those transient
evidences of flitting emotion that vanish as fast as the passing
thought which excites them in an instant she stood before the youth
calm and cold returning with guarded and cautious courtesy the usual
civilities which with a faltering voice mordaunt endeavoured to
present to her the emotion of brenda bore externally at least a
deeper and more agitating character her blush extended over every part
of her beautiful skin which her dress permitted to be visible including
her slender neck and the upper region of a finely formed bosom
neither did she even attempt to reply to what share of his confused
compliment mordaunt addressed to her in particular but regarded him
with eyes in which displeasure was evidently mingled with feelings of
regret and recollections of former times mordaunt felt as it were
assured upon the instant that the regard of minna was extinguished but
that it might be yet possible to recover that of the milder brenda and
such is the waywardness of human fancy that though he had never
hitherto made any distinct difference betwixt these two beautiful and
interesting girls the favour of her which seemed most absolutely
withdrawn became at the moment the most interesting in his eyes

he was disturbed in these hasty reflections by cleveland who advanced
with military frankness to pay his compliments to his preserver having
only delayed long enough to permit the exchange of the ordinary
salutation betwixt the visitor and the ladies of the family he made his
approach with so good a grace that it was impossible for mordaunt
although he dated his loss of favour at burgh-westra from this
stranger's appearance on the coast and domestication in the family to
do less than return his advances as courtesy demanded accept his thanks
with an appearance of satisfaction and hope that his time had past
pleasantly since their last meeting

cleveland was about to answer when he was anticipated by the little old
man formerly noticed who now thrusting himself forward and seizing
mordaunt's hand kissed him on the forehead and then at the same time
echoed and answered his question how passes time at burgh-westra was
it you that asked it my prince of the cliff and of the scaur how
should it pass but with all the wings that beauty and joy can add to
help its flight

and wit and song too my good old friend said mordaunt
half-serious half-jesting as he shook the old man cordially by the
hand these cannot be wanting where claud halcro comes

jeer me not mordaunt my good lad replied the old man when your
foot is as slow as mine your wit frozen and your song out of tune  

how can you belie yourself my good master answered mordaunt who was
not unwilling to avail himself of his old friend's peculiarities to
introduce something like conversation break the awkwardness of this
singular meeting and gain time for observation ere requiring an
explanation of the change of conduct which the family seemed to have
adopted towards him say not so he continued time my old friend
lays his hand lightly on the bard have i not heard you say the poet
partakes the immortality of his song and surely the great english poet
you used to tell us of was elder than yourself when he pulled the
bow-oar among all the wits of london

this alluded to a story which was as the french term it halcro's
cheval de bataille and any allusion to which was certain at once to
place him in the saddle and to push his hobby-horse into full career

his laughing eye kindled with a sort of enthusiasm which the ordinary
folk of this world might have called crazed while he dashed into the
subject which he best loved to talk upon alas alas my dear mordaunt
mertoun silver is silver and waxes not dim by use and pewter is
pewter and grows the longer the duller it is not for poor claud halcro
to name himself in the same twelvemonth with the immortal john dryden
true it is as i may have told you before that i have seen that great
man nay i have been in the wits coffeehouse as it was then called
and had once a pinch out of his own very snuff-box i must have told you
all how it happened but here is captain cleveland who never heard
it i lodged you must know in russel street i question not but you
know russel street covent garden captain cleveland

i should know its latitude pretty well mr halcro said the captain
smiling but i believe you mentioned the circumstance yesterday and
besides we have the day's duty in hand you must play us this song which
we are to study

it will not serve the turn now said halcro we must think of
something that will take in our dear mordaunt the first voice in the
island whether for a part or solo i will never be he will touch a
string to you unless mordaunt mertoun is to help us out what say you
my fairest night what think you my sweet dawn of day he added
addressing the young women upon whom as we have said elsewhere he had
long before bestowed these allegorical names

mr mordaunt mertoun said minna has come too late to be of our band
on this occasion it is our misfortune but it cannot be helped

how what said halcro hastily too late and you have practised
together all your lives take my word my bonny lasses that old tunes
are sweetest and old friends surest mr cleveland has a fine bass
that must be allowed but i would have you trust for the first effect to
one of the twenty fine airs you can sing where mordaunt's tenor joins so
well with your own witchery here is my lovely day approves of the
change in her heart

you were never in your life more mistaken father halcro said brenda
her cheeks again reddening more with displeasure it seemed than with
shame

nay but how is this said the old man pausing and looking at them
alternately what have we got here a cloudy night and a red
morning that betokens rough weather what means all this young
women where lies the offence in me i fear for the blame is always
laid upon the oldest when young folk like you go by the ears

the blame is not with you father halcro said minna rising and
taking her sister by the arm if indeed there be blame anywhere

i should fear then minna said mordaunt endeavouring to soften his
tone into one of indifferent pleasantry that the new comer has brought
the offence along with him

when no offence is taken replied minna with her usual gravity it
matters not by whom such may have been offered

is it possible minna exclaimed mordaunt and is it you who speak
thus to me and you too brenda can you too judge so hardly of me yet
without permitting me one moment of honest and frank explanation

those who should know best answered brenda in a low but decisive
tone of voice have told us their pleasure and it must be
done sister i think we have staid too long here and shall be wanted
elsewhere mr mertoun will excuse us on so busy a day

the sisters linked their arms together halcro in vain endeavoured to
stop them making at the same time a theatrical gesture and
exclaiming

 now day and night but this is wondrous strange

then turned to mordaunt mertoun and added the girls are possessed
with the spirit of mutability showing as our master spenser well
saith that

 among all living creatures more or lesse
 change still doth reign and keep the greater sway

captain cleveland he continued know you any thing that has happened
to put these two juvenile graces out of tune

he will lose his reckoning answered cleveland that spends time in
enquiring why the wind shifts a point or why a woman changes her mind
were i mr mordaunt i would not ask the proud wenches another question
on such a subject

it is a friendly advice captain cleveland replied mordaunt and i
will not hold it the less so that it has been given unasked allow me to
enquire if you are yourself as indifferent to the opinion of your female
friends as it seems you would have me to be

who i said the captain with an air of frank indifference i never
thought twice upon such a subject i never saw a woman worth thinking
twice about after the anchor was a-peak on shore it is another thing
and i will laugh sing dance and make love if they like it with
twenty girls were they but half so pretty as those who have left us
and make them heartily welcome to change their course in the sound of a
boatswain's whistle it will be odds but i wear as fast as they can

a patient is seldom pleased with that sort of consolation which is
founded on holding light the malady of which he complains and mordaunt
felt disposed to be offended with captain cleveland both for taking
notice of his embarrassment and intruding upon him his own opinion and
he replied therefore somewhat sharply that captain cleveland's
sentiments were only suited to such as had the art to become universal
favourites wherever chance happened to throw them and who could not
lose in one place more than their merit was sure to gain for them in
another

this was spoken ironically but there was to confess the truth a
superior knowledge of the world and a consciousness of external merit
at least about the man which rendered his interference doubly
disagreeable as sir lucius o'trigger says there was an air of success
about captain cleveland which was mighty provoking young handsome and
well assured his air of nautical bluntness sat naturally and easily
upon him and was perhaps particularly well fitted to the simple manners
of the remote country in which he found himself and where even in the
best families a greater degree of refinement might have rendered his
conversation rather less acceptable he was contented in the present
instance to smile good-humouredly at the obvious discontent of mordaunt
mertoun and replied you are angry with me my good friend but you
cannot make me angry with you the fair hands of all the pretty women i
ever saw in my life would never have fished me up out of the roost of
sumburgh so pray do not quarrel with me for here is mr halcro
witness that i have struck both jack and topsail and should you fire a
broadside into me cannot return a single shot

ay ay said halcro you must be friends with captain cleveland
mordaunt never quarrel with your friend because a woman is whimsical
why man if they kept one humour how the devil could we make so many
songs on them as we do even old dryden himself glorious old john
could have said little about a girl that was always of one mind as well
write verses upon a mill-pond it is your tides and your roosts and
your currents and eddies that come and go and ebb and flow by
heaven i run into rhyme when i so much as think upon them that smile
one day rage the next flatter and devour delight and ruin us and so
forth it is these that give the real soul of poetry did you never hear
my adieu to the lass of northmaven that was poor bet stimbister whom i
call mary for the sound's sake as i call myself hacon after my great
ancestor hacon goldemund or haco with the golden mouth who came to the
island with harold harfager and was his chief scald well but where
was i o ay poor bet stimbister she and partly some debt was the
cause of my leaving the isles of hialtland better so called than
shetland or zetland even and taking to the broad world i have had a
tramp of it since that time i have battled my way through the world
captain as a man of mold may that has a light head a light purse and
a heart as light as them both fought my way and paid my way that is
either with money or wit have seen kings changed and deposed as you
would turn a tenant out of a scathold knew all the wits of the age and
especially the glorious john dryden what man in the islands can say as
much barring lying i had a pinch out of his own snuff-box i will
tell you how i came by such promotion

but the song mr halcro said captain cleveland

the song answered halcro seizing the captain by the button for he
was too much accustomed to have his audience escape from him during
recitation not to put in practice all the usual means of
prevention the song why i gave a copy of it with fifteen others to
the immortal john you shall hear it you shall hear them all if you
will but stand still a moment and you too my dear boy mordaunt
mertoun i have scarce heard a word from your mouth these six months
and now you are running away from me so saying he secured him with
his other hand

nay now he has got us both in tow said the seaman there is nothing
for it but hearing him out though he spins as tough a yarn as ever an
old man-of-war's-man twisted on the watch at midnight

nay now be silent be silent and let one of us speak at once said
the poet imperatively while cleveland and mordaunt looking at each
other with a ludicrous expression of resignation to their fate waited
in submission for the well-known and inevitable tale i will tell you
all about it continued halcro i was knocked about the world like
other young fellows doing this that and t'other for a livelihood
for thank god i could turn my hand to any thing but loving still the
muses as much as if the ungrateful jades had found me like so many
blockheads in my own coach and six however i held out till my cousin
old lawrence linkletter died and left me the bit of an island yonder
although by the way cultmalindie was as near to him as i was but
lawrence loved wit though he had little of his own well he left me
the wee bit island it is as barren as parnassus itself what then i
have a penny to spend a penny to keep my purse a penny to give to the
poor ay and a bed and a bottle for a friend as you shall know boys
if you will go back with me when this merriment is over but where was
i in my story

near port i hope answered cleveland but halcro was too determined a
narrator to be interrupted by the broadest hint

o ay he resumed with the self-satisfied air of one who has recovered
the thread of a story i was in my old lodgings in russel street with
old timothy thimblethwaite the master fashioner then the best-known
man about town he made for all the wits and for the dull boobies of
fortune besides and made the one pay for the other he never denied a
wit credit save in jest or for the sake of getting a repartee and he
was in correspondence with all that was worth knowing about town he had
letters from crowne and tate and prior and tom brown and all the
famous fellows of the time with such pellets of wit that there was no
reading them without laughing ready to die and all ending with craving
a further term for payment

i should have thought the tailor would have found that jest rather
serious said mordaunt

not a bit not a bit replied his eulogist tim thimblethwaite he
was a cumberland-man by birth had the soul of a prince ay and died
with the fortune of one for woe betide the custard-gorged alderman that
came under tim's goose after he had got one of those letters egad he
was sure to pay the kain why thimblethwaite was thought to be the
original of little tom bibber in glorious john's comedy of the wild
gallant and i know that he has trusted ay and lent john money to boot
out of his own pocket at a time when all his fine court friends blew
cold enough he trusted me too and i have been two months on the score
at a time for my upper room to be sure i was obliging in his way not
that i exactly could shape or sew nor would that have been decorous for
a gentleman of good descent but i eh eh i drew bills summed up the
books  

carried home the clothes of the wits and aldermen and got lodging for
your labour interrupted cleveland

no no damn it no replied halcro no such thing you put me out in
my story where was i

nay the devil help you to the latitude said the captain extricating
his button from the gripe of the unmerciful bard's finger and thumb
for i have no time to take an observation so saying he bolted from
the room

a silly ill-bred conceited fool said halcro looking after him
with as little manners as wit in his empty coxcomb i wonder what
magnus and these silly wenches can see in him he tells such damnable
long-winded stories too about his adventures and sea-fights every
second word a lie i doubt not mordaunt my dear boy take example by
that man that is take warning by him never tell long stories about
yourself you are sometimes given to talk too much about your own
exploits on crags and skerries and the like which only breaks
conversation and prevents other folk from being heard now i see you
are impatient to hear out what i was saying stop whereabouts was i

i fear we must put it off mr halcro until after dinner said
mordaunt who also meditated his escape though desirous of effecting it
with more delicacy towards his old acquaintance than captain cleveland
had thought it necessary to use

nay my dear boy said halcro seeing himself about to be utterly
deserted do not you leave me too never take so bad an example as to
set light by old acquaintance mordaunt i have wandered many a weary
step in my day but they were always lightened when i could get hold of
the arm of an old friend like yourself

so saying he quitted the youth's coat and sliding his hand gently
under his arm grappled him more effectually to which mordaunt
submitted a little moved by the poet's observation upon the unkindness
of old acquaintances under which he himself was an immediate sufferer
but when halcro renewed his formidable question whereabouts was i
mordaunt preferring his poetry to his prose reminded him of the song
which he said he had written upon his first leaving zetland a song to
which indeed the enquirer was no stranger but which as it must be
new to the reader we shall here insert as a favourable specimen of the
poetical powers of this tuneful descendant of haco the golden-mouthed
for in the opinion of many tolerable judges he held a respectable rank
among the inditers of madrigals of the period and was as well qualified
to give immortality to his nancies of the hills or dales as many a
gentle sonnetteer of wit and pleasure about town he was something of a
musician also and on the present occasion seized upon a sort of lute
and quitting his victim prepared the instrument for an accompaniment
speaking all the while that he might lose no time

i learned the lute he said from the same man who taught honest
shadwell plump tom as they used to call him somewhat roughly treated
by the glorious john you remember mordaunt you remember 

 methinks i see the new arion sail
 the lute still trembling underneath thy nail
 at thy well sharpen'd thumb from shore to shore
 the trebles squeak for fear the basses roar

come i am indifferently in tune now what was it to be ay i
remember nay the lass of northmaven is the ditty poor bet stimbister
i have called her mary in the verses betsy does well for an english
song but mary is more natural here so saying after a short prelude
he sung with a tolerable voice and some taste the following verses


mary

 farewell to northmaven
 grey hillswicke farewell
 to the calms of thy haven
 the storms on thy fell 
 to each breeze that can vary
 the mood of thy main
 and to thee bonny mary
 we meet not again

 farewell the wild ferry
 which hacon could brave
 when the peaks of the skerry
 were white in the wave
 there's a maid may look over
 these wild waves in vain 
 for the skiff of her lover 
 he comes not again

 the vows thou hast broke
 on the wild currents fling them
 on the quicksand and rock
 let the mermaidens sing them
 new sweetness they'll give her
 bewildering strain
 but there's one who will never
 believe them again

 o were there an island
 though ever so wild
 where woman could smile and
 no man be beguiled 
 too tempting a snare
 to poor mortals were given
 and the hope would fix there
 that should anchor on heaven

i see you are softened my young friend said halcro when he had
finished his song so are most who hear that same ditty words and
music both mine own and without saying much of the wit of it there is
a sort of eh eh simplicity and truth about it which gets its way to
most folk's heart even your father cannot resist it and he has a heart
as impenetrable to poetry and song as apollo himself could draw an arrow
against but then he has had some ill luck in his time with the
women-folk as is plain from his owing them such a grudge ay ay there
the charm lies none of us but has felt the same sore in our day but
come my dear boy they are mustering in the hall men and women
both plagues as they are we should get on ill without them but
before we go only mark the last turn 

 and the hope would fix there 

that is in the supposed island a place which neither was nor will be 

 that should anchor on heaven

now you see my good young man there are here none of your heathenish
rants which rochester etheridge and these wild fellows used to
string together a parson might sing the song and his clerk bear the
burden but there is the confounded bell we must go now but never
mind we'll get into a quiet corner at night and i'll tell you all
about it




chapter xiii

 full in the midst the polish'd table shines
 and the bright goblets rich with generous wines
 now each partakes the feast the wine prepares
 portions the food and each the portion shares
 nor till the rage of thirst and hunger ceased
 to the high host approach'd the sagacious guest

 odyssey


the hospitable profusion of magnus troil's board the number of guests
who feasted in the hall the much greater number of retainers
attendants humble friends and domestics of every possible description
who revelled without with the multitude of the still poorer and less
honoured assistants who came from every hamlet or township within
twenty miles round to share the bounty of the munificent udaller were
such as altogether astonished triptolemus yellowley and made him
internally doubt whether it would be prudent in him at this time and
amid the full glow of his hospitality to propose to the host who
presided over such a splendid banquet a radical change in the whole
customs and usages of his country

true the sagacious triptolemus felt conscious that he possessed in his
own person wisdom far superior to that of all the assembled feasters to
say nothing of the landlord against whose prudence the very extent of
his hospitality formed in yellowley's opinion sufficient evidence but
yet the amphitryon with whom one dines holds for the time at least
an influence over the minds of his most distinguished guests and if the
dinner be in good style and the wines of the right quality it is
humbling to see that neither art nor wisdom scarce external rank
itself can assume their natural and wonted superiority over the
distributor of these good things until coffee has been brought in
triptolemus felt the full weight of this temporary superiority yet he
was desirous to do something that might vindicate the vaunts he had made
to his sister and his fellow-traveller and he stole a look at them from
time to time to mark whether he was not sinking in their esteem from
postponing his promised lecture on the enormities of zetland

but mrs barbara was busily engaged in noting and registering the waste
incurred in such an entertainment as she had probably never before
looked upon and in admiring the host's indifference to and the guests
absolute negligence of those rules of civility in which her youth had
been brought up the feasters desired to be helped from a dish which was
unbroken and might have figured at supper with as much freedom as if
it had undergone the ravages of half-a-dozen guests and no one seemed
to care the landlord himself least of all whether those dishes only
were consumed which from their nature were incapable of
re-appearance or whether the assault was extended to the substantial
rounds of beef pasties and so forth which by the rules of good
housewifery were destined to stand two attacks and which therefore
according to mrs barbara's ideas of politeness ought not to have been
annihilated by the guests upon the first onset but spared like outis
in the cave of polyphemus to be devoured the last lost in the
meditations to which these breaches of convivial discipline gave rise
and in the contemplation of an ideal larder of cold meat which she could
have saved out of the wreck of roast boiled and baked sufficient to
have supplied her cupboard for at least a twelvemonth mrs barbara
cared very little whether or not her brother supported in its extent the
character which he had calculated upon assuming

mordaunt mertoun also was conversant with far other thoughts than those
which regarded the proposed reformer of zetland enormities his seat was
betwixt two blithe maidens of thule who not taking scorn that he had
upon other occasions given preference to the daughters of the udaller
were glad of the chance which assigned to them the attentions of so
distinguished a gallant who as being their squire at the feast might
in all probability become their partner in the subsequent dance but
whilst rendering to his fair neighbours all the usual attentions which
society required mordaunt kept up a covert but accurate and close
observation upon his estranged friends minna and brenda the udaller
himself had a share of his attention but in him he could remark
nothing except the usual tone of hearty and somewhat boisterous
hospitality with which he was accustomed to animate the banquet upon
all such occasions of general festivity but in the differing mien of
the two maidens there was much more room for painful remark

captain cleveland sat betwixt the sisters was sedulous in his
attentions to both and mordaunt was so placed that he could observe
all and hear a great deal of what passed between them but cleveland's
peculiar regard seemed devoted to the elder sister of this the younger
was perhaps conscious for more than once her eye glanced towards
mordaunt and as he thought with something in it which resembled
regret for the interruption of their intercourse and a sad remembrance
of former and more friendly times while minna was exclusively engrossed
by the attentions of her neighbour and that it should be so filled
mordaunt with surprise and resentment

minna the serious the prudent the reserved whose countenance and
manners indicated so much elevation of character minna the lover of
solitude and of those paths of knowledge in which men walk best without
company the enemy of light mirth the friend of musing melancholy and
the frequenter of fountain-heads and pathless glens she whose character
seemed in short the very reverse of that which might be captivated by
the bold coarse and daring gallantry of such a man as this captain
cleveland gave nevertheless her eye and ear to him as he sat beside
her at table with an interest and a graciousness of attention which
to mordaunt who well knew how to judge of her feelings by her manner
intimated a degree of the highest favour he observed this and his
heart rose against the favourite by whom he had been thus superseded as
well as against minna's indiscreet departure from her own character

what is there about the man he said within himself more than the
bold and daring assumption of importance which is derived from success
in petty enterprises and the exercise of petty despotism over a ship's
crew his very language is more professional than is used by the
superior officers of the british navy and the wit which has excited so
many smiles seems to me such as minna would not formerly have endured
for an instant even brenda seems less taken with his gallantry than
minna whom it should have suited so little

mordaunt was doubly mistaken in these his angry speculations in the
first place with an eye which was in some respects that of a rival
he criticised far too severely the manners and behaviour of captain
cleveland they were unpolished certainly which was of the less
consequence in a country inhabited by so plain and simple a race as the
ancient zetlanders on the other hand there was an open naval
frankness in cleveland's bearing much natural shrewdness some
appropriate humour an undoubting confidence in himself and that
enterprising hardihood of disposition which without any other
recommendable quality very often leads to success with the fair sex
but mordaunt was farther mistaken in supposing that cleveland was
likely to be disagreeable to minna troil on account of the opposition
of their characters in so many material particulars had his knowledge
of the world been a little more extensive he might have observed that
as unions are often formed betwixt couples differing in complexion and
stature they take place still more frequently betwixt persons totally
differing in feelings in taste in pursuits and in understanding and
it would not be saying perhaps too much to aver that two-thirds of
the marriages around us have been contracted betwixt persons who
judging a priori we should have thought had scarce any charms for
each other

a moral and primary cause might be easily assigned for these anomalies
in the wise dispensations of providence that the general balance of
wit wisdom and amiable qualities of all kinds should be kept up
through society at large for what a world were it if the wise were to
intermarry only with the wise the learned with the learned the amiable
with the amiable nay even the handsome with the handsome and is it
not evident that the degraded castes of the foolish the ignorant the
brutal and the deformed comprehending by the way far the greater
portion of mankind must when condemned to exclusive intercourse with
each other become gradually as much brutalized in person and
disposition as so many ourang-outangs when therefore we see the
gentle joined to the rude we may lament the fate of the suffering
individual but we must not the less admire the mysterious disposition
of that wise providence which thus balances the moral good and evil of
life which secures for a family unhappy in the dispositions of one
parent a share of better and sweeter blood transmitted from the other
and preserves to the offspring the affectionate care and protection of
at least one of those from whom it is naturally due without the
frequent occurrence of such alliances and unions mis-sorted as they
seem at first sight the world could not be that for which eternal
wisdom has designed it a place of mixed good and evil a place of trial
at once and of suffering where even the worst ills are checkered with
something that renders them tolerable to humble and patient minds and
where the best blessings carry with them a necessary alloy of
embittering depreciation

when indeed we look a little closer on the causes of those unexpected
and ill-suited attachments we have occasion to acknowledge that the
means by which they are produced do not infer that complete departure
from or inconsistency with the character of the parties which we
might expect when the result alone is contemplated the wise purposes
which providence appears to have had in view by permitting such
intermixture of dispositions tempers and understandings in the
married state are not accomplished by any mysterious impulse by which
in contradiction to the ordinary laws of nature men or women are urged
to an union with those whom the world see to be unsuitable to them the
freedom of will is permitted to us in the occurrences of ordinary life
as in our moral conduct and in the former as well as the latter case
is often the means of misguiding those who possess it thus it usually
happens more especially to the enthusiastic and imaginative that
having formed a picture of admiration in their own mind they too often
deceive themselves by some faint resemblance in some existing being
whom their fancy as speedily as gratuitously invests with all the
attributes necessary to complete the beau ideal of mental perfection
no one perhaps even in the happiest marriage with an object really
beloved ever discovered by experience all the qualities he expected to
possess but in far too many cases he finds he has practised a much
higher degree of mental deception and has erected his airy castle of
felicity upon some rainbow which owed its very existence only to the
peculiar state of the atmosphere

thus mordaunt if better acquainted with life and with the course of
human things would have been little surprised that such a man as
cleveland handsome bold and animated a man who had obviously lived
in danger and who spoke of it as sport should have been invested by a
girl of minna's fanciful disposition with an extensive share of those
qualities which in her active imagination were held to fill up the
accomplishments of a heroic character the plain bluntness of his
manner if remote from courtesy appeared at least as widely different
from deceit and unfashioned as he seemed by forms he had enough both
of natural sense and natural good-breeding to support the delusion he
had created at least as far as externals were concerned it is scarce
necessary to add that these observations apply exclusively to what are
called love-matches for when either party fix their attachment upon the
substantial comforts of a rental or a jointure they cannot be
disappointed in the acquisition although they may be cruelly so in
their over-estimation of the happiness it was to afford or in having
too slightly anticipated the disadvantages with which it was to be
attended

having a certain partiality for the dark beauty whom we have described
we have willingly dedicated this digression in order to account for a
line of conduct which we allow to seem absolutely unnatural in such a
narrative as the present though the most common event in ordinary life
namely in minna's appearing to have over-estimated the taste talent
and ability of a handsome young man who was dedicating to her his whole
time and attention and whose homage rendered her the envy of almost all
the other young women of that numerous party perhaps if our fair
readers will take the trouble to consult their own bosoms they will be
disposed to allow that the distinguished good taste exhibited by any
individual who when his attentions would be agreeable to a whole
circle of rivals selects one as their individual object entitles
him on the footing of reciprocity if on no other to a large share of
that individual's favourable and even partial esteem at any rate if
the character shall after all be deemed inconsistent and unnatural it
concerns not us who record the facts as we find them and pretend no
privilege for bringing closer to nature those incidents which may seem
to diverge from it or for reducing to consistence that most
inconsistent of all created things the heart of a beautiful and admired
female

necessity which teaches all the liberal arts can render us also adepts
in dissimulation and mordaunt though a novice failed not to profit in
her school it was manifest that in order to observe the demeanour of
those on whom his attention was fixed he must needs put constraint on
his own and appear at least so much engaged with the damsels betwixt
whom he sat that minna and brenda should suppose him indifferent to
what was passing around him the ready cheerfulness of maddie and clara
groatsettars who were esteemed considerable fortunes in the island and
were at this moment too happy in feeling themselves seated somewhat
beyond the sphere of vigilance influenced by their aunt the good old
lady glowrowrum met and requited the attempts which mordaunt made to be
lively and entertaining and they were soon engaged in a gay
conversation to which as usual on such occasions the gentleman
contributed wit or what passes for such and the ladies their prompt
laughter and liberal applause but amidst this seeming mirth mordaunt
failed not from time to time as covertly as he might to observe the
conduct of the two daughters of magnus and still it appeared as if the
elder wrapt up in the conversation of cleveland did not cast away a
thought on the rest of the company and as if brenda more openly as she
conceived his attention withdrawn from her looked with an expression
both anxious and melancholy towards the group of which he himself formed
a part he was much moved by the diffidence as well as the trouble
which her looks seemed to convey and tacitly formed the resolution of
seeking a more full explanation with her in the course of the evening
norna he remembered had stated that these two amiable young women were
in danger the nature of which she left unexplained but which he
suspected to arise out of their mistaking the character of this daring
and all-engrossing stranger and he secretly resolved that if
possible he would be the means of detecting cleveland and of saving
his early friends

as he revolved these thoughts his attention to the miss groatsettars
gradually diminished and perhaps he might altogether have forgotten the
necessity of his appearing an uninterested spectator of what was
passing had not the signal been given for the ladies retiring from
table minna with a native grace and somewhat of stateliness in her
manner bent her head to the company in general with a kinder and more
particular expression as her eye reached cleveland brenda with the
blush which attended her slightest personal exertion when exposed to the
eyes of others hurried through the same departing salutation with an
embarrassment which almost amounted to awkwardness but which her youth
and timidity rendered at once natural and interesting again mordaunt
thought that her eye distinguished him amidst the numerous company for
the first time he ventured to encounter and to return the glance and
the consciousness that he had done so doubled the glow of brenda's
countenance while something resembling displeasure was blended with her
emotion

when the ladies had retired the men betook themselves to the deep and
serious drinking which according to the fashion of the times preceded
the evening exercise of the dance old magnus himself by precept and
example exhorted them to make the best use of their time since the
ladies would soon summon them to shake their feet at the same time
giving the signal to a grey-headed domestic who stood behind him in the
dress of a dantzic skipper and who added to many other occupations that
of butler eric scambester he said has the good ship the jolly
mariner of canton got her cargo on board

chokeful loaded answered the ganymede of burgh-westra with good
nantz jamaica sugar portugal lemons not to mention nutmeg and toast
and water taken in from the shellicoat spring

loud and long laughed the guests at this stated and regular jest betwixt
the udaller and his butler which always served as a preface to the
introduction of a punch-bowl of enormous size the gift of the captain
of one of the honourable east india company's vessels which bound from
china homeward had been driven north-about by stress of weather into
lerwick-bay and had there contrived to get rid of part of the cargo
without very scrupulously reckoning for the king's duties

magnus troil having been a large customer besides otherwise obliging
captain coolie had been remunerated on the departure of the ship with
this splendid vehicle of conviviality at the very sight of which as
old eric scambester bent under its weight a murmur of applause ran
through the company the good old toasts dedicated to the prosperity of
zetland were then honoured with flowing bumpers death to the head
that never wears hair was a sentiment quaffed to the success of the
fishing as proposed by the sonorous voice of the udaller claud halcro
proposed with general applause the health of their worthy landmaster
the sweet sister meat-mistresses health to man death to fish and
growth to the produce of the ground the same recurring sentiment was
proposed more concisely by a whiteheaded compeer of magnus troil in the
words god open the mouth of the grey fish and keep his hand about the
corn

full opportunity was afforded to all to honour these interesting toasts
those nearest the capacious mediterranean of punch were accommodated by
the udaller with their portions dispensed in huge rummer glasses by his
own hospitable hand whilst they who sat at a greater distance
replenished their cups by means of a rich silver flagon facetiously
called the pinnace which filled occasionally at the bowl served to
dispense its liquid treasures to the more remote parts of the table and
occasioned many right merry jests on its frequent voyages the commerce
of the zetlanders with foreign vessels and homeward-bound west
indiamen had early served to introduce among them the general use of
the generous beverage with which the jolly mariner of canton was
loaded nor was there a man in the archipelago of thule more skilled in
combining its rich ingredients than old eric scambester who indeed was
known far and wide through the isles by the name of the punch-maker
after the fashion of the ancient norwegians who conferred on rollo the
walker and other heroes of their strain epithets expressive of the
feats of strength or dexterity in which they excelled all other men

the good liquor was not slow in performing its office of exhilaration
and as the revel advanced some ancient norse drinking-songs were sung
with great effect by the guests tending to show that if from want of
exercise the martial virtues of their ancestors had decayed among the
zetlanders they could still actively and intensely enjoy so much of the
pleasures of valhalla as consisted in quaffing the oceans of mead and
brown ale which were promised by odin to those who should share his
scandinavian paradise at length excited by the cup and song the
diffident grew bold and the modest loquacious all became desirous of
talking and none were willing to listen each man mounted his own
special hobby-horse and began eagerly to call on his neighbours to
witness his agility amongst others the little bard who had now got
next to our friend mordaunt mertoun evinced a positive determination to
commence and conclude in all its longitude and latitude the story of
his introduction to glorious john dryden and triptolemus yellowley as
his spirits arose shaking off a feeling of involuntary awe with which
he was impressed by the opulence indicated in all he saw around him as
well as by the respect paid to magnus troil by the assembled guests
began to broach to the astonished and somewhat offended udaller some
of those projects for ameliorating the islands which he had boasted of
to his fellow-travellers upon their journey of the morning

but the innovations which he suggested and the reception which they met
with at the hand of magnus troil must be told in the next chapter

 old play


we left the company of magnus troil engaged in high wassail and revelry
mordaunt who like his father shunned the festive cup did not partake
in the cheerfulness which the ship diffused among the guests as they
unloaded it and the pinnace as it circumnavigated the table but in
low spirits as he seemed he was the more meet prey for the
story-telling halcro who had fixed upon him as in a favourable state
to play the part of listener with something of the same instinct that
directs the hooded crow to the sick sheep among the flock which will
most patiently suffer itself to be made a prey of joyfully did the poet
avail himself of the advantages afforded by mordaunt's absence of mind
and unwillingness to exert himself in measures of active defence with
the unfailing dexterity peculiar to prosers he contrived to dribble out
his tale to double its usual length by the exercise of the privilege of
unlimited digressions so that the story like a horse on the grand
pas seemed to be advancing with rapidity while in reality it scarce
was progressive at the rate of a yard in the quarter of an hour at
length however he had discussed in all its various bearings and
relations the history of his friendly landlord the master fashioner in
russel street including a short sketch of five of his relations and
anecdotes of three of his principal rivals together with some general
observations upon the dress and fashion of the period and having
marched thus far through the environs and outworks of his story he
arrived at the body of the place for so the wits coffeehouse might be
termed he paused on the threshold however to explain the nature of
his landlord's right occasionally to intrude himself into this
well-known temple of the muses

it consisted said halcro in the two principal points of bearing
and forbearing for my friend thimblethwaite was a person of wit
himself and never quarrelled with any jest which the wags who
frequented that house were flinging about like squibs and crackers on a
rejoicing night and then though some of the wits ay and i daresay
the greater number might have had some dealings with him in the way of
trade he never was the person to put any man of genius in unpleasant
remembrance of such trifles and though my dear young master mordaunt
you may think this is but ordinary civility because in this country it
happens seldom that there is either much borrowing or lending and
because praised be heaven there are neither bailiffs nor
sheriff-officers to take a poor fellow by the neck and because there
are no prisons to put him into when they have done so yet let me tell
you that such a lamblike forbearance as that of my poor dear deceased
landlord thimblethwaite is truly uncommon within the london bills of
mortality i could tell you of such things that have happened even to
myself as well as others with these cursed london tradesmen as would
make your hair stand on end but what the devil has put old magnus into
such note he shouts as if he were trying his voice against a north-west
gale of wind

loud indeed was the roar of the old udaller as worn out of patience by
the schemes of improvement which the factor was now undauntedly pressing
upon his consideration he answered him to use an ossianic phrase
like a wave upon a rock

trees sir factor talk not to me of trees i care not though there
never be one on the island tall enough to hang a coxcomb upon we will
have no trees but those that rise in our havens the good trees that
have yards for boughs and standing-rigging for leaves

but touching the draining of the lake of braebaster whereof i spoke to
you master magnus troil said the persevering agriculturist whilk i
opine would be of so much consequence there are two ways down the
linklater glen or by the scalmester burn now having taken the level
of both  

there is a third way master yellowley answered the landlord

i profess i can see none replied triptolemus with as much good faith
as a joker could desire in the subject of his wit in respect that the
hill called braebaster on the south and ane high bank on the north of
whilk i cannot carry the name rightly in my head  

do not tell us of hills and banks master yellowley there is a third
way of draining the loch and it is the only way that shall be tried in
my day you say my lord chamberlain and i are the joint proprietors so
be it let each of us start an equal proportion of brandy lime-juice
and sugar into the loch a ship's cargo or two will do the job let us
assemble all the jolly udallers of the country and in twenty-four hours
you shall see dry ground where the loch of braebaster now is

a loud laugh of applause which for a time actually silenced
triptolemus attended a jest so very well suited to time and place a
jolly toast was given a merry song was sung the ship unloaded her
sweets the pinnace made its genial rounds the duet betwixt magnus and
triptolemus which had attracted the attention of the whole company from
its superior vehemence now once more sunk and merged into the general
hum of the convivial table and the poet halcro again resumed his
usurped possession of the ear of mordaunt mertoun

whereabouts was i he said with a tone which expressed to his weary
listener more plainly than words could how much of his desultory tale
yet remained to be told o i remember we were just at the door of the
wits coffeehouse it was set up by one  

nay but my dear master halcro said his hearer somewhat
impatiently i am desirous to hear of your meeting with dryden

what with glorious john true ay where was i at the wits
coffeehouse well in at the door we got the waiters and so forth
staring at me for as to thimblethwaite honest fellow his was a
well-known face i can tell you a story about that  

nay but john dryden said mordaunt in a tone which deprecated
further digression

ay ay glorious john where was i well as we stood close by the
bar where one fellow sat grinding of coffee and another putting up
tobacco into penny parcels a pipe and a dish cost just a penny then
and there it was that i had the first peep of him one dennis sat near
him who  

nay but john dryden what like was he demanded mordaunt

like a little fat old man with his own grey hair and in a
full-trimmed black suit that sat close as a glove honest
thimblethwaite let no one but himself shape for glorious john and he
had a slashing hand at a sleeve i promise you but there is no getting
a mouthful of common sense spoken here d  n that scotchman he and
old magnus are at it again

it was very true and although the interruption did not resemble a
thunder-clap to which the former stentorian exclamation of the udaller
might have been likened it was a close and clamorous dispute
maintained by question answer retort and repartee as closely huddled
upon each other as the sounds which announce from a distance a close and
sustained fire of musketry

hear reason sir said the udaller we will hear reason and speak
reason too and if reason fall short you shall have rhyme to boot ha
my little friend halcro

though cut off in the middle of his best story if that could be said
to have a middle which had neither beginning nor end the bard
bristled up at the summons like a corps of light infantry when ordered
up to the support of the grenadiers looked smart slapped the table
with his hand and denoted his becoming readiness to back his hospitable
landlord as becomes a well-entertained guest triptolemus was a little
daunted at this reinforcement of his adversary he paused like a
cautious general in the sweeping attack which he had commenced on the
peculiar usages of zetland and spoke not again until the udaller poked
him with the insulting query where is your reason now master
yellowley that you were deafening me with a moment since

be but patient worthy sir replied the agriculturist what on earth
can you or any other man say in defence of that thing you call a plough
in this blinded country why even the savage highlandmen in caithness
and sutherland can make more work and better with their gascromh or
whatever they call it

but what ails you at it sir said the udaller let me hear your
objections to it it tills our land and what would ye more

it hath but one handle or stilt replied triptolemus

and who the devil said the poet aiming at something smart would
wish to need a pair of stilts if he can manage to walk with a single
one

or tell me said magnus troil how it were possible for neil of
lupness that lost one arm by his fall from the crag of nekbreckan to
manage a plough with two handles

the harness is of raw seal-skin said triptolemus

it will save dressed leather answered magnus troil

it is drawn by four wretched bullocks said the agriculturist that
are yoked breast-fashion and two women must follow this unhappy
instrument and complete the furrows with a couple of shovels

drink about master yellowley said the udaller and as you say in
scotland never fash your thumb our cattle are too high-spirited to
let one go before the other our men are too gentle and well-nurtured to
take the working-field without the women's company our ploughs till our
land our land bears us barley we brew our ale eat our bread and make
strangers welcome to their share of it here's to you master
yellowley

this was said in a tone meant to be decisive of the question and
accordingly halcro whispered to mordaunt that has settled the matter
and now we will get on with glorious john there he sat in his suit of
full-trimmed black two years due was the bill as mine honest landlord
afterwards told me and such an eye in his head none of your burning
blighting falcon eyes which we poets are apt to make a rout
about but a soft full thoughtful yet penetrating glance never saw
the like of it in my life unless it were little stephen kleancogg's
the fiddler at papastow who  

nay but john dryden said mordaunt who for want of better
amusement had begun to take a sort of pleasure in keeping the old
gentleman to his narrative as men herd in a restiff sheep when they
wish to catch him he returned to his theme with his usual phrase of
ay true glorious john well sir he cast his eye such as i have
described it on mine landlord and honest tim said he what hast
thou got here and all the wits and lords and gentlemen that used to
crowd round him like the wenches round a pedlar at a fair they made
way for us and up we came to the fireside where he had his own
established chair i have heard it was carried to the balcony in
summer but it was by the fireside when i saw it so up came tim
thimblethwaite through the midst of them as bold as a lion and i
followed with a small parcel under my arm which i had taken up partly
to oblige my landlord as the shop porter was not in the way and partly
that i might be thought to have something to do there for you are to
think there was no admittance at the wits for strangers who had no
business there i have heard that sir charles sedley said a good thing
about that  

nay but you forget glorious john said mordaunt

ay glorious you may well call him they talk of their blackmore and
shadwell and such like not fit to tie the latchets of john's
shoes well he said to my landlord what have you got there and
he bowing i warrant lower than he would to a duke said he had made
bold to come and show him the stuff which lady elizabeth had chose for
her nightgown and which of your geese is that tim who has got it
tucked under his wing he is an orkney goose if it please you mr
dryden said tim who had wit at will and he hath brought you a copy
of verses for your honour to look at is he amphibious said
glorious john taking the paper and methought i could rather have
faced a battery of cannon than the crackle it gave as it opened though
he did not speak in a way to dash one neither and then he looked at
the verses and he was pleased to say in a very encouraging way indeed
with a sort of good-humoured smile on his face and certainly for a fat
elderly gentleman for i would not compare it to minna's smile or
brenda's he had the pleasantest smile i ever saw why tim he
said this goose of yours will prove a swan on your hands with that
he smiled a little and they all laughed and none louder than those who
stood too far off to hear the jest for every one knew when he smiled
there was something worth laughing at and so took it upon trust and
the word passed through among the young templars and the wits and the
smarts and there was nothing but question on question who we were and
one french fellow was trying to tell them it was only monsieur tim
thimblethwaite but he made such work with his dumbletate and
timbletate that i thought his explanation would have lasted  

as long as your own story thought mordaunt but the narrative was at
length finally cut short by the strong and decided voice of the
udaller

i will hear no more on it mr factor he exclaimed

at least let me say something about the breed of horses said
yellowley in rather a cry-mercy tone of voice your horses my dear
sir resemble cats in size and tigers in devilry

for their size said magnus they are the easier for us to get off
and on them as triptolemus experienced this morning thought mordaunt
to himself and as for their devilry let no one mount them that
cannot manage them

a twinge of self-conviction on the part of the agriculturist prevented
him from reply he darted a deprecatory glance at mordaunt as if for
the purpose of imploring secrecy respecting his tumble and the udaller
who saw his advantage although he was not aware of the cause pursued
it with the high and stern tone proper to one who had all his life been
unaccustomed to meet with and unapt to endure opposition

by the blood of saint magnus the martyr he said but you are a fine
fellow master factor yellowley you come to us from a strange land
understanding neither our laws nor our manners nor our language and
you propose to become governor of the country and that we should all be
your slaves

my pupils worthy sir my pupils said yellowley and that only for
your own proper advantage

we are too old to go to school said the zetlander i tell you once
more we will sow and reap our grain as our fathers did we will eat
what god sends us with our doors open to the stranger even as theirs
were open if there is aught imperfect in our practice we will amend it
in time and season but the blessed baptist's holyday was made for light
hearts and quick heels he that speaks a word more of reason as you
call it or any thing that looks like it shall swallow a pint of
sea-water he shall by this hand and so fill up the good ship the
jolly mariner of canton once more for the benefit of those that will
stick by her and let the rest have a fling with the fiddlers who have
been summoning us this hour i will warrant every wench is on tiptoe by
this time come mr yellowley no unkindness man why man thou
feelest the rolling of the jolly mariner still for in truth honest
triptolemus showed a little unsteadiness of motion as he rose to attend
his host but never mind we shall have thee find thy land-legs to
reel it with yonder bonny belles come along triptolemus let me
grapple thee fast lest thou trip old triptolemus ha ha ha

so saying the portly though weatherbeaten hulk of the udaller sailed
off like a man-of-war that had braved a hundred gales having his guest
in tow like a recent prize the greater part of the revellers followed
their leader with loud jubilee although there were several stanch
topers who taking the option left them by the udaller remained behind
to relieve the jolly mariner of a fresh cargo amidst many a pledge to
the health of their absent landlord and to the prosperity of his
roof-tree with whatsoever other wishes of kindness could be devised as
an apology for another pint-bumper of noble punch

the rest soon thronged the dancing-room an apartment which partook of
the simplicity of the time and of the country drawing-rooms and saloons
were then unknown in scotland save in the houses of the nobility and
of course absolutely so in zetland but a long low anomalous
store-room sometimes used for the depositation of merchandise
sometimes for putting aside lumber and a thousand other purposes was
well known to all the youth of dunrossness and of many a district
besides as the scene of the merry dance which was sustained with so
much glee when magnus troil gave his frequent feasts

the first appearance of this ball-room might have shocked a fashionable
party assembled for the quadrille or the waltz low as we have stated
the apartment to be it was but imperfectly illuminated by lamps
candles ship-lanterns and a variety of other candelabra which
served to throw a dusky light upon the floor and upon the heaps of
merchandise and miscellaneous articles which were piled around some of
them stores for the winter some goods destined for exportation some
the tribute of neptune paid at the expense of shipwrecked vessels
whose owners were unknown some articles of barter received by the
proprietor who like most others at the period was somewhat of a
merchant as well as a landholder in exchange for the fish and other
articles the produce of his estate all these with the chests boxes
casks c which contained them had been drawn aside and piled one
above the other in order to give room for the dancers who light and
lively as if they had occupied the most splendid saloon in the parish of
st james's executed their national dances with equal grace and
activity

the group of old men who looked on bore no inconsiderable resemblance
to a party of aged tritons engaged in beholding the sports of the
sea-nymphs so hard a look had most of them acquired by contending with
the elements and so much did the shaggy hair and beards which many of
them cultivated after the ancient norwegian fashion give their heads
the character of these supposed natives of the deep the young people
on the other hand were uncommonly handsome tall well-made and
shapely the men with long fair hair and until broken by the weather
a fresh ruddy complexion which in the females was softened into a
bloom of infinite delicacy their natural good ear for music qualified
them to second to the utmost the exertions of a band whose strains were
by no means contemptible while the elders who stood around or sat
quiet upon the old sea-chests which served for chairs criticised the
dancers as they compared their execution with their own exertions in
former days or warmed by the cup and flagon which continued to
circulate among them snapped their fingers and beat time with their
feet to the music

mordaunt looked upon this scene of universal mirth with the painful
recollection that he thrust aside from his pre-eminence no longer
exercised the important duties of chief of the dancers or office of
leader of the revels which had been assigned to the stranger cleveland
anxious however to suppress the feelings of his own disappointment
which he felt it was neither wise to entertain nor manly to display he
approached his fair neighbours to whom he had been so acceptable at
table with the purpose of inviting one of them to become his partner in
the dance but the awfully ancient old lady even the lady glowrowrum
who had only tolerated the exuberance of her nieces mirth during the
time of dinner because her situation rendered it then impossible for
her to interfere was not disposed to permit the apprehended renewal of
the intimacy implied in mertoun's invitation she therefore took upon
herself in the name of her two nieces who sat pouting beside her in
displeased silence to inform mordaunt after thanking him for his
civility that the hands of her nieces were engaged for that evening
and as he continued to watch the party at a little distance he had an
opportunity of being convinced that the alleged engagement was a mere
apology to get rid of him when he saw the two good-humoured sisters
join the dance under the auspices of the next young men who asked their
hands incensed at so marked a slight and unwilling to expose himself
to another mordaunt mertoun drew back from the circle of dancers
shrouded himself amongst the mass of inferior persons who crowded into
the bottom of the room as spectators and there concealed from the
observation of others digested his own mortification as well as he
could that is to say very ill and with all the philosophy of his
age that is to say with none at all




chapter xv

 a torch for me let wantons light of heart
 tickle the useless rushes with their heels
 for i am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase 
 i'll be a candle-holder and look on

 romeo and juliet


the youth says the moralist johnson cares not for the boy's
hobbyhorse nor the man for the youth's mistress and therefore the
distress of mordaunt mertoun when excluded from the merry dance may
seem trifling to many of my readers who would nevertheless think they
did well to be angry if deposed from their usual place in an assembly of
a different kind there lacked not amusement however for those whom
the dance did not suit or who were not happy enough to find partners to
their liking halcro now completely in his element had assembled round
him an audience to whom he was declaiming his poetry with all the
enthusiasm of glorious john himself and receiving in return the usual
degree of applause allowed to minstrels who recite their own rhymes so
long at least as the author is within hearing of the criticism halcro's
poetry might indeed have interested the antiquary as well as the admirer
of the muses for several of his pieces were translations or imitations
from the scaldic sagas which continued to be sung by the fishermen of
those islands even until a very late period insomuch that when gray's
poems first found their way to orkney the old people recognised at
once in the ode of the fatal sisters the runic rhymes which had
amused or terrified their infancy under the title of the magicians
and which the fishers of north ronaldshaw and other remote isles used
still to sing when asked for a norse ditty

half listening half lost in his own reflections mordaunt mertoun stood
near the door of the apartment and in the outer ring of the little
circle formed around old halcro while the bard chanted to a low wild
monotonous air varied only by the efforts of the singer to give
interest and emphasis to particular passages the following imitation of
a northern war-song


the song of harold harfager

 the sun is rising dimly red
 the wind is wailing low and dread
 from his cliff the eagle sallies
 leaves the wolf his darksome valleys
 in the midst the ravens hover
 peep the wild-dogs from the cover
 screaming croaking baying yelling
 each in his wild accents telling
 soon we feast on dead and dying
 fair-hair'd harold's flag is flying

 many a crest in air is streaming
 many a helmet darkly gleaming
 many an arm the axe uprears
 doom'd to hew the wood of spears
 all along the crowded ranks
 horses neigh and armour clanks
 chiefs are shouting clarions ringing
 louder still the bard is singing
 gather footmen gather horsemen
 to the field ye valiant norsemen

 halt ye not for food or slumber
 view not vantage count not number
 jolly reapers forward still
 grow the crop on vale or hill
 thick or scatter'd stiff or lithe
 it shall down before the scythe
 forward with your sickles bright
 reap the harvest of the fight 
 onward footmen onward horsemen
 to the charge ye gallant norsemen

 fatal choosers of the slaughter
 o'er you hovers odin's daughter
 hear the voice she spreads before ye 
 victory and wealth and glory
 or old valhalla's roaring hail
 her ever-circling mead and ale
 where for eternity unite
 the joys of wassail and of fight
 headlong forward foot and horsemen
 charge and fight and die like norsemen

the poor unhappy blinded heathens said triptolemus with a sigh deep
enough for a groan they speak of their eternal cups of ale and i
question if they kend how to manage a croft land of grain

the cleverer fellows they neighbour yellowley answered the poet if
they made ale without barley

barley alack-a-day replied the more accurate agriculturist who
ever heard of barley in these parts bear my dearest friend bear is
all they have and wonderment it is to me that they ever see an awn of
it ye scart the land with a bit thing ye ca a pleugh ye might as weel
give it a ritt with the teeth of a redding-kame o to see the sock and
the heel and the sole-clout of a real steady scottish pleugh with a
chield like a samson between the stilts laying a weight on them would
keep down a mountain twa stately owsen and as many broad-breasted
horse in the traces going through soil and till and leaving a fur in
the ground would carry off water like a causeyed syver they that have
seen a sight like that have seen something to crack about in another
sort than those unhappy auld-warld stories of war and slaughter of
which the land has seen even but too mickle for a your singing and
soughing awa in praise of such bloodthirsty doings master claud
halcro

it is a heresy said the animated little poet bridling and drawing
himself up as if the whole defence of the orcadian archipelago rested
on his single arm it is a heresy so much as to name one's native
country if a man is not prepared when and how to defend himself ay
and to annoy another the time has been that if we made not good ale
and aquavitæ we knew well enough where to find that which was ready
made to our hand but now the descendants of sea-kings and champions
and berserkars are become as incapable of using their swords as if
they were so many women ye may praise them for a strong pull on an oar
or a sure foot on a skerry but what else could glorious john himself
say of ye my good hialtlanders that any man would listen to

spoken like an angel most noble poet said cleveland who during an
interval of the dance stood near the party in which this conversation
was held the old champions you talked to us about yesternight were
the men to make a harp ring gallant fellows that were friends to the
sea and enemies to all that sailed on it their ships i suppose were
clumsy enough but if it is true that they went upon the account as far
as the levant i scarce believe that ever better fellows unloosed a
topsail

ay replied halcro there you spoke them right in those days none
could call their life and means of living their own unless they dwelt
twenty miles out of sight of the blue sea why they had public prayers
put up in every church in europe for deliverance from the ire of the
northmen in france and england ay and in scotland too for as high as
they hold their head now-a-days there was not a bay or a haven but it
was freer to our forefathers than to the poor devils of natives and now
we cannot forsooth so much as grow our own barley without scottish
help here he darted a sarcastic glance at the factor i would i saw
the time we were to measure arms with them again

spoken like a hero once more said cleveland

ah continued the little bard i would it were possible to see our
barks once the water-dragons of the world swimming with the black
raven standard waving at the topmast and their decks glimmering with
arms instead of being heaped up with stockfish winning with our
fearless hands what the niggard soil denies paying back all old scorn
and modern injury reaping where we never sowed and felling what we
never planted living and laughing through the world and smiling when
we were summoned to quit it

so spoke claud halcro in no serious or at least most certainly in no
sober mood his brain never the most stable whizzing under the
influence of fifty well-remembered sagas besides five bumpers of
usquebaugh and brandy and cleveland between jest and earnest clapped
him on the shoulder and again repeated spoken like a hero

spoken like a fool i think said magnus troil whose attention had
been also attracted by the vehemence of the little bard where would
you cruize upon or against whom we are all subjects of one realm i
trow and i would have you to remember that your voyage may bring up at
execution-dock i like not the scots no offence mr yellowley that
is i would like them well enough if they would stay quiet in their own
land and leave us at peace with our own people and manners and
fashions and if they would but abide there till i went to harry them
like a mad old berserkar i would leave them in peace till the day of
judgment with what the sea sends us and the land lends us as the
proverb says and a set of honest neighbourly folks to help us to
consume it so help me saint magnus as i think we are even but too
happy

i know what war is said an old man and i would as soon sail through
sumburgh-roost in a cockle-shell or in a worse loom as i would venture
there again

and pray what wars knew your valour said halcro who though
forbearing to contradict his landlord from a sense of respect was not a
whit inclined to abandon his argument to any meaner authority

i was pressed answered the old triton to serve under montrose when
he came here about the sixteen hundred and fifty-one and carried a sort
of us off will ye nill ye to get our throats cut in the wilds of
strathnavernk i shall never forget it we had been hard put to
it for victuals what would i have given for a luncheon of burgh-westra
beef ay or a mess of sour sillocks when our highlandmen brought in a
dainty drove of kyloes much ceremony there was not for we shot and
felled and flayed and roasted and broiled as it came to every man's
hand till just as our beards were at the greasiest we heard god
preserve us a tramp of horse then twa or three drapping shots then
came a full salvo and then when the officers were crying on us to
stand and maist of us looking which way we might run away down they
broke horse and foot with old john urry or hurry or whatever
they called him he hurried us that day and worried us to boot and we
began to fall as thick as the stots that we were felling five minutes
before

and montrose said the soft voice of the graceful minna what became
of montrose or how looked he

like a lion with the hunters before him answered the old gentleman
but i looked not twice his way for my own lay right over the hill

and so you left him said minna in a tone of the deepest contempt

it was no fault of mine mistress minna answered the old man
somewhat out of countenance but i was there with no choice of my own
and besides what good could i have done all the rest were running
like sheep and why should i have staid

you might have died with him said minna

and lived with him to all eternity in immortal verse added claud
halcro

i thank you mistress minna replied the plain-dealing zetlander and
i thank you my old friend claud but i would rather drink both your
healths in this good bicker of ale like a living man as i am than that
you should be making songs in my honour for having died forty or fifty
years agone but what signified it run or fight twas all one they
took montrose poor fellow for all his doughty deeds and they took me
that did no doughty deeds at all and they hanged him poor man and as
for me  

i trust in heaven they flogged and pickled you said cleveland worn
out of patience with the dull narrative of the peaceful zetlander's
poltroonery of which he seemed so wondrous little ashamed

flog horses and pickle beef said magnus why you have not the
vanity to think that with all your quarterdeck airs you will make
poor old neighbour haagen ashamed that he was not killed some scores of
years since you have looked on death yourself my doughty young friend
but it was with the eyes of a young man who wishes to be thought of but
we are a peaceful people peaceful that is as long as any one should
be peaceful and that is till some one has the impudence to wrong us or
our neighbours and then perhaps they may not find our northern blood
much cooler in our veins than was that of the old scandinavians that
gave us our names and lineage get ye along get ye along to the
sword-dance that the strangers that are amongst us may see that our
hands and our weapons are not altogether unacquainted even yet

a dozen cutlasses selected hastily from an old arm-chest and whose
rusted hue bespoke how seldom they left the sheath armed the same
number of young zetlanders with whom mingled six maidens led by minna
troil and the minstrelsy instantly commenced a tune appropriate to the
ancient norwegian war-dance the evolutions of which are perhaps still
practised in those remote islands

illustration

the first movement was graceful and majestic the youths holding their
swords erect and without much gesture but the tune and the
corresponding motions of the dancers became gradually more and more
rapid they clashed their swords together in measured time with a
spirit which gave the exercise a dangerous appearance in the eye of the
spectator though the firmness justice and accuracy with which the
dancers kept time with the stroke of their weapons did in truth
ensure its safety the most singular part of the exhibition was the
courage exhibited by the female performers who now surrounded by the
swordsmen seemed like the sabine maidens in the hands of their roman
lovers now moving under the arch of steel which the young men had
formed by crossing their weapons over the heads of their fair partners
resembled the band of amazons when they first joined in the pyrrhic
dance with the followers of theseus but by far the most striking and
appropriate figure was that of minna troil whom halcro had long
since entitled the queen of swords and who indeed moved amidst the
swordsmen with an air which seemed to hold all the drawn blades as the
proper accompaniments of her person and the implements of her pleasure
and when the mazes of the dance became more intricate when the close
and continuous clash of the weapons made some of her companions shrink
and show signs of fear her cheek her lip and her eye seemed rather
to announce that at the moment when the weapons flashed fastest and
rung sharpest around her she was most completely self-possessed and in
her own element last of all when the music had ceased and she
remained for an instant upon the floor by herself as the rule of the
dance required the swordsmen and maidens who departed from around her
seemed the guards and the train of some princess who dismissed by her
signal were leaving her for a time to solitude her own look and
attitude wrapped as she probably was in some vision of the
imagination corresponded admirably with the ideal dignity which the
spectators ascribed to her but almost immediately recollecting
herself she blushed as if conscious she had been though but for an
instant the object of undivided attention and gave her hand gracefully
to cleveland who though he had not joined in the dance assumed the
duty of conducting her to her seat

as they passed mordaunt mertoun might observe that cleveland whispered
into minna's ear and that her brief reply was accompanied with even
more discomposure of countenance than she had manifested when
encountering the gaze of the whole assembly mordaunt's suspicions were
strongly awakened by what he observed for he knew minna's character
well and with what equanimity and indifference she was in the custom of
receiving the usual compliments and gallantries with which her beauty
and her situation rendered her sufficiently familiar

can it be possible she really loves this stranger was the unpleasant
thought that instantly shot across mordaunt's mind and if she does
what is my interest in the matter was the second and which was
quickly followed by the reflection that though he claimed no interest
at any time but as a friend and though that interest was now withdrawn
he was still in consideration of their former intimacy entitled both
to be sorry and angry at her for throwing away her affections on one he
judged unworthy of her in this process of reasoning it is probable
that a little mortified vanity or some indescribable shade of selfish
regret might be endeavouring to assume the disguise of disinterested
generosity but there is so much of base alloy in our very best
unassisted thoughts that it is melancholy work to criticise too
closely the motives of our most worthy actions at least we would
recommend to every one to let those of his neighbours pass current
however narrowly he may examine the purity of his own

the sword-dance was succeeded by various other specimens of the same
exercise and by songs to which the singers lent their whole soul
while the audience were sure as occasion offered to unite in some
favourite chorus it is upon such occasions that music though of a
simple and even rude character finds its natural empire over the
generous bosom and produces that strong excitement which cannot be
attained by the most learned compositions of the first masters which
are caviare to the common ear although doubtless they afford a
delight exquisite in its kind to those whose natural capacity and
education have enabled them to comprehend and relish those difficult and
complicated combinations of harmony

it was about midnight when a knocking at the door of the mansion with
the sound of the gue and the langspiel announced by their tinkling
chime the arrival of fresh revellers to whom according to the
hospitable custom of the country the apartments were instantly thrown
open

 montrose in his last and ill-advised attempt to invade scotland
augmented his small army of danes and scottish royalists by some bands
of raw troops hastily levied or rather pressed into his service in
the orkney and zetland isles who having little heart either to the
cause or manner of service behaved but indifferently when they came
into action

 here as afterwards remarked in the text the zetlander's memory
deceived him grossly sir john urry a brave soldier of fortune was at
that time in montrose's army and made prisoner along with him he had
changed so often that the mistake is pardonable after the action he
was executed by the covenanters and

 wind-changing warwick then could change no more

chapter xvi

     my mind misgives
 some consequence yet hanging in the stars
 shall bitterly begin his fearful date
 with this night's revels

 romeo and juliet


the new-comers were according to the frequent custom of such frolickers
all over the world disguised in a sort of masquing habits and designed
to represent the tritons and mermaids with whom ancient tradition and
popular belief have peopled the northern seas the former called by
zetlanders of that time shoupeltins were represented by young men
grotesquely habited with false hair and beards made of flax and
chaplets composed of sea-ware interwoven with shells and other marine
productions with which also were decorated their light-blue or greenish
mantles of wadmaal repeatedly before-mentioned they had fish-spears
and other emblems of their assumed quality amongst which the classical
taste of claud halcro by whom the masque was arranged had not
forgotten the conch-shells which were stoutly and hoarsely winded from
time to time by one or two of the aquatic deities to the great
annoyance of all who stood near them

the nereids and water-nymphs who attended on this occasion displayed
as usual a little more taste and ornament than was to be seen amongst
their male attendants fantastic garments of green silk and other
materials of superior cost and fashion had been contrived so as to
imitate their idea of the inhabitants of the waters and at the same
time to show the shape and features of the fair wearers to the best
advantage the bracelets and shells which adorned the neck arms and
ankles of the pretty mermaidens were in some cases intermixed with
real pearls and the appearance upon the whole was such as might have
done no discredit to the court of amphitrite especially when the long
bright locks blue eyes fair complexions and pleasing features of the
maidens of thule were taken into consideration we do not indeed
pretend to aver that any of these seeming mermaids had so accurately
imitated the real siren as commentators have supposed those attendant
on cleopatra did who adopting the fish's train of their original were
able nevertheless to make their bends or ends said commentators
cannot tell which adornings indeed had they not left their
extremities in their natural state it would have been impossible for
the zetland sirens to have executed the very pretty dance with which
they rewarded the company for the ready admission which had been granted
to them

it was soon discovered that these masquers were no strangers but a part
of the guests who stealing out a little time before had thus
disguised themselves in order to give variety to the mirth of the
evening the muse of claud halcro always active on such occasions had
supplied them with an appropriate song of which we may give the
following specimen the song was alternate betwixt a nereid or mermaid
and a merman or triton the males and females on either part forming a
semi-chorus which accompanied and bore burden to the principal singer


i

mermaid

 fathoms deep beneath the wave
 stringing beads of glistering pearl
 singing the achievements brave
 of many an old norwegian earl
 dwelling where the tempest's raving
 falls as light upon our ear
 as the sigh of lover craving
 pity from his lady dear
 children of wild thule we
 from the deep caves of the sea
 as the lark springs from the lea
 hither come to share your glee


ii

merman

 from reining of the water-horse
 that bounded till the waves were foaming
 watching the infant tempest's course
 chasing the sea-snake in his roaming
 from winding charge-notes on the shell
 when the huge whale and sword-fish duel
 or tolling shroudless seamen's knell
 when the winds and waves are cruel
 children of wild thule we
 have plough'd such furrows on the sea
 as the steer draws on the lea
 and hither we come to share your glee


iii

mermaids and mermen

 we heard you in our twilight caves
 a hundred fathom deep below
 for notes of joy can pierce the waves
 that drown each sound of war and woe
 those who dwell beneath the sea
 love the sons of thule well
 thus to aid your mirth bring we
 dance and song and sounding shell
 children of dark thule know
 those who dwell by haaf and voe
 where your daring shallops row
 come to share the festal show

the final chorus was borne by the whole voices excepting those carrying
the conch-shells who had been trained to blow them in a sort of rude
accompaniment which had a good effect the poetry as well as the
performance of the masquers received great applause from all who
pretended to be judges of such matters but above all from triptolemus
yellowley who his ear having caught the agricultural sounds of plough
and furrow and his brain being so well drenched that it could only
construe the words in their most literal acceptation declared roundly
and called mordaunt to bear witness that though it was a shame to
waste so much good lint as went to form the tritons beards and
periwigs the song contained the only words of common sense which he had
heard all that long day

but mordaunt had no time to answer the appeal being engaged in
attending with the utmost vigilance to the motions of one of the female
masquers who had given him a private signal as they entered which
induced him though uncertain who she might prove to be to expect some
communication from her of importance the siren who had so boldly
touched his arm and had accompanied the gesture with an expression of
eye which bespoke his attention was disguised with a good deal more
care than her sister-masquers her mantle being loose and wide enough
to conceal her shape completely and her face hidden beneath a silk
mask he observed that she gradually detached herself from the rest of
the masquers and at length placed herself as if for the advantage of
the air near the door of a chamber which remained open looked
earnestly at him again and then taking an opportunity when the
attention of the company was fixed upon the rest of her party she left
the apartment

mordaunt did not hesitate instantly to follow his mysterious guide for
such we may term the masquer as she paused to let him see the direction
she was about to take and then walked swiftly towards the shore of the
voe or salt-water lake now lying full before them its small
summer-waves glistening and rippling under the influence of a broad
moonlight which added to the strong twilight of those regions during
the summer solstice left no reason to regret the absence of the sun
the path of whose setting was still visible on the waves of the west
while the horizon on the east side was already beginning to glimmer with
the lights of dawn

mordaunt had therefore no difficulty in keeping sight of his disguised
guide as she tripped it over height and hollow to the sea-side and
winding among the rocks led the way to the spot where his own labours
during the time of his former intimacy at burgh-westra had constructed
a sheltered and solitary seat where the daughters of magnus were
accustomed to spend when the weather was suitable a good deal of their
time here then was to be the place of explanation for the masquer
stopped and after a moment's hesitation sat down on the rustic
settle but from the lips of whom was he to receive it norna had first
occurred to him but her tall figure and slow majestic step were
entirely different from the size and gait of the more fairy-formed
siren who had preceded him with as light a trip as if she had been a
real nereid who having remained too late upon the shore was under
the dread of amphitrite's displeasure hastening to regain her native
element since it was not norna it could be only he thought brenda
who thus singled him out and when she had seated herself upon the
bench and taken the mask from her face brenda it accordingly proved to
be mordaunt had certainly done nothing to make him dread her presence
and yet such is the influence of bashfulness over the ingenuous youth
of both sexes that he experienced all the embarrassment of one who
finds himself unexpectedly placed before a person who is justly offended
with him brenda felt no less embarrassment but as she had sought this
interview and was sensible it must be a brief one she was compelled
in spite of herself to begin the conversation

mordaunt she said with a hesitating voice then correcting herself
she proceeded you must be surprised mr mertoun that i should have
taken this uncommon freedom

it was not till this morning brenda replied mordaunt that any mark
of friendship or intimacy from you or from your sister could have
surprised me i am far more astonished that you should shun me without
reason for so many hours than that you should now allow me an
interview in the name of heaven brenda in what have i offended you
or why are we on these unusual terms

may it not be enough to say replied brenda looking downward that
it is my father's pleasure

no it is not enough returned mertoun your father cannot have so
suddenly altered his whole thoughts of me and his whole actions towards
me without acting under the influence of some strong delusion i ask
you but to explain of what nature it is for i will be contented to be
lower in your esteem than the meanest hind in these islands if i cannot
show that his change of opinion is only grounded upon some infamous
deception or some extraordinary mistake

it may be so said brenda i hope it is so that i do hope it is so
my desire to see you thus in private may well prove to you but it is
difficult in short it is impossible for me to explain to you the cause
of my father's resentment norna has spoken with him concerning it
boldly and i fear they parted in displeasure and you well know no
light matter could cause that

i have observed said mordaunt that your father is most attentive to
norna's counsel and more complaisant to her peculiarities than to those
of others this i have observed though he is no willing believer in the
supernatural qualities to which she lays claim

they are related distantly answered brenda and were friends in
youth nay as i have heard it was once supposed they would have been
married but norna's peculiarities showed themselves immediately on her
father's death and there was an end of that matter if ever there was
any thing in it but it is certain my father regards her with much
interest and it is i fear a sign how deeply his prejudices respecting
you must be rooted since they have in some degree quarrelled on your
account

now blessings upon you brenda that you have called them prejudices
said mertoun warmly and hastily a thousand blessings on you you were
ever gentle-hearted you could not have maintained even the show of
unkindness long

it was indeed but a show said brenda softening gradually into the
familiar tone in which they had conversed from infancy i could never
think mordaunt never that is seriously believe that you could say
aught unkind of minna or of me

and who dares to say i have said mordaunt giving way to the natural
impetuosity of his disposition who dares to say that i have and
ventures at the same time to hope that i will suffer his tongue to
remain in safety betwixt his jaws by saint magnus the martyr i will
feed the hawks with it

nay now said brenda your anger only terrifies me and will force
me to leave you

leave me said he without telling me either the calumny or the name
of the villainous calumniator

o there are more than one answered brenda that have possessed my
father with an opinion which i cannot myself tell you but there are
more than one who say  

were they hundreds brenda i will do no less to them than i have
said sacred martyr to accuse me of speaking unkindly of those whom i
most respected and valued under heaven i will back to the apartment
this instant and your father shall do me right before all the world

do not go for the love of heaven said brenda do not go as you
would not render me the most unhappy wretch in existence

tell me then at least if i guess aright said mordaunt when i name
this cleveland for one of those who have slandered me

no no said brenda vehemently you run from one error into another
more dangerous you say you are my friend i am willing to be
yours be but still for a moment and hear what i have to say our
interview has lasted but too long already and every additional moment
brings additional danger with it

tell me then said mertoun much softened by the poor girl's extreme
apprehension and distress what it is that you require of me and
believe me it is impossible for you to ask aught that i will not do my
very uttermost to comply with

well then this captain said brenda this cleveland  

i knew it by heaven said mordaunt my mind assured me that that
fellow was in one way or other at the bottom of all this mischief and
misunderstanding

if you cannot be silent and patient for an instant replied brenda
i must instantly quit you what i meant to say had no relation to you
but to another in one word to my sister minna i have nothing to say
concerning her dislike to you but an anxious tale to tell concerning
his attention to her

it is obvious striking and marked said mordaunt and unless my
eyes deceive me it is received as welcome if indeed it is not
returned

that is the very cause of my fear said brenda i too was struck
with the external appearance frank manners and romantic conversation
of this man

his appearance said mordaunt he is stout and well-featured enough
to be sure but as old sinclair of quendale said to the spanish
admiral farcie on his face i have seen many a fairer hang on the
borough-moor from his manners he might be captain of a privateer
and by his conversation the trumpeter to his own puppetshow for he
speaks of little else than his own exploits

you are mistaken answered brenda he speaks but too well on all that
he has seen and learned besides he has really been in many distant
countries and in many gallant actions and he can tell them with as
much spirit as modesty you would think you saw the flash and heard the
report of the guns and he has other tones of talking too about the
delightful trees and fruits of distant climates and how the people wear
no dress through the whole year half so warm as our summer gowns and
indeed put on little except cambric and muslin

upon my word brenda he does seem to understand the business of
amusing young ladies replied mordaunt

he does indeed said brenda with great simplicity i assure you
that at first i liked him better than minna did and yet though she
is so much cleverer than i am i know more of the world than she does
for i have seen more of cities having been once at kirkwall besides
that i was thrice at lerwick when the dutch ships were there and so i
should not be very easily deceived in people

and pray brenda said mertoun what was it that made you think less
favourably of this young fellow who seems to be so captivating

why said brenda after a moment's reflection at first he was much
livelier and the stories he told were not quite so melancholy or so
terrible and he laughed and danced more

and perhaps at that time danced oftener with brenda than with her
sister added mordaunt

no i am not sure of that said brenda and yet to speak plain i
could have no suspicion of him at all while he was attending quite
equally to us both for you know that then he could have been no more to
us than yourself mordaunt mertoun or young swaraster or any other
young man in the islands

but why then said mordaunt should you not see him with patience
become acquainted with your sister he is wealthy or seems to be so at
least you say he is accomplished and pleasant what else would you
desire in a lover for minna

mordaunt you forget who we are said the maiden assuming an air of
consequence which sat as gracefully upon her simplicity as did the
different tone in which she had spoken hitherto this is a little world
of ours this zetland inferior perhaps in soil and climate to other
parts of the earth at least so strangers say but it is our own little
world and we the daughters of magnus troil hold a first rank in it
it would i think little become us who are descended from sea-kings
and jarls to throw ourselves away upon a stranger who comes to our
coast like the eider-duck in spring from we know not whence and may
leave it in autumn to go we know not where

and who may yet entice a zetland golden-eye to accompany his
migration said mertoun

i will hear nothing light on such a subject replied brenda
indignantly minna like myself is the daughter of magnus troil the
friend of strangers but the father of hialtland he gives them the
hospitality they need but let not the proudest of them think that they
can at their pleasure ally with his house

she said this in a tone of considerable warmth which she instantly
softened as she added no mordaunt do not suppose that minna troil
is capable of so far forgetting what she owes to her father and her
father's blood as to think of marrying this cleveland but she may lend
an ear to him so long as to destroy her future happiness she has that
sort of mind into which some feelings sink deeply you remember how
ulla storlson used to go day by day to the top of vossdale-head to
look for her lover's ship that was never to return when i think of her
slow step her pale cheek her eye that grew dimmer and dimmer like
the lamp that is half extinguished for lack of oil when i remember the
fluttered look of something like hope with which she ascended the
cliff at morning and the deep dead despair which sat on her forehead
when she returned when i think on all this can you wonder that i fear
for minna whose heart is formed to entertain with such deep-rooted
fidelity any affection that may be implanted in it

i do not wonder said mordaunt eagerly sympathizing with the poor
girl for besides the tremulous expression of her voice the light
could almost show him the tear which trembled in her eye as she drew
the picture to which her fancy had assimilated her sister i do not
wonder that you should feel and fear whatever the purest affection can
dictate and if you can but point out to me in what i can serve your
sisterly love you shall find me as ready to venture my life if
necessary as i have been to go out on the crag to get you the eggs of
the guillemot and believe me that whatever has been told to your
father or yourself of my entertaining the slightest thoughts of
disrespect or unkindness is as false as a fiend could devise

i believe it said brenda giving him her hand i believe it and my
bosom is lighter now i have renewed my confidence in so old a friend
how you can aid us i know not but it was by the advice i may say by
the commands of norna that i have ventured to make this communication
and i almost wonder she added as she looked around her that i have
had courage to carry me through it at present you know all that i can
tell you of the risk in which my sister stands look after this
cleveland beware how you quarrel with him since you must so surely
come by the worst with an experienced soldier

i do not exactly understand said the youth how that should so
surely be this i know that with the good limbs and good heart that god
hath given me ay and with a good cause to boot i am little afraid of
any quarrel which cleveland can fix upon me

then if not for your own sake for minna's sake said brenda for
my father's for mine for all our sakes avoid any strife with him but
be contented to watch him and if possible to discover who he is and
what are his intentions towards us he has talked of going to orkney to
enquire after the consort with whom he sailed but day after day and
week after week passes and he goes not and while he keeps my father
company over the bottle and tells minna romantic stories of foreign
people and distant wars in wild and unknown regions the time glides
on and the stranger of whom we know nothing except that he is one
becomes gradually closer and more inseparably intimate in our
society and now farewell norna hopes to make your peace with my
father and entreats you not to leave burgh-westra to-morrow however
cold he and my sister may appear towards you i too she said
stretching her hand towards him must wear a face of cold friendship as
towards an unwelcome visitor but at heart we are still brenda and
mordaunt and now separate quickly for we must not be seen together

she stretched her hand to him but withdrew it in some slight confusion
laughing and blushing when by a natural impulse he was about to press
it to his lips he endeavoured for a moment to detain her for the
interview had for him a degree of fascination which as often as he had
before been alone with brenda he had never experienced but she
extricated herself from him and again signing an adieu and pointing
out to him a path different from that which she was herself about to
take tripped towards the house and was soon hidden from his view by
the acclivity

mordaunt stood gazing after her in a state of mind to which as yet
he had been a stranger the dubious neutral ground between love and
friendship may be long and safely trodden until he who stands upon it
is suddenly called upon to recognise the authority of the one or the
other power and then it most frequently happens that the party who for
years supposed himself only a friend finds himself at once transformed
into a lover that such a change in mordaunt's feelings should take
place from this date although he himself was unable exactly to
distinguish its nature was to be expected he found himself at once
received with the most unsuspicious frankness into the confidence of a
beautiful and fascinating young woman by whom he had so short a time
before imagined himself despised and disliked and if any thing could
make a change in itself so surprising and so pleasing yet more
intoxicating it was the guileless and open-hearted simplicity of
brenda that cast an enchantment over every thing which she did or said
the scene too might have had its effect though there was little
occasion for its aid but a fair face looks yet fairer under the light
of the moon and a sweet voice sounds yet sweeter among the whispering
sounds of a summer night mordaunt therefore who had by this time
returned to the house was disposed to listen with unusual patience and
complacency to the enthusiastic declamation pronounced upon moonlight by
claud halcro whose ecstasies had been awakened on the subject by a
short turn in the open air undertaken to qualify the vapours of the
good liquor which he had not spared during the festival

the sun my boy he said is every wretched labourer's
day-lantern it comes glaring yonder out of the east to summon up a
whole world to labour and to misery whereas the merry moon lights all
of us to mirth and to love

and to madness or she is much belied said mordaunt by way of saying
something

let it be so answered halcro so she does not turn us
melancholy-mad my dear young friend the folks of this painstaking
world are far too anxious about possessing all their wits or having
them as they say about them at least i know i have been often called
half-witted and i am sure i have gone through the world as well as if i
had double the quantity but stop where was i o touching and
concerning the moon why man she is the very soul of love and poetry
i question if there was ever a true lover in existence who had not got
at least as far as o thou in a sonnet in her praise

the moon said the factor who was now beginning to speak very thick
ripens corn at least the old folk said so and she fills nuts also
whilk is of less matter sparge nuces pueri

a fine a fine said the udaller who was now in his altitudes the
factor speaks greek by the bones of my holy namesake saint magnus he
shall drink off the yawl full of punch unless he gives us a song on the
spot

too much water drowned the miller answered triptolemus my brain has
more need of draining than of being drenched with more liquor

sing then said the despotic landlord for no one shall speak any
other language here save honest norse jolly dutch or danske or broad
scots at the least of it so eric scambester produce the yawl and
fill it to the brim as a charge for demurrage

ere the vessel could reach the agriculturist he seeing it under way
and steering towards him by short tacks for scambester himself was by
this time not over steady in his course made a desperate effort and
began to sing or rather to croak forth a yorkshire harvest-home
ballad which his father used to sing when he was a little mellow and
which went to the tune of hey dobbin away with the waggon the rueful
aspect of the singer and the desperately discordant tones of his voice
formed so delightful a contrast with the jollity of the words and tune
that honest triptolemus afforded the same sort of amusement which a
reveller might give by appearing on a festival-day in the holyday-coat
of his grandfather the jest concluded the evening for even the mighty
and strong-headed magnus himself had confessed the influence of the
sleepy god the guests went off as they best might each to his separate
crib and resting place and in a short time the mansion which was of
late so noisy was hushed into perfect silence

shakspeare




chapter xvii

 they man their boats and all the young men arm
 with whatsoever might the monsters harm
 pikes halberds spits and darts that wound afar
 the tools of peace and implements of war
 now was the time for vigorous lads to show
 what love or honour could incite them to 
 a goodly theatre where rocks are round
 with reverend age and lovely lasses crown'd

 battle of the summer islands


the morning which succeeds such a feast as that of magnus troil usually
lacks a little of the zest which seasoned the revels of the preceding
day as the fashionable reader may have observed at a public breakfast
during the race-week in a country town for in what is called the best
society these lingering moments are usually spent by the company each
apart in their own dressing-rooms at burgh-westra it will readily be
believed no such space for retirement was afforded and the lasses
with their paler cheeks the elder dames with many a wink and yawn
were compelled to meet with their male companions headaches and all
just three hours after they had parted from each other

eric scambester had done all that man could do to supply the full means
of diverting the ennui of the morning meal the board groaned with
rounds of hung beef made after the fashion of zetland with
pasties with baked meats with fish dressed and cured in every
possible manner nay with the foreign delicacies of tea coffee and
chocolate for as we have already had occasion to remark the situation
of these islands made them early acquainted with various articles of
foreign luxury which were as yet but little known in scotland where
at a much later period than that we write of one pound of green tea was
dressed like cabbage and another converted into a vegetable sauce for
salt beef by the ignorance of the good housewives to whom they had been
sent as rare presents

besides these preparations the table exhibited whatever mighty potions
are resorted to by bons vivans under the facetious name of a hair of
the dog that bit you there was the potent irish usquebaugh right
nantz genuine schiedamm aquavitæ from caithness and golden wasser
from hamburgh there was rum of formidable antiquity and cordials from
the leeward islands after these details it were needless to mention
the stout home-brewed ale the german mum and schwartz beer and still
more would it be beneath our dignity to dwell upon the innumerable sorts
of pottage and flummery together with the bland and various
preparations of milk for those who preferred thinner potations

no wonder that the sight of so much good cheer awakened the appetite and
raised the spirits of the fatigued revellers the young men began
immediately to seek out their partners of the preceding evening and to
renew the small talk which had driven the night so merrily away while
magnus with his stout old norse kindred encouraged by precept and
example those of elder days and graver mood to a substantial
flirtation with the good things before them still however there was
a long period to be filled up before dinner for the most protracted
breakfast cannot well last above an hour and it was to be feared that
claud halcro meditated the occupation of this vacant morning with a
formidable recitation of his own verses besides telling at its full
length the whole history of his introduction to glorious john dryden
but fortune relieved the guests of burgh-westra from this threatened
infliction by sending them means of amusement peculiarly suited to
their taste and habits

most of the guests were using their toothpicks some were beginning to
talk of what was to be done next when with haste in his step fire in
his eye and a harpoon in his hand eric scambester came to announce to
the company that there was a whale on shore or nearly so at the
throat of the voe then you might have seen such a joyous boisterous
and universal bustle as only the love of sport so deeply implanted in
our nature can possibly inspire a set of country squires about to
beat for the first woodcocks of the season were a comparison as petty
in respect to the glee as in regard to the importance of the object
the battue upon a strong cover in ettrick forest for the destruction
of the foxesm the insurrection of the sportsmen of the lennox when
one of the duke's deer gets out from inch-mirran nay the joyous rally
of the fox-chase itself with all its blithe accompaniments of hound and
horn fall infinitely short of the animation with which the gallant sons
of thule set off to encounter the monster whom the sea had sent for
their amusement at so opportune a conjuncture

the multifarious stores of burgh-westra were rummaged hastily for all
sorts of arms which could be used on such an occasion harpoons
swords pikes and halberds fell to the lot of some others contented
themselves with hay-forks spits and whatever else could be found that
was at once long and sharp thus hastily equipped one division under
the command of captain cleveland hastened to man the boats which lay in
the little haven while the rest of the party hurried by land to the
scene of action

poor triptolemus was interrupted in a plan which he too had formed
against the patience of the zetlanders and which was to have consisted
in a lecture upon the agriculture and the capabilities of the country
by this sudden hubbub which put an end at once to halcro's poetry and
to his no less formidable prose it may be easily imagined that he took
very little interest in the sport which was so suddenly substituted for
his lucubrations and he would not even have deigned to have looked upon
the active scene which was about to take place had he not been
stimulated thereunto by the exhortations of mistress baby pit yoursell
forward man said that provident person pit yoursell forward wha
kens whare a blessing may light they say that a men share and share
equals-aquals in the creature's ulzie and a pint o't wad be worth
siller to light the cruise in the lang dark nights that they speak of
pit yoursell forward man there's a graip to ye faint heart never wan
fair lady wha kens but what when it's fresh it may eat weel eneugh
and spare butter

what zeal was added to triptolemus's motions by the prospect of eating
fresh train-oil instead of butter we know not but as better might
not be he brandished the rural implement a stable-fork with which he
was armed and went down to wage battle with the whale

the situation in which the enemy's ill fate had placed him was
particularly favourable to the enterprise of the islanders a tide of
unusual height had carried the animal over a large bar of sand into the
voe or creek in which he was now lying so soon as he found the water
ebbing he became sensible of his danger and had made desperate efforts
to get over the shallow water where the waves broke on the bar but
hitherto he had rather injured than mended his condition having got
himself partly aground and lying therefore particularly exposed to the
meditated attack at this moment the enemy came down upon him the front
ranks consisted of the young and hardy armed in the miscellaneous
manner we have described while to witness and animate their efforts
the young women and the elderly persons of both sexes took their place
among the rocks which overhung the scene of action

as the boats had to double a little headland ere they opened the mouth
of the voe those who came by land to the shores of the inlet had time
to make the necessary reconnoissances upon the force and situation of
the enemy on whom they were about to commence a simultaneous attack by
land and sea

this duty the stout-hearted and experienced general for so the udaller
might be termed would intrust to no eyes but his own and indeed his
external appearance and his sage conduct rendered him alike qualified
for the command which he enjoyed his gold-laced hat was exchanged for a
bearskin cap his suit of blue broadcloth with its scarlet lining and
loops and frogs of bullion had given place to a red flannel jacket
with buttons of black horn over which he wore a seal-skin shirt
curiously seamed and plaited on the bosom such as are used by the
esquimaux and sometimes by the greenland whale-fishers sea-boots of a
formidable size completed his dress and in his hand he held a large
whaling-knife which he brandished as if impatient to employ it in the
operation of flinching the huge animal which lay before them that
is the act of separating its flesh from its bones upon closer
examination however he was obliged to confess that the sport to which
he had conducted his friends however much it corresponded with the
magnificent scale of his hospitality was likely to be attended with its
own peculiar dangers and difficulties

the animal upwards of sixty feet in length was lying perfectly still
in a deep part of the voe into which it had weltered and where it
seemed to await the return of tide of which it was probably assured by
instinct a council of experienced harpooners was instantly called and
it was agreed that an effort should be made to noose the tail of this
torpid leviathan by casting a cable around it to be made fast by
anchors to the shore and thus to secure against his escape in case the
tide should make before they were able to dispatch him three boats were
destined to this delicate piece of service one of which the udaller
himself proposed to command while cleveland and mertoun were to direct
the two others this being decided they sat down on the strand waiting
with impatience until the naval part of the force should arrive in the
voe it was during this interval that triptolemus yellowley after
measuring with his eyes the extraordinary size of the whale observed
that in his poor mind a wain with six owsen or with sixty owsen
either if they were the owsen of the country could not drag siccan a
huge creature from the water where it was now lying to the sea-beach

trifling as this remark may seem to the reader it was connected with a
subject which always fired the blood of the old udaller who glancing
upon triptolemus a quick and stern look asked him what the devil it
signified supposing a hundred oxen could not drag the whale upon the
beach mr yellowley though not much liking the tone with which the
question was put felt that his dignity and his profit compelled him to
answer as follows nay sir you know yoursell master magnus troil
and every one knows that knows any thing that whales of siccan size as
may not be masterfully dragged on shore by the instrumentality of one
wain with six owsen are the right and property of the admiral who is
at this time the same noble lord who is moreover chamberlain of these
isles

and i tell you mr triptolemus yellowley said the udaller as i
would tell your master if he were here that every man who risks his
life to bring that fish ashore shall have an equal share and partition
according to our ancient and loveable norse custom and wont nay if
there is so much as a woman looking on that will but touch the cable
she will be partner with us ay and more than all that if she will but
say there is a reason for it we will assign a portion to the babe that
is unbornn

the strict principle of equity which dictated this last arrangement
occasioned laughter among the men and some slight confusion among the
women the factor however thought it shame to be so easily daunted
suum cuique tribuito said he i will stand for my lord's right and
my own

will you replied magnus then by the martyr's bones you shall have
no law of partition but that of god and saint olave which we had before
either factor or treasurer or chamberlain were heard of all shall
share that lend a hand and never a one else so you master factor
shall be busy as well as other folk and think yourself lucky to share
like other folk jump into that boat for the boats had by this time
pulled round the headland and you my lads make way for the factor
in the stern-sheets he shall be the first man this blessed day that
shall strike the fish

the loud authoritative voice and the habit of absolute command inferred
in the udaller's whole manner together with the conscious want of
favourers and backers amongst the rest of the company rendered it
difficult for triptolemus to evade compliance although he was thus
about to be placed in a situation equally novel and perilous he was
still however hesitating and attempting an explanation with a voice
in which anger was qualified by fear and both thinly disguised under an
attempt to be jocular and to represent the whole as a jest when he
heard the voice of baby maundering in his ear wad he lose his share
of the ulzie and the lang zetland winter coming on when the lightest
day in december is not so clear as a moonless night in the mearns

this domestic instigation in addition to those of fear of the udaller
and shame to seem less courageous than others so inflamed the
agriculturist's spirits that he shook his graip aloft and entered
the boat with the air of neptune himself carrying on high his trident

the three boats destined for this perilous service now approached the
dark mass which lay like an islet in the deepest part of the voe and
suffered them to approach without showing any sign of animation
silently and with such precaution as the extreme delicacy of the
operation required the intrepid adventurers after the failure of their
first attempt and the expenditure of considerable time succeeded in
casting a cable around the body of the torpid monster and in carrying
the ends of it ashore when an hundred hands were instantly employed in
securing them but ere this was accomplished the tide began to make
fast and the udaller informed his assistants that either the fish must
be killed or at least greatly wounded ere the depth of water on the
bar was sufficient to float him or that he was not unlikely to escape
from their joint prowess

wherefore said he we must set to work and the factor shall have
the honour to make the first throw

the valiant triptolemus caught the word and it is necessary to say that
the patience of the whale in suffering himself to be noosed without
resistance had abated his terrors and very much lowered the creature
in his opinion he protested the fish had no more wit and scarcely more
activity than a black snail and influenced by this undue contempt of
the adversary he waited neither for a further signal nor a better
weapon nor a more suitable position but rising in his energy hurled
his graip with all his force against the unfortunate monster the boats
had not yet retreated from him to the distance necessary to ensure
safety when this injudicious commencement of the war took place

magnus troil who had only jested with the factor and had reserved the
launching the first spear against the whale to some much more skilful
hand had just time to exclaim mind yourselves lads or we are all
swamped when the monster roused at once from inactivity by the blow
of the factor's missile blew with a noise resembling the explosion of
a steam-engine a huge shower of water into the air and at the same
time began to lash the waves with his tail in every direction the boat
in which magnus presided received the shower of brine which the animal
spouted aloft and the adventurous triptolemus who had a full share of
the immersion was so much astonished and terrified by the consequences
of his own valorous deed that he tumbled backwards amongst the feet of
the people who too busy to attend to him were actively engaged in
getting the boat into shoal water out of the whale's reach here he lay
for some minutes trampled on by the feet of the boatmen until they lay
on their oars to bale when the udaller ordered them to pull to shore
and land this spare hand who had commenced the fishing so
inauspiciously

while this was doing the other boats had also pulled off to safer
distance and now from these as well as from the shore the unfortunate
native of the deep was overwhelmed by all kinds of missiles harpoons
and spears flew against him on all sides guns were fired and each
various means of annoyance plied which could excite him to exhaust his
strength in useless rage when the animal found that he was locked in by
shallows on all sides and became sensible at the same time of the
strain of the cable on his body the convulsive efforts which he made to
escape accompanied with sounds resembling deep and loud groans would
have moved the compassion of all but a practised whale-fisher the
repeated showers which he spouted into the air began now to be mingled
with blood and the waves which surrounded him assumed the same crimson
appearance meantime the attempts of the assailants were redoubled but
mordaunt mertoun and cleveland in particular exerted themselves to the
uttermost contending who should display most courage in approaching the
monster so tremendous in its agonies and should inflict the most deep
and deadly wounds upon its huge bulk

the contest seemed at last pretty well over for although the animal
continued from time to time to make frantic exertions for liberty yet
its strength appeared so much exhausted that even with the assistance
of the tide which had now risen considerably it was thought it could
scarcely extricate itself

magnus gave the signal to venture nearer to the whale calling out at
the same time close in lads he is not half so mad now the factor
may look for a winter's oil for the two lamps at harfra pull close in
lads

ere his orders could be obeyed the other two boats had anticipated his
purpose and mordaunt mertoun eager to distinguish himself above
cleveland had with the whole strength he possessed plunged a
half-pike into the body of the animal but the leviathan like a nation
whose resources appear totally exhausted by previous losses and
calamities collected his whole remaining force for an effort which
proved at once desperate and successful the wound last received had
probably reached through his external defences of blubber and attained
some very sensitive part of the system for he roared aloud as he sent
to the sky a mingled sheet of brine and blood and snapping the strong
cable like a twig overset mertoun's boat with a blow of his tail shot
himself by a mighty effort over the bar upon which the tide had now
risen considerably and made out to sea carrying with him a whole grove
of the implements which had been planted in his body and leaving behind
him on the waters a dark red trace of his course

there goes to sea your cruise of oil master yellowley said magnus
and you must consume mutton suet or go to bed in the dark

operam et oleum perdidi muttered triptolemus but if they catch me
whale-fishing again i will consent that the fish shall swallow me as he
did jonah

but where is mordaunt mertoun all this while exclaimed claud halcro
and it was instantly perceived that the youth who had been stunned when
his boat was stove was unable to swim to shore as the other sailors
did and now floated senseless upon the waves

we have noticed the strange and inhuman prejudice which rendered the
zetlanders of that period unwilling to assist those whom they saw in the
act of drowning though that is the calamity to which the islanders are
most frequently exposed three men however soared above this
superstition the first was claud halcro who threw himself from a small
rock headlong into the waves forgetting as he himself afterwards
stated that he could not swim and if possessed of the harp of arion
had no dolphins in attendance the first plunge which the poet made in
deep water reminding him of these deficiencies he was fain to cling to
the rock from which he had dived and was at length glad to regain the
shore at the expense of a ducking

magnus troil whose honest heart forgot his late coolness towards
mordaunt when he saw the youth's danger would instantly have brought
him more effectual aid but eric scambester held him fast

hout sir hout exclaimed that faithful attendant captain cleveland
has a grip of mr mordaunt just let the twa strangers help ilk other
and stand by the upshot the light of the country is not to be quenched
for the like of them bide still sir i say bredness voe is not a bowl
of punch that a man can be fished out of like a toast with a long
spoon

this sage remonstrance would have been altogether lost upon magnus had
he not observed that cleveland had in fact jumped out of the boat and
swum to mertoun's assistance and was keeping him afloat till the boat
came to the aid of both as soon as the immediate danger which called so
loudly for assistance was thus ended the honest udaller's desire to
render aid terminated also and recollecting the cause of offence which
he had or thought he had against mordaunt mertoun he shook off his
butler's hold and turning round scornfully from the beach called eric
an old fool for supposing that he cared whether the young fellow sank or
swam

still however amid his assumed indifference magnus could not help
peeping over the heads of the circle which surrounding mordaunt as
soon as he was brought on shore were charitably employed in
endeavouring to recall him to life and he was not able to attain the
appearance of absolute unconcern until the young man sat up on the
beach and showed plainly that the accident had been attended with no
material consequences it was then first that cursing the assistants
for not giving the lad a glass of brandy he walked sullenly away as
if totally unconcerned in his fate

the women always accurate in observing the telltale emotions of each
other failed not to remark that when the sisters of burgh-westra saw
mordaunt immersed in the waves minna grew as pale as death while
brenda uttered successive shrieks of terror but though there were some
nods winks and hints that auld acquaintance were not easily forgot it
was on the whole candidly admitted that less than such marks of
interest could scarce have been expected when they saw the companion of
their early youth in the act of perishing before their eyes

whatever interest mordaunt's condition excited while it seemed perilous
began to abate as he recovered himself and when his senses were fully
restored only claud halcro with two or three others were standing by
him about ten paces off stood cleveland his hair and clothes dropping
water and his features wearing so peculiar an expression as
immediately to arrest the attention of mordaunt there was a suppressed
smile on his cheek and a look of pride in his eye that implied
liberation from a painful restraint and something resembling gratified
scorn claud halcro hastened to intimate to mordaunt that he owed his
life to cleveland and the youth rising from the ground and losing all
other feelings in those of gratitude stepped forward with his hand
stretched out to offer his warmest thanks to his preserver but he
stopped short in surprise as cleveland retreating a pace or two
folded his arms on his breast and declined to accept his proffered
hand he drew back in turn and gazed with astonishment at the
ungracious manner and almost insulting look with which cleveland who
had formerly rather expressed a frank cordiality or at least openness
of bearing now after having thus rendered him a most important
service chose to receive his thanks

it is enough said cleveland observing his surprise and it is
unnecessary to say more about it i have paid back my debt and we are
now equal

you are more than equal with me captain cleveland answered mertoun
because you endangered your life to do for me what i did for you
without the slightest risk besides he added trying to give the
discourse a more pleasant turn i have your rifle-gun to boot

cowards only count danger for any point of the game said cleveland
danger has been my consort for life and sailed with me on a thousand
worse voyages and for rifles i have enough of my own and you may
see when you will which can use them best

there was something in the tone with which this was said that struck
mordaunt strongly it was miching malicho as hamlet says and meant
mischief cleveland saw his surprise came close up to him and spoke in
a low tone of voice hark ye my young brother there is a custom
among us gentlemen of fortune that when we follow the same chase and
take the wind out of each other's sails we think sixty yards of the
sea-beach and a brace of rifles are no bad way of making our odds
even

i do not understand you captain cleveland said mordaunt

i do not suppose you do i did not suppose you would said the
captain and turning on his heel with a smile that resembled a sneer
mordaunt saw him mingle with the guests and very soon beheld him at
the side of minna who was talking to him with animated features that
seemed to thank him for his gallant and generous conduct

if it were not for brenda thought mordaunt i almost wish he had
left me in the voe for no one seems to care whether i am alive or
dead two rifles and sixty yards of sea-beach is that what he points
at it may come but not on the day he has saved my life with risk of
his own

while he was thus musing eric scambester was whispering to halcro if
these two lads do not do each other a mischief there is no faith in
freits master mordaunt saves cleveland well cleveland in requital
has turned all the sunshine of burgh-westra to his own side of the
house and think what it is to lose favour in such a house as this
where the punch-kettle is never allowed to cool well now that
cleveland in his turn has been such a fool as to fish mordaunt out of
the voe see if he does not give him sour sillocks for stock-fish

pshaw pshaw replied the poet that is all old women's fancies my
friend eric for what says glorious dryden sainted john 

 the yellow gall that in your bosom floats
 engenders all these melancholy thoughts

saint john or saint james either may be mistaken in the matter said
eric for i think neither of them lived in zetland i only say that if
there is faith in old saws these two lads will do each other a
mischief and if they do i trust it will light on mordaunt mertoun

and why eric scambester said halcro hastily and angrily should
you wish ill to that poor young man that is worth fifty of the other

let every one roose the ford as he finds it replied eric master
mordaunt is all for wan water like his old dog-fish of a father now
captain cleveland d'ye see takes his glass like an honest fellow and
a gentleman

rightly reasoned and in thine own division said halcro and breaking
off their conversation took his way back to burgh-westra to which the
guests of magnus were now returning discussing as they went with much
animation the various incidents of their attack upon the whale and not
a little scandalized that it should have baffled all their exertions

i hope captain donderdrecht of the eintracht of rotterdam will never
hear of it said magnus he would swear donner and blitzen we were
only fit to fish flounders

chapter xviii

 and helter-skelter have i rode to thee
 and tidings do i bring and lucky joys
 and golden times and happy news of price

 ancient pistol


fortune who seems at times to bear a conscience owed the hospitable
udaller some amends and accordingly repaid to burgh-westra the
disappointment occasioned by the unsuccessful whale-fishing by sending
thither on the evening of the day in which that incident happened no
less a person than the jagger or travelling merchant as he styled
himself bryce snailsfoot who arrived in great pomp himself on one
pony and his pack of goods swelled to nearly double its usual size
forming the burden of another which was led by a bare-headed
bare-legged boy

as bryce announced himself the bearer of important news he was
introduced to the dining apartment where for that primitive age was no
respecter of persons he was permitted to sit down at a side-table and
amply supplied with provisions and good liquor while the attentive
hospitality of magnus permitted no questions to be put to him until
his hunger and thirst appeased he announced with the sense of
importance attached to distant travels that he had just yesterday
arrived at lerwick from kirkwall the capital of orkney and would have
been here yesterday but it blew hard off the fitful-head

we had no wind here said magnus

there is somebody has not been sleeping then said the pedlar and
her name begins with n but heaven is above all

but the news from orkney bryce instead of croaking about a capful of
wind

such news replied bryce as has not been heard this thirty
years not since cromwell's time

there is not another revolution is there said halcro king james
has not come back as blithe as king charlie did has he

it's news replied the pedlar that are worth twenty kings and
kingdoms to boot of them for what good did the evolutions ever do us
and i dare say we have seen a dozen great and sma

are any indiamen come north about said magnus troil

ye are nearer the mark fowd said the jagger but it is nae
indiaman but a gallant armed vessel chokeful of merchandise that they
part with so easy that a decent man like my sell can afford to give the
country the best pennyworths you ever saw and that you will say when i
open that pack for i count to carry it back another sort lighter than
when i brought it here

ay ay bryce said the udaller you must have had good bargains if
you sell cheap but what ship was it

cannot justly say i spoke to nobody but the captain who was a
discreet man but she had been down on the spanish main for she has
silks and satins and tobacco i warrant you and wine and no lack of
sugar and bonny-wallies baith of silver and gowd and a bonnie
dredging of gold dust into the bargain

what like was she said cleveland who seemed to give much attention

a stout ship said the itinerant merchant schooner-rigged sails
like a dolphin they say carries twelve guns and is pierced for
twenty

did you hear the captain's name said cleveland speaking rather lower
than his usual tone

i just ca'd him the captain replied bryce snailsfoot for i make it
a rule never to ask questions of them i deal with in the way of trade
for there is many an honest captain begging your pardon captain
cleveland that does not care to have his name tacked to his title and
as lang as we ken what bargains we are making what signifies it wha we
are making them wi ye ken

bryce snailsfoot is a cautious man said the udaller laughing he
knows a fool may ask more questions than a wise man cares to answer

i have dealt with the fair traders in my day replied snailsfoot and
i ken nae use in blurting braid out with a man's name at every moment
but i will uphold this gentleman to be a gallant commander ay and a
kind one too for every one of his crew is as brave in apparel as
himself nearly the very foremast-men have their silken scarfs i have
seen many a lady wear a warse and think hersell nae sma drink and for
siller buttons and buckles and the lave of sic vanities there is nae
end of them

idiots muttered cleveland between his teeth and then added i
suppose they are often ashore to show all their bravery to the lasses
of kirkwall

ne'er a bit of that are they the captain will scarce let them stir
ashore without the boatswain go in the boat as rough a tarpaulin as
ever swabb'd a deck and you may as weel catch a cat without her claws
as him without his cutlass and his double brace of pistols about him
every man stands as much in awe of him as of the commander himsell

that must be hawkins or the devil said cleveland

aweel captain replied the jagger be he the tane or the tither or
a wee bit o baith mind it is you that give him these names and not
i

why captain cleveland said the udaller this may prove the very
consort you spoke of

they must have had some good luck then said cleveland to put them
in better plight than when i left them did they speak of having lost
their consort pedlar

in troth did they said bryce that is they said something about a
partner that had gone down to davie jones in these seas

and did you tell them what you knew of her said the udaller

and wha the deevil wad hae been the fule then said the pedlar that
i suld say sae when they kend what came of the ship the next question
wad have been about the cargo and ye wad not have had me bring down an
armed vessel on the coast to harrie the poor folk about a wheen rags of
duds that the sea flung upon their shores

besides what might have been found in your own pack you scoundrel
said magnus troil an observation which produced a loud laugh the
udaller could not help joining in the hilarity which applauded his jest
but instantly composing his countenance he said in an unusually grave
tone you may laugh my friends but this is a matter which brings both
a curse and a shame on the country and till we learn to regard the
rights of them that suffer by the winds and waves we shall deserve to
be oppressed and hag-ridden as we have been and are by the superior
strength of the strangers who rule us

the company hung their heads at the rebuke of magnus troil perhaps
some even of the better class might be conscience-struck on their own
account and all of them were sensible that the appetite for plunder on
the part of the tenants and inferiors was not at all times restrained
with sufficient strictness but cleveland made answer gaily if these
honest fellows be my comrades i will answer for them that they will
never trouble the country about a parcel of chests hammocks and such
trumpery that the roost may have washed ashore out of my poor sloop
what signifies to them whether the trash went to bryce snailsfoot or to
the bottom or to the devil so unbuckle thy pack bryce and show the
ladies thy cargo and perhaps we may see something that will please
them

it cannot be his consort said brenda in a whisper to her sister he
would have shown more joy at her appearance

it must be the vessel answered minna i saw his eye glisten at the
thought of being again united to the partner of his dangers

perhaps it glistened said her sister still apart at the thought of
leaving zetland it is difficult to guess the thought of the heart from
the glance of the eye

judge not at least unkindly of a friend's thought said minna and
then brenda if you are mistaken the fault rests not with you

during this dialogue bryce snailsfoot was busied in uncoiling the
carefully arranged cordage of his pack which amounted to six good yards
of dressed seal-skin curiously complicated and secured by all manner of
knots and buckles he was considerably interrupted in the task by the
udaller and others who pressed him with questions respecting the
stranger vessel

were the officers often ashore and how were they received by the
people of kirkwall said magnus troil

excellently well answered bryce snailsfoot and the captain and one
or two of his men had been at some of the vanities and dances which went
forward in the town but there had been some word about customs or
king's duties or the like and some of the higher folk that took upon
them as magistrates or the like had had words with the captain and he
refused to satisfy them and then it is like he was more coldly looked
on and he spoke of carrying the ship round to stromness or the
langhope for she lay under the guns of the battery at kirkwall but he
bryce thought she wad bide at kirkwall till the summer-fair was over
for all that

the orkney gentry said magnus troil are always in a hurry to draw
the scotch collar tighter round their own necks is it not enough that
we must pay scat and wattle which were all the public dues under
our old norse government but must they come over us with king's dues
and customs besides it is the part of an honest man to resist these
things i have done so all my life and will do so to the end of it

there was a loud jubilee and shout of applause among the guests who
were some of them at least better pleased with magnus troil's
latitudinarian principles with respect to the public revenue which
were extremely natural to those living in so secluded a situation and
subjected to many additional exactions than they had been with the
rigour of his judgment on the subject of wrecked goods but minna's
inexperienced feelings carried her farther than her father while she
whispered to brenda not unheard by cleveland that the tame spirit of
the orcadians had missed every chance which late incidents had given
them to emancipate these islands from the scottish yoke

why she said should we not under so many changes as late times
have introduced have seized the opportunity to shake off an allegiance
which is not justly due from us and to return to the protection of
denmark our parent country why should we yet hesitate to do this but
that the gentry of orkney have mixed families and friendship so much
with our invaders that they have become dead to the throb of the heroic
norse blood which they derived from their ancestors

the latter part of this patriotic speech happened to reach the
astonished ears of our friend triptolemus who having a sincere
devotion for the protestant succession and the revolution as
established was surprised into the ejaculation as the old cock crows
the young cock learns hen i should say mistress and i crave your
pardon if i say any thing amiss in either gender but it is a happy
country where the father declares against the king's customs and the
daughter against the king's crown and in my judgment it can end in
naething but trees and tows

trees are scarce among us said magnus and for ropes we need them
for our rigging and cannot spare them to be shirt-collars

and whoever said the captain takes umbrage at what this young lady
says had better keep his ears and tongue for a safer employment than
such an adventure

ay ay said triptolemus it helps the matter much to speak truths
whilk are as unwelcome to a proud stomach as wet clover to a cow's in a
land where lads are ready to draw the whittle if a lassie but looks
awry but what manners are to be expected in a country where folk call a
pleugh-sock a markal

hark ye master yellowley said the captain smiling i hope my
manners are not among those abuses which you come hither to reform any
experiment on them may be dangerous

as well as difficult said triptolemus dryly but fear nothing
captain cleveland from my remonstrances my labours regard the men and
things of the earth and not the men and things of the sea you are not
of my element

let us be friends then old clod-compeller said the captain

clod-compeller said the agriculturist bethinking himself of the
lore of his earlier days clod-compeller pro cloud-compeller
greek nephelêgeréta zeuso græcum est in which voyage came
you by that phrase

i have travelled books as well as seas in my day said the captain
but my last voyages have been of a sort to make me forget my early
cruizes through classic knowledge but come here bryce hast cast off
the lashing come all hands and let us see if he has aught in his
cargo that is worth looking upon

with a proud and at the same time a wily smile did the crafty pedlar
display a collection of wares far superior to those which usually filled
his packages and in particular some stuffs and embroideries of such
beauty and curiosity fringed flowered and worked with such art and
magnificence upon foreign and arabesque patterns that the sight might
have dazzled a far more brilliant company than the simple race of thule
all beheld and admired while mistress baby yellowley holding up her
hands protested it was a sin even to look upon such extravagance and
worse than murder so much as to ask the price of them

others however were more courageous and the prices demanded by the
merchant if they were not as he himself declared something just more
than nothing short only of an absolute free gift of his wares were
nevertheless so moderate as to show that he himself must have made an
easy acquisition of the goods judging by the rate at which he offered
to part with them accordingly the cheapness of the articles created a
rapid sale for in zetland as well as elsewhere wise folk buy more
from the prudential desire to secure a good bargain than from any real
occasion for the purchase the lady glowrowrum bought seven petticoats
and twelve stomachers on this sole principle and other matrons present
rivalled her in this sagacious species of economy the udaller was also
a considerable purchaser but the principal customer for whatever could
please the eye of beauty was the gallant captain cleveland who
rummaged the jagger's stores in selecting presents for the ladies of the
party in which minna and brenda troil were especially remembered

i fear said magnus troil that the young women are to consider these
pretty presents as keepsakes and that all this liberality is only a
sure sign we are soon to lose you

this question seemed to embarrass him to whom it was put

i scarce know he said with some hesitation whether this vessel is
my consort or no i must take a trip to kirkwall to make sure of that
matter and then i hope to return to dunrossness to bid you all
farewell

in that case said the udaller after a moment's pause i think i may
carry you thither i should be at the kirkwall fair to settle with the
merchants i have consigned my fish to and i have often promised minna
and brenda that they should see the fair perhaps also your consort or
these strangers whoever they be may have some merchandise that will
suit me i love to see my rigging-loft well stocked with goods almost
as much as to see it full of dancers we will go to orkney in my own
brig and i can offer you a hammock if you will

the offer seemed so acceptable to cleveland that after pouring himself
forth in thanks he seemed determined to mark his joy by exhausting
bryce snailsfoot's treasures in liberality to the company the contents
of a purse of gold were transferred to the jagger with a facility and
indifference on the part of its former owner which argued either the
greatest profusion or consciousness of superior and inexhaustible
wealth so that baby whispered to her brother that if he could afford
to fling away money at this rate the lad had made a better voyage in a
broken ship than all the skippers of dundee had made in their haill
anes for a twelvemonth past

but the angry feeling in which she made this remark was much mollified
when cleveland whose object it seemed that evening to be to buy golden
opinions of all sorts of men approached her with a garment somewhat
resembling in shape the scottish plaid but woven of a sort of wool so
soft that it felt to the touch as if it were composed of eider-down
this he said was a part of a spanish lady's dress called a
mantilla as it would exactly fit the size of mrs baby yellowley and
was very well suited for the fogs of the climate of zetland he
entreated her to wear it for his sake the lady with as much
condescending sweetness as her countenance was able to express not only
consented to receive this mark of gallantry but permitted the donor to
arrange the mantilla upon her projecting and bony shoulder-blades
where said claud halcro it hung for all the world as if it had been
stretched betwixt a couple of cloak-pins

while the captain was performing this piece of courtesy much to the
entertainment of the company which it may be presumed was his
principal object from the beginning mordaunt mertoun made purchase of a
small golden chaplet with the private intention of presenting it to
brenda when he should find an opportunity the price was fixed and the
article laid aside claud halcro also showed some desire of possessing a
silver box of antique shape for depositing tobacco which he was in the
habit of using in considerable quantity but the bard seldom had current
coin in promptitude and indeed in his wandering way of life had
little occasion for any and bryce on the other hand his having been
hitherto a ready-money trade protested that his very moderate profits
upon such rare and choice articles would not allow of his affording
credit to the purchaser mordaunt gathered the import of this
conversation from the mode in which they whispered together while the
bard seemed to advance a wishful finger towards the box in question and
the cautious pedlar detained it with the weight of his whole hand as if
he had been afraid it would literally make itself wings and fly into
claud halcro's pocket mordaunt mertoun at this moment desirous to
gratify an old acquaintance laid the price of the box on the table and
said he would not permit master halcro to purchase that box as he had
settled in his own mind to make him a present of it

i cannot think of robbing you my dear young friend said the poet
but the truth is that that same box does remind me strangely of
glorious john's out of which i had the honour to take a pinch at the
wits coffeehouse for which i think more highly of my right-hand finger
and thumb than any other part of my body only you must allow me to pay
you back the price when my urkaster stock-fish come to market

settle that as you like betwixt you said the jagger taking up
mordaunt's money the box is bought and sold

and how dare you sell over again said captain cleveland suddenly
interfering what you already have sold to me

all were surprised at this interjection which was hastily made as
cleveland having turned from mistress baby had become suddenly and
as it seemed not without emotion aware what articles bryce snailsfoot
was now disposing of to this short and fierce question the jagger
afraid to contradict a customer of his description answered only by
stammering that the lord knew he meant nae offence

how sir no offence said the seaman and dispose of my property
extending his hand at the same time to the box and chaplet restore the
young gentleman's money and learn to keep your course on the meridian
of honesty

the jagger confused and reluctant pulled out his leathern pouch to
repay to mordaunt the money he had just deposited in it but the youth
was not to be so satisfied

the articles he said were bought and sold these were your own
words bryce snailsfoot in master halcro's hearing and i will suffer
neither you nor any other to deprive me of my property

your property young man said cleveland it is mine i spoke to
bryce respecting them an instant before i turned from the table

i i i had not just heard distinctly said bryce evidently unwilling
to offend either party

come come said the udaller we will have no quarrelling about
baubles we shall be summoned presently to the rigging-loft so he
used to call the apartment used as a ball-room and we must all go in
good-humour the things shall remain with bryce for to-night and
to-morrow i will myself settle whom they shall belong to

the laws of the udaller in his own house were absolute as those of the
medes the two young men regarding each other with looks of sullen
displeasure drew off in different directions

it is seldom that the second day of a prolonged festival equals the
first the spirits as well as the limbs are jaded and unequal to the
renewed expenditure of animation and exertion and the dance at
burgh-westra was sustained with much less mirth than on the preceding
evening it was yet an hour from midnight when even the reluctant
magnus troil after regretting the degeneracy of the times and wishing
he could transfuse into the modern hialtlanders some of the vigour which
still animated his own frame found himself compelled to give the signal
for general retreat

just as this took place halcro leading mordaunt mertoun a little
aside said he had a message to him from captain cleveland

a message said mordaunt his heart beating somewhat thick as he
spoke a challenge i suppose

a challenge repeated halcro who ever heard of a challenge in our
quiet islands do you think that i look like a carrier of challenges
and to you of all men living i am none of those fighting fools as
glorious john calls them and it was not quite a message i had to
deliver only thus far this captain cleveland i find hath set his
heart upon having these articles you looked at

he shall not have them i swear to you replied mordaunt mertoun

nay but hear me said halcro it seems that by the marks or arms
that are upon them he knows that they were formerly his property now
were you to give me the box as you promised i fairly tell you i
should give the man back his own

and brenda might do the like thought mordaunt to himself and
instantly replied aloud i have thought better of it my friend
captain cleveland shall have the toys he sets such store by but it is
on one sole condition

nay you will spoil all with your conditions said halcro for as
glorious john says conditions are but  

hear me i say with patience my condition is that he keeps the toys
in exchange for the rifle-gun i accepted from him which will leave no
obligation between us on either side

i see where you would be this is sebastian and dorax all over well
you may let the jagger know he is to deliver the things to cleveland i
think he is mad to have them and i will let cleveland know the
conditions annexed otherwise honest bryce might come by two payments
instead of one and i believe his conscience would not choke upon it

with these words halcro went to seek out cleveland while mordaunt
observing snailsfoot who as a sort of privileged person had thrust
himself into the crowd at the bottom of the dancing-room went up to
him and gave him directions to deliver the disputed articles to
cleveland as soon as he had an opportunity

ye are in the right maister mordaunt said the jagger ye are a
prudent and a sensible lad a calm answer turneth away wrath and
mysell i sall be willing to please you in ony trifling matters in my
sma way for between the udaller of burgh-westra and captain
cleveland a man is as it were atween the deil and the deep sea and
it was like that the udaller in the end would have taken your part in
the dispute for he is a man that loves justice

which apparently you care very little about master snailsfoot said
mordaunt otherwise there could have been no dispute whatever the
right being so clearly on my side if you had pleased to bear witness
according to the dictates of truth

maister mordaunt said the jagger i must own there was as it were
a colouring or shadow of justice on your side but then the justice
that i meddle with is only justice in the way of trade to have an
ellwand of due length if it be not something worn out with leaning on
it in my lang and painful journeys and to buy and sell by just weight
and measure twenty-four merks to the lispund but i have nothing to do
to do justice betwixt man and man like a fowd or a lawright-man at a
lawting lang syne

no one asked you to do so but only to give evidence according to your
conscience replied mordaunt not greatly pleased either with the part
the jagger had acted during the dispute or the construction which he
seemed to put on his own motives for yielding up the point

but bryce snailsfoot wanted not his answer my conscience he said
maister mordaunt is as tender as ony man's in my degree but she is
something of a timorsome nature cannot abide angry folk and can never
speak above her breath when there is aught of a fray going forward
indeed she hath at all times a small and low voice

which you are not much in the habit of listening to said mordaunt

there is that on your ain breast that proves the contrary said bryce
resolutely

in my breast said mordaunt somewhat angrily what know i of you

i said on your breast maister mordaunt and not in it i am sure
nae eye that looks on that waistcoat upon your own gallant brisket but
will say that the merchant who sold such a piece for four dollars had
justice and conscience and a kind heart to a customer to the boot of a
that sae ye shouldna be sae thrawart wi me for having spared the
breath of my mouth in a fool's quarrel

i thrawart said mordaunt pooh you silly man i have no quarrel
with you

i am glad of it said the travelling merchant i will quarrel with no
man with my will least of all with an old customer and if you will
walk by my advice you will quarrel nane with captain cleveland he is
like one of yon cutters and slashers that have come into kirkwall that
think as little of slicing a man as we do of flinching a whale it's
their trade to fight and they live by it and they have the advantage
of the like of you that only take it up at your own hand and in the
way of pastime when you hae nothing better to do

the company had now almost all dispersed and mordaunt laughing at the
jagger's caution bade him good-night and went to his own place of
repose which had been assigned to him by eric scambester who acted
the part of chamberlain as well as butler in a small room or rather
closet in one of the outhouses furnished for the occasion with the
hammock of a sailor




chapter xix

 i pass like night from land to land
 i have strange power of speech
 so soon as e'er his face i see
 i know the man that must hear me
 to him my tale i teach

 coleridge's rime of the ancient mariner


the daughters of magnus troil shared the same bed in a chamber which
had been that of their parents before the death of their mother magnus
who suffered grievously under that dispensation of providence had
become disgusted with the apartment the nuptial chamber was abandoned
to the pledges of his bereaved affection of whom the eldest was at that
period only four years old or thereabouts and having been their
nursery in infancy continued though now tricked and adorned according
to the best fashion of the islands and the taste of the lovely sisters
themselves to be their sleeping-room or in the old norse dialect
their bower

it had been for many years the scene of the most intimate confidence if
that could be called confidence where in truth there was nothing to
be confided where neither sister had a secret and where every thought
that had birth in the bosom of the one was without either hesitation
or doubt confided to the other as spontaneously as it had arisen but
since cleveland abode in the mansion of burgh-westra each of the lovely
sisters had entertained thoughts which are not lightly or easily
communicated unless she who listens to them has previously assured
herself that the confidence will be kindly received minna had noticed
what other and less interested observers had been unable to perceive
that cleveland namely held a lower rank in brenda's opinion than in
her own and brenda on her side thought that minna had hastily and
unjustly joined in the prejudices which had been excited against
mordaunt mertoun in the mind of their father each was sensible that she
was no longer the same to her sister and this conviction was a painful
addition to other painful apprehensions which they supposed they had to
struggle with their manner towards each other was in outward
appearances and in all the little cares by which affection can be
expressed even more assiduously kind than before as if both conscious
that their internal reserve was a breach of their sisterly union strove
to atone for it by double assiduity in those external marks of
affection which at other times when there was nothing to hide might
be omitted without inferring any consequences

on the night referred to in particular the sisters felt more especially
the decay of the confidence which used to exist betwixt them the
proposed voyage to kirkwall and that at the time of the fair when
persons of every degree in these islands repair thither either for
business or amusement was likely to be an important incident in lives
usually so simple and uniform as theirs and a few months ago minna
and brenda would have been awake half the night anticipating in their
talk with each other all that was likely to happen on so momentous an
occasion but now the subject was just mentioned and suffered to drop
as if the topic was likely to produce a difference betwixt them or to
call forth a more open display of their several opinions than either was
willing to make to the other

yet such was their natural openness and gentleness of disposition that
each sister imputed to herself the fault that there was aught like
estrangement existing between them and when having finished their
devotions and betaken themselves to their common couch they folded
each other in their arms and exchanged a sisterly kiss and a sisterly
good-night they seemed mutually to ask pardon and to exchange
forgiveness although neither said a word of offence either offered or
received and both were soon plunged in that light and yet profound
repose which is only enjoyed when sleep sinks down on the eyes of youth
and innocence

on the night to which the story relates both sisters were visited by
dreams which though varied by the moods and habits of the sleepers
bore yet a strange general resemblance to each other

minna dreamed that she was in one of the most lonely recesses of the
beach called swartaster where the incessant operation of the waves
indenting a calcarious rock has formed a deep halier which in the
language of the island means a subterranean cavern into which the tide
ebbs and flows many of these run to an extraordinary and unascertained
depth under ground and are the secure retreat of cormorants and seals
which it is neither easy nor safe to pursue to their extreme recesses
amongst these this halier of swartaster was accounted peculiarly
inaccessible and shunned both by fowlers and by seamen on account of
sharp angles and turnings in the cave itself as well as the sunken
rocks which rendered it very dangerous for skiffs or boats to advance
far into it especially if there was the usual swell of an island tide
from the dark-browed mouth of this cavern it seemed to minna in her
dream that she beheld a mermaid issue not in the classical dress of a
nereid as in claud halcro's mask of the preceding evening but with
comb and glass in hand according to popular belief and lashing the
waves with that long scaly train which in the traditions of the
country forms so frightful a contrast with the fair face long tresses
and displayed bosom of a human and earthly female of surpassing
beauty she seemed to beckon to minna while her wild notes rang sadly
in her ear and denounced in prophetic sounds calamity and woe

the vision of brenda was of a different description yet equally
melancholy she sat as she thought in her favourite bower surrounded
by her father and a party of his most beloved friends amongst whom
mordaunt mertoun was not forgotten she was required to sing and she
strove to entertain them with a lively ditty in which she was accounted
eminently successful and which she sung with such simple yet natural
humour as seldom failed to produce shouts of laughter and applause
while all who could or who could not sing were irresistibly compelled
to lend their voices to the chorus but on this occasion it seemed as
if her own voice refused all its usual duty and as if while she felt
herself unable to express the words of the well-known air it assumed
in her own despite the deep tones and wild and melancholy notes of
norna of fitful-head for the purpose of chanting some wild runic rhyme
resembling those sung by the heathen priests of old when the victim
too often human was bound to the fatal altar of odin or of thor

at length the two sisters at once started from sleep and uttering a
low scream of fear clasped themselves in each other's arms for their
fancy had not altogether played them false the sounds which had
suggested their dreams were real and sung within their apartment they
knew the voice well indeed and yet knowing to whom it belonged their
surprise and fear were scarce the less when they saw the well-known
norna of fitful-head seated by the chimney of the apartment which
during the summer season contained an iron lamp well trimmed and in
winter a fire of wood or of turf

she was wrapped in her long and ample garment of wadmaal and moved her
body slowly to and fro over the pale flame of the lamp as she sung
lines to the following purport in a slow sad and almost an unearthly
accent

 for leagues along the watery way
 through gulf and stream my course has been
 the billows know my runic lay
 and smooth their crests to silent green

 the billows know my runic lay 
 the gulf grows smooth the stream is still
 but human hearts more wild than they
 know but the rule of wayward will

 one hour is mine in all the year
 to tell my woes and one alone
 when gleams this magic lamp tis here 
 when dies the mystic light tis gone

 daughters of northern magnus hail
 the lamp is lit the flame is clear 
 to you i come to tell my tale
 awake arise my tale to hear

norna was well known to the daughters of troil but it was not without
emotion although varied by their respective dispositions that they
beheld her so unexpectedly and at such an hour their opinions with
respect to the supernatural attributes to which she pretended were
extremely different

minna with an unusual intensity of imagination although superior in
talent to her sister was more apt to listen to and delight in every
tale of wonder and was at all times more willing to admit impressions
which gave her fancy scope and exercise without minutely examining
their reality brenda on the other hand had in her gaiety a slight
propensity to satire and was often tempted to laugh at the very
circumstances upon which minna founded her imaginative dreams and like
all who love the ludicrous she did not readily suffer herself to be
imposed upon or overawed by pompous pretensions of any kind whatever
but as her nerves were weaker and more irritable than those of her
sister she often paid involuntary homage by her fears to ideas which
her reason disowned and hence claud halcro used to say in reference
to many of the traditionary superstitions around burgh-westra that
minna believed them without trembling and that brenda trembled without
believing them in our own more enlightened days there are few whose
undoubting mind and native courage have not felt minna's high wrought
tone of enthusiasm and perhaps still fewer who have not at one time
or other felt like brenda their nerves confess the influence of
terrors which their reason disowned and despised

under the power of such different feelings minna when the first moment
of surprise was over prepared to spring from her bed and go to greet
norna who she doubted not had come on some errand fraught with fate
while brenda who only beheld in her a woman partially deranged in her
understanding and who yet from the extravagance of her claims
regarded her as an undefined object of awe or rather terror detained
her sister by an eager and terrified grasp while she whispered in her
ear an anxious entreaty that she would call for assistance but the soul
of minna was too highly wrought up by the crisis at which her fate
seemed to have arrived to permit her to follow the dictates of her
sister's fears and extricating herself from brenda's hold she hastily
threw on a loose nightgown and stepping boldly across the apartment
while her heart throbbed rather with high excitement than with fear she
thus addressed her singular visitor

norna if your mission regards us as your words seem to express there
is one of us at least who will receive its import with reverence but
without fear

norna dear norna said the tremulous voice of brenda who feeling
no safety in the bed after minna quitted it had followed her as
fugitives crowd into the rear of an advancing army because they dare
not remain behind and who now stood half concealed by her sister and
holding fast by the skirts of her gown norna dear norna said she
whatever you are to say let it be to-morrow i will call euphane fea
the housekeeper and she will find you a bed for the night

no bed for me said their nocturnal visitor no closing of the eyes
for me they have watched as shelf and stack appeared and disappeared
betwixt burgh-westra and orkney they have seen the man of hoy sink
into the sea and the peak of hengcliff arise from it and yet they have
not tasted of slumber nor must they slumber now till my task is ended
sit down then minna and thou silly trembler sit down while i trim
my lamp don your clothes for the tale is long and ere tis done ye
will shiver with worse than cold

for heaven's sake then put it off till daylight dear norna said
brenda the dawn cannot be far distant and if you are to tell us of
any thing frightful let it be by daylight and not by the dim glimmer
of that blue lamp

patience fool said their uninvited guest not by daylight should
norna tell a tale that might blot the sun out of heaven and blight the
hopes of the hundred boats that will leave this shore ere noon to
commence their deep-sea fishing ay and of the hundred families that
will await their return the demon whom the sounds will not fail to
awaken must shake his dark wings over a shipless and a boatless sea as
he rushes from his mountain to drink the accents of horror he loves so
well to listen to

have pity on brenda's fears good norna said the elder sister and
at least postpone this frightful communication to another place and
hour

maiden no replied norna sternly it must be told while that lamp
yet burns mine is no daylight tale by that lamp it must be told which
is framed out of the gibbet-irons of the cruel lord of wodensvoe who
murdered his brother and has for its nourishment but be that
nameless enough that its food never came either from the fish or from
the fruit see it waxes dim and dimmer nor must my tale last longer
than its flame endureth sit ye down there while i sit here opposite
to you and place the lamp betwixt us for within the sphere of its
light the demon dares not venture

the sisters obeyed minna casting a slow awestruck yet determined look
all around as if to see the being who according to the doubtful words
of norna hovered in their neighbourhood while brenda's fears were
mingled with some share both of anger and of impatience norna paid no
attention to either but began her story in the following words 

ye know my daughters that your blood is allied to mine but in what
degree ye know not for there was early hostility betwixt your grandsire
and him who had the misfortune to call me daughter let me term him by
his christian name of erland for that which marks our relation i dare
not bestow your grandsire olave was the brother of erland but when
the wide udal possessions of their father rolfe troil the most rich and
well estated of any who descended from the old norse stock were divided
betwixt the brothers the fowd gave to erland his father's lands in
orkney and reserved for olave those of hialtland discord arose between
the brethren for erland held that he was wronged and when the
lawting with the raddmen and lawright-men confirmed the
division he went in wrath to orkney cursing hialtland and its
inhabitants cursing his brother and his blood

but the love of the rock and of the mountain still wrought on erland's
mind and he fixed his dwelling not on the soft hills of ophir or the
green plains of gramesey but in the wild and mountainous isle of hoy
whose summit rises to the sky like the cliffs of foulah and of
feroe he knew that unhappy erland whatever of legendary lore
scald and bard had left behind them and to teach me that knowledge
which was to cost us both so dear was the chief occupation of his old
age i learned to visit each lonely barrow each lofty cairn to tell
its appropriate tale and to soothe with rhymes in his praise the spirit
of the stern warrior who dwelt within i knew where the sacrifices were
made of yore to thor and to odin on what stones the blood of the
victims flowed where stood the dark-browed priest where the crested
chiefs who consulted the will of the idol where the more distant crowd
of inferior worshippers who looked on in awe or in terror the places
most shunned by the timid peasants had no terrors for me i dared walk
in the fairy circle and sleep by the magic spring

but for my misfortune i was chiefly fond to linger about the dwarfie
stone as it is called a relic of antiquity which strangers look on
with curiosity and the natives with awe it is a huge fragment of rock
which lies in a broken and rude valley full of stones and precipices
in the recesses of the ward-hill of hoy the inside of the rock has two
couches hewn by no earthly hand and having a small passage between
them the doorway is now open to the weather but beside it lies a
large stone which adapted to grooves still visible in the entrance
once had served to open and to close this extraordinary dwelling which
trolld a dwarf famous in the northern sagas is said to have framed for
his own favourite residence the lonely shepherd avoids the place for
at sunrise high noon or sunset the misshapen form of the necromantic
owner may sometimes still be seen sitting by the dwarfie stone i
feared not the apparition for minna my heart was as bold and my hand
was as innocent as yours in my childish courage i was even but too
presumptuous and the thirst after things unattainable led me like our
primitive mother to desire increase of knowledge even by prohibited
means i longed to possess the power of the voluspæ and divining women
of our ancient race to wield like them command over the elements and
to summon the ghosts of deceased heroes from their caverns that they
might recite their daring deeds and impart to me their hidden
treasures often when watching by the dwarfie stone with mine eyes
fixed on the ward-hill which rises above that gloomy valley i have
distinguished among the dark rocks that wonderful carbunclep
which gleams ruddy as a furnace to them who view it from beneath but
has ever become invisible to him whose daring foot has scaled the
precipices from which it darts its splendour my vain and youthful bosom
burned to investigate these and an hundred other mysteries which the
sagas that i perused or learned from erland rather indicated than
explained and in my daring mood i called on the lord of the dwarfie
stone to aid me in attaining knowledge inaccessible to mere mortals

and the evil spirit heard your summons said minna her blood curdling
as she listened

hush said norna lowering her voice vex him not with reproach he
is with us he hears us even now

brenda started from her seat i will to euphane fea's chamber she
said and leave you minna and norna to finish your stories of
hobgoblins and of dwarfs at your own leisure i care not for them at any
time but i will not endure them at midnight and by this pale
lamplight

she was accordingly in the act of leaving the room when her sister
detained her

is this the courage she said of her that disbelieves whatever the
history of our fathers tells us of supernatural prodigy what norna has
to tell concerns the fate perhaps of our father and his house if i
can listen to it trusting that god and my innocence will protect me
from all that is malignant you brenda who believe not in such
influence have surely no cause to tremble credit me that for the
guiltless there is no fear

there may be no danger said brenda unable to suppress her natural
turn for humour but as the old jest book says there is much fear
however minna i will stay with you the rather she added in a
whisper that i am loath to leave you alone with this frightful woman
and that i have a dark staircase and long passage betwixt and euphane
fea else i would have her here ere i were five minutes older

call no one hither maiden upon peril of thy life said norna and
interrupt not my tale again for it cannot and must not be told after
that charmed light has ceased to burn

and i thank heaven said brenda to herself that the oil burns low in
the cruize i am sorely tempted to lend it a puff but then norna would
be alone with us in the dark and that would be worse

so saying she submitted to her fate and sat down determined to listen
with all the equanimity which she could command to the remaining part of
norna's tale which went on as follows 

it happened on a hot summer day and just about the hour of noon
continued norna as i sat by the dwarfie stone with my eyes fixed on
the ward-hill whence the mysterious and ever-burning carbuncle shed its
rays more brightly than usual and repined in my heart at the restricted
bounds of human knowledge that at length i could not help exclaiming
in the words of an ancient saga

 dwellers of the mountain rise
 trolld the powerful haims the wise
 ye who taught weak woman's tongue
 words that sway the wise and strong 
 ye who taught weak woman's hand
 how to wield the magic wand
 and wake the gales on foulah's steep
 or lull wild sumburgh's waves to sleep 
 still are ye yet not yours the power
 ye knew in odin's mightier hour
 what are ye now but empty names
 powerful trolld sagacious haims
 that lightly spoken lightly heard
 float on the air like thistle's beard

i had scarce uttered these words proceeded norna ere the sky which
had been till then unusually clear grew so suddenly dark around me
that it seemed more like midnight than noon a single flash of
lightning showed me at once the desolate landscape of heath morass
mountain and precipice which lay around a single clap of thunder
wakened all the echoes of the ward-hill which continued so long to
repeat the sound that it seemed some rock rent by the thunderbolt from
the summit was rolling over cliff and precipice into the valley
immediately after fell a burst of rain so violent that i was fain to
shun its pelting by creeping into the interior of the mysterious stone

i seated myself on the larger stone couch which is cut at the farther
end of the cavity and with my eyes fixed on the smaller bed wearied
myself with conjectures respecting the origin and purpose of my singular
place of refuge had it been really the work of that powerful trolld to
whom the poetry of the scalds referred it or was it the tomb of some
scandinavian chief interred with his arms and his wealth perhaps also
with his immolated wife that what he loved best in life might not in
death be divided from him or was it the abode of penance chosen by
some devoted anchorite of later days or the idle work of some wandering
mechanic whom chance and whim and leisure had thrust upon such an
undertaking i tell you the thoughts that then floated through my brain
that ye may know that what ensued was not the vision of a prejudiced or
prepossessed imagination but an apparition as certain as it was awful

sleep had gradually crept on me amidst my lucubrations when i was
startled from my slumbers by a second clap of thunder and when i
awoke i saw through the dim light which the upper aperture admitted
the unshapely and indistinct form of trolld the dwarf seated opposite
to me on the lesser couch which his square and misshapen bulk seemed
absolutely to fill up i was startled but not affrighted for the blood
of the ancient race of lochlin was warm in my veins he spoke and his
words were of norse so old that few save my father or i myself
could have comprehended their import such language as was spoken in
these islands ere olave planted the cross on the ruins of heathenism
his meaning was dark also and obscure like that which the pagan priests
were wont to deliver in the name of their idols to the tribes that
assembled at the helgafels this was the import 

 a thousand winters dark have flown
 since o'er the threshold of my stone
 a votaress pass'd my power to own
 visitor bold
 of the mansion of trolld
 maiden haughty of heart
 who hast hither presumed 
 ungifted undoom'd
 thou shalt not depart
 the power thou dost covet
 o'er tempest and wave
 shall be thine thou proud maiden
 by beach and by cave 
 by stack and by skerry by noup and by voe
 by air and by wick and by helyer and gio
 and by every wild shore which the northern winds know
 and the northern tides lave
 but though this shall be given thee thou desperately brave
 i doom thee that never the gift thou shalt have
 till thou reave thy life's giver
 of the gift which he gave

i answered him in nearly the same strain for the spirit of the ancient
scalds of our race was upon me and far from fearing the phantom with
whom i sat cooped within so narrow a space i felt the impulse of that
high courage which thrust the ancient champions and druidesses upon
contests with the invisible world when they thought that the earth no
longer contained enemies worthy to be subdued by them therefore did i
answer him thus 

 dark are thy words and severe
 thou dweller in the stone
 but trembling and fear
 to her are unknown
 who hath sought thee here
 in thy dwelling lone
 come what comes soever
 the worst i can endure
 life is but a short fever
 and death is the cure

the demon scowled at me as if at once incensed and overawed and then
coiling himself up in a thick and sulphureous vapour he disappeared
from his place i did not till that moment feel the influence of
fright but then it seized me i rushed into the open air where the
tempest had passed away and all was pure and serene after a moment's
breathless pause i hasted home musing by the way on the words of the
phantom which i could not as often happens recall so distinctly to
memory at the time as i have been able to do since

it may seem strange that such an apparition should in time have
glided from my mind like a vision of the night but so it was i
brought myself to believe it the work of fancy i thought i had lived
too much in solitude and had given way too much to the feelings
inspired by my favourite studies i abandoned them for a time and i
mixed with the youth of my age i was upon a visit at kirkwall when i
learned to know your father whom business had brought thither he
easily found access to the relation with whom i lived who was anxious
to compose if possible the feud which divided our families your
father maidens has been rather hardened than changed by years he had
the same manly form the same old norse frankness of manner and of
heart the same upright courage and honesty of disposition with more of
the gentle ingenuousness of youth an eager desire to please a
willingness to be pleased and a vivacity of spirits which survives not
our early years but though he was thus worthy of love and though
erland wrote to me authorizing his attachment there was another a
stranger minna a fatal stranger full of arts unknown to us and
graces which to the plain manners of your father were unknown yes he
walked indeed among us like a being of another and of a superior
race ye look on me as if it were strange that i should have had
attractions for such a lover but i present nothing that can remind you
that norna of the fitful-head was once admired and loved as ulla
troil the change betwixt the animated body and the corpse after
disease is scarce more awful and absolute than i have sustained while
i yet linger on earth look on me maidens look on me by this
glimmering light can ye believe that these haggard and weather-wasted
features these eyes which have been almost converted to stone by
looking upon sights of terror these locks that mingled with grey now
stream out the shattered pennons of a sinking vessel that these and
she to whom they belong could once be the objects of fond
affection but the waning lamp sinks fast and let it sink while i tell
my infamy we loved in secret we met in secret till i gave the last
proof of fatal and of guilty passion and now beam out thou magic
glimmer shine out a little space thou flame so powerful even in thy
feebleness bid him who hovers near us keep his dark pinions aloof from
the circle thou dost illuminate live but a little till the worst be
told and then sink when thou wilt into darkness as black as my guilt
and sorrow

while she spoke thus she drew together the remaining nutriment of the
lamp and trimmed its decaying flame then again with a hollow voice
and in broken sentences pursued her narrative

i must waste little time in words my love was discovered but not my
guilt erland came to pomona in anger and transported me to our
solitary dwelling in hoy he commanded me to see my lover no more and
to receive magnus in whom he was willing to forgive the offences of his
father as my future husband alas i no longer deserved his
attachment my only wish was to escape from my father's dwelling to
conceal my shame in my lover's arms let me do him justice he was
faithful too too faithful his perfidy would have bereft me of my
senses but the fatal consequences of his fidelity have done me a
tenfold injury

she paused and then resumed with the wild tone of insanity it has
made me the powerful and the despairing sovereign of the seas and
winds

she paused a second time after this wild exclamation and resumed her
narrative in a more composed manner

my lover came in secret to hoy to concert measures for my flight and
i agreed to meet him that we might fix the time when his vessel should
come into the sound i left the house at midnight

here she appeared to gasp with agony and went on with her tale by
broken and interrupted sentences i left the house at midnight i had
to pass my father's door and i perceived it was open i thought he
watched us and that the sound of my steps might not break his
slumbers i closed the fatal door a light and trivial action but god
in heaven what were the consequences at morn the room was full of
suffocating vapour my father was dead dead through my act dead
through my disobedience dead through my infamy all that follows is
mist and darkness a choking suffocating stifling mist envelopes all
that i said and did all that was said and done until i became assured
that my doom was accomplished and walked forth the calm and terrible
being you now behold me the queen of the elements the sharer in the
power of those beings to whom man and his passions give such sport as
the tortures of the dog-fish afford the fisherman when he pierces his
eyes with thorns and turns him once more into his native element to
traverse the waves in blindness and agony no maidens she whom you
see before you is impassive to the follies of which your minds are the
sport i am she that have made the offering i am she that bereaved the
giver of the gift of life which he gave me the dark saying has been
interpreted by my deed and i am taken from humanity to be something
pre-eminently powerful pre-eminently wretched

as she spoke thus the light which had been long quivering leaped high
for an instant and seemed about to expire when norna interrupting
herself said hastily no more now he comes he comes enough that ye
know me and the right i have to advise and command you approach now
proud spirit if thou wilt

so saying she extinguished the lamp and passed out of the apartment
with her usual loftiness of step as minna could observe from its
measured cadence

chapter xx

 is all the counsel that we two have shared 
 the sisters vows the hours that we have spent
 when we have chid the hasty-footed time
 for parting us o and is all forgot

 midsummer-night's dream


the attention of minna was powerfully arrested by this tale of terror
which accorded with and explained many broken hints respecting norna
which she had heard from her father and other near relations and she
was for a time so lost in surprise not unmingled with horror that she
did not even attempt to speak to her sister brenda when at length she
called her by her name she received no answer and on touching her
hand she found it cold as ice alarmed to the uttermost she threw open
the lattice and the window-shutters and admitted at once the free air
and the pale glimmer of the hyperborean summer night she then became
sensible that her sister was in a swoon all thoughts concerning norna
her frightful tale and her mysterious connexion with the invisible
world at once vanished from minna's thoughts and she hastily ran to
the apartment of the old housekeeper to summon her aid without
reflecting for a moment what sights she might encounter in the long dark
passages which she had to traverse

the old woman hastened to brenda's assistance and instantly applied
such remedies as her experience suggested but the poor girl's nervous
system had been so much agitated by the horrible tale she had just
heard that when recovered from her swoon her utmost endeavours to
compose her mind could not prevent her falling into a hysterical fit of
some duration this also was subdued by the experience of old euphane
fea who was well versed in all the simple pharmacy used by the natives
of zetland and who after administering a composing draught distilled
from simples and wild flowers at length saw her patient resigned to
sleep minna stretched herself beside her sister kissed her cheek and
courted slumber in her turn but the more she invoked it the farther it
seemed to fly from her eyelids and if at times she was disposed to sink
into repose the voice of the involuntary parricide seemed again to
sound in her ears and startled her into consciousness

the early morning hour at which they were accustomed to rise found the
state of the sisters different from what might have been expected a
sound sleep had restored the spirit of brenda's lightsome eye and the
rose on her laughing cheek the transient indisposition of the preceding
night having left as little trouble on her look as the fantastic
terrors of norna's tale had been able to impress on her imagination the
looks of minna on the contrary were melancholy downcast and
apparently exhausted by watching and anxiety they said at first little
to each other as if afraid of touching a subject so fraught with
emotion as the scene of the preceding night it was not until they had
performed together their devotions as usual that brenda while lacing
minna's boddice for they rendered the services of the toilet to each
other reciprocally became aware of the paleness of her sister's
looks and having ascertained by a glance at the mirror that her own
did not wear the same dejection she kissed minna's cheek and said
affectionately claud halcro was right my dearest sister when his
poetical folly gave us these names of night and day

and wherefore should you say so now said minna

because we each are bravest in the season that we take our name from i
was frightened wellnigh to death by hearing those things last night
which you endured with courageous firmness and now when it is broad
light i can think of them with composure while you look as pale as a
spirit who is surprised by sunrise

you are lucky brenda said her sister gravely who can so soon
forget such a tale of wonder and horror

the horror said brenda is never to be forgotten unless one could
hope that the unfortunate woman's excited imagination which shows
itself so active in conjuring up apparitions may have fixed on her an
imaginary crime

you believe nothing then said minna of her interview at the
dwarfie stone that wondrous place of which so many tales are told and
which for so many centuries has been reverenced as the work of a
demon and as his abode

i believe said brenda that our unhappy relative is no
impostor and therefore i believe that she was at the dwarfie stone
during a thunderstorm that she sought shelter in it and that during a
swoon or during sleep perhaps some dream visited her concerned with
the popular traditions with which she was so conversant but i cannot
easily believe more

and yet the event said minna corresponded to the dark intimations
of the vision

pardon me said brenda i rather think the dream would never have
been put into shape or perhaps remembered at all but for the event
she told us herself she had nearly forgot the vision till after her
father's dreadful death and who shall warrant how much of what she
then supposed herself to remember was not the creation of her own fancy
disordered as it naturally was by the horrid accident had she really
seen and conversed with a necromantic dwarf she was likely to remember
the conversation long enough at least i am sure i should

brenda replied minna you have heard the good minister of the
cross-kirk say that human wisdom was worse than folly when it was
applied to mysteries beyond its comprehension and that if we believed
no more than we could understand we should resist the evidence of our
senses which presented us at every turn circumstances as certain as
they were unintelligible

you are too learned yourself sister answered brenda to need the
assistance of the good minister of cross-kirk but i think his doctrine
only related to the mysteries of our religion which it is our duty to
receive without investigation or doubt but in things occurring in
common life as god has bestowed reason upon us we cannot act wrong in
employing it but you my dear minna have a warmer fancy than mine and
are willing to receive all those wonderful stories for truth because
you love to think of sorcerers and dwarfs and water-spirits and
would like much to have a little trow or fairy as the scotch call
them with a green coat and a pair of wings as brilliant as the hues of
the starling's neck specially to attend on you

it would spare you at least the trouble of lacing my boddice said
minna and of lacing it wrong too for in the heat of your argument
you have missed two eyelet-holes

that error shall be presently mended said brenda and then as one
of our friends might say i will haul tight and belay but you draw your
breath so deeply that it will be a difficult matter

i only sighed said minna in some confusion to think how soon you
can trifle with and ridicule the misfortunes of this extraordinary
woman

i do not ridicule them god knows replied brenda somewhat angrily
it is you minna who turn all i say in truth and kindness to
something harsh or wicked i look on norna as a woman of very
extraordinary abilities which are very often united with a strong cast
of insanity and i consider her as better skilled in the signs of the
weather than any woman in zetland but that she has any power over the
elements i no more believe than i do in the nursery stories of king
erick who could make the wind blow from the point he set his cap to

minna somewhat nettled with the obstinate incredulity of her sister
replied sharply and yet brenda this woman half-mad woman and the
veriest impostor is the person by whom you choose to be advised in the
matter next your own heart at this moment

i do not know what you mean said brenda colouring deeply and
shifting to get away from her sister but as she was now undergoing the
ceremony of being laced in her turn her sister had the means of holding
her fast by the silken string with which she was fastening the boddice
and tapping her on the neck which expressed by its sudden writhe and
sudden change to a scarlet hue as much pettish confusion as she had
desired to provoke she added more mildly is it not strange brenda
that used as we have been by the stranger mordaunt mertoun whose
assurance has brought him uninvited to a house where his presence is so
unacceptable you should still look or think of him with favour surely
that you do so should be a proof to you that there are such things as
spells in the country and that you yourself labour under them it is
not for nought that mordaunt wears a chain of elfin gold look to it
brenda and be wise in time

i have nothing to do with mordaunt mertoun answered brenda hastily
nor do i know or care what he or any other young man wears about his
neck i could see all the gold chains of all the bailies of edinburgh
that lady glowrowrum speaks so much of without falling in fancy with
one of the wearers and having thus complied with the female rule of
pleading not guilty in general to such an indictment she immediately
resumed in a different tone but to say the truth minna i think
you and all of you have judged far too hastily about this young friend
of ours who has been so long our most intimate companion mind
mordaunt mertoun is no more to me than he is to you who best know how
little difference he made betwixt us and that chain or no chain he
lived with us like a brother with two sisters and yet you can turn him
off at once because a wandering seaman of whom we know nothing and a
peddling jagger whom we do know to be a thief a cheat and a liar
speak words and carry tales in his disfavour i do not believe he ever
said he could have his choice of either of us and only waited to see
which was to have burgh-westra and bredness voe i do not believe he
ever spoke such a word or harboured such a thought as that of making a
choice between us

perhaps said minna coldly you may have had reason to know that his
choice was already determined

i will not endure this said brenda giving way to her natural
vivacity and springing from between her sister's hands then turning
round and facing her while her glowing cheek was rivalled in the
deepness of its crimson by as much of her neck and bosom as the upper
part of the half-laced boddice permitted to be visible even from you
minna she said i will not endure this you know that all my life i
have spoken the truth and that i love the truth and i tell you that
mordaunt mertoun never in his life made distinction betwixt you and me
until  

here some feeling of consciousness stopped her short and her sister
replied with a smile until when brenda methinks your love of
truth seems choked with the sentence you were bringing out

until you ceased to do him the justice he deserves said brenda
firmly since i must speak out i have little doubt that he will not
long throw away his friendship on you who hold it so lightly

be it so said minna you are secure from my rivalry either in his
friendship or love but bethink you better brenda this is no scandal
of cleveland's cleveland is incapable of slander no falsehood of bryce
snailsfoot not one of our friends or acquaintance but says it has been
the common talk of the island that the daughters of magnus troil were
patiently awaiting the choice of the nameless and birthless stranger
mordaunt mertoun is it fitting that this should be said of us the
descendants of a norwegian jarl and the daughters of the first udaller
in zetland or would it be modest or maidenly to submit to it
unresented were we the meanest lasses that ever lifted a milk-pail

the tongues of fools are no reproach replied brenda warmly i will
never quit my own thoughts of an innocent friend for the gossip of the
island which can put the worst meaning on the most innocent actions

hear but what our friends say repeated minna hear but the lady
glowrowrum hear but maddie and clara groatsettar

if i were to hear lady glowrowrum said brenda steadily i should
listen to the worst tongue in zetland and as for maddie and clara
groatsettar they were both blithe enough to get mordaunt to sit betwixt
them at dinner the day before yesterday as you might have observed
yourself but that your ear was better engaged

your eyes at least have been but indifferently engaged brenda
retorted the elder sister since they were fixed on a young man whom
all the world but yourself believes to have talked of us with the most
insolent presumption and even if he be innocently charged lady
glowrowrum says it is unmaidenly and bold of you even to look in the
direction where he sits knowing it must confirm such reports

i will look which way i please said brenda growing still warmer
lady glowrowrum shall neither rule my thoughts nor my words nor my
eyes i hold mordaunt mertoun to be innocent i will look at him as
such i will speak of him as such and if i did not speak to him also
and behave to him as usual it is in obedience to my father and not for
what lady glowrowrum and all her nieces had she twenty instead of two
could think wink nod or tattle about the matter that concerns them
not

alas brenda answered minna with calmness this vivacity is more
than is required for the defence of the character of a mere
friend beware he who ruined norna's peace for ever was a stranger
admitted to her affections against the will of her family

he was a stranger replied brenda with emphasis not only in birth
but in manners she had not been bred up with him from her youth she
had not known the gentleness the frankness of his disposition by an
intimacy of many years he was indeed a stranger in character temper
birth manners and morals some wandering adventurer perhaps whom
chance or tempest had thrown upon the islands and who knew how to mask
a false heart with a frank brow my good sister take home your own
warning there are other strangers at burgh-westra besides this poor
mordaunt mertoun

minna seemed for a moment overwhelmed with the rapidity with which her
sister retorted her suspicion and her caution but her natural
loftiness of disposition enabled her to reply with assumed composure

were i to treat you brenda with the want of confidence you show
towards me i might reply that cleveland is no more to me than mordaunt
was or than young swartaster or lawrence ericson or any other
favourite guest of my father's now is but i scorn to deceive you or
to disguise my thoughts i love clement cleveland

do not say so my dearest sister said brenda abandoning at once the
air of acrimony with which the conversation had been latterly conducted
and throwing her arms round her sister's neck with looks and with a
tone of the most earnest affection do not say so i implore you i
will renounce mordaunt mertoun i will swear never to speak to him
again but do not repeat that you love this cleveland

and why should i not repeat said minna disengaging herself gently
from her sister's grasp a sentiment in which i glory the boldness
the strength and energy of his character to which command is natural
and fear unknown these very properties which alarm you for my
happiness are the qualities which ensure it remember brenda that
when your foot loved the calm smooth sea-beach of the summer sea mine
ever delighted in the summit of the precipice when the waves are in
fury

and it is even that which i dread said brenda it is even that
adventurous disposition which now is urging you to the brink of a
precipice more dangerous than ever was washed by a spring-tide this
man do not frown i will say no slander of him but is he not even
in your own partial judgment stern and overbearing accustomed as you
say to command but for that very reason commanding where he has no
right to do so and leading whom it would most become him to follow
rushing on danger rather for its own sake than for any other object
and can you think of being yoked with a spirit so unsettled and stormy
whose life has hitherto been led in scenes of death and peril and who
even while sitting by your side cannot disguise his impatience again to
engage in them a lover methinks should love his mistress better than
his own life but yours my dear minna loves her less than the pleasure
of inflicting death on others

and it is even for that i love him said minna i am a daughter of
the old dames of norway who could send their lovers to battle with a
smile and slay them with their own hands if they returned with
dishonour my lover must scorn the mockeries by which our degraded race
strive for distinction or must practise them only in sport and in
earnest of nobler dangers no whale-striking bird-nesting favourite for
me my lover must be a sea-king or what else modern times may give that
draws near to that lofty character

alas my sister said brenda it is now that i must in earnest begin
to believe the force of spells and of charms you remember the spanish
story which you took from me long since because i said in your
admiration of the chivalry of the olden times of scandinavia you
rivalled the extravagance of the hero ah minna your colour shows
that your conscience checks you and reminds you of the book i mean is
it more wise think you to mistake a windmill for a giant or the
commander of a paltry corsair for a kiempe or a vi-king

minna did indeed colour with anger at this insinuation of which
perhaps she felt in some degree the truth

you have a right she said to insult me because you are possessed
of my secret

brenda's soft heart could not resist this charge of unkindness she
adjured her sister to pardon her and the natural gentleness of minna's
feelings could not resist her entreaties

we are unhappy she said as she dried her sister's tears that we
cannot see with the same eyes let us not make each other more so by
mutual insult and unkindness you have my secret it will not perhaps
long be one for my father shall have the confidence to which he is
entitled so soon as certain circumstances will permit me to offer it
meantime i repeat you have my secret and i more than suspect that i
have yours in exchange though you refuse to own it

how minna said brenda would you have me acknowledge for any one
such feelings as you allude to ere he has said the least word that
could justify such a confession

surely not but a hidden fire may be distinguished by heat as well as
flame

you understand these signs minna said brenda hanging down her head
and in vain endeavouring to suppress the temptation to repartee which
her sister's remark offered but i can only say that if ever i love
at all it shall not be until i have been asked to do so once or twice
at least which has not yet chanced to me but do not let us renew our
quarrel and rather let us think why norna should have told us that
horrible tale and to what she expects it should lead

it must have been as a caution replied minna a caution which our
situation and i will not deny it which mine in particular might seem
to her to call for but i am alike strong in my own innocence and in
the honour of cleveland

brenda would fain have replied that she did not confide so absolutely
in the latter security as in the first but she was prudent and
forbearing to awaken the former painful discussion only replied it is
strange that norna should have said nothing more of her lover surely he
could not desert her in the extremity of misery to which he had reduced
her

there may be agonies of distress said minna after a pause in which
the mind is so much jarred that it ceases to be responsive even to the
feelings which have most engrossed it her sorrow for her lover may
have been swallowed up in horror and despair

or he might have fled from the islands in fear of our father's
vengeance replied brenda

if for fear or faintness of heart said minna looking upwards he
was capable of flying from the ruin which he had occasioned i trust he
has long ere this sustained the punishment which heaven reserves for the
most base and dastardly of traitors and of cowards come sister we
are ere this expected at the breakfast board

and they went thither arm in arm with much more of confidence than had
lately subsisted between them the little quarrel which had taken place
having served the purpose of a bourasque or sudden squall which
dispels mists and vapours and leaves fair weather behind it

on their way to the breakfast apartment they agreed that it was
unnecessary and might be imprudent to communicate to their father the
circumstance of the nocturnal visit or to let him observe that they now
knew more than formerly of the melancholy history of norna




author's notes


note i p  norse fragments

near the conclusion of chapter ii it is noticed that the old norwegian
sagas were preserved and often repeated by the fishermen of orkney and
zetland while that language was not yet quite forgotten mr baikie of
tankerness a most respectable inhabitant of kirkwall and an orkney
proprietor assured me of the following curious fact

a clergyman who was not long deceased remembered well when some
remnants of the norse were still spoken in the island called north
ronaldshaw when gray's ode entitled the fatal sisters was first
published or at least first reached that remote island the reverend
gentleman had the well-judged curiosity to read it to some of the old
persons of the isle as a poem which regarded the history of their own
country they listened with great attention to the preliminary
stanzas 

 now the storm begins to lour
 haste the loom of hell prepare
 iron sleet of arrowry shower
 hurtles in the darken'd air

but when they had heard a verse or two more they interrupted the
reader telling him they knew the song well in the norse language and
had often sung it to him when he asked them for an old song they called
it the magicians or the enchantresses it would have been singular news
to the elegant translator when executing his version from the text of
bartholine to have learned that the norse original was still preserved
by tradition in a remote corner of the british dominions the
circumstances will probably justify what is said in the text concerning
the traditions of the inhabitants of those remote isles at the
beginning of the eighteenth century

even yet though the norse language is entirely disused except in so
far as particular words and phrases are still retained these fishers of
the ultima thule are a generation much attached to these ancient
legends of this the author learned a singular instance

about twenty years ago a missionary clergyman had taken the resolution
of traversing those wild islands where he supposed there might be a
lack of religious instruction which he believed himself capable of
supplying after being some days at sea in an open boat he arrived at
north ronaldshaw where his appearance excited great speculation he was
a very little man dark-complexioned and from the fatigue he had
sustained in removing from one island to another appeared before them
ill-dressed and unshaved so that the inhabitants set him down as one of
the ancient picts or as they call them with the usual strong guttural
peghts how they might have received the poor preacher in this
character was at least dubious and the schoolmaster of the parish who
had given quarters to the fatigued traveller set off to consult with
mr s   the able and ingenious engineer of the scottish light-house
service who chanced to be on the island as his skill and knowledge
were in the highest repute it was conceived that mr s   could decide
at once whether the stranger was a peght or ought to be treated as
such mr s   was so good-natured as to attend the summons with the
view of rendering the preacher some service the poor missionary who
had watched for three nights was now fast asleep little dreaming what
odious suspicions were current respecting him the inhabitants were
assembled round the door mr s   understanding the traveller's
condition declined disturbing him upon which the islanders produced a
pair of very little uncouth-looking boots with prodigiously thick
soles and appealed to him whether it was possible such articles of
raiment could belong to any one but a peght mr s   finding the
prejudices of the natives so strong was induced to enter the sleeping
apartment of the traveller and was surprised to recognise in the
supposed peght a person whom he had known in his worldly profession of
an edinburgh shopkeeper before he had assumed his present vocation of
course he was enabled to refute all suspicions of peghtism


note ii p  monsters of the northern seas

i have said in the text that the wondrous tales told by pontoppidan
the archbishop of upsal still find believers in the northern
archipelago it is in vain they are cancelled even in the later editions
of guthrie's grammar of which instructive work they used to form the
chapter far most attractive to juvenile readers but the same causes
which probably gave birth to the legends concerning mermaids
sea-snakes krakens and other marvellous inhabitants of the northern
ocean are still afloat in those climates where they took their rise
they had their origin probably from the eagerness of curiosity
manifested by our elegant poetess mrs hemans

 what hidest thou in thy treasure-caves and cells
 thou ever-sounding and mysterious sea

the additional mystic gloom which rests on these northern billows for
half the year joined to the imperfect glance obtained of occasional
objects encourage the timid or the fanciful to give way to imagination
and frequently to shape out a distinct story from some object half seen
and imperfectly examined thus some years since a large object was
observed in the beautiful bay of scalloway in zetland so much in vulgar
opinion resembling the kraken that though it might be distinguished for
several days if the exchange of darkness to twilight can be termed so
yet the hardy boatmen shuddered to approach it for fear of being drawn
down by the suction supposed to attend its sinking it was probably the
hull of some vessel which had foundered at sea

the belief in mermaids so fanciful and pleasing in itself is ever and
anon refreshed by a strange tale from the remote shores of some solitary
islet

the author heard a mariner of some reputation in his class vouch for
having seen the celebrated sea-serpent it appeared so far as could be
guessed to be about a hundred feet long with the wild mane and fiery
eyes which old writers ascribe to the monster but it is not unlikely
the spectator might in the doubtful light be deceived by the
appearance of a good norway log floating on the waves i have only to
add that the remains of an animal supposed to belong to this latter
species were driven on shore in the zetland isles within the
recollection of man part of the bones were sent to london and
pronounced by sir joseph banks to be those of a basking shark yet it
would seem that an animal so well known ought to have been immediately
distinguished by the northern fishermen


note iii p  sale of winds

the king of sweden the same eric quoted by mordaunt was says olaus
magnus in his time held second to none in the magical art and he was
so familiar with the evil spirits whom he worshipped that what way
soever he turned his cap the wind would presently blow that way for
this he was called windycap historia de gentibus septentrionalibus
romæ it is well known that the laplanders derive a profitable
trade in selling winds but it is perhaps less notorious that within
these few years such a commodity might be purchased on british ground
where it was likely to be in great request at the village of stromness
on the orkney main island called pomona lived in an aged dame
called bessie millie who helped out her subsistence by selling
favourable winds to mariners he was a venturous master of a vessel who
left the roadstead of stromness without paying his offering to
propitiate bessie millie her fee was extremely moderate being exactly
sixpence for which as she explained herself she boiled her kettle and
gave the bark advantage of her prayers for she disclaimed all unlawful
arts the wind thus petitioned for was sure she said to arrive though
occasionally the mariners had to wait some time for it the woman's
dwelling and appearance were not unbecoming her pretensions her house
which was on the brow of the steep hill on which stromness is founded
was only accessible by a series of dirty and precipitous lanes and for
exposure might have been the abode of eolus himself in whose
commodities the inhabitant dealt she herself was as she told us
nearly one hundred years old withered and dried up like a mummy a
clay-coloured kerchief folded round her head corresponded in colour to
her corpse-like complexion two light-blue eyes that gleamed with a
lustre like that of insanity an utterance of astonishing rapidity a
nose and chin that almost met together and a ghastly expression of
cunning gave her the effect of hecaté she remembered gow the pirate
who had been a native of these islands in which he closed his career
as mentioned in the preface such was bessie millie to whom the
mariners paid a sort of tribute with a feeling betwixt jest and
earnest


note iv p  reluctance to save a drowning man

it is remarkable that in an archipelago where so many persons must be
necessarily endangered by the waves so strange and inhuman a maxim
should have ingrafted itself upon the minds of a people otherwise kind
moral and hospitable but all with whom i have spoken agree that it
was almost general in the beginning of the eighteenth century and was
with difficulty weeded out by the sedulous instructions of the clergy
and the rigorous injunctions of the proprietors there is little doubt
it had been originally introduced as an excuse for suffering those who
attempted to escape from the wreck to perish unassisted so that there
being no survivor she might be considered as lawful plunder a story
was told me i hope an untrue one that a vessel having got ashore among
the breakers on one of the remote zetland islands five or six men the
whole or greater part of the unfortunate crew endeavoured to land by
assistance of a hawser which they had secured to a rock the
inhabitants were assembled and looked on with some uncertainty till an
old man said sirs if these men come ashore the additional mouths
will eat all the meal we have in store for winter and how are we to get
more a young fellow moved with this argument struck the rope asunder
with his axe and all the poor wretches were immersed among the
breakers and perished


note v p  mair wrecks ere winter

the ancient zetlander looked upon the sea as the provider of his living
not only by the plenty produced by the fishings but by the spoil of
wrecks some particular islands have fallen off very considerably in
their rent since the commissioners of the lighthouses have ordered
lights on the isle of sanda and the pentland skerries a gentleman
familiar with those seas expressed surprise at seeing the farmer of one
of the isles in a boat with a very old pair of sails had it been his
will said the man with an affected deference to providence very
inconsistent with the sentiment of his speech had it been his will
that light had not been placed yonder i would have had enough of new
sails last winter


note vi p  zetland corn-mills

there is certainly something very extraordinary to a stranger in zetland
corn-mills they are of the smallest possible size the wheel which
drives them is horizontal and the cogs are turned diagonally to the
water the beam itself stands upright and is inserted in a stone quern
of the old-fashioned construction which it turns round and thus
performs its duty had robinson crusoe ever been in zetland he would
have had no difficulty in contriving a machine for grinding corn in his
desert island these mills are thatched over in a little hovel which
has much the air of a pig-sty there may be five hundred such mills on
one island not capable any one of them of grinding above a sackful of
corn at a time


note vii p  the sword-dance

the sword-dance is celebrated in general terms by olaus magnus he seems
to have considered it as peculiar to the norwegians from whom it may
have passed to the orkneymen and zetlanders with other northern
customs

of their dancing in arms

moreover the northern goths and swedes had another sport to exercise
youth withall that they will dance and skip amongst naked swords and
dangerous weapons and this they do after the manner of masters of
defence as they are taught from their youth by skilful teachers that
dance before them and sing to it and this play is showed especially
about shrovetide called in italian macchararum for before
carnivals all the youth dance for eight days together holding their
swords up but within the scabbards for three times turning about and
then they do it with their naked swords lifted up after this turning
more moderately taking the points and pummels one of the other they
change ranks and place themselves in an triagonal figure and this they
call rosam and presently they dissolve it by drawing back their
swords and lifting them up that upon every one's head there may be made
a square rosa and then by a most nimbly whisking their swords about
collaterally they quickly leap back and end the sport which they
guide with pipes or songs or both together first by a more heavy then
by a more vehement and lastly by a most vehement dancing but this
speculation is scarce to be understood but by those who look on how
comely and decent it is when at one word or one commanding the whole
armed multitude is directed to fall to fight and clergymen may exercise
themselves and mingle themselves amongst others at this sport because
it is all guided by most wise reason

to the primate's account of the sword-dance i am able to add the words
sung or chanted on occasion of this dance as it is still performed in
papa stour a remote island of zetland where alone the custom keeps its
ground it is it will be observed by antiquaries a species of play or
mystery in which the seven champions of christendom make their
appearance as in the interlude presented in all's well that ends
well this dramatic curiosity was most kindly procured for my use by
dr scott of hazlar hospital son of my friend mr scott of mewbie
zetland mr hibbert has in his description of the zetland islands
given an account of the sword-dance but somewhat less full than the
following

words used as a prelude to the sword-dance a danish or norwegian
ballet composed some centuries ago and preserved in papa stour
zetland

personæ dramatis

enter master in the character of st george

 brave gentles all within this boor

music begins

figuir

the six stand in rank with their swords reclining on their shoulders
the master st george dances and then strikes the sword of james of
spain who follows george then dances strikes the sword of dennis who
follows behind james in like manner the rest the music playing swords
as before after the six are brought out of rank they and the master
form a circle and hold the swords point and hilt this circle is danced
round twice the whole headed by the master pass under the swords held
in a vaulted manner they jump over the swords this naturally places
the swords across which they disentangle by passing under their right
sword they take up the seven swords and form a circle in which they
dance round

the master runs under the sword opposite which he jumps over
backwards the others do the same he then passes under the right-hand
sword which the others follow in which position they dance until
commanded by the master when they form into a circle and dance round
as before they then jump over the right-hand sword by which means
their backs are to the circle and their hands across their backs they
dance round in that form until the master calls loose when they pass
under the right sword and are in a perfect circle

the master lays down his sword and lays hold of the point of james's
sword he then turns himself james and the others into a clew when
so formed he passes under out of the midst of the circle the others
follow they vault as before after several other evolutions they throw
themselves into a circle with their arms across the breast they
afterwards form such figures as to form a shield of their swords and
the shield is so compact that the master and his knights dance
alternately with this shield upon their heads it is then laid down upon
the floor each knight lays hold of their former points and hilts with
their hands across which disentangle by figuirs directly contrary to
those that formed the shield this finishes the ballet

epilogue

 mars does rule he bends his brows

note viii p  the dwarfie stone

this is one of the wonders of the orkney islands though it has been
rather undervalued by their late historian mr barry the island of hoy
rises abruptly starting as it were out of the sea which is contrary to
the gentle and flat character of the other isles of orkney it consists
of a mountain having different eminences or peaks it is very steep
furrowed with ravines and placed so as to catch the mists of the
western ocean and has a noble and picturesque effect from all points of
view the highest peak is divided from another eminence called the
ward-hill by a long swampy valley full of peat-bogs upon the slope of
this last hill and just where the principal mountain of hoy opens in a
hollow swamp or corrie lies what is called the dwarfie stone it is a
great fragment of sandstone composing one solid mass which has long
since been detached from a belt of the same materials cresting the
eminence above the spot where it now lies and which has slid down till
it reached its present situation the rock is about seven feet high
twenty-two feet long and seventeen feet broad the upper end of it is
hollowed by iron tools of which the marks are evident into a sort of
apartment containing two beds of stone with a passage between them
the uppermost and largest bed is five feet eight inches long by two
feet broad which was supposed to be used by the dwarf himself the
lower couch is shorter and rounded off instead of being squared at the
corners there is an entrance of about three feet and a half square and
a stone lies before it calculated to fit the opening a sort of skylight
window gives light to the apartment we can only guess at the purpose of
this monument and different ideas have been suggested some have
supposed it the work of some travelling mason but the cui bono would
remain to be accounted for the rev mr barry conjectures it to be a
hermit's cell but it displays no symbol of christianity and the door
opens to the westward the orcadian traditions allege the work to be
that of a dwarf to whom they ascribe supernatural powers and a
malevolent disposition the attributes of that race in norse mythology
whoever inhabited this singular den certainly enjoyed

 pillow cold and sheets not warm

i observed that commencing just opposite to the dwarfie stone and
extending in a line to the sea-beach there are a number of small
barrows or cairns which seem to connect the stone with a very large
cairn where we landed this curious monument may therefore have been
intended as a temple of some kind to the northern dii manes to which
the cairns might direct worshippers


note ix p  carbuncle on the ward-hill

at the west end of this stone i e the dwarfie stone stands an
exceeding high mountain of a steep ascent called the ward-hill of hoy
near the top of which in the months of may june and july about
midnight is seen something that shines and sparkles admirably and
which is often seen a great way off it hath shined more brightly
before than it does now and though many have climbed up the hill and
attempted to search for it yet they could find nothing the vulgar
talk of it as some enchanted carbuncle but i take it rather to be some
water sliding down the face of a smooth rock which when the sun
at such a time shines upon the reflection causeth that admirable
splendour dr wallace's description of the islands of orkney

chapter i

 but lost to me for ever lost those joys
 which reason scatters and which time destroys
 no more the midnight fairy-train i view
 all in the merry moonlight tippling dew
 even the last lingering fiction of the brain
 the churchyard ghost is now at rest again

 the library


the moral bard from whom we borrow the motto of this chapter has
touched a theme with which most readers have some feelings that vibrate
unconsciously superstition when not arrayed in her full horrors but
laying a gentle hand only on her suppliant's head had charms which we
fail not to regret even in those stages of society from which her
influence is wellnigh banished by the light of reason and general
education at least in more ignorant periods her system of ideal
terrors had something in them interesting to minds which had few means
of excitement this is more especially true of those lighter
modifications of superstitious feelings and practices which mingle in
the amusements of the ruder ages and are like the auguries of
hallow-e'en in scotland considered partly as matter of merriment
partly as sad and prophetic earnest and with similar feelings people
even of tolerable education have in our times sought the cell of a
fortune-teller upon a frolic as it is termed and yet not always in a
disposition absolutely sceptical towards the responses they receive

when the sisters of burgh-westra arrived in the apartment destined for a
breakfast as ample as that which we have described on the preceding
morning and had undergone a jocular rebuke from the udaller for their
late attendance they found the company most of whom had already
breakfasted engaged in an ancient norwegian custom of the character
which we have just described

it seems to have been borrowed from those poems of the scalds in which
champions and heroines are so often represented as seeking to know their
destiny from some sorceress or prophetess who as in the legend called
by gray the descent of odin awakens by the force of runic rhyme the
unwilling revealer of the doom of fate and compels from her answers
often of dubious import but which were then believed to express some
shadow of the events of futurity

an old sibyl euphane fea the housekeeper we have already mentioned
was installed in the recess of a large window studiously darkened by
bear-skins and other miscellaneous drapery so as to give it something
the appearance of a laplander's hut and accommodated like a
confessional chair with an aperture which permitted the person within
to hear with ease whatever questions should be put though not to see
the querist here seated the voluspa or sibyl was to listen to the
rhythmical enquiries which should be made to her and return an
extemporaneous answer the drapery was supposed to prevent her from
seeing by what individuals she was consulted and the intended or
accidental reference which the answer given under such circumstances
bore to the situation of the person by whom the question was asked
often furnished food for laughter and sometimes as it happened for
more serious reflection the sibyl was usually chosen from her
possessing the talent of improvisation in the norse poetry no unusual
accomplishment where the minds of many were stored with old verses and
where the rules of metrical composition are uncommonly simple the
questions were also put in verse but as this power of extemporaneous
composition though common could not be supposed universal the medium
of an interpreter might be used by any querist which interpreter
holding the consulter of the oracle by the hand and standing by the
place from which the oracles were issued had the task of rendering into
verse the subject of enquiry

on the present occasion claud halcro was summoned by the universal
voice to perform the part of interpreter and after shaking his head
and muttering some apology for decay of memory and poetical powers
contradicted at once by his own conscious smile of confidence and by the
general shout of the company the lighthearted old man came forward to
play his part in the proposed entertainment

but just as it was about to commence the arrangement of parts was
singularly altered norna of the fitful-head whom every one excepting
the two sisters believed to be at the distance of many miles suddenly
and without greeting entered the apartment walked majestically up to
the bearskin tabernacle and signed to the female who was there seated
to abdicate her sanctuary the old woman came forth shaking her head
and looking like one overwhelmed with fear nor indeed were there many
in the company who saw with absolute composure the sudden appearance of
a person so well known and so generally dreaded as norna

she paused a moment at the entrance of the tent and as she raised the
skin which formed the entrance she looked up to the north as if
imploring from that quarter a strain of inspiration then signing to the
surprised guests that they might approach in succession the shrine in
which she was about to install herself she entered the tent and was
shrouded from their sight

but this was a different sport from what the company had meditated and
to most of them seemed to present so much more of earnest than of game
that there was no alacrity shown to consult the oracle the character
and pretensions of norna seemed to almost all present too serious for
the part which she had assumed the men whispered to each other and the
women according to claud halcro realized the description of glorious
john dryden 

 with horror shuddering in a heap they ran

the pause was interrupted by the loud manly voice of the udaller why
does the game stand still my masters are you afraid because my
kinswoman is to play our voluspa it is kindly done in her to do for us
what none in the isles can do so well and we will not baulk our sport
for it but rather go on the merrier

there was still a pause in the company and magnus troil added it
shall never be said that my kinswoman sat in her bower unhalsed as if
she were some of the old mountain-giantesses and all from faint heart
i will speak first myself but the rhyme comes worse from my tongue than
when i was a score of years younger claud halcro you must stand by
me

hand in hand they approached the shrine of the supposed sibyl and after
a moment's consultation together halcro thus expressed the query of his
friend and patron now the udaller like many persons of consequence in
zetland who as sir robert sibbald has testified for them had begun
thus early to apply both to commerce and navigation was concerned to
some extent in the whale-fishery of the season and the bard had been
directed to put into his halting verse an enquiry concerning its
success

claud halcro

 mother darksome mother dread 
 dweller on the fitful-head
 thou canst see what deeds are done
 under the never-setting sun
 look through sleet and look through frost
 look to greenland's caves and coast 
 by the iceberg is a sail
 chasing of the swarthy whale
 mother doubtful mother dread
 tell us has the good ship sped

the jest seemed to turn to earnest as all bending their heads around
listened to the voice of norna who without a moment's hesitation
answered from the recesses of the tent in which she was enclosed 

norna

 the thought of the aged is ever on gear 
 on his fishing his furrow his flock and his steer
 but thrive may his fishing flock furrow and herd
 while the aged for anguish shall tear his grey beard

there was a momentary pause during which triptolemus had time to
whisper if ten witches and as many warlocks were to swear it i will
never believe that a decent man will either fash his beard or himself
about any thing so long as stock and crop goes as it should do

but the voice from within the tent resumed its low monotonous tone of
recitation and interrupting farther commentary proceeded as
follows 

norna

 the ship well-laden as bark need be
 lies deep in the furrow of the iceland sea 
 the breeze for zetland blows fair and soft
 and gaily the garland is fluttering aloft
 seven good fishes have spouted their last
 and their jaw-bones are hanging to yard and mast
 two are for lerwick and two for kirkwall 
 and three for burgh-westra the choicest of all

now the powers above look down and protect us said bryce snailsfoot
for it is mair than woman's wit that has spaed out that ferly i saw
them at north ronaldshaw that had seen the good bark the olave of
lerwick that our worthy patron has such a great share in that she may
be called his own in a manner and they had broomed the ship and as
sure as there are stars in heaven she answered them for seven fish
exact as norna has telled us in her rhyme

umph seven fish exactly and you heard it at north ronaldshaw said
captain cleveland and i suppose told it as a good piece of news when
you came hither

it never crossed my tongue captain answered the pedlar i have kend
mony chapmen travelling merchants and such like neglect their goods
to carry clashes and clavers up and down from one countryside to
another but that is no traffic of mine i dinna believe i have
mentioned the olave's having made up her cargo to three folks since i
crossed to dunrossness

but if one of those three had spoken the news over again and it is two
to one that such a thing happened the old lady prophesies upon velvet

such was the speech of cleveland addressed to magnus troil and heard
without any applause the udaller's respect for his country extended to
its superstitions and so did the interest which he took in his
unfortunate kinswoman if he never rendered a precise assent to her high
supernatural pretensions he was not at least desirous of hearing them
disputed by others

norna he said his cousin an emphasis on the word held no
communication with bryce snailsfoot or his acquaintances he did not
pretend to explain how she came by her information but he had always
remarked that scotsmen and indeed strangers in general when they came
to zetland were ready to find reasons for things which remained
sufficiently obscure to those whose ancestors had dwelt there for ages

captain cleveland took the hint and bowed without attempting to defend
his own scepticism

and now forward my brave hearts said the udaller and may all have
as good tidings as i have three whales cannot but yield let me think
how many hogsheads  

there was an obvious reluctance on the part of the guests to be the next
in consulting the oracle of the tent

gude news are welcome to some folks if they came frae the deil
himsell said mistress baby yellowley addressing the lady
glowrowrum for a similarity of disposition in some respects had made a
sort of intimacy betwixt them but i think my leddy that this has
ower mickle of rank witchcraft in it to have the countenance of douce
christian folks like you and me my leddy

there may be something in what you say my dame replied the good lady
glowrowrum but we hialtlanders are no just like other folks and this
woman if she be a witch being the fowd's friend and near kinswoman it
will be ill taen if we haena our fortunes spaed like a the rest of
them and sae my nieces may e'en step forward in their turn and nae
harm dune they will hae time to repent ye ken in the course of
nature if there be ony thing wrang in it mistress yellowley

while others remained under similar uncertainty and apprehension
halcro who saw by the knitting of the old udaller's brows and by a
certain impatient shuffle of his right foot like the motion of a man
who with difficulty refrains from stamping that his patience began to
wax rather thin gallantly declared that he himself would in his own
person and not as a procurator for others put the next query to the
pythoness he paused a minute collected his rhymes and thus addressed
her

claud halcro

 mother doubtful mother dread
 dweller of the fitful-head
 thou hast conn'd full many a rhyme
 that lives upon the surge of time
 tell me shall my lays be sung
 like hacon's of the golden tongue
 long after halcro's dead and gone
 or shall hialtland's minstrel own
 one note to rival glorious john

the voice of the sibyl immediately replied from her sanctuary

norna

 the infant loves the rattle's noise
 age double childhood hath its toys
 but different far the descant rings
 as strikes a different hand the strings
 the eagle mounts the polar sky 
 the imber-goose unskill'd to fly
 must be content to glide along
 where seal and sea-dog list his song

halcro bit his lip shrugged his shoulders and then instantly
recovering his good-humour and the ready though slovenly power of
extemporaneous composition with which long habit had invested him he
gallantly rejoined

claud halcro

 be mine the imber-goose to play
 and haunt lone cave and silent bay 
 the archer's aim so shall i shun 
 so shall i scape the levell'd gun 
 content my verse's tuneless jingle
 with thule's sounding tides to mingle
 while to the ear of wandering wight
 upon the distant headland's height
 soften'd by murmur of the sea
 the rude sounds seem like harmony

as the little bard stepped back with an alert gait and satisfied air
general applause followed the spirited manner in which he had acquiesced
in the doom which levelled him with an imber-goose but his resigned and
courageous submission did not even yet encourage any other person to
consult the redoubted norna

the coward fools said the udaller are you too afraid captain
cleveland to speak to an old woman ask her any thing ask her whether
the twelve-gun sloop at kirkwall be your consort or no

cleveland looked at minna and probably conceiving that she watched with
anxiety his answer to her father's question he collected himself after
a moment's hesitation

i never was afraid of man or woman master halcro you have heard the
question which our host desires me to ask put it in my name and in
your own way i pretend to as little skill in poetry as i do in
witchcraft

halcro did not wait to be invited twice but grasping captain
cleveland's hand in his according to the form which the game
prescribed he put the query which the udaller had dictated to the
stranger in the following words 

claud halcro

 mother doubtful mother dread
 dweller of the fitful-head
 a gallant bark from far abroad
 saint magnus hath her in his road
 with guns and firelocks not a few 
 a silken and a scarlet crew
 deep stored with precious merchandise
 of gold and goods of rare device 
 what interest hath our comrade bold
 in bark and crew in goods and gold

there was a pause of unusual duration ere the oracle would return any
answer and when she replied it was in a lower though an equally
decided tone with that which she had hitherto employed 

norna

 gold is ruddy fair and free
 blood is crimson and dark to see 
 i look'd out on saint magnus bay
 and i saw a falcon that struck her prey 
 a gobbet of flesh in her beak she bore
 and talons and singles are dripping with gore
 let him that asks after them look on his hand
 and if there is blood on't he's one of their band

cleveland smiled scornfully and held out his hand few men have been
on the spanish main as often as i have without having had to do with
the guarda costas once and again but there never was aught like a
stain on my hand that a wet towel would not wipe away

the udaller added his voice potential there is never peace with
spaniards beyond the line i have heard captain tragendeck and honest
old commodore rummelaer say so an hundred times and they have both been
down in the bay of honduras and all thereabouts i hate all spaniards
since they came here and reft the fair isle men of their vivers in
 i have heard my grandfather speak of it and there is an old
dutch history somewhere about the house that shows what work they made
in the low countries long since there is neither mercy nor faith in
them

true true my old friend said cleveland they are as jealous of
their indian possessions as an old man of his young bride and if they
can catch you at disadvantage the mines for your life is the word and
so we fight them with our colours nailed to the mast

that is the way shouted the udaller the old british jack should
never down when i think of the wooden walls i almost think myself an
englishman only it would be becoming too like my scottish
neighbours but come no offence to any here gentlemen all are
friends and all are welcome come brenda go on with the play do you
speak next you have norse rhymes enough we all know

but none that suit the game we play at father said brenda drawing
back

nonsense said her father pushing her onward while halcro seized on
her reluctant hand never let mistimed modesty mar honest mirth speak
for brenda halcro it is your trade to interpret maidens thoughts

the poet bowed to the beautiful young woman with the devotion of a poet
and the gallantry of a traveller and having in a whisper reminded her
that she was in no way responsible for the nonsense he was about to
speak he paused looked upward simpered as if he had caught a sudden
idea and at length set off in the following verses

claud halcro

 mother doubtful mother dread 
 dweller of the fitful-head
 well thou know'st it is thy task
 to tell what beauty will not ask 
 then steep thy words in wine and milk
 and weave a doom of gold and silk 
 for we would know shall brenda prove
 in love and happy in her love

the prophetess replied almost immediately from behind her curtain 

norna

 untouched by love the maiden's breast
 is like the snow on rona's crest
 high seated in the middle sky
 in bright and barren purity
 but by the sunbeam gently kiss'd
 scarce by the gazing eye tis miss'd
 ere down the lonely valley stealing
 fresh grass and growth its course revealing
 it cheers the flock revives the flower
 and decks some happy shepherd's bower

a comfortable doctrine and most justly spoken said the udaller
seizing the blushing brenda as she was endeavouring to escape never
think shame for the matter my girl to be the mistress of some honest
man's house and the means of maintaining some old norse name making
neighbours happy the poor easy and relieving strangers is the most
creditable lot a young woman can look to and i heartily wish it to all
here come who speaks next good husbands are going maddie
groatsettar my pretty clara come and have your share

the lady glowrowrum shook her head and could not she said
altogether approve  

enough said enough said replied magnus no compulsion but the play
shall go on till we are tired of it here minna i have got you at
command stand forth my girl there are plenty of things to be ashamed
of besides old-fashioned and innocent pleasantry come i will speak
for you myself though i am not sure i can remember rhyme enough for
it

there was a slight colour which passed rapidly over minna's face but
she instantly regained her composure and stood erect by her father as
one superior to any little jest to which her situation might give rise

her father after some rubbing of his brow and other mechanical efforts
to assist his memory at length recovered verse sufficient to put the
following query though in less gallant strains than those of halcro 

magnus troil

 mother speak and do not tarry
 here's a maiden fain would marry
 shall she marry ay or not
 if she marry what's her lot

a deep sigh was uttered within the tabernacle of the soothsayer as if
she compassionated the subject of the doom which she was obliged to
pronounce she then as usual returned her response 

norna

 untouch'd by love the maiden's breast
 is like the snow on rona's crest
 so pure so free from earthly dye
 it seems whilst leaning on the sky
 part of the heaven to which tis nigh
 but passion like the wild march rain
 may soil the wreath with many a stain
 we gaze the lovely vision's gone 
 a torrent fills the bed of stone
 that hurrying to destruction's shock
 leaps headlong from the lofty rock

the udaller heard this reply with high resentment by the bones of the
martyr he said his bold visage becoming suddenly ruddy this is an
abuse of courtesy and were it any but yourself that had classed my
daughter's name and the word destruction together they had better have
left the word unspoken but come forth of the tent thou old
galdragon he added with a smile i should have known that thou
canst not long joy in any thing that smacks of mirth god help thee
his summons received no answer and after waiting a moment he again
addressed her nay never be sullen with me kinswoman though i did
speak a hasty word thou knowest i bear malice to no one least of all
to thee so come forth and let us shake hands thou mightst have
foretold the wreck of my ship and boats or a bad herring-fishery and i
should have said never a word but minna or brenda you know are things
which touch me nearer but come out shake hands and there let there be
an end on't

norna returned no answer whatever to his repeated invocations and the
company began to look upon each other with some surprise when the
udaller raising the skin which covered the entrance of the tent
discovered that the interior was empty the wonder was now general and
not unmixed with fear for it seemed impossible that norna could have
in any manner escaped from the tabernacle in which she was enclosed
without having been discovered by the company gone however she was
and the udaller after a moment's consideration dropt the skin-curtain
again over the entrance of the tent

my friends he said with a cheerful countenance we have long known
my kinswoman and that her ways are not like those of the ordinary folks
of this world but she means well by hialtland and hath the love of a
sister for me and for my house and no guest of mine needs either to
fear evil or to take offence at her hand i have little doubt she will
be with us at dinner-time

now heaven forbid said mrs baby yellowley for my gude leddy
glowrowrum to tell your leddyship the truth i likena cummers that can
come and gae like a glance of the sun or the whisk of a whirlwind

speak lower speak lower said the lady glowrowrum and be thankful
that yon carlin hasna ta'en the house-side away wi her the like of her
have played warse pranks and so has she hersell unless she is the
sairer lied on

similar murmurs ran through the rest of the company until the udaller
uplifted his stentorian and imperative voice to put them to silence and
invited or rather commanded the attendance of his guests to behold the
boats set off for the haaf or deep-sea fishing

the wind has been high since sunrise he said and had kept the boats
in the bay but now it was favourable and they would sail
immediately

this sudden alteration of the weather occasioned sundry nods and winks
amongst the guests who were not indisposed to connect it with norna's
sudden disappearance but without giving vent to observations which
could not but be disagreeable to their host they followed his stately
step to the shore as the herd of deer follows the leading stag with
all manner of respectful observancea

chapter ii

 there was a laughing devil in his sneer
 that raised emotions both of rage and fear
 and where his frown of hatred darkly fell
 hope withering fled and mercy sigh'd farewell

 the corsair canto i


the ling or white fishery is the principal employment of the natives of
zetland and was formerly that upon which the gentry chiefly depended
for their income and the poor for their subsistence the fishing season
is therefore like the harvest of an agricultural country the busiest
and most important as well as the most animating period of the year

the fishermen of each district assemble at particular stations with
their boats and crews and erect upon the shore small huts composed of
shingle and covered with turf for their temporary lodging and skeos
or drying-houses for the fish so that the lonely beach at once assumes
the appearance of an indian town the banks to which they repair for the
haaf fishing are often many miles distant from the station where the
fish is dried so that they are always twenty or thirty hours absent
frequently longer and under unfavourable circumstances of wind and
tide they remain at sea with a very small stock of provisions and in
a boat of a construction which seems extremely slender for two or three
days and are sometimes heard of no more the departure of the fishers
therefore on this occupation has in it a character of danger and of
suffering which renders it dignified and the anxiety of the females
who remain on the beach watching the departure of the lessening boat
or anxiously looking out for its return gives pathos to the scene

the scene therefore was in busy and anxious animation when the
udaller and his friends appeared on the beach the various crews of
about thirty boats amounting each to from three to five or six men
were taking leave of their wives and female relatives and jumping on
board their long norway skiffs where their lines and tackle lay ready
stowed magnus was not an idle spectator of the scene he went from one
place to another enquiring into the state of their provisions for the
voyage and their preparations for the fishing now and then with a
rough dutch or norse oath abusing them for blockheads for going to sea
with their boats indifferently found but always ending by ordering
from his own stores a gallon of gin a lispund of meal or some similar
essential addition to their sea-stores the hardy sailors on receiving
such favours expressed their thanks in the brief gruff manner which
their landlord best approved but the women were more clamorous in their
gratitude which magnus was often obliged to silence by cursing all
female tongues from eve's downwards

at length all were on board and ready the sails were hoisted the
signal for departure given the rowers began to pull and all started
from the shore in strong emulation to get first to the fishing ground
and to have their lines set before the rest an exploit to which no
little consequence was attached by the boat's crew who should be happy
enough to perform it

while they were yet within hearing of the shore they chanted an ancient
norse ditty appropriate to the occasion of which claud halcro had
executed the following literal translation 

 farewell merry maidens to song and to laugh
 for the brave lads of westra are bound to the haaf
 and we must have labour and hunger and pain
 ere we dance with the maids of dunrossness again

 for now in our trim boats of noroway deal
 we must dance on the waves with the porpoise and seal
 the breeze it shall pipe so it pipe not too high
 and the gull be our songstress whene'er she flits by

 sing on my brave bird while we follow like thee
 by bank shoal and quicksand the swarms of the sea
 and when twenty-score fishes are straining our line
 sing louder brave bird for their spoils shall be thine

 we'll sing while we bait and we'll sing when we haul
 for the deeps of the haaf have enough for us all
 there is torsk for the gentle and skate for the carle
 and there's wealth for bold magnus the son of the earl

 huzza my brave comrades give way for the haaf
 we shall sooner come back to the dance and the laugh
 for life without mirth is a lamp without oil
 then mirth and long life to the bold magnus troil

the rude words of the song were soon drowned in the ripple of the waves
but the tune continued long to mingle with the sound of wind and sea
and the boats were like so many black specks on the surface of the
ocean diminishing by degrees as they bore far and farther seaward
while the ear could distinguish touches of the human voice almost
drowned amid that of the elements

the fishermen's wives looked their last after the parting sails and
were now departing slowly with downcast and anxious looks towards the
huts in which they were to make arrangements for preparing and drying
the fish with which they hoped to see their husbands and friends return
deeply laden here and there an old sibyl displayed the superior
importance of her experience by predicting from the appearance of the
atmosphere that the wind would be fair or foul while others
recommended a vow to the kirk of st ninian's for the safety of their
men and boats an ancient catholic superstition not yet wholly
abolished and others but in a low and timorous tone regretted to
their companions that norna of fitful-head had been suffered to depart
in discontent that morning from burgh-westra and of all days in the
year that they suld have contrived to give her displeasure on the first
day of the white fishing

the gentry guests of magnus troil having whiled away as much time as
could be so disposed of in viewing the little armament set sail and in
conversing with the poor women who had seen their friends embark in it
began now to separate into various groups and parties which strolled in
different directions as fancy led them to enjoy what may be called the
clair-obscure of a zetland summer day which though without the
brilliant sunshine that cheers other countries during the fine season
has a mild and pleasing character of its own that softens while it
saddens landscapes which in their own lonely bare and monotonous
tone have something in them stern as well as barren

in one of the loneliest recesses of the coast where a deep indenture of
the rocks gave the tide access to the cavern or as it is called the
helyer of swartaster minna troil was walking with captain cleveland
they had probably chosen that walk as being little liable to
interruption from others for as the force of the tide rendered the
place unfit either for fishing or sailing so it was not the ordinary
resort of walkers on account of its being the supposed habitation of a
mermaid a race which norwegian superstition invests with magical as
well as mischievous qualities here therefore minna wandered with her
lover

a small spot of milk-white sand that stretched beneath one of the
precipices which walled in the creek on either side afforded them space
for a dry firm and pleasant walk of about an hundred yards terminated
at one extremity by a dark stretch of the bay which scarce touched by
the wind seemed almost as smooth as glass and which was seen from
between two lofty rocks the jaws of the creek or indenture that
approached each other above as if they wished to meet over the dark
tide that separated them the other end of their promenade was closed by
a lofty and almost unscaleable precipice the abode of hundreds of
sea-fowl of different kinds in the bottom of which the huge helyer or
sea-cave itself yawned as if for the purpose of swallowing up the
advancing tide which it seemed to receive into an abyss of immeasurable
depth and extent the entrance to this dismal cavern consisted not in a
single arch as usual but was divided into two by a huge pillar of
natural rock which rising out of the sea and extending to the top of
the cavern seemed to lend its support to the roof and thus formed a
double portal to the helyer on which the fishermen and peasants had
bestowed the rude name of the devil's nostrils in this wild scene
lonely and undisturbed but by the clang of the sea-fowl cleveland had
already met with minna troil more than once for with her it was a
favourite walk as the objects which it presented agreed peculiarly with
the love of the wild the melancholy and the wonderful but now the
conversation in which she was earnestly engaged was such as entirely to
withdraw her attention as well as that of her companion from the
scenery around them

you cannot deny it she said you have given way to feelings
respecting this young man which indicate prejudice and violence the
prejudice unmerited as far as you are concerned at least and the
violence equally imprudent and unjustifiable

i should have thought replied cleveland that the service i rendered
him yesterday might have freed me from such a charge i do not talk of
my own risk for i have lived in danger and love it it is not every
one however would have ventured so near the furious animal to save one
with whom they had no connexion

it is not every one indeed who could have saved him answered
minna gravely but every one who has courage and generosity would have
attempted it the giddy-brained claud halcro would have done as much as
you had his strength been equal to his courage my father would have
done as much though having such just cause of resentment against the
young man for his vain and braggart abuse of our hospitality do not
therefore boast of your exploit too much my good friend lest you
should make me think that it required too great an effort i know you
love not mordaunt mertoun though you exposed your own life to save
his

will you allow nothing then said cleveland for the long misery i
was made to endure from the common and prevailing report that this
beardless bird-hunter stood betwixt me and what i on earth coveted
most the affections of minna troil

he spoke in a tone at once impassioned and insinuating and his whole
language and manner seemed to express a grace and elegance which formed
the most striking contrast with the speech and gesture of the unpolished
seaman which he usually affected or exhibited but his apology was
unsatisfactory to minna

you have known she said perhaps too soon and too well how little
you had to fear if you indeed feared that mertoun or any other had
interest with minna troil nay truce to thanks and protestations i
would accept it as the best proof of gratitude that you would be
reconciled with this youth or at least avoid every quarrel with him

that we should be friends minna is impossible replied cleveland
even the love i bear you the most powerful emotion that my heart ever
knew cannot work that miracle

and why i pray you said minna there have been no evil offences
between you but rather an exchange of mutual services why can you not
be friends i have many reasons to wish it

and can you then forget the slights which he has cast upon brenda
and on yourself and on your father's house

i can forgive them all said minna can you not say so much who
have in truth received no offence

cleveland looked down and paused for an instant then raised his head
and replied i might easily deceive you minna and promise you what my
soul tells me is an impossibility but i am forced to use too much
deceit with others and with you i will use none i cannot be friend to
this young man there is a natural dislike an instinctive
aversion something like a principle of repulsion in our mutual nature
which makes us odious to each other ask himself he will tell you he
has the same antipathy against me the obligation he conferred on me was
a bridle to my resentment but i was so galled by the restraint that i
could have gnawed the curb till my lips were bloody

you have worn what you are wont to call your iron mask so long that
your features replied minna retain the impression of its rigidity
even when it is removed

you do me injustice minna replied her lover and you are angry with
me because i deal with you plainly and honestly plainly and honestly
however will i say that i cannot be mertoun's friend but it shall be
his own fault not mine if i am ever his enemy i seek not to injure
him but do not ask me to love him and of this remain satisfied that
it would be vain even if i could do so for as sure as i attempted any
advances towards his confidence so sure would i be to awaken his
disgust and suspicion leave us to the exercise of our natural feelings
which as they will unquestionably keep us as far separate as possible
are most likely to prevent any possible interference with each
other does this satisfy you

it must said minna since you tell me there is no remedy and now
tell me why you looked so grave when you heard of your consort's
arrival for that it is her i have no doubt in the port of kirkwall

i fear replied cleveland the consequences of that vessel's arrival
with her crew as comprehending the ruin of my fondest hopes i had made
some progress in your father's favour and with time might have made
more when hither come hawkins and the rest to blight my prospects for
ever i told you on what terms we parted i then commanded a vessel
braver and better found than their own with a crew who at my slightest
nod would have faced fiends armed with their own fiery element but i
now stand alone a single man destitute of all means to overawe or to
restrain them and they will soon show so plainly the ungovernable
license of their habits and dispositions that ruin to themselves and to
me will in all probability be the consequence

do not fear it said minna my father can never be so unjust as to
hold you liable for the offences of others

but what will magnus troil say to my own demerits fair minna said
cleveland smiling

my father is a zetlander or rather a norwegian said minna one of
an oppressed race who will not care whether you fought against the
spaniards who are the tyrants of the new world or against the dutch
and english who have succeeded to their usurped dominions his own
ancestors supported and exercised the freedom of the seas in those
gallant barks whose pennons were the dread of all europe

i fear nevertheless said cleveland that the descendant of an
ancient sea-king will scarce acknowledge a fitting acquaintance in a
modern rover i have not disguised from you that i have reason to dread
the english laws and magnus though a great enemy to taxes imposts
scat wattle and so forth has no idea of latitude upon points of a
more general character he would willingly reeve a rope to the yard-arm
for the benefit of an unfortunate buccanier

do not suppose so said minna he himself suffers too much oppression
from the tyrannical laws of our proud neighbours of scotland i trust he
will soon be able to rise in resistance against them the enemy such i
will call them are now divided amongst themselves and every vessel
from their coast brings intelligence of fresh commotions the highlands
against the lowlands the williamites against the jacobites the whigs
against the tories and to sum the whole the kingdom of england
against that of scotland what is there as claud halcro well hinted to
prevent our availing ourselves of the quarrels of these robbers to
assert the independence of which we are deprived

to hoist the raven standard on the castle of scalloway said
cleveland in imitation of her tone and manner and proclaim your
father earl magnus the first

earl magnus the seventh if it please you answered minna for six of
his ancestors have worn or were entitled to wear the coronet before
him you laugh at my ardour but what is there to prevent all this

nothing will prevent it replied cleveland because it will never
be attempted any thing might prevent it that is equal in strength to
the long-boat of a british man-of-war

you treat us with scorn sir said minna yet yourself should know
what a few resolved men may perform

but they must be armed minna replied cleveland and willing to
place their lives upon each desperate adventure think not of such
visions denmark has been cut down into a second-rate kingdom incapable
of exchanging a single broadside with england norway is a starving
wilderness and in these islands the love of independence has been
suppressed by a long term of subjection or shows itself but in a few
muttered growls over the bowl and bottle and were your men as willing
warriors as their ancestors what could the unarmed crews of a few
fishing-boats do against the british navy think no more of it sweet
minna it is a dream and i must term it so though it makes your eye so
bright and your step so noble

it is indeed a dream said minna looking down and it ill becomes a
daughter of hialtland to look or to move like a freewoman our eye
should be on the ground and our step slow and reluctant as that of one
who obeys a taskmaster

there are lands said cleveland in which the eye may look bright
upon groves of the palm and the cocoa and where the foot may move
light as a galley under sail over fields carpeted with flowers and
savannahs surrounded by aromatic thickets and where subjection is
unknown except that of the brave to the bravest and of all to the most
beautiful

minna paused a moment ere she spoke and then answered no cleveland
my own rude country has charms for me even desolate as you think it
and depressed as it surely is which no other land on earth can offer to
me i endeavour in vain to represent to myself those visions of trees
and of groves which my eye never saw but my imagination can conceive
no sight in nature more sublime than these waves when agitated by a
storm or more beautiful than when they come as they now do rolling
in calm tranquillity to the shore not the fairest scene in a foreign
land not the brightest sunbeam that ever shone upon the richest
landscape would win my thoughts for a moment from that lofty rock
misty hill and wide-rolling ocean hialtland is the land of my deceased
ancestors and of my living father and in hialtland will i live and
die

then in hialtland answered cleveland will i too live and die i
will not go to kirkwall i will not make my existence known to my
comrades from whom it were else hard for me to escape your father
loves me minna who knows whether long attention anxious care might
not bring him to receive me into his family who would regard the length
of a voyage that was certain to terminate in happiness

dream not of such an issue said minna it is impossible while you
live in my father's house while you receive his assistance and share
his table you will find him the generous friend and the hearty host
but touch him on what concerns his name and family and the
frank-hearted udaller will start up before you the haughty and proud
descendant of a norwegian jarl see you a moment's suspicion has
fallen on mordaunt mertoun and he has banished from his favour the
youth whom he so lately loved as a son no one must ally with his house
that is not of untainted northern descent

and mine may be so for aught that is known to me upon the subject
said cleveland

how said minna have you any reason to believe yourself of norse
descent

i have told you before replied cleveland that my family is totally
unknown to me i spent my earliest days upon a solitary plantation in
the little island of tortuga under the charge of my father then a
different person from what he afterwards became we were plundered by
the spaniards and reduced to such extremity of poverty that my father
in desperation and in thirst of revenge took up arms and having
become chief of a little band who were in the same circumstances
became a buccanier as it is called and cruized against spain with
various vicissitudes of good and bad fortune until while he interfered
to check some violence of his companions he fell by their hands no
uncommon fate among the captains of these rovers but whence my father
came or what was the place of his birth i know not fair minna nor
have i ever had a curious thought on the subject

he was a briton at least your unfortunate father said minna

i have no doubt of it said cleveland his name which i have
rendered too formidable to be openly spoken is an english one and his
acquaintance with the english language and even with english
literature together with the pains which he took in better days to
teach me both plainly spoke him to be an englishman if the rude
bearing which i display towards others is not the genuine character of
my mind and manners it is to my father minna that i owe any share of
better thoughts and principles which may render me worthy in some
small degree of your notice and approbation and yet it sometimes seems
to me that i have two different characters for i cannot bring myself
to believe that i who now walk this lone beach with the lovely minna
troil and am permitted to speak to her of the passion which i have
cherished have ever been the daring leader of the bold band whose name
was as terrible as a tornado

you had not been permitted said minna to use that bold language
towards the daughter of magnus troil had you not been the brave and
undaunted leader who with so small means has made his name so
formidable my heart is like that of a maiden of the ancient days and
is to be won not by fair words but by gallant deeds

alas that heart said cleveland and what is it that i may do what
is it that man can do to win in it the interest which i desire

rejoin your friends pursue your fortunes leave the rest to destiny
said minna should you return the leader of a gallant fleet who can
tell what may befall

and what shall assure me that when i return if return i ever
shall i may not find minna troil a bride or a spouse no minna i
will not trust to destiny the only object worth attaining which my
stormy voyage in life has yet offered me

hear me said minna i will bind myself to you if you dare accept
such an engagement by the promise of odin the most sacred of our
northern rites which are yet practised among us that i will never
favour another until you resign the pretensions which i have given to
you will that satisfy you for more i cannot more i will not give

then with that said cleveland after a moment's pause i must
perforce be satisfied but remember it is yourself that throw me back
upon a mode of life which the laws of britain denounce as criminal and
which the violent passions of the daring men by whom it is pursued have
rendered infamous

but i said minna am superior to such prejudices in warring with
england i see their laws in no other light than as if you were engaged
with an enemy who in fulness of pride and power has declared he will
give his antagonist no quarter a brave man will not fight the worse for
this and for the manners of your comrades so that they do not infect
your own why should their evil report attach to you

cleveland gazed at her as she spoke with a degree of wondering
admiration in which at the same time there lurked a smile at her
simplicity

i could not he said have believed that such high courage could
have been found united with such ignorance of the world as the world is
now wielded for my manners they who best know me will readily allow
that i have done my best at the risk of my popularity and of my life
itself to mitigate the ferocity of my mates but how can you teach
humanity to men burning with vengeance against the world by whom they
are proscribed or teach them temperance and moderation in enjoying the
pleasures which chance throws in their way to vary a life which would
be otherwise one constant scene of peril and hardship but this
promise minna this promise which is all i am to receive in guerdon
for my faithful attachment let me at least lose no time in claiming
that

it must not be rendered here but in kirkwall we must invoke to
witness the engagement the spirit which presides over the ancient
circle of stennis but perhaps you fear to name the ancient father of
the slain too the severe the terrible

cleveland smiled

do me the justice to think lovely minna that i am little subject to
fear real causes of terror and for those which are visionary i have no
sympathy whatever

you believe not in them then said minna and are so far better
suited to be brenda's lover than mine

i will believe replied cleveland in whatever you believe the whole
inhabitants of that valhalla about which you converse so much with that
fiddling rhyming fool claud halcro all these shall become living and
existing things to my credulity but minna do not ask me to fear any
of them

fear no not to fear them surely replied the maiden for not
before thor or odin when they approached in the fulness of their
terrors did the heroes of my dauntless race yield one foot in retreat
nor do i own them as deities a better faith prevents so foul an error
but in our own conception they are powerful spirits for good or evil
and when you boast not to fear them bethink you that you defy an enemy
of a kind you have never yet encountered

not in these northern latitudes said the lover with a smile where
hitherto i have seen but angels but i have faced in my time the
demons of the equinoctial line which we rovers suppose to be as
powerful and as malignant as those of the north

have you then witnessed those wonders that are beyond the visible
world said minna with some degree of awe

cleveland composed his countenance and replied a short while before
my father's death i came though then very young into the command of a
sloop manned with thirty as desperate fellows as ever handled a musket
we cruized for a long while with bad success taking nothing but
wretched small-craft which were destined to catch turtle or otherwise
loaded with coarse and worthless trumpery i had much ado to prevent my
comrades from avenging upon the crews of those baubling shallops the
disappointment which they had occasioned to us at length we grew
desperate and made a descent on a village where we were told we should
intercept the mules of a certain spanish governor laden with treasure
we succeeded in carrying the place but while i endeavoured to save the
inhabitants from the fury of my followers the muleteers with their
precious cargo escaped into the neighbouring woods this filled up the
measure of my unpopularity my people who had been long discontented
became openly mutinous i was deposed from my command in solemn council
and condemned as having too little luck and too much humanity for the
profession i had undertaken to be marooned as the phrase goes on
one of those little sandy bushy islets which are called in the west
indies keys and which are frequented only by turtle and by sea-fowl
many of them are supposed to be hauntedb some by the demons
worshipped by the old inhabitants some by caciques and others whom the
spaniards had put to death by torture to compel them to discover their
hidden treasures and others by the various spectres in which sailors of
all nations have implicit faith my place of banishment called
coffin-key about two leagues and a half to the south-east of bermudas
was so infamous as the resort of these supernatural inhabitants that i
believe the wealth of mexico would not have persuaded the bravest of the
scoundrels who put me ashore there to have spent an hour on the islet
alone even in broad daylight and when they rowed off they pulled for
the sloop like men that dared not cast their eyes behind them and there
they left me to subsist as i might on a speck of unproductive sand
surrounded by the boundless atlantic and haunted as they supposed by
malignant demons

and what was the consequence said minna eagerly

i supported life said the adventurer at the expense of such
sea-fowl aptly called boobies as were silly enough to let me approach
so near as to knock them down with a stick and by means of turtle-eggs
when these complaisant birds became better acquainted with the
mischievous disposition of the human species and more shy of course of
my advances

and the demons of whom you spoke continued minna

i had my secret apprehensions upon their account said cleveland in
open daylight or in absolute darkness i did not greatly apprehend
their approach but in the misty dawn of the morning or when evening
was about to fall i saw for the first week of my abode on the key
many a dim and undefined spectre now resembling a spaniard with his
capa wrapped around him and his huge sombrero as large as an umbrella
upon his head now a dutch sailor with his rough cap and
trunk-hose and now an indian cacique with his feathery crown and long
lance of cane

did you not approach and address them said minna

i always approached them replied the seaman but i grieve to
disappoint your expectations my fair friend whenever i drew near
them the phantom changed into a bush or a piece of drift-wood or a
wreath of mist or some such cause of deception until at last i was
taught by experience to cheat myself no longer with such visions and
continued a solitary inhabitant of coffin-key as little alarmed by
visionary terrors as i ever was in the great cabin of a stout vessel
with a score of companions around me

you have cheated me into listening to a tale of nothing said minna
but how long did you continue on the island

four weeks of wretched existence said cleveland when i was relieved
by the crew of a vessel which came thither a-turtling yet my miserable
seclusion was not entirely useless to me for on that spot of barren
sand i found or rather forged the iron mask which has since been my
chief security against treason or mutiny of my followers it was there
i formed the resolution to seem no softer hearted nor better
instructed no more humane and no more scrupulous than those with whom
fortune had leagued me i thought over my former story and saw that
seeming more brave skilful and enterprising than others had gained me
command and respect and that seeming more gently nurtured and more
civilized than they had made them envy and hate me as a being of
another species i bargained with myself then that since i could not
lay aside my superiority of intellect and education i would do my best
to disguise and to sink in the rude seaman all appearance of better
feeling and better accomplishments i foresaw then what has since
happened that under the appearance of daring obduracy i should
acquire such a habitual command over my followers that i might use it
for the insurance of discipline and for relieving the distresses of the
wretches who fell under our power i saw in short that to attain
authority i must assume the external semblance at least of those over
whom it was to be exercised the tidings of my father's fate while it
excited me to wrath and to revenge confirmed the resolution i had
adopted he also had fallen a victim to his superiority of mind morals
and manners above those whom he commanded they were wont to call him
the gentleman and unquestionably they thought he waited some
favourable opportunity to reconcile himself perhaps at their expense
to those existing forms of society his habits seemed best to suit with
and even therefore they murdered him nature and justice alike called
on me for revenge i was soon at the head of a new body of the
adventurers who are so numerous in those islands i sought not after
those by whom i had been myself marooned but after the wretches who had
betrayed my father and on them i took a revenge so severe that it was
of itself sufficient to stamp me with the character of that inexorable
ferocity which i was desirous to be thought to possess and which
perhaps was gradually creeping on my natural disposition in actual
earnest my manner speech and conduct seemed so totally changed that
those who formerly knew me were disposed to ascribe the alteration to my
intercourse with the demons who haunted the sands of coffin-key nay
there were some superstitious enough to believe that i had actually
formed a league with them

i tremble to hear the rest said minna did you not become the
monster of courage and cruelty whose character you assumed

if i have escaped being so it is to you minna replied cleveland
that the wonder must be ascribed it is true i have always endeavoured
to distinguish myself rather by acts of adventurous valour than by
schemes of revenge or of plunder and that at length i could save lives
by a rude jest and sometimes by the excess of the measures which i
myself proposed could induce those under me to intercede in favour of
prisoners so that the seeming severity of my character has better
served the cause of humanity than had i appeared directly devoted to
it

he ceased and as minna replied not a word both remained silent for a
little space when cleveland again resumed the discourse 

you are silent he said miss troil and i have injured myself in
your opinion by the frankness with which i have laid my character before
you i may truly say that my natural disposition has been controlled
but not altered by the untoward circumstances in which i am placed

i am uncertain said minna after a moment's consideration whether
you had been thus candid had you not known i should soon see your
comrades and discover from their conversation and their manners what
you would otherwise gladly have concealed

you do me injustice minna cruel injustice from the instant that you
knew me to be a sailor of fortune an adventurer a buccanier or if
you will have the broad word a pirate what had you to expect less than
what i have told you

you speak too truly said minna all this i might have anticipated
and i know not how i should have expected it otherwise but it seemed to
me that a war on the cruel and superstitious spaniards had in it
something ennobling something that refined the fierce employment to
which you have just now given its true and dreaded name i thought that
the independent warriors of the western ocean raised up as it were to
punish the wrongs of so many murdered and plundered tribes must have
had something of gallant elevation like that of the sons of the north
whose long galleys avenged on so many coasts the oppressions of
degenerate rome this i thought and this i dreamed i grieve that i am
awakened and undeceived yet i blame you not for the erring of my own
fancy farewell we must now part

say at least said cleveland that you do not hold me in horror for
having told you the truth

i must have time for reflection said minna time to weigh what you
have said ere i can fully understand my own feelings thus much
however i can say even now that he who pursues the wicked purpose of
plunder by means of blood and cruelty and who must veil his remains of
natural remorse under an affectation of superior profligacy is not and
cannot be the lover whom minna troil expected to find in cleveland and
if she still love him it must be as a penitent and not as a hero

so saying she extricated herself from his grasp for he still
endeavoured to detain her making an imperative sign to him to forbear
from following her she is gone said cleveland looking after her
wild and fanciful as she is i expected not this she startled not at
the name of my perilous course of life yet seems totally unprepared for
the evil which must necessarily attend it and so all the merit i have
gained by my resemblance to a norse champion or king of the sea is to
be lost at once because a gang of pirates do not prove to be a choir of
saints i would that rackam hawkins and the rest had been at the
bottom of the race of portland i would the pentland frith had swept
them to hell rather than to orkney i will not however quit the chase
of this angel for all that these fiends can do i will i must to orkney
before the udaller makes his voyage thither our meeting might alarm
even his blunt understanding although thank heaven in this wild
country men know the nature of our trade only by hearsay through our
honest friends the dutch who take care never to speak very ill of those
they make money by well if fortune would but stand my friend with
this beautiful enthusiast i would pursue her wheel no farther at sea
but set myself down amongst these rocks as happy as if they were so
many groves of bananas and palmettoes

with these and such thoughts half rolling in his bosom half expressed
in indistinct hints and murmurs the pirate cleveland returned to the
mansion of burgh-westra

chapter iii

 there was shaking of hands and sorrow of heart
 for the hour was approaching when merry folks must part
 so we call'd for our horses and ask'd for our way
 while the jolly old landlord said nothing's to pay

 lilliput a poem


we do not dwell upon the festivities of the day which had nothing in
them to interest the reader particularly the table groaned under the
usual plenty which was disposed of by the guests with the usual
appetite the bowl of punch was filled and emptied with the same
celerity as usual the men quaffed and the women laughed claud halcro
rhymed punned and praised john dryden the udaller bumpered and sung
choruses and the evening concluded as usual in the rigging-loft as
it was magnus troil's pleasure to term the dancing apartment

it was then and there that cleveland approaching magnus where he sat
betwixt his two daughters intimated his intention of going to kirkwall
in a small brig which bryce snailsfoot who had disposed of his goods
with unprecedented celerity had freighted thither to procure a supply

magnus heard the sudden proposal of his guest with surprise not
unmingled with displeasure and demanded sharply of cleveland how long
it was since he had learned to prefer bryce snailsfoot's company to his
own cleveland answered with his usual bluntness of manner that time
and tide tarried for no one and that he had his own particular reasons
for making his trip to kirkwall sooner than the udaller proposed to set
sail that he hoped to meet with him and his daughters at the great fair
which was now closely approaching and might perhaps find it possible to
return to zetland along with them

while he spoke this brenda kept her eye as much upon her sister as it
was possible to do without exciting general observation she remarked
that minna's pale cheek became yet paler while cleveland spoke and that
she seemed by compressing her lips and slightly knitting her brows to
be in the act of repressing the effects of strong interior emotion but
she spoke not and when cleveland having bidden adieu to the udaller
approached to salute her as was then the custom she received his
farewell without trusting herself to attempt a reply

brenda had her own trial approaching for mordaunt mertoun once so much
loved by her father was now in the act of making his cold parting from
him without receiving a single look of friendly regard there was
indeed sarcasm in the tone with which magnus wished the youth a good
journey and recommended to him if he met a bonny lass by the way not
to dream that she was in love because she chanced to jest with him
mertoun coloured at what he felt as an insult though it was but half
intelligible to him but he remembered brenda and suppressed every
feeling of resentment he proceeded to take his leave of the sisters
minna whose heart was considerably softened towards him received his
farewell with some degree of interest but brenda's grief was so visible
in the kindness of her manner and the moisture which gathered in her
eye that it was noticed even by the udaller who exclaimed half
angrily why ay lass that may be right enough for he was an old
acquaintance but mind i have no will that he remain one

mertoun who was slowly leaving the apartment half overheard this
disparaging observation and half turned round to resent it but his
purpose failed him when he saw that brenda had been obliged to have
recourse to her handkerchief to hide her emotion and the sense that it
was excited by his departure obliterated every thought of her father's
unkindness he retired the other guests followed his example and many
of them like cleveland and himself took their leave over-night with
the intention of commencing their homeward journey on the succeeding
morning

that night the mutual sorrow of minna and brenda if it could not
wholly remove the reserve which had estranged the sisters from each
other at least melted all its frozen and unkindly symptoms they wept
in each other's arms and though neither spoke yet each became dearer
to the other because they felt that the grief which called forth these
drops had a source common to them both

it is probable that though brenda's tears were most abundant the grief
of minna was most deeply seated for long after the younger had sobbed
herself asleep like a child upon her sister's bosom minna lay awake
watching the dubious twilight while tear after tear slowly gathered in
her eye and found a current down her cheek as soon as it became too
heavy to be supported by her long black silken eyelashes as she lay
bewildered among the sorrowful thoughts which supplied these tears she
was surprised to distinguish beneath the window the sounds of music
at first she supposed it was some freak of claud halcro whose fantastic
humour sometimes indulged itself in such serenades but it was not the
gue of the old minstrel but the guitar that she heard an instrument
which none in the island knew how to touch except cleveland who had
learned in his intercourse with the south-american spaniards to play
on it with superior execution perhaps it was in those climates also
that he had learned the song which though he now sung it under the
window of a maiden of thule had certainly never been composed for the
native of a climate so northerly and so severe since it spoke of
productions of the earth and skies which are there unknown



 love wakes and weeps
 while beauty sleeps
 o for music's softest numbers
 to prompt a theme
 for beauty's dream
 soft as the pillow of her slumbers



 through groves of palm
 sigh gales of balm
 fire-flies on the air are wheeling
 while through the gloom
 comes soft perfume
 the distant beds of flowers revealing




 o wake and live
 no dream can give
 a shadow'd bliss the real excelling
 no longer sleep
 from lattice peep
 and list the tale that love is telling

the voice of cleveland was deep rich and manly and accorded well with
the spanish air to which the words probably a translation from the
same language had been adapted his invocation would not probably have
been fruitless could minna have arisen without awaking her sister but
that was impossible for brenda who as we have already mentioned had
wept bitterly before she had sunk into repose now lay with her face on
her sister's neck and one arm stretched around her in the attitude of
a child which has cried itself asleep in the arms of its nurse it was
impossible for minna to extricate herself from her grasp without awaking
her and she could not therefore execute her hasty purpose of donning
her gown and approaching the window to speak with cleveland who she
had no doubt had resorted to this contrivance to procure an interview
the restraint was sufficiently provoking for it was more than probable
that her lover came to take his last farewell but that brenda inimical
as she seemed to be of late towards cleveland should awake and witness
it was a thought not to be endured

there was a short pause in which minna endeavoured more than once with
as much gentleness as possible to unclasp brenda's arm from her neck
but whenever she attempted it the slumberer muttered some little
pettish sound like a child disturbed in its sleep which sufficiently
showed that perseverance in the attempt would awaken her fully

to her great vexation therefore minna was compelled to remain still
and silent when her lover as if determined upon gaining her ear by
music of another strain sung the following fragment of a sea-ditty 

 farewell farewell the voice you hear
 has left its last soft tone with you 
 its next must join the seaward cheer
 and shout among the shouting crew

 the accents which i scarce could form
 beneath your frown's controlling check
 must give the word above the storm
 to cut the mast and clear the wreck

 the timid eye i dared not raise 
 the hand that shook when press'd to thine
 must point the guns upon the chase 
 must bid the deadly cutlass shine

 to all i love or hope or fear 
 honour or own a long adieu
 to all that life has soft and dear
 farewell save memory of youc

he was again silent and again she to whom the serenade was addressed
strove in vain to arise without rousing her sister it was impossible
and she had nothing before her but the unhappy thought that cleveland
was taking leave in his desolation without a single glance or a single
word he too whose temper was so fiery yet who subjected his violent
mood with such sedulous attention to her will could she but have stolen
a moment to say adieu to caution him against new quarrels with
mertoun to implore him to detach himself from such comrades as he had
described could she but have done this who could say what effect such
parting admonitions might have had upon his character nay upon the
future events of his life

tantalized by such thoughts minna was about to make another and
decisive effort when she heard voices beneath the window and thought
she could distinguish that they were those of cleveland and mertoun
speaking in a sharp tone which at the same time seemed cautiously
suppressed as if the speakers feared being overheard alarm now mingled
with her former desire to rise from bed and she accomplished at once
the purpose which she had so often attempted in vain brenda's arm was
unloosed from her sister's neck without the sleeper receiving more
alarm than provoked two or three unintelligible murmurs while with
equal speed and silence minna put on some part of her dress with the
intention to steal to the window but ere she could accomplish this
the sound of the voices without was exchanged for that of blows and
struggling which terminated suddenly by a deep groan

terrified at this last signal of mischief minna sprung to the window
and endeavoured to open it for the persons were so close under the
walls of the house that she could not see them save by putting her head
out of the casement the iron hasp was stiff and rusted and as
generally happens the haste with which she laboured to undo it only
rendered the task more difficult when it was accomplished and minna
had eagerly thrust her body half out at the casement those who had
created the sounds which alarmed her were become invisible excepting
that she saw a shadow cross the moonlight the substance of which must
have been in the act of turning a corner which concealed it from her
sight the shadow moved slowly and seemed that of a man who supported
another upon his shoulders an indication which put the climax to
minna's agony of mind the window was not above eight feet from the
ground and she hesitated not to throw herself from it hastily and to
pursue the object which had excited her terror

but when she came to the corner of the buildings from which the shadow
seemed to have been projected she discovered nothing which could point
out the way that the figure had gone and after a moment's
consideration became sensible that all attempts at pursuit would be
alike wild and fruitless besides all the projections and recesses of
the many-angled mansion and its numerous offices besides the various
cellars store-houses stables and so forth which defied her solitary
search there was a range of low rocks stretching down to the haven
and which were in fact a continuation of the ridge which formed its
pier these rocks had many indentures hollows and caverns into any
one of which the figure to which the shadow belonged might have retired
with his fatal burden for fatal she feared it was most likely to
prove

a moment's reflection as we have said convinced minna of the folly of
further pursuit her next thought was to alarm the family but what tale
had she to tell and of whom was that tale to be told on the other
hand the wounded man if indeed he were wounded alas if indeed he
were not mortally wounded might not be past the reach of assistance
and with this idea she was about to raise her voice when she was
interrupted by that of claud halcro who was returning apparently from
the haven and singing in his manner a scrap of an old norse ditty
which might run thus in english 

 and you shall deal the funeral dole
 ay deal it mother mine
 to weary body and to heavy soul
 the white bread and the wine

 and you shall deal my horses of pride
 ay deal them mother mine
 and you shall deal my lands so wide
 and deal my castles nine

 but deal not vengeance for the deed
 and deal not for the crime
 the body to its place and the soul to heaven's grace
 and the rest in god's own time

the singular adaptation of these rhymes to the situation in which she
found herself seemed to minna like a warning from heaven we are
speaking of a land of omens and superstitions and perhaps will scarce
be understood by those whose limited imagination cannot conceive how
strongly these operate upon the human mind during a certain progress of
society a line of virgil turned up casually was received in the
seventeenth century and in the court of england as an intimation
of future events and no wonder that a maiden of the distant and wild
isles of zetland should have considered as an injunction from heaven
verses which happened to convey a sense analogous to her present
situation

i will be silent she muttered i will seal my lips 

 the body to its place and the soul to heaven's grace
 and the rest in god's own time

who speaks there said claud halcro in some alarm for he had not in
his travels in foreign parts been able by any means to rid himself of
his native superstitions in the condition to which fear and horror had
reduced her minna was at first unable to reply and halcro fixing his
eyes upon the female white figure which he saw indistinctly for she
stood in the shadow of the house and the morning was thick and misty
began to conjure her in an ancient rhyme which occurred to him as suited
for the occasion and which had in its gibberish a wild and unearthly
sound which may be lost in the ensuing translation 

 saint magnus control thee that martyr of treason
 saint ronan rebuke thee with rhyme and with reason
 by the mass of saint martin the might of saint mary
 be thou gone or thy weird shall be worse if thou tarry
 if of good go hence and hallow thee 
 if of ill let the earth swallow thee 
 if thou'rt of air let the grey mist fold thee 
 if of earth let the swart mine hold thee 
 if a pixie seek thy ring 
 if a nixie seek thy spring 
 if on middle earth thou'st been
 slave of sorrow shame and sin
 hast eat the bread of toil and strife
 and dree'd the lot which men call life
 begone to thy stone for thy coffin is scant of thee
 the worm thy playfellow wails for the want of thee 
 hence houseless ghost let the earth hide thee
 till michael shall blow the blast see that there thou bide thee 
 phantom fly hence take the cross for a token
 hence pass till hallowmass my spell is spoken

it is i halcro muttered minna in a tone so thin and low that it
might have passed for the faint reply of the conjured phantom

you you said halcro his tone of alarm changing to one of extreme
surprise by this moonlight which is waning and so it is who could
have thought to find you my most lovely night wandering abroad in your
own element but you saw them i reckon as well as i bold enough in
you to follow them though

saw whom follow whom said minna hoping to gain some information on
the subject of her fears and anxiety

the corpse-lights which danced at the haven replied halcro they
bode no good i promise you you wot well what the old rhyme says 

 where corpse-light
 dances bright
 be it day or night
 be it by light or dark
 there shall corpse lie stiff and stark

i went half as far as the haven to look after them but they had
vanished i think i saw a boat put off however some one bound for the
haaf i suppose i would we had good news of this fishing there was
norna left us in anger and then these corpse-lights well god help
the while i am an old man and can but wish that all were well
over but how now my pretty minna tears in your eyes and now that i
see you in the fair moonlight barefooted too by saint magnus were
there no stockings of zetland wool soft enough for these pretty feet and
ankles that glance so white in the moonbeam what silent angry
perhaps he added in a more serious tone at my nonsense for shame
silly maiden remember i am old enough to be your father and have
always loved you as my child

i am not angry said minna constraining herself to speak but heard
you nothing saw you nothing they must have passed you

they said claud halcro what mean you by they is it the
corpse-lights no they did not pass by me but i think they have
passed by you and blighted you with their influence for you are as
pale as a spectre come come minna he added opening a side-door of
the dwelling these moonlight walks are fitter for old poets than for
young maidens and so lightly clad as you are maiden you should take
care how you give yourself to the breezes of a zetland night for they
bring more sleet than odours upon their wings but maiden go in for
as glorious john says or as he does not say for i cannot remember how
his verse chimes but as i say myself in a pretty poem written when
my muse was in her teens 

 menseful maiden ne'er should rise
 till the first beam tinge the skies
 silk-fringed eyelids still should close
 till the sun has kiss'd the rose
 maiden's foot we should not view
 mark'd with tiny print on dew
 till the opening flowerets spread
 carpet meet for beauty's tread 

stay what comes next let me see

when the spirit of recitation seized on claud halcro he forgot time and
place and might have kept his companion in the cold air for half an
hour giving poetical reasons why she ought to have been in bed but she
interrupted him by the question earnestly pronounced yet in a voice
which was scarcely articulate holding halcro at the same time with a
trembling and convulsive grasp as if to support herself from
falling saw you no one in the boat which put to sea but now

nonsense replied halcro how could i see any one when light and
distance only enabled me to know that it was a boat and not a grampus

but there must have been some one in the boat repeated minna scarce
conscious of what she said

certainly answered the poet boats seldom work to windward of their
own accord but come this is all folly and so as the queen says in
an old play which was revived for the stage by rare will d'avenant to
bed to bed to bed

they separated and minna's limbs conveyed her with difficulty through
several devious passages to her own chamber where she stretched
herself cautiously beside her still sleeping sister with a mind
harassed with the most agonizing apprehensions that she had heard
cleveland she was positive the tenor of the songs left her no doubt on
that subject if not equally certain that she had heard young mertoun's
voice in hot quarrel with her lover the impression to that effect was
strong on her mind the groan with which the struggle seemed to
terminate the fearful indication from which it seemed that the
conqueror had borne off the lifeless body of his victim all tended to
prove that some fatal event had concluded the contest and which of the
unhappy men had fallen which had met a bloody death which had
achieved a fatal and a bloody victory these were questions to which
the still small voice of interior conviction answered that her lover
cleveland from character temper and habits was most likely to have
been the survivor of the fray she received from the reflection an
involuntary consolation which she almost detested herself for admitting
when she recollected that it was at once darkened with her lover's
guilt and embittered with the destruction of brenda's happiness for
ever

innocent unhappy sister such were her reflections thou that art
ten times better than i because so unpretending so unassuming in thine
excellence how is it possible that i should cease to feel a pang which
is only transferred from my bosom to thine

as these cruel thoughts crossed her mind she could not refrain from
straining her sister so close to her bosom that after a heavy sigh
brenda awoke

sister she said is it you i dreamed i lay on one of those
monuments which claud halcro described to us where the effigy of the
inhabitant beneath lies carved in stone upon the sepulchre i dreamed
such a marble form lay by my side and that it suddenly acquired enough
of life and animation to fold me to its cold moist bosom and it is
yours minna that is indeed so chilly you are ill my dearest minna
for god's sake let me rise and call euphane fea what ails you has
norna been here again

call no one hither said minna detaining her nothing ails me for
which any one has a remedy nothing but apprehensions of evil worse than
even norna could prophesy but god is above all my dear brenda and let
us pray to him to turn as he only can our evil into good

they did jointly repeat their usual prayer for strength and protection
from on high and again composed themselves to sleep suffering no word
save god bless you to pass betwixt them when their devotions were
finished thus scrupulously dedicating to heaven their last waking
words if human frailty prevented them from commanding their last waking
thoughts brenda slept first and minna strongly resisting the dark and
evil presentiments which again began to crowd themselves upon her
imagination was at last so fortunate as to slumber also

the storm which halcro had expected began about daybreak a squall
heavy with wind and rain such as is often felt even during the finest
part of the season in these latitudes at the whistle of the wind and
the clatter of the rain on the shingle-roofing of the fishers huts
many a poor woman was awakened and called on her children to hold up
their little hands and join in prayer for the safety of the dear
husband and father who was even then at the mercy of the disturbed
elements around the house of burgh-westra chimneys howled and windows
clashed the props and rafters of the higher parts of the building most
of them formed out of wreck-wood groaned and quivered as fearing to be
again dispersed by the tempest but the daughters of magnus troil
continued to sleep as softly and as sweetly as if the hand of chantrey
had formed them out of statuary-marble the squall had passed away and
the sunbeams dispersing the clouds which drifted to leeward shone full
through the lattice when minna first started from the profound sleep
into which fatigue and mental exhaustion had lulled her and raising
herself on her arm began to recall events which after this interval
of profound repose seemed almost to resemble the baseless visions of
the night she almost doubted if what she recalled of horror previous
to her starting from her bed was not indeed the fiction of a dream
suggested perhaps by some external sounds

i will see claud halcro instantly she said he may know something of
these strange noises as he was stirring at the time

with that she sprung from bed but hardly stood upright on the floor
ere her sister exclaimed gracious heaven minna what ails your
foot your ankle

she looked down and saw with surprise which amounted to agony that
both her feet but particularly one of them was stained with dark
crimson resembling the colour of dried blood

without attempting to answer brenda she rushed to the window and cast
a desperate look on the grass beneath for there she knew she must have
contracted the fatal stain but the rain which had fallen there in
treble quantity as well from the heavens as from the eaves of the
house had washed away that guilty witness if indeed such had ever
existed all was fresh and fair and the blades of grass overcharged
and bent with rain-drops glittered like diamonds in the bright morning
sun

while minna stared upon the spangled verdure with her full dark eyes
fixed and enlarged to circles by the intensity of her terror brenda was
hanging about her and with many an eager enquiry pressed to know
whether or how she had hurt herself

a piece of glass cut through my shoe said minna bethinking herself
that some excuse was necessary to her sister i scarce felt it at the
time

and yet see how it has bled said her sister sweet minna she
added approaching her with a wetted towel let me wipe the blood
off the hurt may be worse than you think of

but as she approached minna who saw no other way of preventing
discovery that the blood with which she was stained had never flowed in
her own veins harshly and hastily repelled the proffered kindness poor
brenda unconscious of any offence which she had given to her sister
drew back two or three paces on finding her service thus unkindly
refused and stood gazing at minna with looks in which there was more of
surprise and mortified affection than of resentment but which had yet
something also of natural displeasure

sister said she i thought we had agreed but last night that
happen to us what might we would at least love each other

much may happen betwixt night and morning answered minna in words
rather wrenched from her by her situation than flowing forth the
voluntary interpreters of her thoughts

much may indeed have happened in a night so stormy answered brenda
for see where the very wall around euphane's plant-a-cruive has been
blown down but neither wind nor rain nor aught else can cool our
affection minna

but that may chance replied minna which may convert it into  

the rest of the sentence she muttered in a tone so indistinct that it
could not be apprehended while at the same time she washed the
blood-stains from her feet and left ankle brenda who still remained
looking on at some distance endeavoured in vain to assume some tone
which might re-establish kindness and confidence betwixt them

you were right she said minna to suffer no one to help you to
dress so simple a scratch standing where i do it is scarce visible

the most cruel wounds replied minna are those which make no outward
show are you sure you see it at all

o yes replied brenda framing her answer as she thought would best
please her sister i see a very slight scratch nay now you draw on
the stocking i can see nothing

you do indeed see nothing answered minna somewhat wildly but the
time will soon come that all ay all will be seen and known

so saying she hastily completed her dress and led the way to
breakfast where she assumed her place amongst the guests but with a
countenance so pale and haggard and manners and speech so altered and
so bewildered that it excited the attention of the whole company and
the utmost anxiety on the part of her father magnus troil many and
various were the conjectures of the guests concerning a distemperature
which seemed rather mental than corporeal some hinted that the maiden
had been struck with an evil eye and something they muttered about
norna of the fitful-head some talked of the departure of captain
cleveland and murmured it was a shame for a young lady to take on so
after a landlouper of whom no one knew any thing and this
contemptuous epithet was in particular bestowed on the captain by
mistress baby yellowley while she was in the act of wrapping round her
old skinny neck the very handsome owerlay as she called it wherewith
the said captain had presented her the old lady glowrowrum had a system
of her own which she hinted to mistress yellowley after thanking god
that her own connexion with the burgh-westra family was by the lass's
mother who was a canny scotswoman like herself

for as to these troils you see dame yellowley for as high as they
hold their heads they say that ken winking sagaciously that there
is a bee in their bonnet that norna as they call her for it's not
her right name neither is at whiles far beside her right mind and
they that ken the cause say the fowd was some gate or other linked in
with it for he will never hear an ill word of her but i was in
scotland then or i might have kend the real cause as weel as other
folk at ony rate there is a kind of wildness in the blood ye ken very
weel daft folk dinna bide to be contradicted and i'll say that for the
fowd he likes to be contradicted as ill as ony man in zetland but it
shall never be said that i said ony ill of the house that i am sae
nearly connected wi only ye will mind dame it is through the
sinclairs that we are akin not through the troils and the sinclairs
are kend far and wide for a wise generation dame but i see there is
the stirrup-cup coming round

i wonder said mistress baby to her brother as soon as the lady
glowrowrum turned from her what gars that muckle wife dame dame
dame that gate at me she might ken the blude of the clinkscales is as
gude as ony glowrowrum's amang them

the guests meanwhile were fast taking their departure scarcely
noticed by magnus who was so much engrossed with minna's indisposition
that contrary to his hospitable wont he suffered them to go away
unsaluted and thus concluded amidst anxiety and illness the festival
of saint john as celebrated on that season at the house of
burgh-westra adding another caution to that of the emperor of
ethiopia with how little security man can reckon upon the days which
he destines to happiness

the term had now elapsed by several days when mordaunt mertoun as he
had promised at his departure should have returned to his father's
abode at jarlshof but there were no tidings of his arrival such delay
might at another time have excited little curiosity and no anxiety
for old swertha who took upon her the office of thinking and
conjecturing for the little household would have concluded that he had
remained behind the other guests upon some party of sport or pleasure
but she knew that mordaunt had not been lately in favour with magnus
troil she knew that he proposed his stay at burgh-westra should be a
short one upon account of his father's health to whom notwithstanding
the little encouragement which his filial piety received he paid
uniform attention swertha knew all this and she became anxious she
watched the looks of her master the elder mertoun but wrapt in dark
and stern uniformity of composure his countenance like the surface of
a midnight lake enabled no one to penetrate into what was beneath his
studies his solitary meals his lonely walks succeeded each other in
unvaried rotation and seemed undisturbed by the least thought about
mordaunt's absence

at length such reports reached swertha's ear from various quarters
that she became totally unable to conceal her anxiety and resolved at
the risk of provoking her master into fury or perhaps that of losing
her place in his household to force upon his notice the doubts which
afflicted her own mind mordaunt's good-humour and goodly person must
indeed have made no small impression on the withered and selfish heart
of the poor old woman to induce her to take a course so desperate and
from which her friend the ranzelman endeavoured in vain to deter her
still however conscious that a miscarriage in the matter would like
the loss of trinculo's bottle in the horse-pool be attended not only
with dishonour but with infinite loss she determined to proceed on her
high emprize with as much caution as was consistent with the attempt

we have already mentioned that it seemed a part of the very nature of
this reserved and unsocial being at least since his retreat into the
utter solitude of jarlshof to endure no one to start a subject of
conversation or to put any question to him that did not arise out of
urgent and pressing emergency swertha was sensible therefore that in
order to open the discourse favourably which she proposed to hold with
her master she must contrive that it should originate with himself

to accomplish this purpose while busied in preparing the table for mr
mertoun's simple and solitary dinner-meal she formally adorned the
table with two covers instead of one and made all her other
preparations as if he was to have a guest or companion at dinner

the artifice succeeded for mertoun on coming from his study no sooner
saw the table thus arranged than he asked swertha who waiting the
effect of her stratagem as a fisher watches his ground-baits was
fiddling up and down the room whether mordaunt was returned from
burgh-westra


this question was the cue for swertha and she answered in a voice of
sorrowful anxiety half real half affected na na nae sic divot had
dunted at their door it wad be blithe news indeed to ken that young
maister mordaunt puir dear bairn were safe at hame

and if he be not at home why should you lay a cover for him you
doting fool replied mertoun in a tone well calculated to stop the old
woman's proceedings but she replied boldly that indeed somebody
should take thought about maister mordaunt a that she could do was to
have seat and plate ready for him when he came but she thought the dear
bairn had been ower lang awa and if she maun speak out she had her
ain fears when and whether he might ever come hame

your fears said mertoun his eyes flashing as they usually did when
his hour of ungovernable passion approached do you speak of your idle
fears to me who know that all of your sex that is not fickleness and
folly and self-conceit and self-will is a bundle of idiotical fears
vapours and tremors what are your fears to me you foolish old hag

it is an admirable quality in womankind that when a breach of the laws
of natural affection comes under their observation the whole sex is in
arms let a rumour arise in the street of a parent that has misused a
child or a child that has insulted a parent i say nothing of the
case of husband and wife where the interest may be accounted for in
sympathy and all the women within hearing will take animated and
decided part with the sufferer swertha notwithstanding her greed and
avarice had her share of the generous feeling which does so much honour
to her sex and was on this occasion so much carried on by its
impulse that she confronted her master and upbraided him with his
hard-hearted indifference with a boldness at which she herself was
astonished

to be sure it wasna her that suld be fearing for her young maister
maister mordaunt even although he was as she might weel say the very
sea-calf of her heart but ony other father but his honour himsell wad
have had speerings made after the poor lad and him gane this eight-days
from burgh-westra and naebody kend when or where he had gane there
wasna a bairn in the howff but was maining for him for he made all
their bits of boats with his knife there wadna be a dry eye in the
parish if aught worse than weal should befall him na no ane unless
it might be his honour's ain

mertoun had been much struck and even silenced by the insolent
volubility of his insurgent housekeeper but at the last sarcasm he
imposed on her silence in her turn with an audible voice accompanied
with one of the most terrific glances which his dark eye and stern
features could express but swertha who as she afterwards acquainted
the ranzelman was wonderfully supported during the whole scene would
not be controlled by the loud voice and ferocious look of her master
but proceeded in the same tone as before

his honour she said had made an unco wark because a wheen bits of
kists and duds that naebody had use for had been gathered on the beach
by the poor bodies of the township and here was the bravest lad in the
country lost and cast away as it were before his een and nae are
asking what was come o him

what should come of him but good you old fool answered mr mertoun
as far at least as there can be good in any of the follies he spends
his time in

this was spoken rather in a scornful than an angry tone and swertha
who had got into the spirit of the dialogue was resolved not to let it
drop now that the fire of her opponent seemed to slacken

o ay to be sure i am an auld fule but if maister mordaunt should
have settled down in the roost as mair than ae boat had been lost in
that wearifu squall the other morning by good luck it was short as it
was sharp or naething could have lived in it or if he were drowned in
a loch coming hame on foot or if he were killed by miss of footing on a
craig the haill island kend how venturesome he was who said swertha
will be the auld fule then and she added a pathetic ejaculation that
god would protect the poor motherless bairn for if he had had a
mother there would have been search made after him before now

this last sarcasm affected mertoun powerfully his jaw quivered his
face grew pale and he muttered to swertha to go into his study where
she was scarcely ever permitted to enter and fetch him a bottle which
stood there

o ho quoth swertha to herself as she hastened on the commission my
master knows where to find a cup of comfort to qualify his water with
upon fitting occasions

there was indeed a case of such bottles as were usually employed to hold
strong waters but the dust and cobwebs in which they were enveloped
showed that they had not been touched for many years with some
difficulty swertha extracted the cork of one of them by the help of a
fork for corkscrew was there none at jarlshof and having ascertained
by smell and in case of any mistake by a moderate mouthful that it
contained wholesome barbadoes-waters she carried it into the room
where her master still continued to struggle with his faintness she
then began to pour a small quantity into the nearest cup that she could
find wisely judging that upon a person so much unaccustomed to the
use of spirituous liquors a little might produce a strong effect but
the patient signed to her impatiently to fill the cup which might hold
more than the third of an english pint measure up to the very brim and
swallowed it down without hesitation

now the saunts above have a care on us said swertha he will be
drunk as weel as mad and wha is to guide him then i wonder

but mertoun's breath and colour returned without the slightest symptom
of intoxication on the contrary swertha afterwards reported that
although she had always had a firm opinion in favour of a dram yet she
never saw one work such miracles he spoke mair like a man of the middle
world than she had ever heard him since she had entered his service

swertha he said you are right in this matter and i was wrong go
down to the ranzelman directly tell him to come and speak with me
without an instant's delay and bring me special word what boats and
people he can command i will employ them all in the search and they
shall be plentifully rewarded

stimulated by the spur which maketh the old woman proverbially to trot
swertha posted down to the hamlet with all the speed of threescore
rejoicing that her sympathetic feelings were likely to achieve their own
reward having given rise to a quest which promised to be so lucrative
and in the profits whereof she was determined to have her share
shouting out as she went and long before she got within hearing the
names of niel ronaldson sweyn erickson and the other friends and
confederates who were interested in her mission to say the truth
notwithstanding that the good dame really felt a deep interest in
mordaunt mertoun and was mentally troubled on account of his absence
perhaps few things would have disappointed her more than if he had at
this moment started up in her path safe and sound and rendered
unnecessary by his appearance the expense and the bustle of searching
after him

soon did swertha accomplish her business in the village and adjust with
the senators of the township her own little share of per centage upon
the profits likely to accrue on her mission and speedily did she return
to jarlshof with niel ronaldson by her side schooling him to the best
of her skill in all the peculiarities of her master

aboon a things she said never make him wait for an answer and
speak loud and distinct as if you were hailing a boat for he downa
bide to say the same thing twice over and if he asks about distance
ye may make leagues for miles for he kens naething about the face of
the earth that he lives upon and if he speak of siller ye may ask
dollars for shillings for he minds them nae mair than sclate-stanes

thus tutored niel ronaldson was introduced into the presence of
mertoun but was utterly confounded to find that he could not act upon
the system of deception which had been projected when he attempted by
some exaggeration of distance and peril to enhance the hire of the
boats and of the men for the search was to be by sea and land he
found himself at once cut short by mertoun who showed not only the most
perfect knowledge of the country but of distances tides currents and
all belonging to the navigation of those seas although these were
topics with which he had hitherto appeared to be totally unacquainted
the ranzelman therefore trembled when they came to speak of the
recompense to be afforded for their exertions in the search for it was
not more unlikely that mertoun should be well informed of what was just
and proper upon this head than upon others and niel remembered the
storm of his fury when at an early period after he had settled at
jarlshof he drove swertha and sweyn erickson from his presence as
however he stood hesitating betwixt the opposite fears of asking too
much or too little mertoun stopped his mouth and ended his
uncertainty by promising him a recompense beyond what he dared have
ventured to ask with an additional gratuity in case they returned with
the pleasing intelligence that his son was safe

when this great point was settled niel ronaldson like a man of
conscience began to consider earnestly the various places where search
should be made after the young man and having undertaken faithfully
that the enquiry should be prosecuted at all the houses of the gentry
both in this and the neighbouring islands he added that after all
if his honour would not be angry there was ane not far off that if
any body dared speer her a question and if she liked to answer it
could tell more about maister mordaunt than any body else could ye
will ken wha i mean swertha her that was down at the haven this
morning thus he concluded addressing himself with a mysterious look
to the housekeeper which she answered with a nod and a wink

how mean you said mertoun speak out short and open whom do you
speak of

it is norna of the fitful-head said swertha that the ranzelman is
thinking about for she has gone up to saint ringan's kirk this morning
on business of her own

and what can this person know of my son said mertoun she is i
believe a wandering madwoman or impostor

if she wanders said swertha it is for nae lack of means at hame
and that is weel known plenty of a thing has she of her ain forby
that the fowd himsell would let her want naething

but what is that to my son said mertoun impatiently

i dinna ken she took unco pleasure in maister mordaunt from the time
she first saw him and mony a braw thing she gave him at ae time or
another forby the gowd chain that hangs about his bonny craig folk say
it is of fairy gold i kenna what gold it is but bryce snailsfoot says
that the value will mount to an hundred pounds english and that is nae
deaf nuts

go ronaldson said mertoun or else send some one to seek this
woman out if you think there be a chance of her knowing any thing of my
son

she kens a thing that happens in thae islands said niel ronaldson
muckle sooner than other folk and that is heaven's truth but as to
going to the kirk or the kirkyard to speer after her there is not a
man in zetland will do it for meed or for money and that's heaven's
truth as weel as the other

cowardly superstitious fools said mertoun but give me my cloak
swertha this woman has been at burgh-westra she is related to troil's
family she may know something of mordaunt's absence and its cause i
will seek her myself she is at the cross-kirk you say

no not at the cross-kirk but at the auld kirk of saint ringan's it's
a dowie bit and far frae being canny and if your honour added
swertha wad walk by my rule i wad wait until she came back and no
trouble her when she may be mair busied wi the dead for ony thing that
we ken than she is wi the living the like of her carena to have other
folk's een on them when they are gude sain us doing their ain
particular turns

mertoun made no answer but throwing his cloak loosely around him for
the day was misty with passing showers and leaving the decayed
mansion of jarlshof he walked at a pace much faster than was usual with
him taking the direction of the ruinous church which stood as he well
knew within three or four miles of his dwelling

the ranzelman and swertha stood gazing after him in silence until he
was fairly out of ear-shot when looking seriously on each other and
shaking their sagacious heads in the same boding degree of vibration
they uttered their remarks in the same breath

fools are aye fleet and fain said swertha

fey folk run fast added the ranzelman and the thing that we are
born to we cannot win by i have known them that tried to stop folk
that were fey you have heard of helen emberson of camsey how she
stopped all the boles and windows about the house that her gudeman
might not see daylight and rise to the haaf-fishing because she feared
foul weather and how the boat he should have sailed in was lost in the
roost and how she came back rejoicing in her gudeman's safety but
ne'er may care for there she found him drowned in his own masking-fat
within the wa's of his ain biggin and moreover  

but here swertha reminded the ranzelman that he must go down to the
haven to get off the fishing-boats for both that my heart is sair for
the bonny lad and that i am fear'd he cast up of his ain accord before
you are at sea and as i have often told ye my master may lead but he
winna drive and if ye do not his bidding and get out to sea the never
a bodle of boat-hire will ye see

weel weel good dame said the ranzelman we will launch as fast as
we can and by good luck neither clawson's boat nor peter grot's is
out to the haaf this morning for a rabbit ran across the path as they
were going on board and they came back like wise men kenning they wad
be called to other wark this day and a marvel it is to think swertha
how few real judicious men are left in this land there is our great
udaller is weel eneugh when he is fresh but he makes ower mony voyages
in his ship and his yawl to be lang sae and now they say his
daughter mistress minna is sair out of sorts then there is norna
kens muckle mair than other folk but wise woman ye cannot call her our
tacksman here maister mertoun his wit is sprung in the bowsprit i
doubt his son is a daft gowk and i ken few of consequence
hereabouts excepting always myself and maybe you swertha but what
may in some sense or other be called fules

that may be niel ronaldson said the dame but if you do not hasten
the faster to the shore you will lose tide and as i said to my master
some short time syne wha will be the fule then




chapter v

 i do love these ancient ruins 
 we never tread upon them but we set
 our foot upon some reverend history
 and questionless here in this open court
 which now lies naked to the injuries
 of stormy weather some men lie interr'd
 loved the church so well and gave so largely to it
 they thought it should have canopied their bones
 till doomsday but all things have their end 
 churches and cities which have diseases like to men
 must have like death which we have

 duchess of malfy


the ruinous church of saint ninian had in its time enjoyed great
celebrity for that mighty system of roman superstition which spread
its roots over all europe had not failed to extend them even to this
remote archipelago and zetland had in the catholic times her saints
her shrines and her relics which though little known elsewhere
attracted the homage and commanded the observance of the simple
inhabitants of thule their devotion to this church of saint ninian or
as he was provincially termed saint ringan situated as the edifice
was close to the sea-beach and serving in many points as a landmark
to their boats was particularly obstinate and was connected with so
much superstitious ceremonial and credulity that the reformed clergy
thought it best by an order of the church courts to prohibit all
spiritual service within its walls as tending to foster the rooted
faith of the simple and rude people around in saint-worship and other
erroneous doctrines of the romish church

after the church of saint ninian had been thus denounced as a seat of
idolatry and desecrated of course the public worship was transferred
to another church and the roof with its lead and its rafters having
been stripped from the little rude old gothic building it was left in
the wilderness to the mercy of the elements the fury of the
uncontrolled winds which howled along an exposed space resembling that
which we have described at jarlshof very soon choked up nave and aisle
and on the north-west side which was chiefly exposed to the wind hid
the outside walls more than half way up with mounds of drifted sand
over which the gable-ends of the building with the little belfry which
was built above its eastern angle arose in ragged and shattered
nakedness of ruin

yet deserted as it was the kirk of saint ringan still retained some
semblance of the ancient homage formerly rendered there the rude and
ignorant fishermen of dunrossness observed a practice of which they
themselves had wellnigh forgotten the origin and from which the
protestant clergy in vain endeavoured to deter them when their boats
were in extreme peril it was common amongst them to propose to vow an
awmous as they termed it that is an alms to saint ringan and when
the danger was over they never failed to absolve themselves of their
vow by coming singly and secretly to the old church and putting off
their shoes and stockings at the entrance of the churchyard walking
thrice around the ruins observing that they did so in the course of the
sun when the circuit was accomplished for the third time the votary
dropped his offering usually a small silver coin through the mullions
of a lanceolated window which opened into a side aisle and then
retired avoiding carefully to look behind him till he was beyond the
precincts which had once been hallowed ground for it was believed that
the skeleton of the saint received the offering in his bony hand and
showed his ghastly death's-head at the window into which it was thrown

indeed the scene was rendered more appalling to weak and ignorant
minds because the same stormy and eddying winds which on the one side
of the church threatened to bury the ruins with sand and had in fact
heaped it up in huge quantities so as almost to hide the side-wall with
its buttresses seemed in other places bent on uncovering the graves of
those who had been laid to their long rest on the south-eastern quarter
and after an unusually hard gale the coffins and sometimes the very
corpses of those who had been interred without the usual cerements
were discovered in a ghastly manner to the eyes of the living

it was to this desolated place of worship that the elder mertoun now
proceeded though without any of those religious or superstitious
purposes with which the church of saint ringan was usually approached
he was totally without the superstitious fears of the country nay
from the sequestered and sullen manner in which he lived withdrawing
himself from human society even when assembled for worship it was the
general opinion that he erred on the more fatal side and believed
rather too little than too much of that which the church receives and
enjoins to christians

as he entered the little bay on the shore and almost on the beach of
which the ruins are situated he could not help pausing for an instant
and becoming sensible that the scene as calculated to operate on human
feelings had been selected with much judgment as the site of a
religious house in front lay the sea into which two headlands which
formed the extremities of the bay projected their gigantic causeways of
dark and sable rocks on the ledges of which the gulls scouries and
other sea-fowl appeared like flakes of snow while upon the lower
ranges of the cliff stood whole lines of cormorants drawn up alongside
of each other like soldiers in their battle array and other living
thing was there none to see the sea although not in a tempestuous
state was disturbed enough to rush on these capes with a sound like
distant thunder and the billows which rose in sheets of foam half way
up these sable rocks formed a contrast of colouring equally striking
and awful

betwixt the extremities or capes of these projecting headlands there
rolled on the day when mertoun visited the scene a deep and dense
aggregation of clouds through which no human eye could penetrate and
which bounding the vision and excluding all view of the distant ocean
rendered it no unapt representation of the sea in the vision of mirza
whose extent was concealed by vapours and clouds and storms the
ground rising steeply from the sea-beach permitting no view into the
interior of the country appeared a scene of irretrievable barrenness
where scrubby and stunted heath intermixed with the long bent or
coarse grass which first covers sandy soils were the only vegetables
that could be seen upon a natural elevation which rose above the beach
in the very bottom of the bay and receded a little from the sea so as
to be without reach of the waves arose the half-buried ruin which we
have already described surrounded by a wasted half-ruinous and
mouldering wall which breached in several places served still to
divide the precincts of the cemetery the mariners who were driven by
accident into this solitary bay pretended that the church was
occasionally observed to be full of lights and from that circumstance
were used to prophesy shipwrecks and deaths by sea

as mertoun approached near to the chapel he adopted insensibly and
perhaps without much premeditation measures to avoid being himself
seen until he came close under the walls of the burial-ground which he
approached as it chanced on that side where the sand was blowing from
the graves in the manner we have described

here looking through one of the gaps in the wall which time had made
he beheld the person whom he sought occupied in a manner which assorted
well with the ideas popularly entertained of her character but which
was otherwise sufficiently extraordinary

she was employed beside a rude monument on one side of which was
represented the rough outline of a cavalier or knight on horseback
while on the other appeared a shield with the armorial bearings so
defaced as not to be intelligible which escutcheon was suspended by one
angle contrary to the modern custom which usually places them straight
and upright at the foot of this pillar was believed to repose as
mertoun had formerly heard the bones of ribolt troil one of the remote
ancestors of magnus and a man renowned for deeds of valorous emprize in
the fifteenth century from the grave of this warrior norna of the
fitful-head seemed busied in shovelling the sand an easy task where it
was so light and loose so that it seemed plain that she would shortly
complete what the rude winds had begun and make bare the bones which
lay there interred as she laboured she muttered her magic song for
without the runic rhyme no form of northern superstition was ever
performed we have perhaps preserved too many examples of these
incantations but we cannot help attempting to translate that which
follows 

 champion famed for warlike toil
 art thou silent ribolt troil
 sand and dust and pebbly stones
 are leaving bare thy giant bones
 who dared touch the wild-bear's skin
 ye slumber'd on while life was in 
 a woman now or babe may come
 and cast the covering from thy tomb

 yet be not wrathful chief nor blight
 mine eyes or ears with sound or sight
 i come not with unhallow'd tread
 to wake the slumbers of the dead
 or lay thy giant relics bare
 but what i seek thou well canst spare
 be it to my hand allow'd
 to shear a merk's weight from thy shroud
 yet leave thee sheeted lead enough
 to shield thy bones from weather rough

 see i draw my magic knife 
 never while thou wert in life
 laid'st thou still for sloth or fear
 when point and edge were glittering near
 see the cerements now i sever 
 waken now or sleep for ever
 thou wilt not wake the deed is done 
 the prize i sought is fairly won

 thanks ribolt thanks for this the sea
 shall smooth its ruffled crest for thee 
 and while afar its billows foam
 subside to peace near ribolt's tomb
 thanks ribolt thanks for this the might
 of wild winds raging at their height
 when to thy place of slumber nigh
 shall soften to a lullaby

 she the dame of doubt and dread
 norna of the fitful-head
 mighty in her own despite 
 miserable in her might
 in despair and frenzy great 
 in her greatness desolate
 wisest wickedest who lives
 well can keep the word she gives

while norna chanted the first part of this rhyme she completed the task
of laying bare a part of the leaden coffin of the ancient warrior and
severed from it with much caution and apparent awe a portion of the
metal she then reverentially threw back the sand upon the coffin and
by the time she had finished her song no trace remained that the
secrets of the sepulchre had been violated

mertoun remained gazing on her from behind the churchyard wall during
the whole ceremony not from any impression of veneration for her or her
employment but because he conceived that to interrupt a madwoman in her
act of madness was not the best way to obtain from her such
intelligence as she might have to impart meanwhile he had full time to
consider her figure although her face was obscured by her dishevelled
hair and by the hood of her dark mantle which permitted no more to be
visible than a druidess would probably have exhibited at the celebration
of her mystical rites mertoun had often heard of norna before nay it
is most probable that he might have seen her repeatedly for she had
been in the vicinity of jarlshof more than once since his residence
there but the absurd stories which were in circulation respecting her
prevented his paying any attention to a person whom he regarded as
either an impostor or a madwoman or a compound of both yet now that
his attention was by circumstances involuntarily fixed upon her person
and deportment he could not help acknowledging to himself that she was
either a complete enthusiast or rehearsed her part so admirably that
no pythoness of ancient times could have excelled her the dignity and
solemnity of her gesture the sonorous yet impressive tone of voice
with which she addressed the departed spirit whose mortal relics she
ventured to disturb were such as failed not to make an impression upon
him careless and indifferent as he generally appeared to all that went
on around him but no sooner was her singular occupation terminated
than entering the churchyard with some difficulty by clambering over
the disjointed ruins of the wall he made norna aware of his presence
far from starting or expressing the least surprise at his appearance in
a place so solitary she said in a tone that seemed to intimate that he
had been expected so you have sought me at last

and found you replied mertoun judging he would best introduce the
enquiries he had to make by assuming a tone which corresponded to her
own

yes she replied found me you have and in the place where all men
must meet amid the tabernacles of the dead

here we must indeed meet at last replied mertoun glancing his
eyes on the desolate scene around where headstones half covered in
sand and others from which the same wind had stripped the soil on
which they rested covered with inscriptions and sculptured with the
emblems of mortality were the most conspicuous objects here as in
the house of death all men must meet at length and happy those that
come soonest to the quiet haven

he that dares desire this haven said norna must have steered a
steady course in the voyage of life i dare not hope for such quiet
harbour darest thou expect it or has the course thou hast kept
deserved it

it matters not to my present purpose replied mertoun i have to ask
you what tidings you know of my son mordaunt mertoun

a father replied the sibyl asks of a stranger what tidings she has
of his son how should i know aught of him the cormorant says not to
the mallard where is my brood

lay aside this useless affectation of mystery said mertoun with the
vulgar and ignorant it has its effect but upon me it is thrown away
the people of jarlshof have told me that you do know or may know
something of mordaunt mertoun who has not returned home after the
festival of saint john's held in the house of your relative magnus
troil give me such information if indeed ye have it to give and it
shall be recompensed if the means of recompense are in my power

the wide round of earth replied norna holds nothing that i would
call a recompense for the slightest word that i throw away upon a living
ear but for thy son if thou wouldst see him in life repair to the
approaching fair of kirkwall in orkney

and wherefore thither said mertoun i know he had no purpose in that
direction

we drive on the stream of fate answered norna without oar or
rudder you had no purpose this morning of visiting the kirk of saint
ringan yet you are here you had no purpose but a minute hence of
being at kirkwall and yet you will go thither

not unless the cause is more distinctly explained to me i am no
believer dame in those who assert your supernatural powers

you shall believe in them ere we part said norna as yet you know
but little of me nor shall you know more but i know enough of you and
could convince you with one word that i do so

convince me then said mertoun for unless i am so convinced there
is little chance of my following your counsel

mark then said norna what i have to say on your son's score else
what i shall say to you on your own will banish every other thought from
your memory you shall go to the approaching fair at kirkwall and on
the fifth day of the fair you shall walk at the hour of noon in the
outer aisle of the cathedral of saint magnus and there you shall meet a
person who will give you tidings of your son

you must speak more distinctly dame returned mertoun scornfully
if you hope that i should follow your counsel i have been fooled in my
time by women but never so grossly as you seem willing to gull me

hearken then said the old woman the word which i speak shall touch
the nearest secret of thy life and thrill thee through nerve and bone

so saying she whispered a word into mertoun's ear the effect of which
seemed almost magical he remained fixed and motionless with surprise
as waving her arm slowly aloft with an air of superiority and triumph
norna glided from him turned round a corner of the ruins and was soon
out of sight

mertoun offered not to follow or to trace her we fly from our fate in
vain he said as he began to recover himself and turning he left
behind him the desolate ruins with their cemetery as he looked back
from the very last point at which the church was visible he saw the
figure of norna muffled in her mantle standing on the very summit of
the ruined tower and stretching out in the sea-breeze something which
resembled a white pennon or flag a feeling of horror similar to that
excited by her last words again thrilled through his bosom and he
hastened onwards with unwonted speed until he had left the church of
saint ninian with its bay of sand far behind him

upon his arrival at jarlshof the alteration in his countenance was so
great that swertha conjectured he was about to fall into one of those
fits of deep melancholy which she termed his dark hour

and what better could be expected thought swertha when he must
needs go visit norna of the fitful-head when she was in the haunted
kirk of saint ringan's

but without testifying any other symptoms of an alienated mind than
that of deep and sullen dejection her master acquainted her with his
intention to go to the fair of kirkwall a thing so contrary to his
usual habits that the housekeeper wellnigh refused to credit her ears
shortly after he heard with apparent indifference the accounts
returned by the different persons who had been sent out in quest of
mordaunt by sea and land who all of them returned without any tidings
the equanimity with which mertoun heard the report of their bad success
convinced swertha still more firmly that in his interview with norna
that issue had been predicted to him by the sibyl whom he had consulted

the township were yet more surprised when their tacksman mr mertoun
as if on some sudden resolution made preparations to visit kirkwall
during the fair although he had hitherto avoided sedulously all such
places of public resort swertha puzzled herself a good deal without
being able to penetrate this mystery and vexed herself still more
concerning the fate of her young master but her concern was much
softened by the deposit of a sum of money seeming however moderate in
itself a treasure in her eyes which her master put into her hands
acquainting her at the same time that he had taken his passage for
kirkwall in a small bark belonging to the proprietor of the island of
mousa




chapter vi

 nae langer she wept her tears were a spent 
 despair it was come and she thought it content
 she thought it content but her cheek it grew pale
 and she droop'd like a lily broke down by the hail

 continuation of auld robin grayd


the condition of minna much resembled that of the village heroine in
lady ann lindsay's beautiful ballad her natural firmness of mind
prevented her from sinking under the pressure of the horrible secret
which haunted her while awake and was yet more tormenting during her
broken and hurried slumbers there is no grief so dreadful as that which
we dare not communicate and in which we can neither ask nor desire
sympathy and when to this is added the burden of a guilty mystery to an
innocent bosom there is little wonder that minna's health should have
sunk under the burden

to the friends around her habits and manners nay her temper seemed
altered to such an extraordinary degree that it is no wonder that some
should have ascribed the change to witchcraft and some to incipient
madness she became unable to bear the solitude in which she formerly
delighted to spend her time yet when she hurried into society it was
without either joining in or attending to what passed generally she
appeared wrapped in sad and even sullen abstraction until her
attention was suddenly roused by some casual mention of the name of
cleveland or of mordaunt mertoun at which she started with the horror
of one who sees the lighted match applied to a charged mine and expects
to be instantly involved in the effects of the explosion and when she
observed that the discovery was not yet made it was so far from being a
consolation that she almost wished the worst were known rather than
endure the continued agonies of suspense

her conduct towards her sister was so variable yet uniformly so painful
to the kind-hearted brenda that it seemed to all around one of the
strongest features of her malady sometimes minna was impelled to seek
her sister's company as if by the consciousness that they were common
sufferers by a misfortune of which she herself alone could grasp the
extent and then suddenly the feeling of the injury which brenda had
received through the supposed agency of cleveland made her unable to
bear her presence and still less to endure the consolation which her
sister mistaking the nature of her malady vainly endeavoured to
administer frequently also did it happen that while brenda was
imploring her sister to take comfort she incautiously touched upon some
subject which thrilled to the very centre of her soul so that unable
to conceal her agony minna would rush hastily from the apartment all
these different moods though they too much resembled to one who knew
not their real source the caprices of unkind estrangement brenda
endured with such prevailing and unruffled gentleness of disposition
that minna was frequently moved to shed floods of tears upon her neck
and perhaps the moments in which she did so though embittered by the
recollection that her fatal secret concerned the destruction of brenda's
happiness as well as her own were still softened as they were by
sisterly affection the most endurable moments of this most miserable
period of her life

the effects of the alternations of moping melancholy fearful agitation
and bursts of nervous feeling were soon visible on the poor young
woman's face and person she became pale and emaciated her eye lost the
steady quiet look of happiness and innocence and was alternately dim
and wild as she was acted upon by a general feeling of her own
distressful condition or by some quicker and more poignant sense of
agony her very features seemed to change and become sharp and eager
and her voice which in its ordinary tones was low and placid now
sometimes sunk in indistinct mutterings and sometimes was raised beyond
the natural key in hasty and abrupt exclamations when in company with
others she was sullenly silent and when she ventured into solitude
was observed for it was now thought very proper to watch her on such
occasions to speak much to herself

the pharmacy of the islands was in vain resorted to by minna's anxious
father sages of both sexes who knew the virtues of every herb which
drinks the dew and augmented those virtues by words of might used
while they prepared and applied the medicines were attended with no
benefit and magnus in the utmost anxiety was at last induced to have
recourse to the advice of his kinswoman norna of the fitful-head
although owing to circumstances noticed in the course of the story
there was at this time some estrangement between them his first
application was in vain norna was then at her usual place of residence
upon the sea-coast near the headland from which she usually took her
designation but although eric scambester himself brought the message
she refused positively to see him or to return any answer

magnus was angry at the slight put upon his messenger and message but
his anxiety on minna's account as well as the respect which he had for
norna's real misfortunes and imputed wisdom and power prevented him
from indulging on the present occasion his usual irritability of
disposition on the contrary he determined to make an application to
his kinswoman in his own person he kept his purpose however to
himself and only desired his daughters to be in readiness to attend him
upon a visit to a relation whom he had not seen for some time and
directed them at the same time to carry some provisions along with
them as the journey was distant and they might perhaps find their
friend unprovided

unaccustomed to ask explanations of his pleasure and hoping that
exercise and the amusement of such an excursion might be of service to
her sister brenda upon whom all household and family charges now
devolved caused the necessary preparations to be made for the
expedition and on the next morning they were engaged in tracing the
long and tedious course of beach and of moorland which only varied by
occasional patches of oats and barley where a little ground had been
selected for cultivation divided burgh-westra from the north-western
extremity of the mainland as the principal island is called which
terminates in the cape called fitful-head as the south-western point
ends in the cape of sumburgh

on they went through wild and over wold the udaller bestriding a
strong square-made well-barrelled palfrey of norwegian breed
somewhat taller and yet as stout as the ordinary ponies of the
country while minna and brenda famed amongst other accomplishments
for their horsemanship rode two of those hardy animals which bred and
reared with more pains than is usually bestowed showed both by the
neatness of their form and their activity that the race so much and so
carelessly neglected is capable of being improved into beauty without
losing any thing of its spirit or vigour they were attended by two
servants on horseback and two on foot secure that the last
circumstance would be no delay to their journey because a great part of
the way was so rugged or so marshy that the horses could only move at
a foot pace and that whenever they met with any considerable tract of
hard and even ground they had only to borrow from the nearest herd of
ponies the use of a couple for the accommodation of these pedestrians

the journey was a melancholy one and little conversation passed except
when the udaller pressed by impatience and vexation urged his pony to
a quick pace and again recollecting minna's weak state of health
slackened to a walk and reiterated enquiries how she felt herself and
whether the fatigue was not too much for her at noon the party halted
and partook of some refreshment for which they had made ample
provision beside a pleasant spring the pureness of whose waters
however did not suit the udaller's palate until qualified by a
liberal addition of right nantz after he had a second yea and a third
time filled a large silver travelling-cup embossed with a german cupid
smoking a pipe and a german bacchus emptying his flask down the throat
of a bear he began to become more talkative than vexation had permitted
him to be during the early part of their journey and thus addressed his
daughters 

well children we are within a league or two of norna's dwelling and
we shall soon see how the old spell-mutterer will receive us

minna interrupted her father with a faint exclamation while brenda
surprised to a great degree exclaimed is it then to norna that we are
to make this visit heaven forbid

and wherefore should heaven forbid said the udaller knitting his
brows wherefore i would gladly know should heaven forbid me to visit
my kinswoman whose skill may be of use to your sister if any woman in
zetland or man either can be of service to her you are a fool
brenda your sister has more sense cheer up minna thou wert ever
wont to like her songs and stories and used to hang about her neck
when little brenda cried and ran from her like a spanish merchantman
from a dutch caper

i wish she may not frighten me as much to-day father replied brenda
desirous of indulging minna in her taciturnity and at the same time to
amuse her father by sustaining the conversation i have heard so much
of her dwelling that i am rather alarmed at the thought of going there
uninvited

thou art a fool said magnus to think that a visit from her
kinsfolks can ever come amiss to a kind hearty hialtland heart like
my cousin norna's and now i think on't i will be sworn that is the
reason why she would not receive eric scambester it is many a long day
since i have seen her chimney smoke and i have never carried you
thither she hath indeed some right to call me unkind but i will tell
her the truth and that is that though such be the fashion i do not
think it is fair or honest to eat up the substance of lone women-folks
as we do that of our brother udallers when we roll about from house to
house in the winter season until we gather like a snowball and eat up
all wherever we come

there is no fear of our putting norna to any distress just now
replied brenda for i have ample provision of every thing that we can
possibly need fish and bacon and salted mutton and dried geese more
than we could eat in a week besides enough of liquor for you father

right right my girl said the udaller a well-found ship makes a
merry voyage so we shall only want the kindness of norna's roof and a
little bedding for you for as to myself my sea-cloak and honest dry
boards of norway deal suit me better than your eider-down cushions and
mattresses so that norna will have the pleasure of seeing us without
having a stiver's worth of trouble

i wish she may think it a pleasure sir replied brenda

why what does the girl mean in the name of the martyr replied
magnus troil dost thou think my kinswoman is a heathen who will not
rejoice to see her own flesh and blood i would i were as sure of a
good year's fishing no no i only fear we may find her from home at
present for she is often a wanderer and all with thinking over much on
what can never be helped

minna sighed deeply as her father spoke and the udaller went on 

dost thou sigh at that my girl why tis the fault of half the
world let it never be thine own minna

another suppressed sigh intimated that the caution came too late

i believe you are afraid of my cousin as well as brenda is said the
udaller gazing on her pale countenance if so speak the word and we
will return back again as if we had the wind on our quarter and were
running fifteen knots by the line

do for heaven's sake sister let us return said brenda
imploringly you know you remember you must be well aware that norna
can do nought to help you

it is but too true said minna in a subdued voice but i know
not she may answer a question a question that only the miserable dare
ask of the miserable

nay my kinswoman is no miser answered the udaller who only heard
the beginning of the word a good income she has both in orkney and
here and many a fair lispund of butter is paid to her but the poor
have the best share of it and shame fall the zetlander who begrudges
them the rest she spends i wot not how in her journeys through the
islands but you will laugh to see her house and nick strumpfer whom
she calls pacolet many folks think nick is the devil but he is flesh
and blood like any of us his father lived in græmsay i shall be glad
to see nick again

while the udaller thus ran on brenda who in recompense for a less
portion of imagination than her sister was gifted with sound common
sense was debating with herself the probable effect of this visit on
her sister's health she came finally to the resolution of speaking with
her father aside upon the first occasion which their journey should
afford to him she determined to communicate the whole particulars of
their nocturnal interview with norna to which among other agitating
causes she attributed the depression of minna's spirits and then make
himself the judge whether he ought to persist in his visit to a person
so singular and expose his daughter to all the shock which her nerves
might possibly receive from the interview

just as she had arrived at this conclusion her father dashing the
crumbs from his laced waistcoat with one hand and receiving with the
other a fourth cup of brandy and water drank devoutly to the success of
their voyage and ordered all to be in readiness to set forward whilst
they were saddling their ponies brenda with some difficulty contrived
to make her father understand she wished to speak with him in
private no small surprise to the honest udaller who though secret as
the grave in the very few things where he considered secrecy as of
importance was so far from practising mystery in general that his most
important affairs were often discussed by him openly in presence of his
whole family servants included

but far greater was his astonishment when remaining purposely with his
daughter brenda a little in the wake as he termed it of the other
riders he heard the whole account of norna's visit to burgh-westra and
of the communication with which she had then astounded his daughters
for a long time he could utter nothing but interjections and ended with
a thousand curses on his kinswoman's folly in telling his daughters such
a history of horror

i have often heard said the udaller that she was quite mad with
all her wisdom and all her knowledge of the seasons and by the bones
of my namesake the martyr i begin now to believe it most assuredly i
know no more how to steer than if i had lost my compass had i known
this before we set out i think i had remained at home but now that we
have come so far and that norna expects us  

expects us father said brenda how can that be possible

why that i know not but she that can tell how the wind is to blow
can tell which way we are designing to ride she must not be
provoked perhaps she has done my family this ill for the words i had
with her about that lad mordaunt mertoun and if so she can undo it
again and so she shall or i will know the cause wherefore but i will
try fair words first

finding it thus settled that they were to go forward brenda endeavoured
next to learn from her father whether norna's tale was founded in
reality he shook his head groaned bitterly and in a few words
acknowledged that the whole so far as concerned her intrigue with a
stranger and her father's death of which she became the accidental and
most innocent cause was a matter of sad and indisputable truth for
her infant he said he could never by any means learn what became
of it

her infant exclaimed brenda she spoke not a word of her infant

then i wish my tongue had been blistered said the udaller when i
told you of it i see that young and old a man has no better chance
of keeping a secret from you women than an eel to keep himself in his
hold when he is sniggled with a loop of horse-hair sooner or later the
fisher teazes him out of his hole when he has once the noose round his
neck

but the infant my father said brenda still insisting on the
particulars of this extraordinary story what became of it

carried off i fancy by the blackguard vaughan answered the udaller
with a gruff accent which plainly betokened how weary he was of the
subject

by vaughan said brenda the lover of poor norna doubtless what
sort of man was he father

why much like other men i fancy answered the udaller i never saw
him in my life he kept company with the scottish families at kirkwall
and i with the good old norse folk ah if norna had dwelt always
amongst her own kin and not kept company with her scottish
acquaintance she would have known nothing of vaughan and things might
have been otherwise but then i should have known nothing of your
blessed mother brenda and that he said his large blue eyes shining
with a tear would have saved me a short joy and a long sorrow

norna could but ill have supplied my mother's place to you father as
a companion and a friend that is judging from all i have heard said
brenda with some hesitation but magnus softened by recollections of
his beloved wife answered her with more indulgence than she expected

i would have been content he said to have wedded norna at that
time it would have been the soldering of an old quarrel the healing of
an old sore all our blood relations wished it and situated as i was
especially not having seen your blessed mother i had little will to
oppose their counsels you must not judge of norna or of me by such an
appearance as we now present to you she was young and beautiful and i
gamesome as a highland buck and little caring what haven i made for
having as i thought more than one under my lee but norna preferred
this man vaughan and as i told you before it was perhaps the best
kindness she could have done to me

ah poor kinswoman said brenda but believe you father in the high
powers which she claims in the mysterious vision of the dwarf in
the  

she was interrupted in these questions by magnus to whom they were
obviously displeasing

i believe brenda he said according to the belief of my
forefathers i pretend not to be a wiser man than they were in their
time and they all believed that in cases of great worldly distress
providence opened the eyes of the mind and afforded the sufferers a
vision of futurity it was but a trimming of the boat with
reverence here he touched his hat reverentially and after all the
shifting of ballast poor norna is as heavily loaded in the bows as ever
was an orkneyman's yawl at the dog-fishing she has more than affliction
enough on board to balance whatever gifts she may have had in the midst
of her calamity they are as painful to her poor soul as a crown of
thorns would be to her brows though it were the badge of the empire of
denmark and do not you brenda seek to be wiser than your fathers
your sister minna before she was so ill had as much reverence for
whatever was produced in norse as if it had been in the pope's bull
which is all written in pure latin

poor norna repeated brenda and her child was it never recovered

what do i know of her child said the udaller more gruffly than
before except that she was very ill both before and after the birth
though we kept her as merry as we could with pipe and harp and so
forth the child had come before its time into this bustling world so
it is likely it has been long dead but you know nothing of all these
matters brenda so get along for a foolish girl and ask no more
questions about what it does not become you to enquire into

so saying the udaller gave his sturdy little palfrey the spur and
cantering forward over rough and smooth while the pony's accuracy and
firmness of step put all difficulties of the path at secure defiance he
placed himself soon by the side of the melancholy minna and permitted
her sister to have no farther share in his conversation than as it was
addressed to them jointly she could but comfort herself with the hope
that as minna's disease appeared to have its seat in the imagination
the remedies recommended by norna might have some chance of being
effectual since in all probability they would be addressed to the
same faculty

their way had hitherto held chiefly over moss and moor varied
occasionally by the necessity of making a circuit around the heads of
those long lagoons called voes which run up into and indent the
country in such a manner that though the mainland of zetland may be
thirty miles or more in length there is perhaps no part of it which
is more than three miles distant from the salt water but they had now
approached the north-western extremity of the isle and travelled along
the top of an immense ridge of rocks which had for ages withstood the
rage of the northern ocean and of all the winds by which it is
buffeted

at length exclaimed magnus to his daughters there is norna's
dwelling look up minna my love for if this does not make you laugh
nothing will saw you ever any thing but an osprey that would have made
such a nest for herself as that is by my namesake's bones there is
not the like of it that living thing ever dwelt in having no wings and
the use of reason unless it chanced to be the frawa-stack off papa
where the king's daughter of norway was shut up to keep her from her
lovers and all to little purpose if the tale be true for
maidens i would have you to wot that it is hard to keep flax from the
lowe

the dwelling of norna though none but a native of zetland familiar
during his whole life with every variety of rock-scenery could have
seen any thing ludicrous in this situation was not unaptly compared by
magnus troil to the eyry of the osprey or sea-eagle it was very small
and had been fabricated out of one of those dens which are called burghs
and picts-houses in zetland and duns on the mainland of scotland and
the hebrides and which seem to be the first effort at architecture the
connecting link betwixt a fox's hole in a cairn of loose stones and an
attempt to construct a human habitation out of the same materials
without the use of lime or cement of any kind without any timber so
far as can be seen from their remains without any knowledge of the
arch or of the stair such as they are however the numerous remains of
these dwellings for there is one found on every headland islet or
point of vantage which could afford the inhabitants additional means of
defence tend to prove that the remote people by whom these burghs were
constructed were a numerous race and that the islands had then a much
greater population than from other circumstances we might have been
led to anticipate

the burgh of which we at present speak had been altered and repaired at
a later period probably by some petty despot or sea-rover who
tempted by the security of the situation which occupied the whole of a
projecting point of rock and was divided from the mainland by a rent or
chasm of some depth had built some additions to it in the rudest style
of gothic defensive architecture had plastered the inside with lime
and clay and broken out windows for the admission of light and air
and finally by roofing it over and dividing it into stories by means
of beams of wreck-wood had converted the whole into a tower resembling
a pyramidical dovecot formed by a double wall still containing within
its thickness that set of circular galleries or concentric rings which
is proper to all the forts of this primitive construction and which
seem to have constituted the only shelter which they were originally
qualified to afford to their shivering inhabitants

this singular habitation built out of the loose stones which lay
scattered around and exposed for ages to the vicissitudes of the
elements was as grey weatherbeaten and wasted as the rock on which
it was founded and from which it could not easily be distinguished so
completely did it resemble in colour and so little did it differ in
regularity of shape from a pinnacle or fragment of the cliff

minna's habitual indifference to all that of late had passed around her
was for a moment suspended by the sight of an abode which at another
and happier period of her life would have attracted at once her
curiosity and her wonder even now she seemed to feel interest as she
gazed upon this singular retreat and recollected it was that of certain
misery and probable insanity connected as its inhabitant asserted and
minna's faith admitted with power over the elements and the capacity
of intercourse with the invisible world

our kinswoman she muttered has chosen her dwelling well with no
more of earth than a sea-fowl might rest upon and all around sightless
tempests and raging waves despair and magical power could not have a
fitter residence

brenda on the other hand shuddered when she looked on the dwelling to
which they were advancing by a difficult dangerous and precarious
path which sometimes to her great terror approached to the verge of
the precipice so that zetlander as she was and confident as she had
reason to be in the steadiness and sagacity of the sure-footed pony
she could scarce suppress an inclination to giddiness especially at one
point when being foremost of the party and turning a sharp angle of
the rock her feet as they projected from the side of the pony hung
for an instant sheer over the ledge of the precipice so that there was
nothing save empty space betwixt the sole of her shoe and the white foam
of the vexed ocean which dashed howled and foamed five hundred feet
below what would have driven a maiden of another country into delirium
gave her but a momentary uneasiness which was instantly lost in the
hope that the impression which the scene appeared to make on her
sister's imagination might be favourable to her cure

illustration

she could not help looking back to see how minna should pass the point
of peril which she herself had just rounded and could hear the
strong voice of the udaller though to him such rough paths were
familiar as the smooth sea-beach call in a tone of some anxiety take
heed jarto as minna with an eager look dropped her bridle and
stretched forward her arms and even her body over the precipice in
the attitude of the wild swan when balancing itself and spreading its
broad pinions it prepares to launch from the cliff upon the bosom of
the winds brenda felt at that instant a pang of unutterable terror
which left a strong impression on her nerves even when relieved as it
instantly was by her sister recovering herself and sitting upright on
her saddle the opportunity and temptation if she felt it passing
away as the quiet steady animal which supported her rounded the
projecting angle and turned its patient and firm step from the verge of
the precipice

they now attained a more level and open space of ground being the flat
top of an isthmus of projecting rock narrowing again towards a point
where it was terminated by the chasm which separated the small peak or
stack occupied by norna's habitation from the main ridge of cliff
and precipice this natural fosse which seemed to have been the work of
some convulsion of nature was deep dark and irregular narrower
towards the bottom which could not be distinctly seen and widest at
top having the appearance as if that part of the cliff occupied by the
building had been half rent away from the isthmus which it
terminated an idea favoured by the angle at which it seemed to recede
from the land and lean towards the sea with the building which crowned
it

this angle of projection was so considerable that it required
recollection to dispel the idea that the rock so much removed from the
perpendicular was about to precipitate itself seaward with its old
tower and a timorous person would have been afraid to put foot upon it
lest an addition of weight so inconsiderable as that of the human body
should hasten a catastrophe which seemed at every instant impending

without troubling himself about such fantasies the udaller rode towards
the tower and there dismounting along with his daughters gave the
ponies in charge to one of their domestics with directions to
disencumber them of their burdens and turn them out for rest and
refreshment upon the nearest heath this done they approached the gate
which seemed formerly to have been connected with the land by a rude
drawbridge some of the apparatus of which was still visible but the
rest had been long demolished and was replaced by a stationary
footbridge formed of barrel-staves covered with turf very narrow and
ledgeless and supported by a sort of arch constructed out of the
jaw-bones of the whale along this brigg of dread the udaller stepped
with his usual portly majesty of stride which threatened its demolition
and his own at the same time his daughters trode more lightly and more
safely after him and the whole party stood before the low and rugged
portal of norna's habitation

if she should be abroad after all said magnus as he plied the black
oaken door with repeated blows but if so we will at least lie by a
day for her return and make nick strumpfer pay the demurrage in bland
and brandy

as he spoke the door opened and displayed to the alarm of brenda
and the surprise of minna herself a square-made dwarf about four feet
five inches high with a head of most portentous size and features
correspondent namely a huge mouth a tremendous nose with large black
nostrils which seemed to have been slit upwards blubber lips of an
unconscionable size and huge wall-eyes with which he leared sneered
grinned and goggled on the udaller as an old acquaintance without
uttering a single word the young women could hardly persuade themselves
that they did not see before their eyes the very demon trolld who made
such a distinguished figure in norna's legend their father went on
addressing this uncouth apparition in terms of such condescending
friendship as the better sort apply to their inferiors when they wish
for any immediate purpose to conciliate or coax them a tone by the
by which generally contains in its very familiarity as much offence
as the more direct assumption of distance and superiority

ha nick honest nick said the udaller here you are lively and
lovely as saint nicholas your namesake when he is carved with an axe
for the headpiece of a dutch dogger how dost thou do nick or pacolet
if you like that better nicholas here are my two daughters nearly as
handsome as thyself thou seest

nick grinned and did a clumsy obeisance by way of courtesy but kept
his broad misshapen person firmly placed in the doorway

daughters continued the udaller who seemed to have his reasons for
speaking this cerberus fair at least according to his own notions of
propitiation this is nick strumpfer maidens whom his mistress calls
pacolet being a light-limbed dwarf as you see like him that wont to
fly about like a scourie on his wooden hobbyhorse in the old
storybook of valentine and orson that you minna used to read whilst
you were a child i assure you he can keep his mistress's counsel and
never told one of her secrets in his life ha ha ha

the ugly dwarf grinned ten times wider than before and showed the
meaning of the udaller's jest by opening his immense jaws and throwing
back his head so as to discover that in the immense cavity of his
mouth there only remained the small shrivelled remnant of a tongue
capable perhaps of assisting him in swallowing his food but unequal
to the formation of articulate sounds whether this organ had been
curtailed by cruelty or injured by disease it was impossible to guess
but that the unfortunate being had not been originally dumb was evident
from his retaining the sense of hearing having made this horrible
exhibition he repaid the udaller's mirth with a loud horrid and
discordant laugh which had something in it the more hideous that his
mirth seemed to be excited by his own misery the sisters looked on each
other in silence and fear and even the udaller appeared disconcerted

and how now he proceeded after a minute's pause when didst thou
wash that throat of thine that is about the width of the pentland
frith with a cup of brandy ha nick i have that with me which is
sound stuff boy ha

the dwarf bent his beetle-brows shook his misshapen head and made a
quick sharp indication throwing his right hand up to his shoulder with
the thumb pointed backwards

what my kinswoman said the udaller comprehending the signal will
be angry well shalt have a flask to carouse when she is from home
old acquaintance lips and throats may swallow though they cannot
speak

pacolet grinned a grim assent

and now said the udaller stand out of the way pacolet and let me
carry my daughters to see their kinswoman by the bones of saint magnus
it shall be a good turn in thy way nay never shake thy head man for
if thy mistress be at home see her we will

the dwarf again intimated the impossibility of their being admitted
partly by signs partly by mumbling some uncouth and most disagreeable
sounds and the udaller's mood began to arise

tittle tattle man said he trouble not me with thy gibberish but
stand out of the way and the blame if there be any shall rest with
me

so saying magnus troil laid his sturdy hand upon the collar of the
recusant dwarf's jacket of blue wadmaal and with a strong but not a
violent grasp removed him from the doorway pushed him gently aside
and entered followed by his two daughters whom a sense of
apprehension arising out of all which they saw and heard kept very
close to him a crooked and dusky passage through which magnus led the
way was dimly enlightened by a shot-hole communicating with the
interior of the building and originally intended doubtless to command
the entrance by a hagbut or culverin as they approached nearer for
they walked slowly and with hesitation the light imperfect as it was
was suddenly obscured and on looking upward to discern the cause
brenda was startled to observe the pale and obscurely-seen countenance
of norna gazing downward upon them without speaking a word there was
nothing extraordinary in this as the mistress of the mansion might be
naturally enough looking out to see what guests were thus suddenly and
unceremoniously intruding themselves on her presence still however
the natural paleness of her features exaggerated by the light in which
they were at present exhibited the immovable sternness of her look
which showed neither kindness nor courtesy of civil reception her dead
silence and the singular appearance of every thing about her dwelling
augmented the dismay which brenda had already conceived magnus troil
and minna had walked slowly forward without observing the apparition of
their singular hostess

chapter viii

 the witch then raised her wither'd arm
 and waved her wand on high
 and while she spoke the mutter'd charm
 dark lightning fill'd her eye

 meikle


this should be the stair said the udaller blundering in the dark
against some steps of irregular ascent this should be the stair
unless my memory greatly fail me ay and there she sits he added
pausing at a half-open door with all her tackle about her as usual
and as busy doubtless as the devil in a gale of wind

as he made this irreverent comparison he entered followed by his
daughters the darkened apartment in which norna was seated amidst a
confused collection of books of various languages parchment scrolls
tablets and stones inscribed with the straight and angular characters of
the runic alphabet and similar articles which the vulgar might have
connected with the exercise of the forbidden arts there were also lying
in the chamber or hung over the rude and ill-contrived chimney an old
shirt of mail with the headpiece battle-axe and lance which had once
belonged to it and on a shelf were disposed in great order several of
those curious stone-axes formed of green granite which are often found
in those islands where they are called thunderbolts by the common
people who usually preserve them as a charm of security against the
effects of lightning there was moreover to be seen amid the strange
collection a stone sacrificial knife used perhaps for immolating human
victims and one or two of the brazen implements called celts the
purpose of which has troubled the repose of so many antiquaries a
variety of other articles some of which had neither name nor were
capable of description lay in confusion about the apartment and in one
corner on a quantity of withered sea-weed reposed what seemed at
first view to be a large unshapely dog but when seen more closely
proved to be a tame seal which it had been norna's amusement to
domesticate

this uncouth favourite bristled up in its corner upon the arrival of so
many strangers with an alertness similar to that which a terrestrial
dog would have displayed on a similar occasion but norna remained
motionless seated behind a table of rough granite propped up by
misshapen feet of the same material which besides the old book with
which she seemed to be busied sustained a cake of the coarse unleavened
bread three parts oatmeal and one the sawdust of fir which is used by
the poor peasants of norway beside which stood a jar of water

magnus troil remained a minute in silence gazing upon his kinswoman
while the singularity of her mansion inspired brenda with much fear and
changed though but for a moment the melancholy and abstracted mood of
minna into a feeling of interest not unmixed with awe the silence was
interrupted by the udaller who unwilling on the one hand to give his
kinswoman offence and desirous on the other to show that he was not
daunted by a reception so singular opened the conversation thus 

i give you good e'en cousin norna my daughters and i have come far to
see you

norna raised her eyes from her volume looked full at her visitors then
let them quietly sit down on the leaf with which she seemed to be
engaged

nay cousin said magnus take your own time our business with you
can wait your leisure see here minna what a fair prospect here is of
the cape scarce a quarter of a mile off you may see the billows
breaking on it topmast high our kinswoman has got a pretty seal
too here sealchie my man whew whew

the seal took no further notice of the udaller's advances to
acquaintance than by uttering a low growl

he is not so well trained continued the udaller affecting an air of
ease and unconcern as peter macraw's the old piper of stornoway who
had a seal that flapped its tail to the tune of caberfae and
acknowledged no other whatever well cousin he concluded
observing that norna closed her book are you going to give us a
welcome at last or must we go farther than our blood-relation's house
to seek one and that when the evening is wearing late apace

ye dull and hard-hearted generation as deaf as the adder to the voice
of the charmer answered norna addressing them why come ye to me
you have slighted every warning i could give of the coming harm and
now that it hath come upon you ye seek my counsel when it can avail you
nothing

look you kinswoman said the udaller with his usual frankness and
boldness of manner and accent i must needs tell you that your courtesy
is something of the coarsest and the coldest i cannot say that i ever
saw an adder in regard there are none in these parts but touching my
own thoughts of what such a thing may be it cannot be termed a suitable
comparison to me or to my daughters and that i would have you to know
for old acquaintance and certain other reasons i do not leave your
house upon the instant but as i came hither in all kindness and
civility so i pray you to receive me with the like otherwise we will
depart and leave shame on your inhospitable threshold

how said norna dare you use such bold language in the house of one
from whom all men from whom you yourself come to solicit counsel and
aid they who speak to the reimkennar must lower their voice to her
before whom winds and waves hush both blast and billow

blast and billow may hush themselves if they will replied the
peremptory udaller but that will not i i speak in the house of my
friend as in my own and strike sail to none

and hope ye said norna by this rudeness to compel me to answer to
your interrogatories

kinswoman replied magnus troil i know not so much as you of the old
norse sagas but this i know that when kempies were wont long since
to seek the habitations of the gall-dragons and spae-women they came
with their axes on their shoulders and their good swords drawn in their
hands and compelled the power whom they invoked to listen to and to
answer them ay were it odin himself

kinsman said norna arising from her seat and coming forward thou
hast spoken well and in good time for thyself and thy daughters for
hadst thou turned from my threshold without extorting an answer
morning's sun had never again shone upon you the spirits who serve me
are jealous and will not be employed in aught that may benefit
humanity unless their service is commanded by the undaunted importunity
of the brave and the free and now speak what wouldst thou have of me

my daughter's health replied magnus which no remedies have been
able to restore

thy daughter's health answered norna and what is the maiden's
ailment

the physician said troil must name the disease all that i can tell
thee of it is  

be silent said norna interrupting him i know all thou canst tell
me and more than thou thyself knowest sit down all of you and thou
maiden she said addressing minna sit thou in that chair pointing
to the place she had just left once the seat of giervada at whose
voice the stars hid their beams and the moon herself grew pale

minna moved with slow and tremulous step towards the rude seat thus
indicated to her it was composed of stone formed into some semblance
of a chair by the rough and unskilful hand of some ancient gothic
artist

brenda creeping as close as possible to her father seated herself
along with him upon a bench at some distance from minna and kept her
eyes with a mixture of fear pity and anxiety closely fixed upon
her it would be difficult altogether to decipher the emotions by which
this amiable and affectionate girl was agitated at the moment deficient
in her sister's predominating quality of high imagination and little
credulous of course to the marvellous she could not but entertain
some vague and indefinite fears on her own account concerning the
nature of the scene which was soon to take place but these were in a
manner swallowed up in her apprehensions on the score of her sister
who with a frame so much weakened spirits so much exhausted and a
mind so susceptible of the impressions which all around her was
calculated to excite now sat pensively resigned to the agency of one
whose treatment might produce the most baneful effects upon such a
subject

brenda gazed at minna who sat in that rude chair of dark stone her
finely formed shape and limbs making the strongest contrast with its
ponderous and irregular angles her cheek and lips as pale as clay and
her eyes turned upward and lighted with the mixture of resignation and
excited enthusiasm which belonged to her disease and her character the
younger sister then looked on norna who muttered to herself in a low
monotonous manner as gliding from one place to another she collected
different articles which she placed one by one on the table and
lastly brenda looked anxiously to her father to gather if possible
from his countenance whether he entertained any part of her own fears
for the consequences of the scene which was to ensue considering the
state of minna's health and spirits but magnus troil seemed to have no
such apprehensions he viewed with stern composure norna's
preparations and appeared to wait the event with the composure of one
who confiding in the skill of a medical artist sees him preparing to
enter upon some important and painful operation in the issue of which
he is interested by friendship or by affection

norna meanwhile went onward with her preparations until she had
placed on the stone table a variety of miscellaneous articles and among
the rest a small chafing-dish full of charcoal a crucible and a piece
of thin sheet-lead she then spoke aloud it is well that i was aware
of your coming hither ay long before you yourself had resolved it how
should i else have been prepared for that which is now to be
done maiden she continued addressing minna where lies thy pain

the patient answered by pressing her hand to the left side of her
bosom

even so replied norna even so tis the site of weal or woe and
you her father and her sister think not this the idle speech of one
who talks by guess if i can tell thee ill it may be that i shall be
able to render that less severe which may not by any aid be wholly
amended the heart ay the heart touch that and the eye grows dim
the pulse fails the wholesome stream of our blood is choked and
troubled our limbs decay like sapless sea-weed in a summer's sun our
better views of existence are past and gone what remains is the dream
of lost happiness or the fear of inevitable evil but the reimkennar
must to her work well it is that i have prepared the means

she threw off her long dark-coloured mantle and stood before them in
her short jacket of light-blue wadmaal with its skirt of the same
stuff fancifully embroidered with black velvet and bound at the waist
with a chain or girdle of silver formed into singular devices norna
next undid the fillet which bound her grizzled hair and shaking her
head wildly caused it to fall in dishevelled abundance over her face
and around her shoulders so as almost entirely to hide her features
she then placed a small crucible on the chafing-dish already
mentioned dropped a few drops from a vial on the charcoal
below pointed towards it her wrinkled forefinger which she had
previously moistened with liquid from another small bottle and said
with a deep voice fire do thy duty and the words were no sooner
spoken than probably by some chemical combination of which the
spectators were not aware the charcoal which was under the crucible
became slowly ignited while norna as if impatient of the delay threw
hastily back her disordered tresses and while her features reflected
the sparkles and red light of the fire and her eyes flashed from
amongst her hair like those of a wild animal from its cover blew
fiercely till the whole was in an intense glow she paused a moment from
her toil and muttering that the elemental spirit must be thanked
recited in her usual monotonous yet wild mode of chanting the
following verses 

 thou so needful yet so dread
 with cloudy crest and wing of red
 thou without whose genial breath
 the north would sleep the sleep of death
 who deign'st to warm the cottage hearth
 yet hurl'st proud palaces to earth 
 brightest keenest of the powers
 which form and rule this world of ours
 with my rhyme of runic i
 thank thee for thy agency

she then severed a portion from the small mass of sheet-lead which lay
upon the table and placing it in the crucible subjected it to the
action of the lighted charcoal and as it melted she sung 

 old reimkennar to thy art
 mother hertha sends her part
 she whose gracious bounty gives
 needful food for all that lives
 from the deep mine of the north
 came the mystic metal forth
 doom'd amidst disjointed stones
 long to cere a champion's bones
 disinhumed my charms to aid 
 mother earth my thanks are paid

she then poured out some water from the jar into a large cup or goblet
and sung once more as she slowly stirred it round with the end of her
staff 

 girdle of our islands dear
 element of water hear
 thou whose power can overwhelm
 broken mounds and ruin'd realm
 on the lowly belgian strand
 all thy fiercest rage can never
 of our soil a furlong sever
 from our rock-defended land
 play then gently thou thy part
 to assist old norna's art

she then with a pair of pincers removed the crucible from the
chafing-dish and poured the lead now entirely melted into the bowl of
water repeating at the same time 

 elements each other greeting
 gifts and powers attend your meeting

the melted lead spattering as it fell into the water formed of
course the usual combination of irregular forms which is familiar to
all who in childhood have made the experiment and from which according
to our childish fancy we may have selected portions bearing some
resemblance to domestic articles the tools of mechanics or the like
norna seemed to busy herself in some such researches for she examined
the mass of lead with scrupulous attention and detached it into
different portions without apparently being able to find a fragment in
the form which she desired

at length she again muttered rather as speaking to herself than to her
guests he the viewless will not be omitted he will have his
tribute even in the work to which he gives nothing stern compeller of
the clouds thou also shalt hear the voice of the reimkennar

thus speaking norna once more threw the lead into the crucible where
hissing and spattering as the wet metal touched the sides of the red-hot
vessel it was soon again reduced into a state of fusion the sibyl
meantime turned to a corner of the apartment and opening suddenly a
window which looked to the north-west let in the fitful radiance of the
sun now lying almost level upon a great mass of red clouds which
boding future tempest occupied the edge of the horizon and seemed to
brood over the billows of the boundless sea turning to this quarter
from which a low hollow moaning breeze then blew norna addressed the
spirit of the winds in tones which seemed to resemble his own 

 thou that over billows dark
 safely send'st the fisher's bark 
 giving him a path and motion
 through the wilderness of ocean
 thou that when the billows brave ye
 o'er the shelves canst drive the navy 
 did'st thou chafe as one neglected
 while thy brethren were respected
 to appease thee see i tear
 this full grasp of grizzled hair
 oft thy breath hath through it sung
 softening to my magic tongue 
 now tis thine to bid it fly
 through the wide expanse of sky
 mid the countless swarms to sail
 of wild-fowl wheeling on thy gale
 take thy portion and rejoice 
 spirit thou hast heard my voice

norna accompanied these words with the action which they described
tearing a handful of hair with vehemence from her head and strewing it
upon the wind as she continued her recitation she then shut the
casement and again involved the chamber in the dubious twilight which
best suited her character and occupation the melted lead was once more
emptied into the water and the various whimsical conformations which it
received from the operation were examined with great care by the sibyl
who at length seemed to intimate by voice and gesture that her spell
had been successful she selected from the fused metal a piece about the
size of a small nut bearing in shape a close resemblance to that of the
human heart and approaching minna again spoke in song 

 she who sits by haunted well
 is subject to the nixie's spell
 she who walks on lonely beach
 to the mermaid's charmed speech
 she who walks round ring of green
 offends the peevish fairy queen
 and she who takes rest in the dwarfie's cave
 a weary weird of woe shall have

 by ring by spring by cave by shore
 minna troil has braved all this and more
 and yet hath the root of her sorrow and ill
 a source that's more deep and more mystical still

minna whose attention had been latterly something disturbed by
reflections on her own secret sorrow now suddenly recalled it and
looked eagerly on norna as if she expected to learn from her rhymes
something of deep interest the northern sibyl meanwhile proceeded to
pierce the piece of lead which bore the form of a heart and to fix in
it a piece of gold wire by which it might be attached to a chain or
necklace she then proceeded in her rhyme 

 thou art within a demon's hold
 more wise than heims more strong than trolld
 no siren sings so sweet as he 
 no fay springs lighter on the lea
 no elfin power hath half the art
 to soothe to move to wring the heart 
 life-blood from the cheek to drain
 drench the eye and dry the vein
 maiden ere we farther go
 dost thou note me ay or no

minna replied in the same rhythmical manner which in jest and earnest
was frequently used by the ancient scandinavians 

 i mark thee my mother both word look and sign
 speak on with the riddle to read it be mine

now heaven and every saint be praised said magnus they are the
first words to the purpose which she hath spoken these many days

and they are the last which she shall speak for many a month said
norna incensed at the interruption if you again break the progress of
my spell turn your faces to the wall and look not hitherward again
under penalty of my severe displeasure you magnus troil from
hard-hearted audacity of spirit and you brenda from wanton and idle
disbelief in that which is beyond your bounded comprehension are
unworthy to look on this mystic work and the glance of your eyes
mingles with and weakens the spell for the powers cannot brook
distrust

unaccustomed to be addressed in a tone so peremptory magnus would have
made some angry reply but reflecting that the health of minna was at
stake and considering that she who spoke was a woman of many sorrows
he suppressed his anger bowed his head shrugged his shoulders assumed
the prescribed posture averting his head from the table and turning
towards the wall brenda did the same on receiving a sign from her
father and both remained profoundly silent

norna then addressed minna once more 

 mark me for the word i speak
 shall bring the colour to thy cheek
 this leaden heart so light of cost
 the symbol of a treasure lost
 thou shalt wear in hope and in peace
 that the cause of your sickness and sorrow may cease
 when crimson foot meets crimson hand
 in the martyrs aisle and in orkney-land

minna coloured deeply at the last couplet intimating as she failed not
to interpret it that norna was completely acquainted with the secret
cause of her sorrow the same conviction led the maiden to hope in the
favourable issue which the sibyl seemed to prophesy and not venturing
to express her feelings in any manner more intelligible she pressed
norna's withered hand with all the warmth of affection first to her
breast and then to her bosom bedewing it at the same time with her
tears

with more of human feeling than she usually exhibited norna extricated
her hand from the grasp of the poor girl whose tears now flowed freely
and then with more tenderness of manner than she had yet shown she
knotted the leaden heart to a chain of gold and hung it around minna's
neck singing as she performed that last branch of the spell 

 be patient be patient for patience hath power
 to ward us in danger like mantle in shower
 a fairy gift you best may hold
 in a chain of fairy gold
 the chain and the gift are each a true token
 that not without warrant old norna has spoken
 but thy nearest and dearest must never behold them
 till time shall accomplish the truths i have told them

the verses being concluded norna carefully arranged the chain around
her patient's neck so as to hide it in her bosom and thus ended the
spell a spell which at the moment i record these incidents it is
known has been lately practised in zetland where any decline of
health without apparent cause is imputed by the lower orders to a
demon having stolen the heart from the body of the patient and where
the experiment of supplying the deprivation by a leaden one prepared in
the manner described has been resorted to within these few years in a
metaphorical sense the disease may be considered as a general one in
all parts of the world but as this simple and original remedy is
peculiar to the isles of thule it were unpardonable not to preserve it
at length in a narrative connected with scottish antiquities

a second time norna reminded her patient that if she showed or spoke
of the fairy gifts their virtue would be lost a belief so common as
to be received into the superstitions of all nations lastly
unbuttoning the collar which she had just fastened she showed her a
link of the gold chain which minna instantly recognised as that
formerly given by norna to mordaunt mertoun this seemed to intimate he
was yet alive and under norna's protection and she gazed on her with
the most eager curiosity but the sibyl imposed her finger on her lips
in token of silence and a second time involved the chain in those folds
which modestly and closely veiled one of the most beautiful as well as
one of the kindest bosoms in the world

norna then extinguished the lighted charcoal and as the water hissed
upon the glowing embers commanded magnus and brenda to look around and
behold her task accomplished

 the macraws were followers of the mackenzies whose chief has the
name of caberfae or buckshead from the cognisance borne on his
standards unquestionably the worthy piper trained the seal on the same
principle of respect to the clan-term which i have heard has been taught
to dogs who unused to any other air dance after their fashion to the
tune of caberfae

 the spells described in this chapter are not altogether imaginary
by this mode of pouring lead into water and selecting the part which
chances to assume a resemblance to the human heart which must be worn
by the patient around her or his neck the sage persons of zetland
pretend to cure the fatal disorder called the loss of a heart




chapter ix

 see yonder woman whom our swains revere
 and dread in secret while they take her counsel
 when sweetheart shall be kind or when cross dame shall die
 where lurks the thief who stole the silver tankard
 and how the pestilent murrain may be cured 
 this sage adviser's mad stark mad my friend
 yet in her madness hath the art and cunning
 to wring fools secrets from their inmost bosoms
 and pay enquirers with the coin they gave her

 old play


it seemed as if norna had indeed full right to claim the gratitude of
the udaller for the improved condition of his daughter's health she
once more threw open the window and minna drying her eyes and
advancing with affectionate confidence threw herself on her father's
neck and asked his forgiveness for the trouble she had of late
occasioned to him it is unnecessary to add that this was at once
granted with a full though rough burst of parental tenderness and as
many close embraces as if his child had been just rescued from the jaws
of death when magnus had dismissed minna from his arms to throw
herself into those of her sister and express to her rather by kisses
and tears than in words the regret she entertained for her late wayward
conduct the udaller thought proper in the meantime to pay his thanks
to their hostess whose skill had proved so efficacious but scarce had
he come out with much respected kinswoman i am but a plain old
norseman when she interrupted him by pressing her finger on her
lips

there are those around us she said who must hear no mortal voice
witness no sacrifice to mortal feelings there are times when they
mutiny even against me their sovereign mistress because i am still
shrouded in the flesh of humanity fear therefore and be silent i
whose deeds have raised me from the low-sheltered valley of life where
dwell its social wants and common charities i who have bereft the
giver of the gift which he gave and stand alone on a cliff of
immeasurable height detached from earth save from the small portion
that supports my miserable tread i alone am fit to cope with those
sullen mates fear not therefore but yet be not too bold and let this
night to you be one of fasting and of prayer

if the udaller had not before the commencement of the operation been
disposed to dispute the commands of the sibyl it may be well believed
he was less so now that it had terminated to all appearance so
fortunately so he sat down in silence and seized upon a volume which
lay near him as a sort of desperate effort to divert ennui for on no
other occasion had magnus been known to have recourse to a book for that
purpose it chanced to be a book much to his mind being the well-known
work of olaus magnus upon the manners of the ancient northern nations
the book is unluckily in the latin language and the danske or dutch
were either of them much more familiar to the udaller but then it was
the fine edition published in which contains representations of
the war-chariots fishing exploits warlike exercises and domestic
employments of the scandinavians executed on copper-plates and thus
the information which the work refused to the understanding was
addressed to the eye which as is well known both to old and young
answers the purpose of amusement as well if not better

meanwhile the two sisters pressed as close to each other as two flowers
on the same stalk sat with their arms reciprocally passed over each
other's shoulder as if they feared some new and unforeseen cause of
coldness was about to separate them and interrupt the sister-like
harmony which had been but just restored norna sat opposite to them
sometimes revolving the large parchment volume with which they had found
her employed at their entrance and sometimes gazing on the sisters with
a fixed look in which an interest of a kind unusually tender seemed
occasionally to disturb the stern and rigorous solemnity of her
countenance all was still and silent as death and the subsiding
emotions of brenda had not yet permitted her to wonder whether the
remaining hours of the evening were to be passed in the same manner
when the scene of tranquillity was suddenly interrupted by the entrance
of the dwarf pacolet or as the udaller called him nicholas strumpfer

norna darted an angry glance on the intruder who seemed to deprecate
her resentment by holding up his hands and uttering a babbling sound
then instantly resorting to his usual mode of conversation he
expressed himself by a variety of signs made rapidly upon his fingers
and as rapidly answered by his mistress so that the young women who
had never heard of such an art and now saw it practised by two beings
so singular almost conceived their mutual intelligence the work of
enchantment when they had ceased their intercourse norna turned to
magnus troil with much haughtiness and said how my kinsman have you
so far forgot yourself as to bring earthly food into the house of the
reimkennar and make preparations in the dwelling of power and of
despair for refection and wassail and revelry speak not answer
not she said the duration of the cure which was wrought even now
depends on your silence and obedience bandy but a single look or word
with me and the latter condition of that maiden shall be worse than the
first

this threat was an effectual charm upon the tongue of the udaller
though he longed to indulge it in vindication of his conduct

follow me all of you said norna striding to the door of the
apartment and see that no one looks backwards we leave not this
apartment empty though we the children of mortality be removed from
it

she went out and the udaller signed to his daughters to follow and to
obey her injunctions the sibyl moved swifter than her guests down the
rude descent such it might rather be termed than a proper staircase
which led to the lower apartment magnus and his daughters when they
entered the chamber found their own attendants aghast at the presence
and proceedings of norna of the fitful-head

they had been previously employed in arranging the provisions which they
had brought along with them so as to present a comfortable cold meal
as soon as the appetite of the udaller which was as regular as the
return of tide should induce him to desire some refreshment and now
they stood staring in fear and surprise while norna seizing upon one
article after another and well supported by the zealous activity of
pacolet flung their whole preparations out of the rude aperture which
served for a window and over the cliff from which the ancient burgh
arose into the ocean which raged and foamed beneath vifda dried
beef hams and pickled pork flew after each other into empty space
smoked geese were restored to the air and cured fish to the sea their
native elements indeed but which they were no longer capable of
traversing and the devastation proceeded so rapidly that the udaller
could scarce secure from the wreck his silver drinking cup while the
large leathern flask of brandy which was destined to supply his
favourite beverage was sent to follow the rest of the supper by the
hands of pacolet who regarded at the same time the disappointed
udaller with a malicious grin as if notwithstanding his own natural
taste for the liquor he enjoyed the disappointment and surprise of
magnus troil still more than he would have relished sharing his
enjoyment

the destruction of the brandy flask exhausted the patience of magnus
who roared out in a tone of no small displeasure why kinswoman this
is wasteful madness where and on what would you have us sup

where you will answered norna and on what you will but not in my
dwelling and not on the food with which you have profaned it vex my
spirit no more but begone every one of you you have been here too long
for my good perhaps for your own

how kinswoman said magnus would you make outcasts of us at this
time of night when even a scotchman would not turn a stranger from the
door bethink you dame it is shame on our lineage for ever if this
squall of yours should force us to slip cables and go to sea so
scantily provided

be silent and depart said norna let it suffice you have got that
for which you came i have no harbourage for mortal guests no provision
to relieve human wants there is beneath the cliff a beach of the
finest sand a stream of water as pure as the well of kildinguie and
the rocks bear dulse as wholesome as that of guiodin and well you wot
that the well of kildinguie and the dulse of guiodin will cure all
maladies save black death

and well i wot said the udaller that i would eat corrupted
sea-weeds like a starling or salted seal's flesh like the men of
burraforth or wilks buckies and lampits like the poor sneaks of
stroma rather than break wheat bread and drink red wine in a house
where it is begrudged me and yet he said checking himself i am
wrong very wrong my cousin to speak thus to you and i should rather
thank you for what you have done than upbraid you for following your
own ways but i see you are impatient we will be all under way
presently and you ye knaves addressing his servants that were in
such hurry with your service before it was lacked get out of doors with
you presently and manage to catch the ponies for i see we must make
for another harbour to-night if we would not sleep with an empty
stomach and on a hard bed

the domestics of magnus already sufficiently alarmed at the violence of
norna's conduct scarce waited the imperious command of their master to
evacuate her dwelling with all dispatch and the udaller with a
daughter on each arm was in the act of following them when norna said
emphatically stop they obeyed and again turned towards her she
held out her hand to magnus which the placable udaller instantly folded
in his own ample palm

magnus she said we part by necessity but i trust not in anger

surely not cousin said the warm-hearted udaller wellnigh stammering
in his hasty disclamation of all unkindness most assuredly not i
never bear ill-will to any one much less to one of my own blood and
who has piloted me with her advice through many a rough tide as i would
pilot a boat betwixt swona and stroma through all the waws wells and
swelchies of the pentland frith

enough said norna and now farewell with such a blessing as i dare
bestow not a word more maidens she added draw near and let me
kiss your brows

the sibyl was obeyed by minna with awe and by brenda with fear the one
overmastered by the warmth of her imagination the other by the natural
timidity of her constitution norna then dismissed them and in two
minutes afterwards they found themselves beyond the bridge and standing
upon the rocky platform in front of the ancient pictish burgh which it
was the pleasure of this sequestered female to inhabit the night for
it was now fallen was unusually serene a bright twilight which
glimmered far over the surface of the sea supplied the brief absence of
the summer's sun and the waves seemed to sleep under its influence so
faint and slumberous was the sound with which one after another rolled
on and burst against the foot of the cliff on which they stood in front
of them stood the rugged fortress seeming in the uniform greyness of
the atmosphere as aged as shapeless and as massive as the rock on
which it was founded there was neither sight nor sound that indicated
human habitation save that from one rude shot-hole glimmered the flame
of the feeble lamp by which the sibyl was probably pursuing her mystical
and nocturnal studies shooting upon the twilight in which it was soon
lost and confounded a single line of tiny light bearing the same
proportion to that of the atmosphere as the aged woman and her serf
the sole inhabitants of that desert did to the solitude with which they
were surrounded

for several minutes the party thus suddenly and unexpectedly expelled
from the shelter where they had reckoned upon spending the night stood
in silence each wrapt in their own separate reflections minna her
thoughts fixed on the mystical consolation which she had received in
vain endeavoured to extract from the words of norna a more distinct and
intelligible meaning and the udaller had not yet recovered his surprise
at the extrusion to which he had been thus whimsically subjected under
circumstances that prohibited him from resenting as an insult
treatment which in all other respects was so shocking to the genial
hospitality of his nature that he still felt like one disposed to be
angry if he but knew how to set about it brenda was the first who
brought matters to a point by asking whither they were to go and how
they were to spend the night the question which was asked in a tone
that amidst its simplicity had something dolorous in it entirely
changed the train of her father's ideas and the unexpected perplexity
of their situation now striking him in a comic point of view he laughed
till his very eyes ran over while every rock around him rang and the
sleeping sea-fowl were startled from their repose by the loud hearty
explosions of his obstreperous hilarity

the udaller's daughters eagerly representing to their father the risk
of displeasing norna by this unlimited indulgence of his mirth united
their efforts to drag him to a farther distance from her dwelling
magnus yielding to their strength which feeble as it was his own fit
of laughter rendered him incapable of resisting suffered himself to be
pulled to a considerable distance from the burgh and then escaping from
their hands and sitting down or rather suffering himself to drop upon
a large stone which lay conveniently by the wayside he again laughed so
long and lustily that his vexed and anxious daughters became afraid
that there was something more than natural in these repeated
convulsions

at length his mirth exhausted both itself and the udaller's strength he
groaned heavily wiped his eyes and said not without feeling some
desire to renew his obstreperous cachinnation now by the bones of
saint magnus my ancestor and namesake one would imagine that being
turned out of doors at this time of night was nothing short of an
absolutely exquisite jest for i have shaken my sides at it till they
ache there we sat made snug for the night and i made as sure of a
good supper and a can as ever i had been of either and here we are all
taken aback and then poor brenda's doleful voice and melancholy
question of what is to be done and where are we to sleep in good
faith unless one of those knaves who must needs torment the poor woman
by their trencher-work before it was wanted can make amends by telling
us of some snug port under our lee we have no other course for it but
to steer through the twilight on the bearing of burgh-westra and rough
it out as well as we can by the way i am sorry but for you girls for
many a cruize have i been upon when we were on shorter allowance than we
are like to have now i would i had but secured a morsel for you and a
drop for myself and then there had been but little to complain of

both sisters hastened to assure the udaller that they felt not the least
occasion for food

why that is well said magnus and so being the case i will not
complain of my own appetite though it is sharper than convenient and
the rascal nicholas strumpfer what a leer the villain gave me as he
started the good nantz into the salt-water he grinned the knave like
a seal on a skerry had it not been for vexing my poor kinswoman norna
i would have sent his misbegotten body and misshapen jolterhead after
my bonny flask as sure as saint magnus lies at kirkwall

by this time the servants returned with the ponies which they had very
soon caught these sensible animals finding nothing so captivating in
the pastures where they had been suffered to stray as inclined them to
resist the invitation again to subject themselves to saddle and bridle
the prospects of the party were also considerably improved by learning
that the contents of their sumpter-pony's burden had not been entirely
exhausted a small basket having fortunately escaped the rage of norna
and pacolet by the rapidity with which one of the servants had caught
up and removed it the same domestic an alert and ready-witted fellow
had observed upon the beach not above three miles distant from the
burgh and about a quarter of a mile off their straight path a deserted
skio or fisherman's hut and suggested that they should occupy it for
the rest of the night in order that the ponies might be refreshed and
the young ladies spend the night under cover from the raw evening air

when we are delivered from great and serious dangers our mood is or
ought to be grave in proportion to the peril we have escaped and the
gratitude due to protecting providence but few things raise the spirits
more naturally or more harmlessly than when means of extrication from
any of the lesser embarrassments of life are suddenly presented to us
and such was the case in the present instance the udaller relieved
from the apprehensions for his daughters suffering from fatigue and
himself from too much appetite and too little food carolled norse
ditties as he spurred bergen through the twilight with as much glee
and gallantry as if the night-ride had been entirely a matter of his own
free choice brenda lent her voice to some of his choruses which were
echoed in ruder notes by the servants who in that simple state of
society were not considered as guilty of any breach of respect by
mingling their voices with the song minna indeed was as yet unequal
to such an effort but she compelled herself to assume some share in the
general hilarity of the meeting and contrary to her conduct since the
fatal morning which concluded the festival of saint john she seemed to
take her usual interest in what was going on around her and answered
with kindness and readiness the repeated enquiries concerning her
health with which the udaller every now and then interrupted his carol
and thus they proceeded by night a happier party by far than they had
been when they traced the same route on the preceding morning making
light of the difficulties of the way and promising themselves shelter
and a comfortable night's rest in the deserted hut which they were now
about to approach and which they expected to find in a state of
darkness and solitude

but it was the lot of the udaller that day to be deceived more than once
in his calculations

and which way lies this cabin of yours laurie said the udaller
addressing the intelligent domestic of whom we just spoke

yonder it should be said laurence scholey at the head of the
voe but by my faith if it be the place there are folk there before
us god and saint ronan send that they be canny company

in truth there was a light in the deserted hut strong enough to glimmer
through every chink of the shingles and wreck-wood of which it was
constructed and to give the whole cabin the appearance of a smithy seen
by night the universal superstition of the zetlanders seized upon
magnus and his escort

they are trows said one voice

they are witches murmured another

they are mermaids muttered a third only hear their wild singing

all stopped and in effect some notes of music were audible which
brenda with a voice that quivered a little but yet had a turn of arch
ridicule in its tone pronounced to be the sound of a fiddle

fiddle or fiend said the udaller who if he believed in such nightly
apparitions as had struck terror into his retinue certainly feared them
not fiddle or fiend may the devil fetch me if a witch cheats me out
of supper to-night for the second time

so saying he dismounted clenched his trusty truncheon in his hand and
advanced towards the hut followed by laurence alone the rest of his
retinue continuing stationary on the beach beside his daughters and the
ponies

 so at least says an orkney proverb




chapter x

 what ho my jovial mates come on we'll frolic it
 like fairies frisking in the merry moonshine
 seen by the curtal friar who from some christening
 or some blithe bridal hies belated cell-ward 
 he starts and changes his bold bottle swagger
 to churchman's pace professional and ransacking
 his treacherous memory for some holy hymn
 finds but the roundel of the midnight catch

 old play


the stride of the udaller relaxed nothing of its length or of its
firmness as he approached the glimmering cabin from which he now heard
distinctly the sound of the fiddle but if still long and firm his
steps succeeded each other rather more slowly than usual for like a
cautious though a brave general magnus was willing to reconnoitre his
enemy before assailing him the trusty laurence scholey who kept close
behind his master now whispered into his ear so help me sir as i
believe that the ghaist if ghaist it be that plays so bravely on the
fiddle must be the ghaist of maister claud halcro or his wraith at
least for never was bow drawn across thairm which brought out the gude
auld spring of fair and lucky so like his ain

magnus was himself much of the same opinion for he knew the blithe
minstrelsy of the spirited little old man and hailed the hut with a
hearty hilloah which was immediately replied to by the cheery note of
his ancient messmate and halcro himself presently made his appearance
on the beach

the udaller now signed to his retinue to come up while he asked his
friend after a kind greeting and much shaking of hands how the devil
he came to sit there playing old tunes in so desolate a place like an
owl whooping to the moon

and tell me rather fowd said claud halcro how you came to be
within hearing of me ay by my word and with your bonny daughters
too jarto minna and jarto brenda i bid you welcome to these yellow
sands and there shake hands as glorious john or some other body
says upon the same occasion and how came you here like two fair swans
making day out of twilight and turning all you step upon to silver

you shall know all about them presently answered magnus but what
messmates have you got in the hut with you i think i hear some one
speaking

none replied claud halcro but that poor creature the factor and
my imp of a boy giles i but come in come in here you will find us
starving in comfort not so much as a mouthful of sour sillocks to be
had for love or money

that may be in a small part helped said the udaller for though the
best of our supper is gone over the fitful crags to the sealchies and
the dog-fish yet we have got something in the kit still here laurie
bring up the vifda

jokul jokul was laurence's joyful answer and he hastened for
the basket

by the bicker of saint magnus said halcro and the burliest
bishop that ever quaffed it for luck's sake there is no finding your
locker empty magnus i believe sincerely that ere a friend wanted you
could like old luggie the warlock fish up boiled and roasted out of
the pool of kibster

you are wrong there jarto claud said magnus troil for far from
helping me to a supper the foul fiend i believe has carried off great
part of mine this blessed evening but you are welcome to share and
share of what is left this was said while the party entered the hut

here in a cabin which smelled strongly of dried fish and whose sides
and roof were jet-black with smoke they found the unhappy triptolemus
yellowley seated beside a fire made of dried sea-weed mingled with some
peats and wreck-wood his sole companion a barefooted yellow-haired
zetland boy who acted occasionally as a kind of page to claud halcro
bearing his fiddle on his shoulder saddling his pony and rendering him
similar duties of kindly observance the disconsolate agriculturist for
such his visage betokened him displayed little surprise and less
animation at the arrival of the udaller and his companions until
after the party had drawn close to the fire a neighbourhood which the
dampness of the night air rendered far from disagreeable the pannier
was opened and a tolerable supply of barley-bread and hung beef
besides a flask of brandy no doubt smaller than that which the
relentless hand of pacolet had emptied into the ocean gave assurances
of a tolerable supper then indeed the worthy factor grinned
chuckled rubbed his hands and enquired after all friends at
burgh-westra

when they had all partaken of this needful refreshment the udaller
repeated his enquiries of halcro and more particularly of the factor
how they came to be nestled in such a remote corner at such an hour of
night

maister magnus troil said triptolemus when a second cup had given
him spirits to tell his tale of woe i would not have you think that it
is a little thing that disturbs me i came of that grain that takes a
sair wind to shake it i have seen many a martinmas and many a
whitsunday in my day whilk are the times peculiarly grievous to those
of my craft and i could aye bide the bang but i think i am like to be
dung ower a'thegither in this damned country of yours gude forgie me
for swearing but evil communication corrupteth good manners

now heaven guide us said the udaller what is the matter with the
man why man if you will put your plough into new land you must look
to have it hank on a stone now and then you must set us an example of
patience seeing you come here for our improvement

and the deil was in my feet when i did so said the factor i had
better have set myself to improve the cairn on clochnaben

but what is it after all said the udaller that has befallen
you what is it that you complain of

of every thing that has chanced to me since i landed on this island
which i believe was accursed at the very creation said the
agriculturist and assigned as a fitting station for sorners thieves
whores i beg the ladies pardon witches bitches and all evil
spirits

by my faith a goodly catalogue said magnus and there has been the
day that if i had heard you give out the half of it i should have
turned improver myself and have tried to amend your manners with a
cudgel

bear with me said the factor maister fowd or maister udaller or
whatever else they may call you and as you are strong be pitiful and
consider the luckless lot of any inexperienced person who lights upon
this earthly paradise of yours he asks for drink they bring him sour
whey no disparagement to your brandy fowd which is excellent you ask
for meat and they bring you sour sillocks that satan might choke
upon you call your labourers together and bid them work it proves
saint magnus's day or saint ronan's day or some infernal saint or
other's or else perhaps they have come out of bed with the wrong foot
foremost or they have seen an owl or a rabbit has crossed their path
or they have dreamed of a roasted horse in short nothing is to be
done give them a spade and they work as if it burned their fingers
but set them to dancing and see when they will tire of funking and
flinging

and why should they poor bodies said claud halcro as long as there
are good fiddlers to play to them

ay ay said triptolemus shaking his head you are a proper person
to uphold them in such a humour well to proceed i till a piece of
my best ground down comes a sturdy beggar that wants a kailyard or a
plant-a-cruive as you call it and he claps down an enclosure in the
middle of my bit shot of corn as lightly as if he was baith laird and
tenant and gainsay him wha likes there he dibbles in his kail-plants
i sit down to my sorrowful dinner thinking to have peace and quietness
there at least when in comes one two three four or half-a-dozen of
skelping long lads from some foolery or anither misca me for barring
my ain door against them and eat up the best half of what my sister's
providence and she is not over bountiful has allotted for my dinner
then enters a witch with an ellwand in her hand and she raises the
wind or lays it whichever she likes majors up and down my house as if
she was mistress of it and i am bounden to thank heaven if she carries
not the broadside of it away with her

still said the fowd this is no answer to my question how the foul
fiend i come to find you at moorings here

have patience worthy sir replied the afflicted factor and listen
to what i have to say for i fancy it will be as well to tell you the
whole matter you must know i once thought that i had gotten a small
godsend that might have made all these matters easier

how a godsend do you mean a wreck master factor exclaimed magnus
shame upon you that should have set example to others

it was no wreck said the factor but if you must needs know it
chanced that as i raised an hearthstane in one of the old chambers at
stourburgh for my sister is minded that there is little use in mair
fire-places about a house than one and i wanted the stane to knock bear
upon when what should i light on but a horn full of old coins silver
the maist feck of them but wi a bit sprinkling of gold amang them
too weel i thought this was a dainty windfa and so thought baby
and we were the mair willing to put up with a place where there were
siccan braw nest-eggs and we slade down the stane cannily over the
horn which seemed to me to be the very cornucopia or horn of
abundance and for further security baby wad visit the room maybe
twenty times in the day and mysell at an orra time to the boot of a
that

on my word and a very pretty amusement said claud halcro to look
over a horn of one's own siller i question if glorious john dryden ever
enjoyed such a pastime in his life i am very sure i never did

yes but you forget jarto claud said the udaller that the factor
was only counting over the money for my lord the chamberlain as he is
so keen for his lordship's rights in whales and wrecks he would not
surely forget him in treasure-trove

a-hem a-hem a-he he hem ejaculated triptolemus seized at the
moment with an awkward fit of coughing no doubt my lord's right in
the matter would have been considered being in the hand of one though
i say it as just as can be found in angus-shire let alone the mearns
but mark what happened of late one day as i went up to see that all
was safe and snug and just to count out the share that should have been
his lordship's for surely the labourer as one may call the finder is
worthy of his hire nay some learned men say that when the finder in
point of trust and in point of power representeth the dominus or
lord superior he taketh the whole but let that pass as a kittle
question in apicibus juris as we wont to say at saint andrews well
sir and ladies when i went to the upper chamber what should i see but
an ugsome ill-shaped and most uncouth dwarf that wanted but hoofs and
horns to have made an utter devil of him counting over the very hornful
of siller i am no timorous man master fowd but judging that i should
proceed with caution in such a matter for i had reason to believe that
there was devilry in it i accosted him in latin whilk it is maist
becoming to speak to aught whilk taketh upon it as a goblin and
conjured him in nomine and so forth with such words as my poor
learning could furnish of a suddenty whilk to say truth were not so
many nor altogether so purely latineezed as might have been had i not
been few years at college and many at the pleugh well sirs he
started at first as one that heareth that which he expects not but
presently recovering himself he wawls on me with his grey een like a
wild-cat and opens his mouth whilk resembled the mouth of an oven for
the deil a tongue he had in it that i could spy and took upon his ugly
self altogether the air and bearing of a bull-dog whilk i have seen
loosed at a fair upon a mad staig whereupon i was something
daunted and withdrew myself to call upon sister baby who fears neither
dog nor devil when there is in question the little penny siller and
truly she raise to the fray as i hae seen the lindsays and ogilvies
bristle up when donald macdonnoch or the like made a start down frae
the highlands on the braes of islay but an auld useless carline called
tronda dronsdaughter they might call her drone the sell of her
without farther addition flung herself right in my sister's gate and
yelloched and skirled that you would have thought her a whole
generation of hounds whereupon i judged it best to make ae yoking of
it and stop the pleugh until i got my sister's assistance whilk when i
had done and we mounted the stair to the apartment in which the said
dwarf devil or other apparition was to be seen dwarf horn and
siller were as clean gane as if the cat had lickit the place where i
saw them

here triptolemus paused in his extraordinary narration while the rest
of the party looked upon each other in surprise and the udaller
muttered to claud halcro by all tokens this must have been either the
devil or nicholas strumpfer and if it were him he is more of a goblin
than e'er i gave him credit for and shall be apt to rate him as such in
future then addressing the factor he enquired saw ye nought how
this dwarf of yours parted company

as i shall answer it no replied triptolemus with a cautious look
around him as if daunted by the recollection neither i nor baby who
had her wits more about her not having seen this unseemly vision could
perceive any way by whilk he made evasion only tronda said she saw him
flee forth of the window of the west roundel of the auld house upon a
dragon as she averred but as the dragon is held a fabulous animal i
suld pronounce her averment to rest upon deceptio visus

but may we not ask farther said brenda stimulated by curiosity to
know as much of her cousin norna's family as was possible how all this
operated upon master yellowley so as to occasion his being in this
place at so unseasonable an hour

seasonable it must be mistress brenda since it brought us into your
sweet company answered claud halcro whose mercurial brain far
outstripped the slow conceptions of the agriculturist and who became
impatient of being so long silent to say the truth it was i mistress
brenda who recommended to our friend the factor whose house i chanced
to call at just after this mischance and where by the way owing
doubtless to the hurry of their spirits i was but poorly received to
make a visit to our other friend at fitful-head well judging from
certain points of the story at which my other and more particular
friend than either looking at magnus may chance to form a guess
that they who break a head are the best to find a plaster and as our
friend the factor scrupled travelling on horseback in respect of some
tumbles from our ponies  

which are incarnate devils said triptolemus aloud muttering under
his breath like every live thing that i have found in zetland

well fowd continued halcro i undertook to carry him to fitful-head
in my little boat which giles and i can manage as if it were an
admiral's barge full manned and master triptolemus yellowley will tell
you how seaman-like i piloted him to the little haven within a quarter
of a mile of norna's dwelling

i wish to heaven you had brought me as safe back again said the
factor

why to be sure replied the minstrel i am as glorious john says 

 a daring pilot in extremity
 pleased with the danger when the waves go high
 i seek the storm but for a calm unfit
 will steer too near the sands to show my wit

i showed little wit in intrusting myself to your charge said
triptolemus and you still less when you upset the boat at the throat
of the voe as you call it when even the poor bairn that was mair than
half drowned told you that you were carrying too much sail and then ye
wad fasten the rape to the bit stick on the boat-side that ye might
have time to play on the fiddle

what said the udaller make fast the sheets to the thwart a most
unseasonable practice claud halcro

and sae came of it replied the agriculturist for the neist blast
and we are never lang without ane in these parts whomled us as a
gudewife would whomle a bowie and ne'er a thing wad maister halcro save
but his fiddle the puir bairn swam out like a water-spaniel and i
swattered hard for my life wi the help of ane of the oars and here we
are comfortless creatures that till a good wind blew you here had
naething to eat but a mouthful of norway rusk that has mair sawdust
than rye-meal in it and tastes liker turpentine than any thing else

i thought we heard you very merry said brenda as we came along the
beach

ye heard a fiddle mistress brenda said the factor and maybe ye may
think there can be nae dearth miss where that is skirling but then
it was maister claud halcro's fiddle whilk i am apt to think wad
skirl at his father's deathbed or at his ain sae lang as his fingers
could pinch the thairm and it was nae sma aggravation to my misfortune
to have him bumming a sorts of springs norse and scots highland and
lawland english and italian in my lug as if nothing had happened that
was amiss and we all in such stress and perplexity

why i told you sorrow would never right the boat factor said the
thoughtless minstrel and i did my best to make you merry if i failed
it was neither my fault nor my fiddle's i have drawn the bow across it
before glorious john dryden himself

i will hear no stories about glorious john dryden answered the
udaller who dreaded halcro's narratives as much as triptolemus did his
music i will hear nought of him but one story to every three bowls
of punch it is our old paction you know but tell me instead what
said norna to you about your errand

ay there was anither fine upshot said master yellowley she wadna
look at us or listen to us only she bothered our acquaintance master
halcro here who thought he could have sae much to say wi her with
about a score of questions about your family and household estate
master magnus troil and when she had gotten a she wanted out of him i
thought she wad hae dung him ower the craig like an empty peacod

and for yourself said the udaller

she wadna listen to my story nor hear sae much as a word that i had to
say answered triptolemus and sae much for them that seek to witches
and familiar spirits

you needed not to have had recourse to norna's wisdom master factor
said minna not unwilling perhaps to stop his railing against the
friend who had so lately rendered her service the youngest child in
orkney could have told you that fairy treasures if they are not wisely
employed for the good of others as well as of those to whom they are
imparted do not dwell long with their possessors

your humble servant to command mistress minnie said triptolemus i
thank ye for the hint and i am blithe that you have gotten your
wits i beg pardon i meant your health into the barn-yard again for
the treasure i neither used nor abused it they that live in the house
with my sister baby wad find it hard to do either and as for speaking
of it whilk they say muckle offends them whom we in scotland call good
neighbours and you call drows the face of the auld norse kings on the
coins themselves might have spoken as much about it as ever i did

the factor said claud halcro not unwilling to seize the opportunity
of revenging himself on triptolemus for disgracing his seamanship and
disparaging his music the factor was so scrupulous as to keep the
thing quiet even from his master the lord chamberlain but now that
the matter has ta'en wind he is likely to have to account to his master
for that which is no longer in his possession for the lord chamberlain
will be in no hurry i think to believe the story of the dwarf neither
do i think winking to the udaller that norna gave credit to a word
of so odd a story and i dare say that was the reason that she received
us i must needs say in a very dry manner i rather think she knew that
triptolemus our friend here had found some other hiding-hole for the
money and that the story of the goblin was all his own invention for
my part i will never believe there was such a dwarf to be seen as the
creature master yellowley describes until i set my own eyes on him

then you may do so at this moment said the factor for by   
he muttered a deep asseveration as he sprung on his feet in great
horror there the creature is

all turned their eyes in the direction in which he pointed and saw the
hideous misshapen figure of pacolet with his eyes fixed and glaring at
them through the smoke he had stolen upon their conversation
unperceived until the factor's eye lighted upon him in the manner we
have described there was something so ghastly in his sudden and
unexpected appearance that even the udaller to whom his form was
familiar could not help starting neither pleased with himself for
having testified this degree of emotion however slight nor with the
dwarf who had given cause to it magnus asked him sharply what was his
business there pacolet replied by producing a letter which he gave to
the udaller uttering a sound resembling the word shogh

that is the highlandman's language said the udaller didst thou
learn that nicholas when you lost your own

pacolet nodded and signed to him to read his letter

that is no such easy matter by fire-light my good friend replied the
udaller but it may concern minna and we must try

brenda offered her assistance but the udaller answered no no my
girl norna's letters must be read by those they are written to give
the knave strumpfer a drop of brandy the while though he little
deserves it at my hands considering the grin with which he sent the
good nantz down the crag this morning as if it had been as much
ditch-water

will you be this honest gentleman's cup-bearer his ganymede friend
yellowley or shall i said claud halcro aside to the factor while
magnus troil having carefully wiped his spectacles which he produced
from a large copper case had disposed them on his nose and was
studying the epistle of norna

i would not touch him or go near him for all the carse of gowrie
said the factor whose fears were by no means entirely removed though
he saw that the dwarf was received as a creature of flesh and blood by
the rest of the company but i pray you to ask him what he has done
with my horn of coins

the dwarf who heard the question threw back his head and displayed
his enormous throat pointing to it with his finger

nay if he has swallowed them there is no more to be said replied
the factor only i hope he will thrive on them as a cow on wet clover
he is dame norna's servant it's like such man such mistress but if
theft and witchcraft are to go unpunished in this land my lord must
find another factor for i have been used to live in a country where
men's worldly gear was keepit from infang and outfang thief as well as
their immortal souls from the claws of the deil and his cummers sain
and save us

the agriculturist was perhaps the less reserved in expressing his
complaints that the udaller was for the present out of hearing having
drawn claud halcro apart into another corner of the hut

and tell me said he friend halcro what errand took thee to
sumburgh since i reckon it was scarce the mere pleasure of sailing in
partnership with yonder barnacle

in faith fowd said the bard and if you will have the truth i went
to speak to norna on your affairs

on my affairs replied the udaller on what affairs of mine

just touching your daughter's health i heard that norna refused your
message and would not see eric scambester now said i to myself i
have scarce joyed in meat or drink or music or aught else since
jarto minna has been so ill and i may say literally as well as
figuratively that my day and night have been made sorrowful to me in
short i thought i might have some more interest with old norna than
another as scalds and wise women were always accounted something akin
and i undertook the journey with the hope to be of some use to my old
friend and his lovely daughter

and it was most kindly done of you good warm-hearted claud said the
udaller shaking him warmly by the hand i ever said you showed the
good old norse heart amongst all thy fiddling and thy folly tut man
never wince for the matter but be blithe that thy heart is better than
thy head well and i warrant you got no answer from norna

none to purpose replied claud halcro but she held me close to
question about minna's illness too and i told her how i had met her
abroad the other morning in no very good weather and how her sister
brenda said she had hurt her foot in short i told her all and every
thing i knew

and something more besides it would seem said the udaller for i
at least never heard before that minna had hurt herself

o a scratch a mere scratch said the old man but i was startled
about it terrified lest it had been the bite of a dog or some hurt
from a venomous thing i told all to norna however

and what answered the udaller did she say in the way of reply

she bade me begone about my business and told me that the issue would
be known at the kirkwall fair and said just the like to this noodle of
a factor it was all that either of us got for our labour said halcro

that is strange said magnus my kinswoman writes me in this letter
not to fail going thither with my daughters this fair runs strongly in
her head one would think she intended to lead the market and yet she
has nothing to buy or to sell there that i know of and so you came away
as wise as you went and swamped your boat at the mouth of the voe

why how could i help it said the poet i had set the boy to steer
and as the flaw came suddenly off shore i could not let go the
tack and play on the fiddle at the same time but it is all well
enough salt-water never harmed zetlander so as he could get out of
it and as heaven would have it we were within man's depth of the
shore and chancing to find this skio we should have done well enough
with shelter and fire and are much better than well with your good
cheer and good company but it wears late and night and day must be
both as sleepy as old midnight can make them there is an inner crib
here where the fishers slept somewhat fragrant with the smell of
their fish but that is wholesome they shall bestow themselves there
with the help of what cloaks you have and then we will have one cup of
brandy and one stave of glorious john or some little trifle of my own
and so sleep as sound as cobblers

two glasses of brandy if you please said the udaller if our stores
do not run dry but not a single stave of glorious john or of any one
else to-night

and this being arranged and executed agreeably to the peremptory
pleasure of the udaller the whole party consigned themselves to slumber
for the night and on the next day departed for their several
habitations claud halcro having previously arranged with the udaller
that he would accompany him and his daughters on their proposed visit to
kirkwall

 henry iv part d


we must now change the scene from zetland to orkney and request our
readers to accompany us to the ruins of an elegant though ancient
structure called the earl's palace these remains though much
dilapidated still exist in the neighbourhood of the massive and
venerable pile which norwegian devotion dedicated to saint magnus the
martyr and being contiguous to the bishop's palace which is also
ruinous the place is impressive as exhibiting vestiges of the
mutations both in church and state which have affected orkney as well
as countries more exposed to such convulsions several parts of these
ruinous buildings might be selected under suitable modifications as
the model of a gothic mansion provided architects would be contented
rather to imitate what is really beautiful in that species of building
than to make a medley of the caprices of the order confounding the
military ecclesiastical and domestic styles of all ages at random
with additional fantasies and combinations of their own device all
formed out of the builder's brain

the earl's palace forms three sides of an oblong square and has even
in its ruins the air of an elegant yet massive structure uniting as
was usual in the residence of feudal princes the character of a palace
and of a castle a great banqueting-hall communicating with several
large rounds or projecting turret-rooms and having at either end an
immense chimney testifies the ancient northern hospitality of the earls
of orkney and communicates almost in the modern fashion with a
gallery or withdrawing-room of corresponding dimensions and having
like the hall its projecting turrets the lordly hall itself is lighted
by a fine gothic window of shafted stone at one end and is entered by a
spacious and elegant staircase consisting of three flights of stone
steps the exterior ornaments and proportions of the ancient building
are also very handsome but being totally unprotected this remnant of
the pomp and grandeur of earls who assumed the license as well as the
dignity of petty sovereigns is now fast crumbling to decay and has
suffered considerably since the date of our story

with folded arms and downcast looks the pirate cleveland was pacing
slowly the ruined hall which we have just described a place of
retirement which he had probably chosen because it was distant from
public resort his dress was considerably altered from that which he
usually wore in zetland and seemed a sort of uniform richly laced and
exhibiting no small quantity of embroidery a hat with a plume and a
small sword very handsomely mounted then the constant companion of
every one who assumed the rank of a gentleman showed his pretensions to
that character but if his exterior was so far improved it seemed to be
otherwise with his health and spirits he was pale and had lost both
the fire of his eye and the vivacity of his step and his whole
appearance indicated melancholy of mind or suffering of body or a
combination of both evils

as cleveland thus paced these ancient ruins a young man of a light and
slender form whose showy dress seemed to have been studied with care
yet exhibited more extravagance than judgment or taste whose manner was
a janty affectation of the free and easy rake of the period and the
expression of whose countenance was lively with a cast of effrontery
tripped up the staircase entered the hall and presented himself to
cleveland who merely nodded to him and pulling his hat deeper over his
brows resumed his solitary and discontented promenade

the stranger adjusted his own hat nodded in return took snuff with
the air of a petit maitre from a richly chased gold box offered it
to cleveland as he passed and being repulsed rather coldly replaced
the box in his pocket folded his arms in his turn and stood looking
with fixed attention on his motions whose solitude he had interrupted
at length cleveland stopped short as if impatient of being longer the
subject of his observation and said abruptly why can i not be left
alone for half an hour and what the devil is it that you want

i am glad you spoke first answered the stranger carelessly i was
determined to know whether you were clement cleveland or cleveland's
ghost and they say ghosts never take the first word so i now set it
down for yourself in life and limb and here is a fine old hurly-house
you have found out for an owl to hide himself in at mid-day or a ghost
to revisit the pale glimpses of the moon as the divine shakspeare
says

well well answered cleveland abruptly your jest is made and now
let us have your earnest

in earnest then captain cleveland replied his companion i think
you know me for your friend

i am content to suppose so said cleveland

it is more than supposition replied the young man i have proved
it proved it both here and elsewhere

well well answered cleveland i admit you have been always a
friendly fellow and what then

well well and what then replied the other this is but a brief way
of thanking folk look you captain here is benson barlowe dick
fletcher and a few others of us who wished you well have kept your old
comrade captain goffe in these seas upon the look-out for you when he
and hawkins and the greater part of the ship's company would fain have
been down on the spanish main and at the old trade

and i wish to god that you had all gone about your business said
cleveland and left me to my fate

which would have been to be informed against and hanged captain the
first time that any of these dutch or english rascals whom you have
lightened of their cargoes came to set their eyes upon you and no
place more likely to meet with seafaring men than in these islands and
here to screen you from such a risk we have been wasting our precious
time till folk are grown very peery and when we have no more goods or
money to spend amongst them the fellows will be for grabbing the ship

well then why do you not sail off without me said cleveland there
has been fair partition and all have had their share let all do as
they like i have lost my ship and having been once a captain i will
not go to sea under command of goffe or any other man besides you know
well enough that both hawkins and he bear me ill-will for keeping them
from sinking the spanish brig with the poor devils of negroes on
board

why what the foul fiend is the matter with thee said his companion
are you clement cleveland our own old true-hearted clem of the cleugh
and do you talk of being afraid of hawkins and goffe and a score of
such fellows when you have myself and barlowe and dick fletcher at
your back when was it we deserted you either in council or in fight
that you should be afraid of our flinching now and as for serving under
goffe i hope it is no new thing for gentlemen of fortune who are going
on the account to change a captain now and then let us alone for
that captain you shall be for death rock me asleep if i serve under
that fellow goffe who is as very a bloodhound as ever sucked
bitch no no i thank you my captain must have a little of the
gentleman about him howsoever besides you know it was you who first
dipped my hands in the dirty water and turned me from a stroller by
land to a rover by sea

alas poor bunce said cleveland you owe me little thanks for that
service

that is as you take it replied bunce for my part i see no harm in
levying contributions on the public either one way or t'other but i
wish you would forget that name of bunce and call me altamont as i
have often desired you to do i hope a gentleman of the roving trade has
as good a right to have an alias as a stroller and i never stepped on
the boards but what i was altamont at the least

well then jack altamont replied cleveland since altamont is the
word  

yes but captain jack is not the word though altamont be so jack
altamont why tis a velvet coat with paper lace let it be frederick
captain frederick altamont is all of a piece

frederick be it then with all my heart said cleveland and pray
tell me which of your names will sound best at the head of the last
speech confession and dying words of john bunce alias frederick
altamont who was this morning hanged at execution-dock for the crime
of piracy upon the high seas

faith i cannot answer that question without another can of grog
captain so if you will go down with me to bet haldane's on the quay i
will bestow some thought on the matter with the help of a right pipe of
trinidado we will have the gallon bowl filled with the best stuff you
ever tasted and i know some smart wenches who will help us to drain it
but you shake your head you're not i the vein well then i will
stay with you for by this hand clem you shift me not off only i will
ferret you out of this burrow of old stones and carry you into sunshine
and fair air where shall we go

where you will said cleveland so that you keep out of the way of
our own rascals and all others

why then replied bunce you and i will go up to the hill of
whitford which overlooks the town and walk together as gravely and
honestly as a pair of well-employed attorneys

as they proceeded to leave the ruinous castle bunce turning back to
look at it thus addressed his companion

hark ye captain dost thou know who last inhabited this old cockloft

an earl of the orkneys they say replied cleveland

and are you avised what death he died of said bunce for i have
heard that it was of a tight neck-collar a hempen fever or the like

the people here do say replied cleveland that his lordship some
hundred years ago had the mishap to become acquainted with the nature
of a loop and a leap in the air

why la ye there now said bunce there was some credit in being
hanged in those days and in such worshipful company and what might his
lordship have done to deserve such promotion

plundered the liege subjects they say replied cleveland slain and
wounded them fired upon his majesty's flag and so forth

near akin to a gentleman rover then said bunce making a theatrical
bow towards the old building and therefore my most potent grave
and reverend signior earl i crave leave to call you my loving cousin
and bid you most heartily adieu i leave you in the good company of rats
and mice and so forth and i carry with me an honest gentleman who
having of late had no more heart than a mouse is now desirous to run
away from his profession and friends like a rat and would therefore be
a most fitting denizen of your earlship's palace

i would advise you not to speak so loud my good friend frederick
altamont or john bunce said cleveland when you were on the stage
you might safely rant as loud as you listed but in your present
profession of which you are so fond every man speaks under correction
of the yard-arm and a running noose

the comrades left the little town of kirkwall in silence and ascended
the hill of whitford which raises its brow of dark heath uninterrupted
by enclosures or cultivation of any kind to the northward of the
ancient burgh of saint magnus the plain at the foot of the hill was
already occupied by numbers of persons who were engaged in making
preparations for the fair of saint olla to be held upon the ensuing
day and which forms a general rendezvous to all the neighbouring
islands of orkney and is even frequented by many persons from the more
distant archipelago of zetland it is in the words of the proclamation
a free mercat and fair holden at the good burgh of kirkwall on the
third of august being saint olla's day and continuing for an
indefinite space thereafter extending from three days to a week and
upwards the fair is of great antiquity and derives its name from
olaus olave ollaw the celebrated monarch of norway who rather by
the edge of his sword than any milder argument introduced christianity
into those isles and was respected as the patron of kirkwall some time
before he shared that honour with saint magnus the martyr

it was no part of cleveland's purpose to mingle in the busy scene which
was here going on and turning their route to the left they soon
ascended into undisturbed solitude save where the grouse more
plentiful in orkney perhaps than in any other part of the british
dominions rose in covey and went off before them having continued
to ascend till they had wellnigh reached the summit of the conical
hill both turned round as with one consent to look at and admire the
prospect beneath

the lively bustle which extended between the foot of the hill and the
town gave life and variety to that part of the scene then was seen the
town itself out of which arose like a great mass superior in
proportion as it seemed to the whole burgh the ancient cathedral of
saint magnus of the heaviest order of gothic architecture but grand
solemn and stately the work of a distant age and of a powerful hand
the quay with the shipping lent additional vivacity to the scene and
not only the whole beautiful bay which lies betwixt the promontories of
inganess and quanterness at the bottom of which kirkwall is situated
but all the sea so far as visible and in particular the whole strait
betwixt the island of shapinsha and that called pomona or the mainland
was covered and enlivened by a variety of boats and small vessels
freighted from distant islands to convey passengers or merchandise to
the fair of saint olla

having attained the point by which this fair and busy prospect was most
completely commanded each of the strangers in seaman fashion had
recourse to his spy-glass to assist the naked eye in considering the
bay of kirkwall and the numerous vessels by which it was traversed but
the attention of the two companions seemed to be arrested by different
objects that of bunce or altamont as he chose to call himself was
riveted to the armed sloop where conspicuous by her square rigging and
length of beam with the english jack and pennon which they had the
precaution to keep flying she lay among the merchant vessels as
distinguished from them by the trim neatness of her appearance as a
trained soldier amongst a crowd of clowns

yonder she lies said bunce i wish to god she was in the bay of
honduras you captain on the quarter-deck i your lieutenant and
fletcher quarter-master and fifty stout fellows under us i should not
wish to see these blasted heaths and rocks again for a while and
captain you shall soon be the old brute goffe gets drunk as a lord
every day swaggers and shoots and cuts among the crew and besides
he has quarrelled with the people here so damnably that they will
scarce let water or provisions go on board of us and we expect an open
breach every day

as bunce received no answer he turned short round on his companion
and perceiving his attention otherwise engaged exclaimed what the
devil is the matter with you or what can you see in all that trumpery
small-craft which is only loaded with stock-fish and ling and smoked
geese and tubs of butter that is worse than tallow the cargoes of the
whole lumped together would not be worth the flash of a pistol no no
give me such a chase as we might see from the mast-head off the island
of trinidado your don rolling as deep in the water as a grampus
deep-loaden with rum sugar and bales of tobacco and all the rest
ingots moidores and gold dust then set all sail clear the deck
stand to quarters up with the jolly roger we near her we make
her out to be well manned and armed  

twenty guns on her lower deck said cleveland

forty if you will retorted bunce and we have but ten
mounted never mind the don blazes away never mind yet my brave
lads run her alongside and on board with you to work with your
grenadoes your cutlasses pole-axes and pistols the don cries
misericordia and we share the cargo without co licencio seignior

by my faith said cleveland thou takest so kindly to the trade that
all the world may see that no honest man was spoiled when you were made
a pirate but you shall not prevail on me to go farther in the devil's
road with you for you know yourself that what is got over his back is
spent you wot how in a week or a month at most the rum and the sugar
are out the bales of tobacco have become smoke the moidores ingots
and gold dust have got out of our hands into those of the quiet
honest conscientious folks who dwell at port royal and elsewhere wink
hard on our trade as long as we have money but not a jot beyond then
we have cold looks and it may be a hint is given to the judge marshal
for when our pockets are worth nothing our honest friends rather than
want will make money upon our heads then comes a high gallows and a
short halter and so dies the gentleman rover i tell thee i will leave
this trade and when i turn my glass from one of these barks and boats
to another there is not the worst of them which i would not row for
life rather than continue to be what i have been these poor men make
the sea a means of honest livelihood and friendly communication between
shore and shore for the mutual benefit of the inhabitants but we have
made it a road to the ruin of others and to our own destruction here
and in eternity i am determined to turn honest man and use this life
no longer

and where will your honesty take up its abode if it please you said
bunce you have broken the laws of every nation and the hand of the
law will detect and crush you wherever you may take refuge cleveland
i speak to you more seriously than i am wont to do i have had my
reflections too and they have been bad enough though they lasted but
a few minutes to spoil me weeks of joviality but here is the
matter what can we do but go on as we have done unless we have a
direct purpose of adorning the yard-arm

we may claim the benefit of the proclamation to those of our sort who
come in and surrender said cleveland

umph answered his companion dryly the date of that day of grace
has been for some time over and they may take the penalty or grant the
pardon at their pleasure were i you i would not put my neck in such a
venture

why others have been admitted but lately to favour and why should not
i said cleveland

ay replied his associate harry glasby and some others have been
spared but glasby did what was called good service in betraying his
comrades and retaking the jolly fortune and that i think you would
scorn even to be revenged of the brute goffe yonder

i would die a thousand times sooner said cleveland

i will be sworn for it said bunce and the others were forecastle
fellows petty larceny rogues scarce worth the hemp it would have cost
to hang them but your name has stood too high amongst the gentlemen of
fortune for you to get off so easily you are the prime buck of the
herd and will be marked accordingly

and why so i pray you said cleveland you know well enough my aim
jack

frederick if you please said bunce

the devil take your folly prithee keep thy wit and let us be grave
for a moment

for a moment be it so said bunce but i feel the spirit of altamont
coming fast upon me i have been a grave man for ten minutes already

be so then for a little longer said cleveland i know jack that
you really love me and since we have come thus far in this talk i
will trust you entirely now tell me why should i be refused the
benefit of this gracious proclamation i have borne a rough outside as
thou knowest but in time of need i can show the numbers of lives
which i have been the means of saving the property which i have
restored to those who owned it when without my intercession it would
have been wantonly destroyed in short bunce i can show  

that you were as gentle a thief as robin hood himself said bunce
and for that reason i fletcher and the better sort among us love
you as one who saves the character of us gentlemen rovers from utter
reprobation well suppose your pardon made out what are you to do
next what class in society will receive you with whom will you
associate old drake in queen bess's time could plunder peru and
mexico without a line of commission to show for it and blessed be her
memory he was knighted for it on his return and there was hal morgan
the welshman nearer our time in the days of merry king charles
brought all his gettings home had his estate and his country-house and
who but he but that is all ended now once a pirate and an outcast for
ever the poor devil may go and live shunned and despised by every one
in some obscure seaport with such part of his guilty earnings as
courtiers and clerks leave him for pardons do not pass the seals for
nothing and when he takes his walk along the pier if a stranger
asks who is the down-looking swarthy melancholy man for whom all
make way as if he brought the plague in his person the answer shall
be that is such a one the pardoned pirate no honest man will speak
to him no woman of repute will give him her hand

your picture is too highly coloured jack said cleveland suddenly
interrupting his friend there are women there is one at least that
would be true to her lover even if he were what you have described

bunce was silent for a space and looked fixedly at his friend by my
soul he said at length i begin to think myself a conjurer unlikely
as it all was i could not help suspecting from the beginning that there
was a girl in the case why this is worse than prince volscius in love
ha ha ha

laugh as you will said cleveland it is true there is a maiden who
is contented to love me pirate as i am and i will fairly own to you
jack that though i have often at times detested our roving life and
myself for following it yet i doubt if i could have found resolution to
make the break which i have now resolved on but for her sake

why then god-a-mercy replied bunce there is no speaking sense to
a madman and love in one of our trade captain is little better than
lunacy the girl must be a rare creature for a wise man to risk hanging
for her but harkye may she not be a little touched as well as
yourself and is it not sympathy that has done it she cannot be one of
our ordinary cockatrices but a girl of conduct and character

both are as undoubted as that she is the most beautiful and bewitching
creature whom the eye ever opened upon answered cleveland

and she loves thee knowing thee most noble captain to be a commander
among those gentlemen of fortune whom the vulgar call pirates

even so i am assured of it said cleveland

why then answered bunce she is either mad in good earnest as i
said before or she does not know what a pirate is

you are right in the last point replied cleveland she has been bred
in such remote simplicity and utter ignorance of what is evil that she
compares our occupation with that of the old norsemen who swept sea and
haven with their victorious galleys established colonies conquered
countries and took the name of sea-kings

and a better one it is than that of pirate and comes much to the same
purpose i dare say said bunce but this must be a mettled
wench why did you not bring her aboard methinks it was pity to baulk
her fancy

and do you think said cleveland that i could so utterly play the
part of a fallen spirit as to avail myself of her enthusiastic error
and bring an angel of beauty and innocence acquainted with such a hell
as exists on board of yonder infernal ship of ours i tell you my
friend that were all my former sins doubled in weight and in dye such
a villainy would have outglared and outweighed them all

why then captain cleveland said his confident methinks it was but
a fool's part to come hither at all the news must one day have gone
abroad that the celebrated pirate captain cleveland with his good
sloop the revenge had been lost on the mainland of zetland and all
hands perished so you would have remained hid both from friend and
enemy and might have married your pretty zetlander and converted your
sash and scarf into fishing-nets and your cutlass into a harpoon and
swept the seas for fish instead of florins

and so i had determined said the captain but a jagger as they call
them here like a meddling peddling thief as he is brought down
intelligence to zetland of your lying here and i was fain to set off
to see if you were the consort of whom i had told them long before i
thought of leaving the roving trade

ay said bunce and so far you judged well for as you had heard of
our being at kirkwall so we should have soon learned that you were at
zetland and some of us for friendship some for hatred and some for
fear of your playing harry glasby upon us would have come down for the
purpose of getting you into our company again

i suspected as much said the captain and therefore was fain to
decline the courteous offer of a friend who proposed to bring me here
about this time besides jack i recollected that as you say my
pardon will not pass the seals without money my own was waxing low no
wonder thou knowest i was never a churl of it and so  

and so you came for your share of the cobs replied his friend it
was wisely done and we shared honourably so far goffe has acted up to
articles it must be allowed but keep your purpose of leaving him close
in your breast for i dread his playing you some dog's trick or other
for he certainly thought himself sure of your share and will hardly
forgive your coming alive to disappoint him

i fear him not said cleveland and he knows that well i would i
were as well clear of the consequences of having been his comrade as i
hold myself to be of all those which may attend his ill-will another
unhappy job i may be troubled with i hurt a young fellow who has been
my plague for some time in an unhappy brawl that chanced the morning i
left zetland

is he dead asked bunce it is a more serious question here than it
would be on the grand caimains or the bahama isles where a brace or two
of fellows may be shot in a morning and no more heard of or asked
about them than if they were so many wood-pigeons but here it may be
otherwise so i hope you have not made your friend immortal

i hope not said the captain though my anger has been fatal to those
who have given me less provocation to say the truth i was sorry for
the lad notwithstanding and especially as i was forced to leave him in
mad keeping

in mad keeping said bunce why what means that

you shall hear replied his friend in the first place you are to
know this young man came suddenly on me while i was trying to gain
minna's ear for a private interview before i set sail that i might
explain my purpose to her now to be broken in on by the accursed
rudeness of this young fellow at such a moment  

the interruption deserved death said bunce by all the laws of love
and honour

a truce with your ends of plays jack and listen one moment the
brisk youth thought proper to retort when i commanded him to be gone i
am not thou knowest very patient and enforced my commands with a
blow which he returned as roundly we struggled till i became desirous
that we should part at any rate which i could only effect by a stroke
of my poniard which according to old use i have thou knowest always
about me i had scarce done this when i repented but there was no time
to think of any thing save escape and concealment for if the house
rose on me i was lost as the fiery old man who is head of the family
would have done justice on me had i been his brother i took the body
hastily on my shoulders to carry it down to the sea-shore with the
purpose of throwing it into a riva as they call them or chasm of
great depth where it would have been long enough in being discovered
this done i intended to jump into the boat which i had lying ready and
set sail for kirkwall but as i was walking hastily towards the beach
with my burden the poor young fellow groaned and so apprized me that
the wound had not been instantly fatal i was by this time well
concealed amongst the rocks and far from desiring to complete my
crime i laid the young man on the ground and was doing what i could to
stanch the blood when suddenly an old woman stood before me she was a
person whom i had frequently seen while in zetland and to whom they
ascribe the character of a sorceress or as the negroes say an obi
woman she demanded the wounded man of me and i was too much pressed
for time to hesitate in complying with her request more she was about
to say to me when we heard the voice of a silly old man belonging to
the family singing at some distance she then pressed her finger on her
lip as a sign of secrecy whistled very low and a shapeless deformed
brute of a dwarf coming to her assistance they carried the wounded man
into one of the caverns with which the place abounds and i got to my
boat and to sea with all expedition if that old hag be as they say
connected with the king of the air she favoured me that morning with a
turn of her calling for not even the west indian tornadoes which we
have weathered together made a wilder racket than the squall that drove
me so far out of our course that without a pocket-compass which i
chanced to have about me i should never have recovered the fair isle
for which we run and where i found a brig which brought me to this
place but whether the old woman meant me weal or woe here we came at
length in safety from the sea and here i remain in doubts and
difficulties of more kinds than one

o the devil take the sumburgh-head said bunce or whatever they
call the rock that you knocked our clever little revenge against

do not say i knocked her on the rock said cleveland have i not
told you fifty times if the cowards had not taken to their boat though
i showed them the danger and told them they would all be swamped which
happened the instant they cast off the painter she would have been
afloat at this moment had they stood by me and the ship their lives
would have been saved had i gone with them mine would have been lost
who can say which is for the best

well replied his friend i know your case now and can the better
help and advise i will be true to you clement as the blade to the
hilt but i cannot think that you should leave us as the old scottish
song says wae's my heart that we should sunder but come you will
aboard with us to-day at any rate

i have no other place of refuge said cleveland with a sigh

he then once more ran his eyes over the bay directing his spy-glass
upon several of the vessels which traversed its surface in hopes
doubtless of discerning the vessel of magnus troil and then followed
his companion down the hill in silence


footnotes

 it is very curious that the grouse plenty in orkney as the text
declares should be totally unknown in the neighbouring archipelago of
zetland which is only about sixty miles distance with the fair isle as
a step between

 the pirates gave this name to the black flag which with many
horrible devices to enhance its terrors was their favourite ensign




chapter xii

 i strive like to the vessel in the tide-way
 which lacking favouring breeze hath not the power
 to stem the powerful current even so
 resolving daily to forsake my vices
 habits strong circumstance renew'd temptation
 sweep me to sea again o heavenly breath
 fill thou my sails and aid the feeble vessel
 which ne'er can reach the blessed port without thee

 tis odds when evens meet


cleveland with his friend bunce descended the hill for a time in
silence until at length the latter renewed their conversation

you have taken this fellow's wound more on your conscience than you
need captain i have known you do more and think less on't

not on such slight provocation jack replied cleveland besides the
lad saved my life and say that i requited him the favour still we
should not have met on such evil terms but i trust that he may receive
aid from that woman who has certainly strange skill in simples

and over simpletons captain said his friend in which class i must
e'en put you down if you think more on this subject that you should be
made a fool of by a young woman why it is many an honest man's
case but to puzzle your pate about the mummeries of an old one is far
too great a folly to indulge a friend in talk to me of your minna
since you so call her as much as you will but you have no title to
trouble your faithful squire-errant with your old mumping magician and
now here we are once more amongst the booths and tents which these good
folk are pitching let us look and see whether we may not find some fun
and frolic amongst them in merry england now you would have seen on
such an occasion two or three bands of strollers as many fire-eaters
and conjurers as many shows of wild beasts but amongst these grave
folk there is nothing but what savours of business and of
commodity no not so much as a single squall from my merry gossip punch
and his rib joan

as bunce thus spoke cleveland cast his eyes on some very gay clothes
which with other articles hung out upon one of the booths that had a
good deal more of ornament and exterior decoration than the rest there
was in front a small sign of canvass painted announcing the variety of
goods which the owner of the booth bryce snailsfoot had on sale and
the reasonable prices at which he proposed to offer them to the public
for the further gratification of the spectator the sign bore on the
opposite side an emblematic device resembling our first parents in
their vegetable garments with this legend 

 poor sinners whom the snake deceives
 are fain to cover them with leaves
 zetland hath no leaves tis true
 because that trees are none or few
 but we have flax and taits of woo
 for linen cloth and wadmaal blue
 and we have many of foreign knacks
 of finer waft than woo or flax
 ye gallanty lambmas lads appear
 and bring your lambmas sisters here
 bryce snailsfoot spares not cost or care
 to pleasure every gentle pair

while cleveland was perusing these goodly rhymes which brought to his
mind claud halcro to whom as the poet laureate of the island ready
with his talent alike in the service of the great and small they
probably owed their origin the worthy proprietor of the booth having
cast his eye upon him began with hasty and trembling hand to remove
some of the garments which as the sale did not commence till the
ensuing day he had exposed either for the purpose of airing them or to
excite the admiration of the spectators

by my word captain whispered bunce to cleveland you must have had
that fellow under your clutches one day and he remembers one gripe of
your talons and fears another see how fast he is packing his wares out
of sight so soon as he set eyes on you

his wares said cleveland on looking more attentively at his
proceedings by heaven they are my clothes which i left in a chest at
jarlshof when the revenge was lost there why bryce snailsfoot thou
thief dog and villain what means this have you not made enough of us
by cheap buying and dear selling that you have seized on my trunk and
wearing apparel

bryce snailsfoot who probably would otherwise not have been willing to
see his friend the captain was now by the vivacity of his attack
obliged to pay attention to him he first whispered to his little
foot-page by whom as we have already noticed he was usually attended
run to the town-council-house jarto and tell the provost and bailies
they maun send some of their officers speedily for here is like to be
wild wark in the fair

so having said and having seconded his commands by a push on the
shoulder of his messenger which sent him spinning out of the shop as
fast as heels could carry him bryce snailsfoot turned to his old
acquaintance and with that amplification of words and exaggeration of
manner which in scotland is called making a phrase he
ejaculated the lord be gude to us the worthy captain cleveland that
we were all sae grieved about returned to relieve our hearts again wat
have my cheeks been for you here bryce wiped his eyes and blithe
am i now to see you restored to your sorrowing friends

my sorrowing friends you rascal said cleveland i will give you
better cause for sorrow than ever you had on my account if you do not
tell me instantly where you stole all my clothes

stole ejaculated bryce casting up his eyes now the powers be gude
to us the poor gentleman has lost his reason in that weary gale of
wind

why you insolent rascal said cleveland grasping the cane which he
carried do you think to bamboozle me with your impudence as you would
have a whole head on your shoulders and your bones in a whole skin one
minute longer tell me where the devil you stole my wearing apparel

bryce snailsfoot ejaculated once more a repetition of the word stole
now heaven be gude to us but at the same time conscious that the
captain was likely to be sudden in execution cast an anxious look to
the town to see the loitering aid of the civil power advance to his
rescue

i insist on an instant answer said the captain with upraised weapon
or else i will beat you to a mummy and throw out all your frippery
upon the common

meanwhile master john bunce who considered the whole affair as an
excellent good jest and not the worse one that it made cleveland very
angry seized hold of the captain's arm and without any idea of
ultimately preventing him from executing his threats interfered just so
much as was necessary to protract a discussion so amusing

nay let the honest man speak he said messmate he has as fine a
cozening face as ever stood on a knavish pair of shoulders and his are
the true flourishes of eloquence in the course of which men snip the
cloth an inch too short now i wish you to consider that you are both
of a trade he measures bales by the yard and you by the sword and
so i will not have him chopped up till he has had a fair chase

you are a fool said cleveland endeavouring to shake his friend
off let me go for by heaven i will be foul of him

hold him fast said the pedlar good dear merry gentleman hold him
fast

then say something for yourself said bunce use your gob-box man
patter away or by my soul i will let him loose on you

he says i stole these goods said bryce who now saw himself run so
close that pleading to the charge became inevitable now how could i
steal them when they are mine by fair and lawful purchase

purchase you beggarly vagrant said cleveland from whom did you
dare to buy my clothes or who had the impudence to sell them

just that worthy professor mrs swertha the housekeeper at jarlshof
who acted as your executor said the pedlar and a grieved heart she
had

and so she was resolved to make a heavy pocket of it i suppose said
the captain but how did she dare to sell the things left in her
charge

why she acted all for the best good woman said the pedlar anxious
to protract the discussion until the arrival of succours and if you
will but hear reason i am ready to account with you for the chest and
all that it holds

speak out then and let us have none of thy damnable evasions said
captain cleveland if you show ever so little purpose of being somewhat
honest for once in thy life i will not beat thee

why you see noble captain said the pedlar and then muttered to
himself plague on pate paterson's cripple knee they will be waiting
for him hirpling useless body then resumed aloud the country you
see is in great perplexity great perplexity indeed much
perplexity truly there was your honour missing that was loved by
great and small clean missing nowhere to be heard of a lost
man umquhile dead defunct

you shall find me alive to your cost you scoundrel said the
irritated captain

weel but take patience ye will not hear a body speak said the
jagger then there was the lad mordaunt mertoun  

ha said the captain what of him

cannot be heard of said the pedlar clean and clear tint a gone
youth fallen it is thought from the craig into the sea he was aye
venturous i have had dealings with him for furs and feathers whilk he
swapped against powder and shot and the like and now he has worn out
from among us clean retired utterly vanished like the last puff of an
auld wife's tobacco pipe

but what is all this to the captain's clothes my dear friend said
bunce i must presently beat you myself unless you come to the point

weel weel patience patience said bryce waving his hand you
will get all time enough weel there are two folks gane as i said
forbye the distress at burgh-westra about mistress minna's sad
ailment  

bring not her into your buffoonery sirrah said cleveland in a
tone of anger not so loud but far deeper and more concentrated than he
had hitherto used for if you name her with less than reverence i
will crop the ears out of your head and make you swallow them on the
spot

he he he faintly laughed the jagger that were a pleasant jest
you are pleased to be witty but to say naething of burgh-westra there
is the carle at jarlshof he that was the auld mertoun mordaunt's
father whom men thought as fast bound to the place he dwelt in as the
sumburgh-head itsell naething maun serve him but he is lost as weel as
the lave about whom i have spoken and there's magnus troil wi favour
be he named taking horse and there is pleasant maister claud halcro
taking boat whilk he steers worst of any man in zetland his head
running on rambling rhymes and the factor body is on the stir the
scots factor him that is aye speaking of dikes and delving and such
unprofitable wark which has naething of merchandise in it and he is on
the lang trot too so that ye might say upon a manner the tae half of
the mainland of zetland is lost and the other is running to and fro
seeking it awfu times

captain cleveland had subdued his passion and listened to this tirade
of the worthy man of merchandise with impatience indeed yet not
without the hope of hearing something that might concern him but his
companion was now become impatient in his turn the clothes he
exclaimed the clothes the clothes the clothes accompanying each
repetition of the words with a flourish of his cane the dexterity of
which consisted in coming mighty near the jagger's ears without actually
touching them

the jagger shrinking from each of these demonstrations continued to
exclaim nay sir good sir worthy sir for the clothes i found the
worthy dame in great distress on account of her old maister and on
account of her young maister and on account of worthy captain
cleveland and because of the distress of the worthy fowd's family and
the trouble of the great fowd himself and because of the factor and
in respect of claud halcro and on other accounts and respects also we
mingled our sorrows and our tears with a bottle as the holy text hath
it and called in the ranzelman to our council a worthy man niel
ronaldson by name who hath a good reputation

here another flourish of the cane came so very near that it partly
touched his ear the jagger started back and the truth or that which
he desired should be considered as such bolted from him without more
circumlocution as a cork after much unnecessary buzzing and fizzing
springs forth from a bottle of spruce beer

in brief what the deil mair would you have of it the woman sold me
the kist of clothes they are mine by purchase and that is what i will
live and die upon

in other words said cleveland this greedy old hag had the impudence
to sell what was none of hers and you honest bryce snailsfoot had the
assurance to be the purchaser

ou dear captain said the conscientious pedlar what wad ye hae had
twa poor folk to do there was yoursell gane that aught the things and
maister mordaunt was gane that had them in keeping and the things were
but damply put up where they were rotting with moth and mould and  

and so this old thief sold them and you bought them i suppose just
to keep them from spoiling said cleveland

weel then said the merchant i'm thinking noble captain that wad
be just the gate of it

well then hark ye you impudent scoundrel said the captain i do
not wish to dirty my fingers with you or to make any disturbance in
this place  

good reason for that captain aha said the jagger slyly

i will break your bones if you speak another word replied cleveland
take notice i offer you fair terms give me back the black leathern
pocket-book with the lock upon it and the purse with the doubloons
with some few of the clothes i want and keep the rest in the devil's
name

doubloons exclaimed the jagger with an exaltation of voice
intended to indicate the utmost extremity of surprise what do i ken
of doubloons my dealing was for doublets and not for doubloons if
there were doubloons in the kist doubtless swertha will have them in
safe keeping for your honour the damp wouldna harm the gold ye ken

give me back my pocket-book and my goods you rascally thief said
cleveland or without a word more i will beat your brains out

the wily jagger casting eye around him saw that succour was near in
the shape of a party of officers six in number for several rencontres
with the crew of the pirate had taught the magistrates of kirkwall to
strengthen their police parties when these strangers were in question

ye had better keep the thief to suit yoursell honoured captain
said the jagger emboldened by the approach of the civil power for wha
kens how a these fine goods and bonny-dies were come by

this was uttered with such provoking slyness of look and tone that
cleveland made no further delay but seizing upon the jagger by the
collar dragged him over his temporary counter which was with all the
goods displayed thereon overset in the scuffle and holding him with
one hand inflicted on him with the other a severe beating with his
cane all this was done so suddenly and with such energy that bryce
snailsfoot though rather a stout man was totally surprised by the
vivacity of the attack and made scarce any other effort at extricating
himself than by roaring for assistance like a bull-calf the loitering
aid having at length come up the officers made an effort to seize on
cleveland and by their united exertions succeeded in compelling him to
quit hold of the pedlar in order to defend himself from their assault
this he did with infinite strength resolution and dexterity being at
the same time well seconded by his friend jack bunce who had seen with
glee the drubbing sustained by the pedlar and now combated tightly to
save his companion from the consequences but as there had been for
some time a growing feud between the townspeople and the crew of the
rover the former provoked by the insolent deportment of the seamen
had resolved to stand by each other and to aid the civil power upon
such occasions of riot as should occur in future and so many assistants
came up to the rescue of the constables that cleveland after fighting
most manfully was at length brought to the ground and made prisoner
his more fortunate companion had escaped by speed of foot as soon as he
saw that the day must needs be determined against them

the proud heart of cleveland which even in its perversion had in its
feelings something of original nobleness was like to burst when he
felt himself borne down in this unworthy brawl dragged into the town as
a prisoner and hurried through the streets towards the council-house
where the magistrates of the burgh were then seated in council the
probability of imprisonment with all its consequences rushed also upon
his mind and he cursed an hundred times the folly which had not rather
submitted to the pedlar's knavery than involved him in so perilous an
embarrassment

but just as they approached the door of the council-house which is
situated in the middle of the little town the face of matters was
suddenly changed by a new and unexpected incident

bunce who had designed by his precipitate retreat to serve as well
his friend as himself had hied him to the haven where the boat of the
rover was then lying and called the cockswain and boat's crew to the
assistance of cleveland they now appeared on the scene fierce
desperadoes as became their calling with features bronzed by the
tropical sun under which they had pursued it they rushed at once
amongst the crowd laying about them with their stretchers and forcing
their way up to cleveland speedily delivered him from the hands of the
officers who were totally unprepared to resist an attack so furious and
so sudden and carried him off in triumph towards the quay two or
three of their number facing about from time to time to keep back the
crowd whose efforts to recover the prisoner were the less violent that
most of the seamen were armed with pistols and cutlasses as well as
with the less lethal weapons which alone they had as yet made use of

they gained their boat in safety and jumped into it carrying along
with them cleveland to whom circumstances seemed to offer no other
refuge and pushed off for their vessel singing in chorus to their oars
an old ditty of which the natives of kirkwall could only hear the first
stanza

 robin rover
 said to his crew
 up with the black flag
 down with the blue 
 fire on the main-top
 fire on the bow
 fire on the gun-deck
 fire down below

the wild chorus of their voices was heard long after the words ceased to
be intelligible and thus was the pirate cleveland again thrown almost
involuntarily amongst those desperate associates from whom he had so
often resolved to detach himself


footnotes

 it was anciently a custom at saint olla's fair at kirkwall that
the young people of the lower class and of either sex associated in
pairs for the period of the fair during which the couple were termed
lambmas brother and sister it is easy to conceive that the exclusive
familiarity arising out of this custom was liable to abuse the rather
that it is said little scandal was attached to the indiscretions which
it occasioned




chapter xiii

 parental love my friend has power o'er wisdom
 and is the charm which like the falconer's lure
 can bring from heaven the highest soaring spirits 
 so when famed prosper doff'd his magic robe
 it was miranda pluck'd it from his shoulders

 old play


our wandering narrative must now return to mordaunt mertoun we left
him in the perilous condition of one who has received a severe wound
and we now find him in the condition of a convalescent pale indeed
and feeble from the loss of much blood and the effects of a fever which
had followed the injury but so far fortunate that the weapon having
glanced on the ribs had only occasioned a great effusion of blood
without touching any vital part and was now wellnigh healed so
efficacious were the vulnerary plants and salves with which it had been
treated by the sage norna of fitful-head

the matron and her patient now sat together in a dwelling in a remote
island he had been transported during his illness and ere he had
perfect consciousness first to her singular habitation near
fitful-head and thence to her present abode by one of the
fishing-boats on the station of burgh-westra for such was the command
possessed by norna over the superstitious character of her countrymen
that she never failed to find faithful agents to execute her commands
whatever these happened to be and as her orders were generally given
under injunctions of the strictest secrecy men reciprocally wondered at
occurrences which had in fact been produced by their own agency and
that of their neighbours and in which had they communicated freely
with each other no shadow of the marvellous would have remained

mordaunt was now seated by the fire in an apartment indifferently well
furnished having a book in his hand which he looked upon from time to
time with signs of ennui and impatience feelings which at length so far
overcame him that flinging the volume on the table he fixed his eyes
on the fire and assumed the attitude of one who is engaged in
unpleasant meditation

norna who sat opposite to him and appeared busy in the composition of
some drug or unguent anxiously left her seat and approaching
mordaunt felt his pulse making at the same time the most affectionate
enquiries whether he felt any sudden pain and where it was seated the
manner in which mordaunt replied to these earnest enquiries although
worded so as to express gratitude for her kindness while he disclaimed
any feeling of indisposition did not seem to give satisfaction to the
pythoness

ungrateful boy she said for whom i have done so much you whom i
have rescued by my power and skill from the very gates of death are
you already so weary of me that you cannot refrain from showing how
desirous you are to spend at a distance from me the very first
intelligent days of the life which i have restored you

you do me injustice my kind preserver replied mordaunt i am not
tired of your society but i have duties which recall me to ordinary
life

duties repeated norna and what duties can or ought to interfere
with the gratitude which you owe to me duties your thoughts are on
the use of your gun or on clambering among the rocks in quest of
sea-fowl for these exercises your strength doth not yet fit you and
yet these are the duties to which you are so anxious to return

not so my good and kind mistress said mordaunt to name one duty
out of many which makes me seek to leave you now that my strength
permits let me mention that of a son to his father

to your father said norna with a laugh that had something in it
almost frantic o you know not how we can in these islands at once
cancel such duties and for your father she added proceeding more
calmly what has he done for you to deserve the regard and duty you
speak of is he not the same who as you have long since told me left
you for so many years poorly nourished among strangers without
enquiring whether you were alive or dead and only sending from time to
time supplies in such fashion as men relieve the leprous wretch to
whom they fling alms from a distance and in these later years when he
had made you the companion of his misery he has been by starts your
pedagogue by starts your tormentor but never mordaunt never your
father

something of truth there is in what you say replied mordaunt my
father is not fond but he is and has ever been effectively kind men
have not their affections in their power and it is a child's duty to be
grateful for the benefits which he receives even when coldly bestowed
my father has conferred instruction on me and i am convinced he loves
me he is unfortunate and even if he loved me not  

and he does not love you said norna hastily he never loved any
thing or any one save himself he is unfortunate but well are his
misfortunes deserved o mordaunt you have one parent only one
parent who loves you as the drops of the heart-blood

i know i have but one parent replied mordaunt my mother has been
long dead but your words contradict each other

they do not they do not said norna in a paroxysm of the deepest
feeling you have but one parent your unhappy mother is not dead i
would to god that she were but she is not dead thy mother is the only
parent that loves thee and i i mordaunt throwing herself on his
neck am that most unhappy yet most happy mother

she closed him in a strict and convulsive embrace and tears the first
perhaps which she had shed for many years burst in torrents as she
sobbed on his neck astonished at what he heard felt and saw moved
by the excess of her agitation yet disposed to ascribe this burst of
passion to insanity mordaunt vainly endeavoured to tranquillize the
mind of this extraordinary person

ungrateful boy she said who but a mother would have watched over
thee as i have watched from the instant i saw thy father when he
little thought by whom he was observed a space now many years back i
knew him well and under his charge i saw you then a
stripling while nature speaking loud in my bosom assured me thou
wert blood of my blood and bone of my bone think how often you have
wondered to see me when least expected in your places of pastime and
resort think how often my eye has watched you on the giddy precipices
and muttered those charms which subdue the evil demons who show
themselves to the climber on the giddiest point of his path and force
him to quit his hold did i not hang around thy neck in pledge of thy
safety that chain of gold which an elfin king gave to the founder of
our race would i have given that dear gift to any but to the son of my
bosom mordaunt my power has done that for thee that a mere mortal
mother would dread to think of i have conjured the mermaid at midnight
that thy bark might be prosperous on the haaf i have hushed the winds
and navies have flapped their empty sails against the mast in
inactivity that you might safely indulge your sport upon the crags

mordaunt perceiving that she was growing yet wilder in her talk
endeavoured to frame an answer which should be at once indulgent
soothing and calculated to allay the rising warmth of her imagination

dear norna he said i have indeed many reasons to call you mother
who have bestowed so many benefits upon me and from me you shall ever
receive the affection and duty of a child but the chain you mentioned
it has vanished from my neck i have not seen it since the ruffian
stabbed me

alas and can you think of it at this moment said norna in a
sorrowful accent but be it so and know it was i took it from thy
neck and tied it around the neck of her who is dearest to you in token
that the union betwixt you which has been the only earthly wish which
i have had the power to form shall yet even yet be accomplished ay
although hell should open to forbid the bans

alas said mordaunt with a sigh you remember not the difference
betwixt our situation her father is wealthy and of ancient birth

not more wealthy than will be the heir of norna of fitful-head
answered the pythoness not of better or more ancient blood than that
which flows in thy veins derived from thy mother the descendant of the
same jarls and sea-kings from whom magnus boasts his origin or dost
thou think like the pedant and fanatic strangers who have come amongst
us that thy blood is dishonoured because my union with thy father did
not receive the sanction of a priest know that we were wedded after
the ancient manner of the norse our hands were clasped within the
circle of odin with such deep vows of eternal fidelity as even the
laws of these usurping scots would have sanctioned as equivalent to a
blessing before the altar to the offspring of such a union magnus has
nought to object it was weak it was criminal on my part but it
conveyed no infamy to the birth of my son

the composed and collected manner in which norna argued these points
began to impose upon mordaunt an incipient belief in the truth of what
she said and indeed she added so many circumstances satisfactorily
and rationally connected with each other as seemed to confute the
notion that her story was altogether the delusion of that insanity which
sometimes showed itself in her speech and actions a thousand confused
ideas rushed upon him when he supposed it possible that the unhappy
person before him might actually have a right to claim from him the
respect and affection due to a parent from a son he could only surmount
them by turning his mind to a different and scarce less interesting
topic resolving within himself to take time for farther enquiry and
mature consideration ere he either rejected or admitted the claim which
norna preferred upon his affection and duty his benefactress at least
she undoubtedly was and he could not err in paying her as such the
respect and attention due from a son to a mother and so far therefore
he might gratify norna without otherwise standing committed

and do you then really think my mother since so you bid me term
you said mordaunt that the proud magnus troil may by any
inducement be prevailed upon to relinquish the angry feelings which he
has of late adopted towards me and to permit my addresses to his
daughter brenda

brenda repeated norna who talks of brenda it was of minna that i
spoke to you

but it was of brenda that i thought replied mordaunt of her that i
now think and of her alone that i will ever think

impossible my son replied norna you cannot be so dull of heart so
poor of spirit as to prefer the idle mirth and housewife simplicity of
the younger sister to the deep feeling and high mind of the
noble-spirited minna who would stoop to gather the lowly violet that
might have the rose for stretching out his hand

some think the lowliest flowers are the sweetest replied mordaunt
and in that faith will i live and die

you dare not tell me so answered norna fiercely then instantly
changing her tone and taking his hand in the most affectionate manner
she proceeded you must not you will not tell me so my dear son you
will not break a mother's heart in the very first hour in which she has
embraced her child nay do not answer but hear me you must wed
minna i have bound around her neck a fatal amulet on which the
happiness of both depends the labours of my life have for years had
this direction thus it must be and not otherwise minna must be the
bride of my son

but is not brenda equally near equally dear to you replied mordaunt

as near in blood said norna but not so dear no not half so dear
in affection minna's mild yet high and contemplative spirit renders
her a companion meet for one whose ways like mine are beyond the
ordinary paths of this world brenda is a thing of common and ordinary
life an idle laugher and scoffer who would level art with ignorance
and reduce power to weakness by disbelieving and turning into ridicule
whatever is beyond the grasp of her own shallow intellect

she is indeed answered mordaunt neither superstitious nor
enthusiastic and i love her the better for it remember also my
mother that she returns my affection and that minna if she loves any
one loves the stranger cleveland

she does not she dares not answered norna nor dares he pursue her
farther i told him when first he came to burgh-westra that i destined
her for you

and to that rash annunciation said mordaunt i owe this man's
persevering enmity my wound and wellnigh the loss of my life see my
mother to what point your intrigues have already conducted us and in
heaven's name prosecute them no farther

it seemed as if this reproach struck norna with the force at once and
vivacity of lightning for she struck her forehead with her hand and
seemed about to drop from her seat mordaunt greatly shocked hastened
to catch her in his arms and though scarce knowing what to say
attempted to utter some incoherent expressions

spare me heaven spare me were the first words which she muttered
do not let my crime be avenged by his means yes young man she
said after a pause you have dared to tell what i dared not tell
myself you have pressed that upon me which if it be truth i cannot
believe and yet continue to live

mordaunt in vain endeavoured to interrupt her with protestations of his
ignorance how he had offended or grieved her and of his extreme regret
that he had unintentionally done either she proceeded while her voice
trembled wildly with vehemence

yes you have touched on that dark suspicion which poisons the
consciousness of my power the sole boon which was given me in exchange
for innocence and for peace of mind your voice joins that of the demon
which even while the elements confess me their mistress whispers to
me norna this is but delusion your power rests but in the idle
belief of the ignorant supported by a thousand petty artifices of your
own this is what brenda says this is what you would say and false
scandalously false as it is there are rebellious thoughts in this wild
brain of mine touching her forehead with her finger as she spoke
that like an insurrection in an invaded country arise to take part
against their distressed sovereign spare me my son she continued in
a voice of supplication spare me the sovereignty of which your words
would deprive me is no enviable exaltation few would covet to rule
over gibbering ghosts and howling winds and raging currents my throne
is a cloud my sceptre a meteor my realm is only peopled with
fantasies but i must either cease to be or continue to be the
mightiest as well as the most miserable of beings

do not speak thus mournfully my dear and unhappy benefactress said
mordaunt much affected i will think of your power whatever you would
have me believe but for your own sake view the matter otherwise turn
your thoughts from such agitating and mystical studies from such wild
subjects of contemplation into another and a better channel life will
again have charms and religion will have comforts for you

she listened to him with some composure as if she weighed his counsel
and desired to be guided by it but as he ended she shook her head and
exclaimed 

it cannot be i must remain the dreaded the mystical the
reimkennar the controller of the elements or i must be no more i have
no alternative no middle station my post must be high on yon lofty
headland where never stood human foot save mine or i must sleep at the
bottom of the unfathomable ocean its white billows booming over my
senseless corpse the parricide shall never also be denounced as the
impostor

the parricide echoed mordaunt stepping back in horror

yes my son answered norna with a stern composure even more
frightful than her former impetuosity within these fatal walls my
father met his death by my means in yonder chamber was he found a livid
and lifeless corpse beware of filial disobedience for such are its
fruits

so saying she arose and left the apartment where mordaunt remained
alone to meditate at leisure upon the extraordinary communication which
he had received he himself had been taught by his father a disbelief in
the ordinary superstitions of zetland and he now saw that norna
however ingenious in duping others could not altogether impose on
herself this was a strong circumstance in favour of her sanity of
intellect but on the other hand her imputing to herself the guilt of
parricide seemed so wild and improbable as in mordaunt's opinion to
throw much doubt upon her other assertions

he had leisure enough to make up his mind on these particulars for no
one approached the solitary dwelling of which norna her dwarf and he
himself were the sole inhabitants the hoy island in which it stood is
rude bold and lofty consisting entirely of three hills or rather one
huge mountain divided into three summits with the chasms rents and
valleys which descend from its summit to the sea while its crest
rising to great height and shivered into rocks which seem almost
inaccessible intercepts the mists as they drive from the atlantic
and often obscured from the human eye forms the dark and unmolested
retreat of hawks eagles and other birds of prey

the soil of the island is wet mossy cold and unproductive presenting
a sterile and desolate appearance excepting where the sides of small
rivulets or mountain ravines are fringed with dwarf bushes of birch
hazel and wild currant some of them so tall as to be denominated
trees in that bleak and bare country

but the view of the sea-beach which was mordaunt's favourite walk when
his convalescent state began to permit him to take exercise had charms
which compensated the wild appearance of the interior a broad and
beautiful sound or strait divides this lonely and mountainous island
from pomona and in the centre of that sound lies like a tablet
composed of emerald the beautiful and verdant little island of græmsay
on the distant mainland is seen the town or village of stromness the
excellence of whose haven is generally evinced by a considerable number
of shipping in the roadstead and from the bay growing narrower and
lessening as it recedes runs inland into pomona where its tide fills
the fine sheet of water called the loch of stennis

on this beach mordaunt was wont to wander for hours with an eye not
insensible to the beauties of the view though his thoughts were
agitated with the most embarrassing meditations on his own situation he
was resolved to leave the island as soon as the establishment of his
health should permit him to travel yet gratitude to norna of whom he
was at least the adopted if not the real son would not allow him to
depart without her permission even if he could obtain means of
conveyance of which he saw little possibility it was only by
importunity that he extorted from his hostess a promise that if he
would consent to regulate his motions according to her directions she
would herself convey him to the capital of the orkney islands when the
approaching fair of saint olla should take place there

 hark to the insult loud the bitter sneer
 the fierce threat answering to the brutal jeer
 oaths fly like pistol-shots and vengeful words
 clash with each other like conflicting swords 
 the robber's quarrel by such sounds is shown

 captivity a poem


when cleveland borne off in triumph from his assailants in kirkwall
found himself once more on board the pirate-vessel his arrival was
hailed with hearty cheers by a considerable part of the crew who rushed
to shake hands with him and offer their congratulations on his return
for the situation of a buccanier captain raised him very little above
the level of the lowest of his crew who in all social intercourse
claimed the privilege of being his equal

when his faction for so these clamorous friends might be termed had
expressed their own greetings they hurried cleveland forward to the
stern where goffe their present commander was seated on a gun
listening in a sullen and discontented mood to the shout which announced
cleveland's welcome he was a man betwixt forty and fifty rather under
the middle size but so very strongly made that his crew used to
compare him to a sixty-four cut down black-haired bull-necked and
beetle-browed his clumsy strength and ferocious countenance contrasted
strongly with the manly figure and open countenance of cleveland in
which even the practice of his atrocious profession had not been able to
eradicate a natural grace of motion and generosity of expression the
two piratical captains looked upon each other for some time in silence
while the partisans of each gathered around him the elder part of the
crew were the principal adherents of goffe while the young fellows
among whom jack bunce was a principal leader and agitator were in
general attached to cleveland

at length goffe broke silence you are welcome aboard captain
cleveland smash my taffrail i suppose you think yourself commodore
yet but that was over by g  when you lost your ship and be
d  d

and here once for all we may take notice that it was the gracious
custom of this commander to mix his words and oaths in nearly equal
proportions which he was wont to call shotting his discourse as we
delight not however in the discharge of such artillery we shall only
indicate by a space like this    the places in which these expletives
occurred and thus if the reader will pardon a very poor pun we will
reduce captain goffe's volley of sharp-shot into an explosion of blank
cartridges to his insinuations that he was come on board to assume the
chief command cleveland replied that he neither desired nor would
accept any such promotion but would only ask captain goffe for a cast
of the boat to put him ashore in one of the other islands as he had no
wish either to command goffe or to remain in a vessel under his orders

and why not under my orders brother demanded goffe very austerely
      are you too good a man       with your cheese-toaster and
your jib there     to serve under my orders and be d  d to you
where there are so many gentlemen that are elder and better seamen than
yourself

i wonder which of these capital seamen it was said cleveland coolly
that laid the ship under the fire of yon six-gun battery that could
blow her out of the water if they had a mind before you could either
cut or slip elder and better sailors than i may like to serve under
such a lubber but i beg to be excused for my own share captain that's
all i have got to tell you

by g  i think you are both mad said hawkins the boatswain a
meeting with sword and pistol may be devilish good fun in its way when
no better is to be had but who the devil that had common sense amongst
a set of gentlemen in our condition would fall a quarrelling with each
other to let these duck-winged web-footed islanders have a chance of
knocking us all upon the head

well said old hawkins observed derrick the quarter-master who was
an officer of very considerable importance among these rovers i say
if the two captains won't agree to live together quietly and club both
heart and head to defend the vessel why d  n me depose them both
say i and choose another in their stead

meaning yourself i suppose master quarter-master said jack bunce
but that cock won't fight he that is to command gentlemen should be a
gentleman himself i think and i give my vote for captain cleveland as
spirited and as gentleman-like a man as ever daffed the world aside and
bid it pass

what you call yourself a gentleman i warrant retorted derrick
why    your eyes a tailor would make a better out of the worst suit
of rags in your strolling wardrobe it is a shame for men of spirit to
have such a jack-a-dandy scarecrow on board

jack bunce was so incensed at these base comparisons that without more
ado he laid his hand on his sword the carpenter however and
boatswain interfered the former brandishing his broad axe and
swearing he would put the skull of the first who should strike a blow
past clouting and the latter reminding them that by their articles
all quarrelling striking or more especially fighting on board was
strictly prohibited and that if any gentleman had a quarrel to settle
they were to go ashore and decide it with cutlass and pistol in
presence of two of their messmates

i have no quarrel with any one       said goffe sullenly
captain cleveland has wandered about among the islands here amusing
himself       and we have wasted our time and property in waiting
for him when we might have been adding twenty or thirty thousand
dollars to the stock-purse however if it pleases the rest of the
gentlemen-adventurers       why i shall not grumble about it

i propose said the boatswain that there should be a general council
called in the great cabin according to our articles that we may
consider what course we are to hold in this matter

a general assent followed the boatswain's proposal for every one found
his own account in these general councils in which each of the rovers
had a free vote by far the greater part of the crew only valued this
franchise as it allowed them upon such solemn occasions an unlimited
quantity of liquor a right which they failed not to exercise to the
uttermost by way of aiding their deliberations but a few amongst the
adventurers who united some degree of judgment with the daring and
profligate character of their profession were wont at such periods to
limit themselves within the bounds of comparative sobriety and by
these under the apparent form of a vote of the general council all
things of moment relating to the voyage and undertakings of the pirates
were in fact determined the rest of the crew when they recovered from
their intoxication were easily persuaded that the resolution adopted
had been the legitimate effort of the combined wisdom of the whole
senate

upon the present occasion the debauch had proceeded until the greater
part of the crew were as usual displaying inebriation in all its most
brutal and disgraceful shapes swearing empty and unmeaning
oaths venting the most horrid imprecations in the mere gaiety of their
heart singing songs the ribaldry of which was only equalled by their
profaneness and from the middle of this earthly hell the two
captains together with one or two of their principal adherents as also
the carpenter and boatswain who always took a lead on such occasions
had drawn together into a pandemonium or privy council of their own to
consider what was to be done for as the boatswain metaphorically
observed they were in a narrow channel and behoved to keep sounding
the tide-way

when they began their consultations the friends of goffe remarked to
their great displeasure that he had not observed the wholesome rule to
which we have just alluded but that in endeavouring to drown his
mortification at the sudden appearance of cleveland and the reception
he met with from the crew the elder captain had not been able to do so
without overflowing his reason at the same time his natural sullen
taciturnity had prevented this from being observed until the council
began its deliberations when it proved impossible to hide it

the first person who spoke was cleveland who said that so far from
wishing the command of the vessel he desired no favour at any one's
hand except to land him upon some island or holm at a distance from
kirkwall and leave him to shift for himself

the boatswain remonstrated strongly against this resolution the lads
he said all knew cleveland and could trust his seamanship as well as
his courage besides he never let the grog get quite uppermost and was
always in proper trim either to sail the ship or to fight the ship
whereby she was never without some one to keep her course when he was on
board and as for the noble captain goffe continued the mediator he
is as stout a heart as ever broke biscuit and that i will uphold him
but then when he has his grog aboard i speak to his face he is so
d  d funny with his cranks and his jests that there is no living with
him you all remember how nigh he had run the ship on that cursed horse
of copinsha as they call it just by way of frolic and then you know
how he fired off his pistol under the table when we were at the great
council and shot jack jenkins in the knee and cost the poor devil his
leg with his pleasantry

jack jenkins was not a chip the worse said the carpenter i took the
leg off with my saw as well as any loblolly-boy in the land could have
done heated my broad axe and seared the stump ay by    and made a
jury-leg that he shambles about with as well as ever he did for jack
could never cut a feather

you are a clever fellow carpenter replied the boatswain a d  d
clever fellow but i had rather you tried your saw and red-hot axe upon
the ship's knee-timbers than on mine sink me but that here is not the
case the question is if we shall part with captain cleveland here who
is a man of thought and action whereby it is my belief it would be
heaving the pilot overboard when the gale is blowing on a lee-shore
and i must say it is not the part of a true heart to leave his mates
who have been here waiting for him till they have missed stays our
water is wellnigh out and we have junketed till provisions are low with
us we cannot sail without provisions we cannot get provisions without
the good-will of the kirkwall folks if we remain here longer the
halcyon frigate will be down upon us she was seen off peterhead two
days since and we shall hang up at the yard-arm to be sun-dried now
captain cleveland will get us out of the hobble if any can he can play
the gentleman with these kirkwall folks and knows how to deal with them
on fair terms and foul too if there be occasion for it

and so you would turn honest captain goffe a-grazing would ye said
an old weatherbeaten pirate who had but one eye what though he has
his humours and made my eye dowse the glim in his fancies and frolics
he is as honest a man as ever walked a quarter-deck for all that and
d  n me but i stand by him so long as t'other lantern is lit

why you would not hear me out said hawkins a man might as well
talk to so many negers i tell you i propose that cleveland shall only
be captain from one post meridiem to five a m during which time
goffe is always drunk

the captain of whom he last spoke gave sufficient proof of the truth of
his words by uttering an inarticulate growl and attempting to present
a pistol at the mediator hawkins

why look ye now said derrick there is all the sense he has to get
drunk on council-day like one of these poor silly fellows

ay said bunce drunk as davy's sow in the face of the field the
fray and the senate

but nevertheless continued derrick it will never do to have two
captains in the same day i think week about might suit better and let
cleveland take the first turn

there are as good here as any of them said hawkins howsomdever i
object nothing to captain cleveland and i think he may help us into
deep water as well as another

ay exclaimed bunce and a better figure he will make at bringing
these kirkwallers to order than his sober predecessor so captain
cleveland for ever

illustration

stop gentlemen said cleveland who had hitherto been silent i
hope you will not choose me captain without my own consent

ay by the blue vault of heaven will we said bunce if it be pro
bono publico

but hear me at least said cleveland i do consent to take command
of the vessel since you wish it and because i see you will ill get out
of the scrape without me

why then i say cleveland for ever again shouted bunce

be quiet prithee dear bunce honest altamont said cleveland i
undertake the business on this condition that when i have got the ship
cleared for her voyage with provisions and so forth you will be
content to restore captain goffe to the command as i said before and
put me ashore somewhere to shift for myself you will then be sure it
is impossible i can betray you since i will remain with you to the last
moment

ay and after the last moment too by the blue vault or i mistake the
matter muttered bunce to himself

the matter was now put to the vote and so confident were the crew in
cleveland's superior address and management that the temporary
deposition of goffe found little resistance even among his own
partisans who reasonably enough observed he might at least have kept
sober to look after his own business e'en let him put it to rights
again himself next morning if he will

but when the next morning came the drunken part of the crew being
informed of the issue of the deliberations of the council to which they
were virtually held to have assented showed such a superior sense of
cleveland's merits that goffe sulky and malecontent as he was judged
it wisest for the present to suppress his feelings of resentment until
a safer opportunity for suffering them to explode and to submit to the
degradation which so frequently took place among a piratical crew

cleveland on his part resolved to take upon him with spirit and
without loss of time the task of extricating his ship's company from
their perilous situation for this purpose he ordered the boat with
the purpose of going ashore in person carrying with him twelve of the
stoutest and best men of the crew all very handsomely appointed for
the success of their nefarious profession had enabled the pirates to
assume nearly as gay dresses as their officers and above all each man
being sufficiently armed with cutlass and pistols and several having
pole-axes and poniards

cleveland himself was gallantly attired in a blue coat lined with
crimson silk and laced with gold very richly crimson damask waistcoat
and breeches a velvet cap richly embroidered with a white feather
white silk stockings and red-heeled shoes which were the extremity of
finery among the gallants of the day he had a gold chain several times
folded round his neck which sustained a whistle of the same metal the
ensign of his authority above all he wore a decoration peculiar to
those daring depredators who besides one or perhaps two brace of
pistols at their belt had usually two additional brace of the finest
mounting and workmanship suspended over their shoulders in a sort of
sling or scarf of crimson ribbon the hilt and mounting of the captain's
sword corresponded in value to the rest of his appointments and his
natural good mien was so well adapted to the whole equipment that
when he appeared on deck he was received with a general shout by the
crew who as in other popular societies judged a great deal by the
eye

cleveland took with him in the boat amongst others his predecessor in
office goffe who was also very richly dressed but who not having the
advantage of such an exterior as cleveland's looked like a boorish
clown in the dress of a courtier or rather like a vulgar-faced footpad
decked in the spoils of some one whom he has murdered and whose claim
to the property of his garments is rendered doubtful in the eyes of all
who look upon him by the mixture of awkwardness remorse cruelty and
insolence which clouds his countenance cleveland probably chose to
take goffe ashore with him to prevent his having any opportunity
during his absence to debauch the crew from their allegiance in this
guise they left the ship and singing to their oars while the water
foamed higher at the chorus soon reached the quay of kirkwall

the command of the vessel was in the meantime intrusted to bunce upon
whose allegiance cleveland knew that he might perfectly depend and in
a private conversation with him of some length he gave him directions
how to act in such emergencies as might occur

these arrangements being made and bunce having been repeatedly charged
to stand upon his guard alike against the adherents of goffe and any
attempt from the shore the boat put off as she approached the harbour
cleveland displayed a white flag and could observe that their
appearance seemed to occasion a good deal of bustle and alarm people
were seen running to and fro and some of them appeared to be getting
under arms the battery was manned hastily and the english colours
displayed these were alarming symptoms the rather that cleveland knew
that though there were no artillerymen in kirkwall yet there were many
sailors perfectly competent to the management of great guns and willing
enough to undertake such service in case of need

noting these hostile preparations with a heedful eye but suffering
nothing like doubt or anxiety to appear on his countenance cleveland
ran the boat right for the quay on which several people armed with
muskets rifles and fowlingpieces and others with half-pikes and
whaling-knives were now assembled as if to oppose his landing
apparently however they had not positively determined what measures
they were to pursue for when the boat reached the quay those
immediately opposite bore back and suffered cleveland and his party to
leap ashore without hinderance they immediately drew up on the quay
except two who as their captain had commanded remained in the boat
which they put off to a little distance a manoeuvre which while it
placed the boat the only one belonging to the sloop out of danger of
being seized indicated a sort of careless confidence in cleveland and
his party which was calculated to intimidate their opponents

the kirkwallers however showed the old northern blood put a manly
face upon the matter and stood upon the quay with their arms
shouldered directly opposite to the rovers and blocking up against
them the street which leads to the town

cleveland was the first who spoke as the parties stood thus looking
upon each other how is this gentlemen burghers he said are you
orkney folks turned highlandmen that you are all under arms so early
this morning or have you manned the quay to give me the honour of a
salute upon taking the command of my ship

the burghers looked on each other and one of them replied to
cleveland we do not know who you are it was that other man pointing
to goffe who used to come ashore as captain

that other gentleman is my mate and commands in my absence said
cleveland but what is that to the purpose i wish to speak with your
lord mayor or whatever you call him

the provost is sitting in council with the magistrates answered the
spokesman

so much the better replied cleveland where do their worships
meet

in the council-house answered the other

then make way for us gentlemen if you please for my people and i are
going there

there was a whisper among the townspeople but several were unresolved
upon engaging in a desperate and perhaps an unnecessary conflict with
desperate men and the more determined citizens formed the hasty
reflection that the strangers might be more easily mastered in the
house or perhaps in the narrow streets which they had to traverse than
when they stood drawn up and prepared for battle upon the quay they
suffered them therefore to proceed unmolested and cleveland moving
very slowly keeping his people close together suffering no one to
press upon the flanks of his little detachment and making four men who
constituted his rear-guard turn round and face to the rear from time to
time rendered it by his caution a very dangerous task to make any
attempt upon them

in this manner they ascended the narrow street and reached the
council-house where the magistrates were actually sitting as the
citizen had informed cleveland here the inhabitants began to press
forward with the purpose of mingling with the pirates and availing
themselves of the crowd in the narrow entrance to secure as many as
they could without allowing them room for the free use of their
weapons but this also had cleveland foreseen and ere entering the
council-room he caused the entrance to be cleared and secured
commanding four of his men to face down the street and as many to
confront the crowd who were thrusting each other from above the
burghers recoiled back from the ferocious swarthy and sunburnt
countenances as well as the levelled arms of these desperadoes and
cleveland with the rest of his party entered the council-room where
the magistrates were sitting in council with very little attendance
these gentlemen were thus separated effectually from the citizens who
looked to them for orders and were perhaps more completely at the mercy
of cleveland than he with his little handful of men could be said to
be at that of the multitude by whom they were surrounded

the magistrates seemed sensible of their danger for they looked upon
each other in some confusion when cleveland thus addressed them 

good morrow gentlemen i hope there is no unkindness betwixt us i am
come to talk with you about getting supplies for my ship yonder in the
roadstead we cannot sail without them

your ship sir said the provost who was a man of sense and
spirit how do we know that you are her captain

look at me said cleveland and you will i think scarce ask the
question again

the magistrate looked at kim and accordingly did not think proper to
pursue that part of the enquiry but proceeded to say and if you are
her captain whence comes she and where is she bound for you look too
much like a man-of-war's man to be master of a trader and we know that
you do not belong to the british navy

there are more men-of-war on the sea than sail under the british flag
replied cleveland but say that i were commander of a free-trader here
willing to exchange tobacco brandy gin and such like for cured fish
and hides why i do not think i deserve so very bad usage from the
merchants of kirkwall as to deny me provisions for my money

look you captain said the town-clerk it is not that we are so very
strait-laced neither for when gentlemen of your cloth come this way
it is as weel as i tauld the provost just to do as the collier did
when he met the devil and that is to have naething to say to them if
they have naething to say to us and there is the gentleman pointing
to goffe that was captain before you and may be captain after
you the cuckold speaks truth in that muttered goffe he knows
well how handsomely we entertained him till he and his men took upon
them to run through the town like hellicat devils i see one of them
there that was the very fellow that stopped my servant-wench on the
street as she carried the lantern home before me and insulted her
before my face

if it please your noble mayorship's honour and glory said derrick
the fellow at whom the town-clerk pointed it was not i that brought
to the bit of a tender that carried the lantern in the poop it was
quite a different sort of a person

who was it then sir said the provost

why please your majesty's worship said derrick making several sea
bows and describing as nearly as he could the exterior of the worthy
magistrate himself he was an elderly gentleman dutch-built round in
the stern with a white wig and a red nose very like your majesty i
think then turning to a comrade he added jack don't you think the
fellow that wanted to kiss the pretty girl with the lantern t'other
night was very like his worship

by g  tom derrick answered the party appealed to i believe it is
the very man

this is insolence which we can make you repent of gentlemen said the
magistrate justly irritated at their effrontery you have behaved in
this town as if you were in an indian village at madagascar you
yourself captain if captain you be were at the head of another riot
no longer since than yesterday we will give you no provisions till we
know better whom we are supplying and do not think to bully us when i
shake this handkerchief out at the window which is at my elbow your
ship goes to the bottom remember she lies under the guns of our
battery

and how many of these guns are honeycombed mr mayor said cleveland
he put the question by chance but instantly perceived from a sort of
confusion which the provost in vain endeavoured to hide that the
artillery of kirkwall was not in the best order come come mr
mayor he said bullying will go down with us as little as with you
your guns yonder will do more harm to the poor old sailors who are to
work them than to our sloop and if we bring a broadside to bear on the
town why your wives crockery will be in some danger and then to talk
to us of seamen being a little frolicsome ashore why when are they
otherwise you have the greenland whalers playing the devil among you
every now and then and the very dutchmen cut capers in the streets of
kirkwall like porpoises before a gale of wind i am told you are a man
of sense and i am sure you and i could settle this matter in the course
of a five-minutes palaver

well sir said the provost i will hear what you have to say if you
will walk this way

cleveland accordingly followed him into a small interior apartment and
when there addressed the provost thus i will lay aside my pistols
sir if you are afraid of them

d  n your pistols answered the provost i have served the king
and fear the smell of powder as little as you do

so much the better said cleveland for you will hear me the more
coolly now sir let us be what perhaps you suspect us or let us be
any thing else what in the name of heaven can you get by keeping us
here but blows and bloodshed for which believe me we are much better
provided than you can pretend to be the point is a plain one you are
desirous to be rid of us we are desirous to be gone let us have the
means of departure and we leave you instantly

look ye captain said the provost i thirst for no man's blood you
are a pretty fellow as there were many among the buccaniers in my
time but there is no harm in wishing you a better trade you should
have the stores and welcome for your money so you would make these
seas clear of you but then here lies the rub the halcyon frigate is
expected here in these parts immediately when she hears of you she will
be at you for there is nothing the white lapelle loves better than a
rover you are seldom without a cargo of dollars well he comes down
gets you under his stern  

blows us into the air if you please said cleveland

nay that must be as you please captain said the provost but
then what is to come of the good town of kirkwall that has been
packing and peeling with the king's enemies the burgh will be laid
under a round fine and it may be that the provost may not come off so
easily

well then said cleveland i see where your pinch lies now suppose
that i run round this island of yours and get into the roadstead at
stromness we could get what we want put on board there without
kirkwall or the provost seeming to have any hand in it or if it should
be ever questioned your want of force and our superior strength will
make a sufficient apology

that may be said the provost but if i suffer you to leave your
present station and go elsewhere i must have some security that you
will not do harm to the country

and we said cleveland must have some security on our side that you
will not detain us by dribbling out our time till the halcyon is on the
coast now i am myself perfectly willing to continue on shore as a
hostage on the one side provided you will give me your word not to
betray me and send some magistrate or person of consequence aboard
the sloop where his safety will be a guarantee for mine

the provost shook his head and intimated it would be difficult to find
a person willing to place himself as hostage in such a perilous
condition but said he would propose the arrangement to such of the
council as were fit to be trusted with a matter of such weight

 this was really an exploit of the celebrated avery the pirate who
suddenly and without provocation fired his pistols under the table
where he sat drinking with his messmates wounded one man severely and
thought the matter a good jest what is still more extraordinary his
crew regarded it in the same light

chapter xv

 i left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep

 dibdin


when the provost and cleveland had returned into the public
council-room the former retired a second time with such of his brethren
as he thought proper to advise with and while they were engaged in
discussing cleveland's proposal refreshments were offered to him and
his party these the captain permitted his people to partake of but
with the greatest precaution against surprisal one party relieving the
guard whilst the others were at their food

he himself in the meanwhile walked up and down the apartment and
conversed upon indifferent subjects with those present like a person
quite at his ease

amongst these individuals he saw somewhat to his surprise triptolemus
yellowley who chancing to be at kirkwall had been summoned by the
magistrates as representative in a certain degree of the lord
chamberlain to attend council on this occasion cleveland immediately
renewed the acquaintance which he had formed with the agriculturist at
burgh-westra and asked him his present business in orkney

just to look after some of my little plans captain cleveland i am
weary of fighting with wild beasts at ephesus yonder and i just cam
ower to see how my orchard was thriving whilk i had planted four or
five miles from kirkwall it may be a year bygane and how the bees were
thriving whereof i had imported nine skeps for the improvement of the
country and for the turning of the heather-bloom into wax and honey

and they thrive i hope said cleveland who however little
interested in the matter sustained the conversation as if to break the
chilly and embarrassed silence which hung upon the company assembled

thrive replied triptolemus they thrive like every thing else in
this country and that is the backward way

want of care i suppose said cleveland

the contrary sir quite and clean the contrary replied the factor
they died of ower muckle care like lucky christie's chickens i asked
to see the skeps and cunning and joyful did the fallow look who was to
have taken care of them had there been ony body in charge but mysell
he said ye might have seen the skeps or whatever you ca them but
there wad hae been as mony solan-geese as flees in them if it hadna
been for my four quarters for i watched them so closely that i saw
them a creeping out at the little holes one sunny morning and if i had
not stopped the leak on the instant with a bit clay the deil a bee or
flee or whatever they are would have been left in the skeps as ye ca
them in a word sir he had clagged up the hives as if the puir
things had had the pestilence and my bees were as dead as if they had
been smeaked and so ends my hope generandi gloria mellis as
virgilius hath it

there is an end of your mead then replied cleveland but what is
your chance of cider how does the orchard thrive

o captain this same solomon of the orcadian ophir i am sure no man
need to send thither to fetch either talents of gold or talents of
sense i say this wise man had watered the young apple-trees in his
great tenderness with hot water and they are perished root and
branch but what avails grieving and i wish you would tell me
instead what is all the din that these good folks are making about
pirates and what for all these ill-looking men that are armed like so
mony highlandmen assembled in the judgment-chamber for i am just come
from the other side of the island and i have heard nothing distinct
about it and now i look at you yoursell captain i think you have
mair of these foolish pistolets about you than should suffice an honest
man in quiet times

and so i think too said the pacific triton old haagen who had been
an unwilling follower of the daring montrose if you had been in the
glen of edderachyllis when we were sae sair worried by sir john
worry  

you have forgot the whole matter neighbour haagen said the factor
sir john urry was on your side and was ta'en with montrose by the
same token he lost his head

did he said the triton i believe you may be right for he changed
sides mair than anes and wha kens whilk he died for but always he was
there and so was i a fight there was and i never wish to see
another

the entrance of the provost here interrupted their desultory
conversation we have determined he said captain that your ship
shall go round to stromness or scalpa-flow to take in stores in order
that there may be no more quarrels between the fair folks and your
seamen and as you wish to stay on shore to see the fair we intend to
send a respectable gentleman on board your vessel to pilot her round the
mainland as the navigation is but ticklish

spoken like a quiet and sensible magistrate mr mayor said
cleveland and no otherwise than as i expected and what gentleman is
to honour our quarter-deck during my absence

we have fixed that too captain cleveland said the provost you may
be sure we were each more desirous than another to go upon so pleasant a
voyage and in such good company but being fair time most of us have
some affairs in hand i myself in respect of my office cannot be well
spared the eldest bailie's wife is lying-in the treasurer does not
agree with the sea two bailies have the gout the other two are absent
from town and the other fifteen members of council are all engaged on
particular business

all that i can tell you mr mayor said cleveland raising his voice
is that i expect  

a moment's patience if you please captain said the provost
interrupting him so that we have come to the resolution that our
worthy mr triptolemus yellowley who is factor to the lord chamberlain
of these islands shall in respect of his official situation be
preferred to the honour and pleasure of accompanying you

me said the astonished triptolemus what the devil should i do going
on your voyages my business is on dry land

the gentlemen want a pilot said the provost whispering to him and
there is no eviting to give them one

do they want to go bump on shore then said the factor how the
devil should i pilot them that never touched rudder in my life

hush hush be silent said the provost if the people of this town
heard ye say such a word your utility and respect and rank and every
thing else is clean gone no man is any thing with us island folks
unless he can hand reef and steer besides it is but a mere form
and we will send old pate sinclair to help you you will have nothing to
do but to eat drink and be merry all day

eat and drink said the factor not able to comprehend exactly why
this piece of duty was pressed upon him so hastily and yet not very
capable of resisting or extricating himself from the toils of the more
knowing provost eat and drink that is all very well but to speak
truth the sea does not agree with me any more than with the treasurer
and i have always a better appetite for eating and drinking ashore

hush hush hush again said the provost in an under tone of earnest
expostulation would you actually ruin your character out and out a
factor of the high chamberlain of the isles of orkney and zetland and
not like the sea you might as well say you are a highlander and do
not like whisky

you must settle it somehow gentlemen said captain cleveland it is
time we were under weigh mr triptolemus yellowley are we to be
honoured with your company

i am sure captain cleveland stammered the factor i would have no
objection to go anywhere with you only  

he has no objection said the provost catching at the first limb of
the sentence without awaiting the conclusion

he has no objection cried the treasurer

he has no objection sung out the whole four bailies together
and the fifteen councillors all catching up the same phrase of
assent repeated it in chorus with the additions of good
man public-spirited honourable gentleman burgh eternally
obliged where will you find such a worthy factor and so forth

astonished and confused at the praises with which he was overwhelmed on
all sides and in no shape understanding the nature of the transaction
that was going forward the astounded and overwhelmed agriculturist
became incapable of resisting the part of the kirkwall curtius thus
insidiously forced upon him and was delivered up by captain cleveland
to his party with the strictest injunctions to treat him with honour
and attention goffe and his companions began now to lead him off amid
the applauses of the whole meeting after the manner in which the victim
of ancient days was garlanded and greeted by shouts when consigned to
the priests for the purpose of being led to the altar and knocked on
the head a sacrifice for the commonweal it was while they thus
conducted and in a manner forced him out of the council-chamber that
poor triptolemus much alarmed at finding that cleveland in whom he had
some confidence was to remain behind the party tried when just going
out at the door the effect of one remonstrating bellow nay but
provost captain bailies treasurer councillors if captain
cleveland does not go aboard to protect me it is nae bargain and go i
will not unless i am trailed with cart-ropes

his protest was however drowned in the unanimous chorus of the
magistrates and councillors returning him thanks for his public
spirit wishing him a good voyage and praying to heaven for his happy
and speedy return stunned and overwhelmed and thinking if he had any
distinct thoughts at all that remonstrance was vain where friends and
strangers seemed alike determined to carry the point against him
triptolemus without farther resistance suffered himself to be
conducted into the street where the pirate's boat's-crew assembling
around him began to move slowly towards the quay many of the townsfolk
following out of curiosity but without any attempt at interference or
annoyance for the pacific compromise which the dexterity of the first
magistrate had achieved was unanimously approved of as a much better
settlement of the disputes betwixt them and the strangers than might
have been attained by the dubious issue of an appeal to arms

meanwhile as they went slowly along triptolemus had time to study the
appearance countenance and dress of those into whose hands he had
been thus delivered and began to imagine that he read in their looks
not only the general expression of a desperate character but some
sinister intentions directed particularly towards himself he was
alarmed by the truculent looks of goffe in particular who holding his
arm with a gripe which resembled in delicacy of touch the compression of
a smith's vice cast on him from the outer corner of his eye oblique
glances like those which the eagle throws upon the prey which she has
clutched ere yet she proceeds as it is technically called to plume
it at length yellowley's fears got so far the better of his prudence
that he fairly asked his terrible conductor in a sort of crying
whisper are you going to murder me captain in the face of the laws
baith of god and man

hold your peace if you are wise said goffe who had his own reasons
for desiring to increase the panic of his captive we have not murdered
a man these three months and why should you put us in mind of it

you are but joking i hope good worthy captain replied triptolemus
this is worse than witches dwarfs dirking of whales and cowping of
cobles put all together this is an away-ganging crop with a
vengeance what good in heaven's name would murdering me do to you

we might have some pleasure in it at least said goffe look these
fellows in the face and see if you see one among them that would not
rather kill a man than let it alone but we will speak more of that
when you have first had a taste of the bilboes unless indeed you come
down with a handsome round handful of chili boards for your ransom

as i shall live by bread captain answered the factor that
misbegotten dwarf has carried off the whole hornful of silver

a cat-and-nine-tails will make you find it again said goffe gruffly
flogging and pickling is an excellent receipt to bring a man's wealth
into his mind twisting a bowstring round his skull till the eyes start
a little is a very good remembrancer too

captain replied yellowley stoutly i have no money seldom can
improvers have we turn pasture to tillage and barley into aits and
heather into greensward and the poor yarpha as the benighted
creatures here call their peat-bogs into baittle grass-land but we
seldom make any thing of it that comes back to our ain pouch the carles
and the cart-avers make it all and the carles and the cart-avers eat it
all and the deil clink doun with it

well well said goffe if you be really a poor fellow as you
pretend i'll stand your friend then inclining his head so as to
reach the ear of the factor who stood on tiptoe with anxiety he said
if you love your life do not enter the boat with us

but how am i to get away from you while you hold me so fast by the
arm that i could not get off if the whole year's crop of scotland
depended on it

hark ye you gudgeon said goffe just when you come to the water's
edge and when the fellows are jumping in and taking their oars slue
yourself round suddenly to the larboard i will let go your arm and
then cut and run for your life

triptolemus did as he was desired goffe's willing hand relaxed the
grasp as he had promised the agriculturist trundled off like a football
that has just received a strong impulse from the foot of one of the
players and with celerity which surprised himself as well as all
beholders fled through the town of kirkwall nay such was the impetus
of his retreat that as if the grasp of the pirate was still open to
pounce upon him he never stopped till he had traversed the whole town
and attained the open country on the other side they who had seen him
that day his hat and wig lost in the sudden effort he had made to bolt
forward his cravat awry and his waistcoat unbuttoned and who had an
opportunity of comparing his round spherical form and short legs with
the portentous speed at which he scoured through the street might well
say that if fury ministers arms fear confers wings his very mode of
running seemed to be that peculiar to his fleecy care for like a ram
in the midst of his race he ever and anon encouraged himself by a great
bouncing attempt at a leap though there were no obstacles in his way

there was no pursuit after the agriculturist and though a musket or two
were presented for the purpose of sending a leaden messenger after him
yet goffe turning peace-maker for once in his life so exaggerated the
dangers that would attend a breach of the truce with the people of
kirkwall that he prevailed upon the boat's crew to forbear any active
hostilities and to pull off for their vessel with all dispatch

the burghers who regarded the escape of triptolemus as a triumph on
their side gave the boat three cheers by way of an insulting farewell
while the magistrates on the other hand entertained great anxiety
respecting the probable consequences of this breach of articles between
them and the pirates and could they have seized upon the fugitive very
privately instead of complimenting him with a civic feast in honour of
the agility which he displayed it is likely they might have delivered
the runaway hostage once more into the hands of his foemen but it was
impossible to set their face publicly to such an act of violence and
therefore they contented themselves with closely watching cleveland
whom they determined to make responsible for any aggression which might
be attempted by the pirates cleveland on his part easily conjectured
that the motive which goffe had for suffering the hostage to escape was
to leave him answerable for all consequences and relying more on the
attachment and intelligence of his friend and adherent frederick
altamont alias jack bunce than on any thing else expected the result
with considerable anxiety since the magistrates though they continued
to treat him with civility plainly intimated they would regulate his
treatment by the behaviour of the crew though he no longer commanded
them

it was not however without some reason that he reckoned on the devoted
fidelity of bunce for no sooner did that trusty adherent receive from
goffe and the boat's crew the news of the escape of triptolemus than
he immediately concluded it had been favoured by the late captain in
order that cleveland being either put to death or consigned to hopeless
imprisonment goffe might be called upon to resume the command of the
vessel

but the drunken old boatswain shall miss his mark said bunce to his
confederate fletcher or else i am contented to quit the name of
altamont and be called jack bunce or jack dunce if you like it
better to the end of the chapter

availing himself accordingly of a sort of nautical eloquence which his
enemies termed slack-jaw bunce set before the crew in a most animated
manner the disgrace which they all sustained by their captain
remaining as he was pleased to term it in the bilboes without any
hostage to answer for his safety and succeeded so far that besides
exciting a good deal of discontent against goffe he brought the crew to
the resolution of seizing the first vessel of a tolerable appearance
and declaring that the ship crew and cargo should be dealt with
according to the usage which cleveland should receive on shore it was
judged at the same time proper to try the faith of the orcadians by
removing from the roadstead of kirkwall and going round to that of
stromness where according to the treaty betwixt provost torfe and
captain cleveland they were to victual their sloop they resolved in
the meantime to intrust the command of the vessel to a council
consisting of goffe the boatswain and bunce himself until cleveland
should be in a situation to resume his command

these resolutions having been proposed and acceded to they weighed
anchor and got their sloop under sail without experiencing any
opposition or annoyance from the battery which relieved them of one
important apprehension incidental to their situation

chapter xvi

 clap on more sail pursue up with your fights
 give fire she is my prize or ocean whelm them all

 shakspeare


a very handsome brig which with several other vessels was the
property of magnus troil the great zetland udaller had received on
board that magnate himself his two lovely daughters and the facetious
claud halcro who for friendship's sake chiefly and the love of beauty
proper to his poetical calling attended them on their journey from
zetland to the capital of orkney to which norna had referred them as
the place where her mystical oracles should at length receive a
satisfactory explanation

they passed at a distance the tremendous cliffs of the lonely spot of
earth called the fair isle which at an equal distance from either
archipelago lies in the sea which divides orkney from zetland and at
length after some baffling winds made the start of sanda off the
headland so named they became involved in a strong current well known
by those who frequent these seas as the roost of the start which
carried them considerably out of their course and joined to an adverse
wind forced them to keep on the east side of the island of stronsa
and finally compelled them to lie by for the night in papa sound since
the navigation in dark or thick weather amongst so many low islands is
neither pleasant nor safe

on the ensuing morning they resumed their voyage under more favourable
auspices and coasting along the island of stronsa whose flat
verdant and comparatively fertile shores formed a strong contrast to
the dun hills and dark cliffs of their own islands they doubled the
cape called the lambhead and stood away for kirkwall

they had scarce opened the beautiful bay betwixt pomona and shapinsha
and the sisters were admiring the massive church of saint magnus as it
was first seen to rise from amongst the inferior buildings of kirkwall
when the eyes of magnus and of claud halcro were attracted by an
object which they thought more interesting this was an armed sloop
with her sails set which had just left the anchorage in the bay and
was running before the wind by which the brig of the udaller was beating
in

a tight thing that by my ancestors bones said the old udaller but
i cannot make out of what country as she shows no colours spanish
built i should think her

ay ay said claud halcro she has all the look of it she runs
before the wind that we must battle with which is the wonted way of the
world as glorious john says 

 with roomy deck and guns of mighty strength
 whose low-laid mouths each mounting billow laves
 deep in her draught and warlike in her length
 she seems a sea-wasp flying on the waves

brenda could not help telling halcro when he had spouted this stanza
with great enthusiasm that though the description was more like a
first-rate than a sloop yet the simile of the sea-wasp served but
indifferently for either

a sea-wasp said magnus looking with some surprise as the sloop
shifting her course suddenly bore down on them egad i wish she may
not show us presently that she has a sting

what the udaller said in jest was fulfilled in earnest for without
hoisting colours or hailing two shots were discharged from the sloop
one of which ran dipping and dancing upon the water just ahead of the
zetlander's bows while the other went through his main-sail

magnus caught up a speaking-trumpet and hailed the sloop to demand
what she was and what was the meaning of this unprovoked aggression he
was only answered by the stern command down top-sails instantly and
lay your main-sail to the mast you shall see who we are presently

there were no means within the reach of possibility by which obedience
could be evaded where it would instantly have been enforced by a
broadside and with much fear on the part of the sisters and claud
halcro mixed with anger and astonishment on that of the udaller the
brig lay-to to await the commands of the captors

the sloop immediately lowered a boat with six armed hands commanded by
jack bunce which rowed directly for their prize as they approached
her claud halcro whispered to the udaller if what we hear of
buccaniers be true these men with their silk scarfs and vests have
the very cut of them

my daughters my daughters muttered magnus to himself with such an
agony as only a father could feel go down below and hide yourselves
girls while i  

he threw down his speaking-trumpet and seized on a handspike while his
daughters more afraid of the consequences of his fiery temper to
himself than of any thing else hung round him and begged him to make
no resistance claud halcro united his entreaties adding it were best
pacify the fellows with fair words they might he said be
dunkirkers or insolent man-of-war's men on a frolic

no no answered magnus it is the sloop which the jagger told us of
but i will take your advice i will have patience for these girls
sakes yet  

he had no time to conclude the sentence for bunce jumped on board with
his party and drawing his cutlass struck it upon the companion-ladder
and declared the ship was theirs

by what warrant or authority do you stop us on the high seas said
magnus

here are half a dozen of warrants said bunce showing the pistols
which were hung round him according to a pirate-fashion already
mentioned choose which you like old gentleman and you shall have the
perusal of it presently

that is to say you intend to rob us said magnus so be it we have
no means to help it only be civil to the women and take what you
please from the vessel there is not much but i will and can make it
worth more if you use us well

civil to the women said fletcher who had also come on board with the
gang when were we else than civil to them ay and kind to boot look
here jack bunce what a trim-going little thing here is by g  she
shall make a cruize with us come of old squaretoes what will

he seized upon the terrified brenda with one hand and insolently
pulled back with the other the hood of the mantle in which she had
muffled herself

help father help minna exclaimed the affrighted girl
unconscious at the moment that they were unable to render her
assistance

magnus again uplifted the handspike but bunce stopped his
hand avast father he said or you will make a bad voyage of it
presently and you fletcher let go the girl

and d  n me why should i let her go said fletcher

because i command you dick said the other and because i'll make it
a quarrel else and now let me know beauties is there one of you
bears that queer heathen name of minna for which i have a certain sort
of regard

gallant sir said halcro unquestionably it is because you have some
poetry in your heart

i have had enough of it in my mouth in my time answered bunce but
that day is by old gentleman however i shall soon find out which of
these girls is minna throw back your mufflings from your faces and
don't be afraid my lindamiras no one here shall meddle with you to do
you wrong on my soul two pretty wenches i wish i were at sea in an
egg-shell and a rock under my lee-bow if i would wish a better
leaguer-lass than the worst of them hark you my girls which of you
would like to swing in a rover's hammock you should have gold for the
gathering

the terrified maidens clung close together and grew pale at the bold
and familiar language of the desperate libertine

nay don't be frightened said he no one shall serve under the
noble altamont but by her own free choice there is no pressing amongst
gentlemen of fortune and do not look so shy upon me neither as if i
spoke of what you never thought of before one of you at least has
heard of captain cleveland the rover

brenda grew still paler but the blood mounted at once in minna's
cheeks on hearing the name of her lover thus unexpectedly introduced
for the scene was in itself so confounding that the idea of the
vessel's being the consort of which cleveland had spoken at
burgh-westra had occurred to no one save the udaller

i see how it is said bunce with a familiar nod and i will hold my
course accordingly you need not be afraid of any injury father he
added addressing magnus familiarly and though i have made many a
pretty girl pay tribute in my time yet yours shall go ashore without
either wrong or ransom

if you will assure me of that said magnus you are as welcome to the
brig and cargo as ever i made man welcome to a can of punch

and it is no bad thing that same can of punch said bunce if we had
any one here that could mix it well

i will do it said claud halcro with any man that ever squeezed
lemon eric scambester the punch-maker of burgh-westra being alone
excepted

and you are within a grapnel's length of him too said the
udaller go down below my girls he added and send up the rare old
man and the punch-bowl

the punch-bowl said fletcher i say the bucket d  n me talk
of bowls in the cabin of a paltry merchantman but not to
gentlemen-strollers rovers i would say correcting himself as he
observed that bunce looked sour at the mistake

and i say these two pretty girls shall stay on deck and fill my can
said bunce i deserve some attendance at least for all my
generosity

and they shall fill mine too said fletcher they shall fill it to
the brim and i will have a kiss for every drop they spill broil me if
i won't

why then i tell you you shan't said bunce for i'll be d  d if
any one shall kiss minna but one and that's neither you nor i and her
other little bit of a consort shall scape for company there are
plenty of willing wenches in orkney and so now i think on it these
girls shall go down below and bolt themselves into the cabin and we
shall have the punch up here on deck al fresco as the old gentleman
proposes

why jack i wish you knew your own mind said fletcher i have been
your messmate these two years and i love you and yet flay me like a
wild bullock if you have not as many humours as a monkey and what
shall we have to make a little fun of since you have sent the girls
down below

why we will have master punch-maker here answered bunce to give us
toasts and sing us songs and in the meantime you there stand by
sheets and tacks and get her under way and you steersman as you
would keep your brains in your skull keep her under the stern of the
sloop if you attempt to play us any trick i will scuttle your sconce
as if it were an old calabash

the vessel was accordingly got under way and moved slowly on in the
wake of the sloop which as had been previously agreed upon held her
course not to return to the bay of kirkwall but for an excellent
roadstead called inganess bay formed by a promontory which extends to
the eastward two or three miles from the orcadian metropolis and where
the vessels might conveniently lie at anchor while the rovers
maintained any communication with the magistrates which the new state of
things seemed to require

meantime claud halcro had exerted his utmost talents in compounding a
bucketful of punch for the use of the pirates which they drank out of
large cans the ordinary seamen as well as bunce and fletcher who
acted as officers dipping them into the bucket with very little
ceremony as they came and went upon their duty magnus who was
particularly apprehensive that liquor might awaken the brutal passions
of these desperadoes was yet so much astonished at the quantities which
he saw them drink without producing any visible effect upon their
reason that he could not help expressing his surprise to bunce himself
who wild as he was yet appeared by far the most civil and conversable
of his party and whom he was perhaps desirous to conciliate by a
compliment of which all boon topers know the value

bones of saint magnus said the udaller i used to think i took off
my can like a gentleman but to see your men swallow captain one would
think their stomachs were as bottomless as the hole of laifell in foula
which i have sounded myself with a line of an hundred fathoms by my
soul the bicker of saint magnus were but a sip to them

in our way of life sir answered bunce there is no stint till duty
calls or the puncheon is drunk out

by my word sir said claud halcro i believe there is not one of
your people but could drink out the mickle bicker of scarpa which was
always offered to the bishop of orkney brimful of the best bummock that
ever was brewed

if drinking could make them bishops said bunce i should have a
reverend crew of them but as they have no other clerical qualities
about them i do not propose that they shall get drunk to-day so we
will cut our drink with a song

and i'll sing it by    said or swore dick fletcher and instantly
struck up the old ditty 

 it was a ship and a ship of fame
 launch'd off the stocks bound for the main
 with an hundred and fifty brisk young men
 all pick'd and chosen every one

i would sooner be keel-hauled than hear that song over again said
bunce and confound your lantern jaws you can squeeze nothing else out
of them

by    said fletcher i will sing my song whether you like it or
no and again he sung with the doleful tone of a north-easter
whistling through sheet and shrouds 

 captain glen was our captain's name
 a very gallant and brisk young man
 as bold a sailor as e'er went to sea
 and we were bound for high barbary

i tell you again said bunce we will have none of your screech-owl
music here and i'll be d  d if you shall sit here and make that
infernal noise

why then i'll tell you what said fletcher getting up i'll sing
when i walk about and i hope there is no harm in that jack bunce and
so getting up from his seat he began to walk up and down the sloop
croaking out his long and disastrous ballad

you see how i manage them said bunce with a smile of
self-applause allow that fellow two strides on his own way and you
make a mutineer of him for life but i tie him strict up and he follows
me as kindly as a fowler's spaniel after he has got a good beating and
now your toast and your song sir addressing halcro or rather your
song without your toast i have got a toast for myself here is success
to all roving blades and confusion to all honest men

i should be sorry to drink that toast if i could help it said magnus
troil

what you reckon yourself one of the honest folks i warrant said
bunce tell me your trade and i'll tell you what i think of it as
for the punch-maker here i knew him at first glance to be a tailor who
has therefore no more pretensions to be honest than he has not to be
mangy but you are some high-dutch skipper i warrant me that tramples
on the cross when he is in japan and denies his religion for a day's
gain

no replied the udaller i am a gentleman of zetland

o what retorted the satirical mr bunce you are come from the
happy climate where gin is a groat a-bottle and where there is daylight
for ever

at your service captain said the udaller suppressing with much
pain some disposition to resent these jests on his country although
under every risk and at all disadvantage

at my service said bunce ay if there was a rope stretched from
the wreck to the beach you would be at my service to cut the hawser
make floatsome and jetsome of ship and cargo and well if you did
not give me a rap on the head with the back of the cutty-axe and you
call yourself honest but never mind here goes the aforesaid toast and
do you sing me a song mr fashioner and look it be as good as your
punch

halcro internally praying for the powers of a new timotheus to turn
his strain and check his auditor's pride as glorious john had it began
a heart-soothing ditty with the following lines 

 maidens fresh as fairest rose
 listen to this lay of mine

i will hear nothing of maidens or roses said bunce it puts me in
mind what sort of a cargo we have got on board and by    i will be
true to my messmate and my captain as long as i can and now i think
on't i'll have no more punch either that last cup made innovation and
i am not to play cassio to-night and if i drink not nobody else
shall

so saying he manfully kicked over the bucket which notwithstanding
the repeated applications made to it was still half full got up from
his seat shook himself a little to rights as he expressed it cocked
his hat and walking the quarter-deck with an air of dignity gave by
word and signal the orders for bringing the ships to anchor which
were readily obeyed by both goffe being then in all probability past
any rational state of interference

the udaller in the meantime condoled with halcro on their situation
it is bad enough said the tough old norseman for these are rank
rogues and yet were it not for the girls i should not fear them that
young vapouring fellow who seems to command is not such a born devil
as he might have been

he has queer humours though said halcro and i wish we were loose
from him to kick down a bucket half full of the best punch ever was
made and to cut me short in the sweetest song i ever wrote i promise
you i do not know what he may do next it is next door to madness

meanwhile the ships being brought to anchor the valiant lieutenant
bunce called upon fletcher and resuming his seat by his unwilling
passengers he told them they should see what message he was about to
send to the wittols of kirkwall as they were something concerned in it
it shall run in dick's name he said as well as in mine i love to
give the poor young fellow a little countenance now and then don't i
dick you d  d stupid ass

why yes jack bunce said dick i can't say but as you do only you
are always bullocking one about something or other too but
howsomdever d'ye see  

enough said belay your jaw dick said bunce and proceeded to write
his epistle which being read aloud proved to be of the following
tenor

 for the mayor and aldermen of kirkwall gentlemen as contrary
 to your good faith given you have not sent us on board a hostage
 for the safety of our captain remaining on shore at your
 request these come to tell you we are not thus to be trifled
 with we have already in our possession a brig with a family of
 distinction its owners and passengers and as you deal with our
 captain so will we deal with them in every respect and as this
 is the first so assure yourselves it shall not be the last damage
 which we will do to your town and trade if you do not send on
 board our captain and supply us with stores according to treaty

 given on board the brig mergoose of burgh-westra lying in
 inganess bay witness our hands commanders of the fortune's
 favourite and gentlemen adventurers

he then subscribed himself frederick altamont and handed the letter to
fletcher who read the said subscription with much difficulty and
admiring the sound of it very much swore he would have a new name
himself and the rather that fletcher was the most crabbed word to spell
and conster he believed in the whole dictionary he subscribed himself
accordingly timothy tugmutton

will you not add a few lines to the coxcombs said bunce addressing
magnus

not i returned the udaller stubborn in his ideas of right and wrong
even in so formidable an emergency the magistrates of kirkwall know
their duty and were i they  but here the recollection that his
daughters were at the mercy of these ruffians blanked the bold visage
of magnus troil and checked the defiance which was just about to issue
from his lips

d  n me said bunce who easily conjectured what was passing in the
mind of his prisoner that pause would have told well on the stage it
would have brought down pit box and gallery egad as bayes has it

i will hear nothing of bayes said claud halcro himself a little
elevated it is an impudent satire on glorious john but he tickled
buckingham off for it 

 in the first rank of these did zimri stand
 a man so various  

hold your peace said bunce drowning the voice of the admirer of
dryden in louder and more vehement asseveration the rehearsal is the
best farce ever was written and i'll make him kiss the gunner's
daughter that denies it d  n me i was the best prince prettyman
ever walked the boards 

 sometimes a fisher's son sometimes a prince

but let us to business hark ye old gentleman to magnus you have
a sort of sulkiness about you for which some of my profession would cut
your ears out of your head and broil them for your dinner with red
pepper i have known goffe do so to a poor devil for looking sour and
dangerous when he saw his sloop go to davy jones's locker with his only
son on board but i'm a spirit of another sort and if you or the ladies
are ill used it shall be the kirkwall people's fault and not mine and
that's fair and so you had better let them know your condition and
your circumstances and so forth and that's fair too

magnus thus exhorted took up the pen and attempted to write but his
high spirit so struggled with his paternal anxiety that his hand
refused its office i cannot help it he said after one or two
illegible attempts to write i cannot form a letter if all our lives
depended upon it

and he could not with his utmost efforts so suppress the convulsive
emotions which he experienced but that they agitated his whole frame
the willow which bends to the tempest often escapes better than the oak
which resists it and so in great calamities it sometimes happens
that light and frivolous spirits recover their elasticity and presence
of mind sooner than those of a loftier character in the present case
claud halcro was fortunately able to perform the task which the deeper
feelings of his friend and patron refused he took the pen and in as
few words as possible explained the situation in which they were
placed and the cruel risks to which they were exposed insinuating at
the same time as delicately as he could express it that to the
magistrates of the country the life and honour of its citizens should
be a dearer object than even the apprehension or punishment of the
guilty taking care however to qualify the last expression as much as
possible for fear of giving umbrage to the pirates

bunce read over the letter which fortunately met his approbation and
on seeing the name of claud halcro at the bottom he exclaimed in great
surprise and with more energetic expressions of asseveration than we
choose to record why you are the little fellow that played the fiddle
to old manager gadabout's company at hogs norton the first season i
came out there i thought i knew your catchword of glorious john

at another time this recognition might not have been very grateful to
halcro's minstrel pride but as matters stood with him the discovery
of a golden mine could not have made him more happy he instantly
remembered the very hopeful young performer who came out in don
sebastian and judiciously added that the muse of glorious john had
never received such excellent support during the time that he was first
he might have added and only violin to mr gadabout's company

why yes said bunce i believe you are right i think i might have
shaken the scene as well as booth or betterton either but i was
destined to figure on other boards striking his foot upon the deck
and i believe i must stick by them till i find no board at all to
support me but now old acquaintance i will do something for you slue
yourself this way a bit i would have you solus they leaned over the
taffrail while bunce whispered with more seriousness than he usually
showed i am sorry for this honest old heart of norway pine blight me
if i am not and for the daughters too besides i have my own reasons
for befriending one of them i can be a wild fellow with a willing lass
of the game but to such decent and innocent creatures d  n me i am
scipio at numantia and alexander in the tent of darius you remember
how i touch off alexander here he started into heroics

 thus from the grave i rise to save my love
 all draw your swords with wings of lightning move
 when i rush on sure none will dare to stay 
 tis beauty calls and glory shows the way

claud halcro failed not to bestow the necessary commendations on his
declamation declaring that in his opinion as an honest man he had
always thought mr altamont's giving that speech far superior in tone
and energy to betterton

bunce or altamont wrung his hand tenderly ah you flatter me my
dear friend he said yet why had not the public some of your
judgment i should not then have been at this pass heaven knows my
dear mr halcro heaven knows with what pleasure i could keep you on
board with me just that i might have one friend who loves as much to
hear as i do to recite the choicest pieces of our finest dramatic
authors the most of us are beasts and for the kirkwall hostage
yonder he uses me egad as i use fletcher i think and huffs me the
more the more i do for him but how delightful it would be in a tropic
night when the ship was hanging on the breeze with a broad and steady
sail for me to rehearse alexander with you for my pit box and
gallery nay for you are a follower of the muses as i remember who
knows but you and i might be the means of inspiring like orpheus and
eurydice a pure taste into our companions and softening their manners
while we excited their better feelings

this was spoken with so much unction that claud halcro began to be
afraid he had both made the actual punch over potent and mixed too many
bewitching ingredients in the cup of flattery which he had administered
and that under the influence of both potions the sentimental pirate
might detain him by force merely to realize the scenes which his
imagination presented the conjuncture was however too delicate to
admit of any active effort on halcro's part to redeem his blunder and
therefore he only returned the tender pressure of his friend's hand and
uttered the interjection alas in as pathetic a tone as he could

bunce immediately resumed you are right my friend these are but
vain visions of felicity and it remains but for the unhappy altamont to
serve the friend to whom he is now to bid farewell i have determined to
put you and the two girls ashore with fletcher for your protection and
so call up the young women and let them begone before the devil get
aboard of me or of some one else you will carry my letter to the
magistrates and second it with your own eloquence and assure them
that if they hurt but one hair of cleveland's head there will be the
devil to pay and no pitch hot

relieved at heart by this unexpected termination of bunce's harangue
halcro descended the companion ladder two steps at a time and knocking
at the cabin door could scarce find intelligible language enough to say
his errand the sisters hearing with unexpected joy that they were to
be set ashore muffled themselves in their cloaks and when they
learned that the boat was hoisted out came hastily on deck where they
were apprized for the first time to their great horror that their
father was still to remain on board of the pirate

we will remain with him at every risk said minna we may be of some
assistance to him were it but for an instant we will live and die with
him

we shall aid him more surely said brenda who comprehended the nature
of their situation better than minna by interesting the people of
kirkwall to grant these gentlemen's demands

spoken like an angel of sense and beauty said bunce and now away
with you for d  n me if this is not like having a lighted linstock
in the powder-room if you speak another word more confound me if i
know how i shall bring myself to part with you

go in god's name my daughters said magnus i am in god's hand and
when you are gone i shall care little for myself and i shall think and
say as long as i live that this good gentleman deserves a better
trade go go away with you for they yet lingered in reluctance to
leave him

stay not to kiss said bunce for fear i be tempted to ask my share
into the boat with you yet stop an instant he drew the three captives
apart fletcher said he will answer for the rest of the fellows
and will see you safe off the sea-beach but how to answer for fletcher
i know not except by trusting mr halcro with this little guarantee

illustration

he offered the minstrel a small double-barrelled pistol which he said
was loaded with a brace of balls minna observed halcro's hand tremble
as he stretched it out to take the weapon give it to me sir she
said taking it from the outlaw and trust to me for defending my
sister and myself

bravo bravo shouted bunce there spoke a wench worthy of cleveland
the king of rovers

cleveland repeated minna do you then know that cleveland whom you
have twice named

know him is there a man alive said bunce that knows better than i
do the best and stoutest fellow ever stepped betwixt stem and stern
when he is out of the bilboes as please heaven he shall soon be i
reckon to see you come on board of us and reign the queen of every sea
we sail over you have got the little guardian i suppose you know how
to use it if fletcher behaves ill to you you need only draw up this
piece of iron with your thumb so and if he persists it is but
crooking your pretty forefinger thus and i shall lose the most dutiful
messmate that ever man had though d  n the dog he will deserve his
death if he disobeys my orders and now into the boat but stay one
kiss for cleveland's sake

brenda in deadly terror endured his courtesy but minna stepping back
with disdain offered her hand bunce laughed but kissed with a
theatrical air the fair hand which she extended as a ransom for her
lips and at length the sisters and halcro were placed in the boat
which rowed off under fletcher's command

bunce stood on the quarter-deck soliloquizing after the manner of his
original profession were this told at port-royal now or at the isle
of providence or in the petits guaves i wonder what they would say of
me why that i was a good-natured milksop a jack-a-lent an
ass well let them i have done enough of bad to think about it it is
worth while doing one good action if it were but for the rarity of the
thing and to put one in good humour with oneself then turning to
magnus troil he proceeded by    these are bona-robas these
daughters of yours the eldest would make her fortune on the london
boards what a dashing attitude the wench had with her as she seized
the pistol d  n me that touch would have brought the house down
what a roxalana the jade would have made for in his oratory bunce
like sancho's gossip thomas cecial was apt to use the most energetic
word which came to hand without accurately considering its propriety
i would give my share of the next prize but to hear her spout 

 away begone and give a whirlwind room
 or i will blow you up like dust avaunt
 madness but meanly represents my rage

and then again that little soft shy tearful trembler for statira
to hear her recite 

 he speaks the kindest words and looks such things
 vows with such passion swears with so much grace
 that tis a kind of heaven to be deluded by him

what a play we might have run up i was a beast not to think of it
before i sent them off i to be alexander claud halcro
lysimachus this old gentleman might have made a clytus for a pinch i
was an idiot not to think of it

there was much in this effusion which might have displeased the udaller
but to speak truth he paid no attention to it his eye and finally
his spy-glass were employed in watching the return of his daughters to
the shore he saw them land on the beach and accompanied by halcro
and another man fletcher doubtless he saw them ascend the
acclivity and proceed upon the road to kirkwall and he could even
distinguish that minna as if considering herself as the guardian of the
party walked a little aloof from the rest on the watch as it seemed
against surprise and ready to act as occasion should require at
length as the udaller was just about to lose sight of them he had the
exquisite satisfaction to see the party halt and the pirate leave them
after a space just long enough for a civil farewell and proceed slowly
back on his return to the beach blessing the great being who had thus
relieved him from the most agonizing fears which a father can feel the
worthy udaller from that instant stood resigned to his own fate
whatever that might be

chapter xvii

 over the mountains and under the waves
 over the fountains and under the graves
 over floods that are deepest
 which neptune obey
 over rocks that are steepest
 love will find out the way

 old song


the parting of fletcher from claud halcro and the sisters of
burgh-westra on the spot where it took place was partly occasioned by
a small party of armed men being seen at a distance in the act of
advancing from kirkwall an apparition hidden from the udaller's
spy-glass by the swell of the ground but quite visible to the pirate
whom it determined to consult his own safety by a speedy return to his
boat he was just turning away when minna occasioned the short delay
which her father had observed

stop she said i command you tell your leader from me that
whatever the answer may be from kirkwall he shall carry his vessel
nevertheless round to stromness and being anchored there let him
send a boat ashore for captain cleveland when he shall see a smoke on
the bridge of broisgar

fletcher had thought like his messmate bunce of asking a kiss at
least for the trouble of escorting these beautiful young women and
perhaps neither the terror of the approaching kirkwall men nor of
minna's weapon might have prevented his being insolent but the name of
his captain and still more the unappalled dignified and commanding
manner of minna troil overawed him he made a sea bow promised to
keep a sharp look-out and returning to his boat went on board with
his message

as halcro and the sisters advanced towards the party whom they saw on
the kirkwall road and who on their part had halted as if to observe
them brenda relieved from the fears of fletcher's presence which had
hitherto kept her silent exclaimed merciful heaven minna in what
hands have we left our dear father

in the hands of brave men said minna steadily i fear not for him

as brave as you please said claud halcro but very dangerous rogues
for all that i know that fellow altamont as he calls himself though
that is not his right name neither as deboshed a dog as ever made a
barn ring with blood and blank verse he began with barnwell and every
body thought he would end with the gallows like the last scene in
venice preserved

it matters not said minna the wilder the waves the more powerful
is the voice that rules them the name alone of cleveland ruled the mood
of the fiercest amongst them

i am sorry for cleveland said brenda if such are his
companions but i care little for him in comparison to my father

reserve your compassion for those who need it said minna and fear
nothing for our father god knows every silver hair on his head is to
me worth the treasure of an unsummed mine but i know that he is safe
while in yonder vessel and i know that he will be soon safe on shore

i would i could see it said claud halcro but i fear the kirkwall
people supposing cleveland to be such as i dread will not dare to
exchange him against the udaller the scots have very severe laws
against theft-boot as they call it

but who are those on the road before us said brenda and why do they
halt there so jealously

they are a patrol of the militia answered halcro glorious john
touches them off a little sharply but then john was a jacobite e

 mouths without hands maintain'd at vast expense
 in peace a charge in war a weak defence
 stout once a-month they march a blustering band
 and ever but in time of need at hand

i fancy they halted just now taking us as they saw us on the brow of
the hill for a party of the sloop's men and now they can distinguish
that you wear petticoats they are moving on again

they came on accordingly and proved to be as claud halcro had
suggested a patrol sent out to watch the motions of the pirates and to
prevent their attempting descents to damage the country

they heartily congratulated claud halcro who was well known to more
than one of them upon his escape from captivity and the commander of
the party while offering every assistance to the ladies could not help
condoling with them on the circumstances in which their father stood
hinting though in a delicate and doubtful manner the difficulties
which might be in the way of his liberation

when they arrived at kirkwall and obtained an audience of the provost
and one or two of the magistrates these difficulties were more plainly
insisted upon the halcyon frigate is upon the coast said the
provost she was seen off duncansbay-head and though i have the
deepest respect for mr troil of burgh-westra yet i shall be answerable
to law if i release from prison the captain of this suspicious vessel
on account of the safety of any individual who may be unhappily
endangered by his detention this man is now known to be the heart and
soul of these buccaniers and am i at liberty to send him aboard that
he may plunder the country or perhaps go fight the king's ship for he
has impudence enough for any thing

courage enough for any thing you mean mr provost said minna
unable to restrain her displeasure

why you may call it as you please miss troil said the worthy
magistrate but in my opinion that sort of courage which proposes to
fight singly against two is little better than a kind of practical
impudence

but our father said brenda in a tone of the most earnest
entreaty our father the friend i may say the father of his
country to whom so many look for kindness and so many for actual
support whose loss would be the extinction of a beacon in a storm will
you indeed weigh the risk which he runs against such a trifling thing
as letting an unfortunate man from prison to seek his unhappy fate
elsewhere

miss brenda is right said claud halcro i am for let-a-be for
let-a-be as the boys say and never fash about a warrant of
liberation provost but just take a fool's counsel and let the goodman
of the jail forget to draw his bolt on the wicket or leave a chink of a
window open or the like and we shall be rid of the rover and have the
one best honest fellow in orkney or zetland on the lee-side of a bowl of
punch with us in five hours

the provost replied in nearly the same terms as before that he had the
highest respect for mr magnus troil of burgh-westra but that he could
not suffer his consideration for any individual however respectable to
interfere with the discharge of his duty

minna then addressed her sister in a tone of calm and sarcastic
displeasure you forget she said brenda that you are talking of
the safety of a poor insignificant udaller of zetland to no less a
person than the chief magistrate of the metropolis of orkney can you
expect so great a person to condescend to such a trifling subject of
consideration it will be time enough for the provost to think of
complying with the terms sent to him for comply with them at length he
both must and will when the church of saint magnus is beat down about
his ears

you may be angry with me my pretty young lady said the good-humoured
provost torfe but i cannot be offended with you the church of saint
magnus has stood many a day and i think will outlive both you and me
much more yonder pack of unhanged dogs and besides that your father is
half an orkneyman and has both estate and friends among us i would i
give you my word do as much for a zetlander in distress as i would for
any one excepting one of our own native kirkwallers who are doubtless
to be preferred and if you will take up your lodgings here with my wife
and myself we will endeavour to show you continued he that you are
as welcome in kirkwall as ever you could be in lerwick or scalloway

minna deigned no reply to this good-humoured invitation but brenda
declined it in civil terms pleading the necessity of taking up their
abode with a wealthy widow of kirkwall a relation who already expected
them

halcro made another attempt to move the provost but found him
inexorable the collector of the customs had already threatened he
said to inform against him for entering into treaty or as he called
it packing and peeling with those strangers even when it seemed the
only means of preventing a bloody affray in the town and should he now
forego the advantage afforded by the imprisonment of cleveland and the
escape of the factor he might incur something worse than censure the
burden of the whole was that he was sorry for the udaller he was
sorry even for the lad cleveland who had some sparks of honour about
him but his duty was imperious and must be obeyed the provost then
precluded farther argument by observing that another affair from
zetland called for his immediate attention a gentleman named mertoun
residing at jarlshof had made complaint against snailsfoot the jagger
for having assisted a domestic of his in embezzling some valuable
articles which had been deposited in his custody and he was about to
take examinations on the subject and cause them to be restored to mr
mertoun who was accountable for them to the right owner

in all this information there was nothing which seemed interesting to
the sisters excepting the word mertoun which went like a dagger to the
heart of minna when she recollected the circumstances under which
mordaunt mertoun had disappeared and which with an emotion less
painful though still of a melancholy nature called a faint blush into
brenda's cheek and a slight degree of moisture into her eye but it was
soon evident that the magistrate spoke not of mordaunt but of his
father and the daughters of magnus little interested in his detail
took leave of the provost to go to their own lodgings

when they arrived at their relation's minna made it her business to
learn by such enquiries as she could make without exciting suspicion
what was the situation of the unfortunate cleveland which she soon
discovered to be exceedingly precarious the provost had not indeed
committed him to close custody as claud halcro had anticipated
recollecting perhaps the favourable circumstances under which he had
surrendered himself and loath till the moment of the last necessity
altogether to break faith with him but although left apparently at
large he was strictly watched by persons well armed and appointed for
the purpose who had directions to detain him by force if he attempted
to pass certain narrow precincts which were allotted to him he was
quartered in a strong room within what is called the king's castle and
at night his chamber door was locked on the outside and a sufficient
guard mounted to prevent his escape he therefore enjoyed only the
degree of liberty which the cat in her cruel sport is sometimes
pleased to permit to the mouse which she has clutched and yet such was
the terror of the resources the courage and ferocity of the pirate
captain that the provost was blamed by the collector and many other
sage citizens of kirkwall for permitting him to be at large upon any
conditions

it may be well believed that under such circumstances cleveland had
no desire to seek any place of public resort conscious that he was the
object of a mixed feeling of curiosity and terror his favourite place
of exercise therefore was the external aisles of the cathedral of
saint magnus of which the eastern end alone is fitted up for public
worship this solemn old edifice having escaped the ravage which
attended the first convulsions of the reformation still retains some
appearance of episcopal dignity this place of worship is separated by a
screen from the nave and western limb of the cross and the whole is
preserved in a state of cleanliness and decency which might be well
proposed as an example to the proud piles of westminster and st paul's

it was in this exterior part of the cathedral that cleveland was
permitted to walk the rather that his guards by watching the single
open entrance had the means with very little inconvenience to
themselves of preventing any possible attempt at escape the place
itself was well suited to his melancholy circumstances the lofty and
vaulted roof rises upon ranges of saxon pillars of massive size four
of which still larger than the rest once supported the lofty spire
which long since destroyed by accident has been rebuilt upon a
disproportioned and truncated plan the light is admitted at the eastern
end through a lofty well-proportioned and richly-ornamented gothic
window and the pavement is covered with inscriptions in different
languages distinguishing the graves of noble orcadians who have at
different times been deposited within the sacred precincts

here walked cleveland musing over the events of a misspent life which
it seemed probable might be brought to a violent and shameful close
while he was yet in the prime of youth with these dead he said
looking on the pavement shall i soon be numbered but no holy man will
speak a blessing no friendly hand register an inscription no proud
descendant sculpture armorial bearings over the grave of the pirate
cleveland my whitening bones will swing in the gibbet-irons on some
wild beach or lonely cape that will be esteemed fatal and accursed for
my sake the old mariner as he passes the sound will shake his head
and tell of my name and actions as a warning to his younger
comrades but minna minna what will be thy thoughts when the news
reaches thee would to god the tidings were drowned in the deepest
whirlpool betwixt kirkwall and burgh-westra ere they came to her
ear and o would to heaven that we had never met since we never can
meet again

he lifted up his eyes as he spoke and minna troil stood before him her
face was pale and her hair dishevelled but her look was composed and
firm with its usual expression of high-minded melancholy she was still
shrouded in the large mantle which she had assumed on leaving the
vessel cleveland's first emotion was astonishment his next was joy
not unmixed with awe he would have exclaimed he would have thrown
himself at her feet but she imposed at once silence and composure on
him by raising her finger and saying in a low but commanding
accent be cautious we are observed there are men without they let
me enter with difficulty i dare not remain long they would think they
might believe o cleveland i have hazarded every thing to save you

to save me alas poor minna answered cleveland to save me is
impossible enough that i have seen you once more were it but to say
for ever farewell

we must indeed say farewell said minna for fate and your guilt
have divided us for ever cleveland i have seen your associates need
i tell you more need i say that i know now what a pirate is

you have been in the ruffians power said cleveland with a start of
agony did they presume  

cleveland replied minna they presumed nothing your name was a
spell over them by the power of that spell over these ferocious
banditti and by that alone i was reminded of the qualities i once
thought my cleveland's

yes said cleveland proudly my name has and shall have power over
them when they are at the wildest and had they harmed you by one rude
word they should have found yet what do i rave about i am a
prisoner

you shall be so no longer said minna your safety the safety of my
dear father all demand your instant freedom i have formed a scheme for
your liberty which boldly executed cannot fail the light is fading
without muffle yourself in my cloak and you will easily pass the
guards i have given them the means of carousing and they are deeply
engaged haste to the loch of stennis and hide yourself till day dawns
then make a smoke on the point where the land stretching into the
lake on each side divides it nearly in two at the bridge of broisgar
your vessel which lies not far distant will send a boat ashore do
not hesitate an instant

but you minna should this wild scheme succeed said cleveland
what is to become of you

for my share in your escape answered the maiden the honesty of my
own intention will vindicate me in the sight of heaven and the safety
of my father whose fate depends on yours will be my excuse to man

in a few words she gave him the history of their capture and its
consequences cleveland cast up his eyes and raised his hands to heaven
in thankfulness for the escape of the sisters from his evil companions
and then hastily added but you are right minna i must fly at all
rates for your father's sake i must fly here then we part yet not
i trust for ever

for ever answered a voice that sounded as from a sepulchral vault

they started looked around them and then gazed on each other it
seemed as if the echoes of the building had returned cleveland's last
words but the pronunciation was too emphatically accented

yes for ever said norna of the fitful-head stepping forward from
behind one of the massive saxon pillars which support the roof of the
cathedral here meet the crimson foot and the crimson hand well for
both that the wound is healed whence that crimson was derived well for
both but best for him who shed it here then you meet and meet for
the last time

not so said cleveland as if about to take minna's hand to
separate me from minna while i have life must be the work of herself
alone

away said norna stepping betwixt them away with such idle
folly nourish no vain dreams of future meetings you part here and
you part for ever the hawk pairs not with the dove guilt matches not
with innocence minna troil you look for the last time on this bold
and criminal man cleveland you behold minna for the last time

and dream you said cleveland indignantly that your mummery imposes
on me and that i am among the fools who see more than trick in your
pretended art

forbear cleveland forbear said minna her hereditary awe of norna
augmented by the circumstance of her sudden appearance o
forbear she is powerful she is but too powerful and do you o
norna remember my father's safety is linked with cleveland's

and it is well for cleveland that i do remember it replied the
pythoness and that for the sake of one i am here to aid both you
with your childish purpose of passing one of his bulk and stature under
the disguise of a few paltry folds of wadmaal what would your device
have procured him but instant restraint with bolt and shackle i will
save him i will place him in security on board his bark but let him
renounce these shores for ever and carry elsewhere the terrors of his
sable flag and his yet blacker name for if the sun rises twice and
finds him still at anchor his blood be on his own head ay look to
each other look the last look that i permit to frail affection and
say if ye can say it farewell for ever

obey her stammered minna remonstrate not but obey her

cleveland grasping her hand and kissing it ardently said but so low
that she only could hear it farewell minna but not for ever

and now maiden begone said norna and leave the rest to the
reimkennar

one word more said minna and i obey you tell me but if i have
caught aright your meaning is mordaunt mertoun safe and recovered

recovered and safe said norna else woe to the hand that shed his
blood

minna slowly sought the door of the cathedral and turned back from time
to time to look at the shadowy form of norna and the stately and
military figure of cleveland as they stood together in the deepening
gloom of the ancient cathedral when she looked back a second time they
were in motion and cleveland followed the matron as with a slow and
solemn step she glided towards one of the side aisles when minna
looked back a third time their figures were no longer visible she
collected herself and walked on to the eastern door by which she had
entered and listened for an instant to the guard who talked together
on the outside

the zetland girl stays a long time with this pirate fellow said one
i wish they have not more to speak about than the ransom of her
father

ay truly answered another the wenches will have more sympathy with
a handsome young pirate than an old bed-ridden burgher

their discourse was here interrupted by her of whom they were speaking
and as if taken in the manner they pulled off their hats made their
awkward obeisances and looked not a little embarrassed and confused

minna returned to the house where she lodged much affected yet on the
whole pleased with the result of her expedition which seemed to put
her father out of danger and assured her at once of the escape of
cleveland and of the safety of young mordaunt she hastened to
communicate both pieces of intelligence to brenda who joined her in
thankfulness to heaven and was herself wellnigh persuaded to believe in
norna's supernatural pretensions so much was she pleased with the
manner in which they had been employed some time was spent in
exchanging their mutual congratulations and mingling tears of hope
mixed with apprehension when at a late hour in the evening they were
interrupted by claud halcro who full of a fidgeting sort of
importance not unmingled with fear came to acquaint them that the
prisoner cleveland had disappeared from the cathedral in which he had
been permitted to walk and that the provost having been informed that
minna was accessary to his flight was coming in a mighty quandary to
make enquiry into the circumstances

when the worthy magistrate arrived minna did not conceal from him her
own wish that cleveland should make his escape as the only means which
she saw of redeeming her father from imminent danger but that she had
any actual accession to his flight she positively denied and stated
that she had parted from cleveland in the cathedral more than two
hours since and then left him in company with a third person whose
name she did not conceive herself obliged to communicate

it is not needful miss minna troil answered provost torfe for
although no person but this captain cleveland and yourself was seen to
enter the kirk of st magnus this day we know well enough that your
cousin old ulla troil whom you zetlanders call norna of fitful-head
has been cruising up and down upon sea and land and air for what i
know in boats and on ponies and it may be on broomsticks and here has
been her dumb drow too coming and going and playing the spy on every
one and a good spy he is for he can hear every thing and tells
nothing again unless to his mistress and we know besides that she
can enter the kirk when all the doors are fast and has been seen there
more than once god save us from the evil one and so without farther
questions asked i conclude it was old norna whom you left in the kirk
with this slashing blade and if so they may catch them again that
can i cannot but say however pretty mistress minna that you zetland
folks seem to forget both law and gospel when you use the help of
witchcraft to fetch delinquents out of a legal prison and the least
that you or your cousin or your father can do is to use influence
with this wild fellow to go away as soon as possible without hurting
the town or trade and then there will be little harm in what has
chanced for heaven knows i did not seek the poor lad's life so i
could get my hands free of him without blame and far less did i wish
that through his imprisonment any harm should come to worthy magnus
troil of burgh-westra

i see where the shoe pinches you mr provost said claud halcro and
i am sure i can answer for my friend mr troil as well as for myself
that we will say and do all in our power with this man captain
cleveland to make him leave the coast directly

and i said minna am so convinced that what you recommend is best
for all parties that my sister and i will set off early to-morrow
morning to the house of stennis if mr halcro will give us his escort
to receive my father when he comes ashore that we may acquaint him with
your wish and to use every influence to induce this unhappy man to
leave the country

provost torfe looked upon her with some surprise it is not every young
woman he said would wish to move eight miles nearer to a band of
pirates

we run no risk said claud halcro interfering the house of stennis
is strong and my cousin whom it belongs to has men and arms within
it the young ladies are as safe there as in kirkwall and much good may
arise from an early communication between magnus troil and his
daughters and happy am i to see that in your case my good old
friend as glorious john says 

   after much debate
 the man prevails above the magistrate

the provost smiled nodded his head and indicated as far as he thought
he could do so with decency how happy he should be if the fortune's
favourite and her disorderly crew would leave orkney without further
interference or violence on either side he could not authorize their
being supplied from the shore he said but either for fear or favour
they were certain to get provisions at stromness this pacific
magistrate then took leave of halcro and the two ladies who proposed
the next morning to transfer their residence to the house of stennis
situated upon the banks of the salt-water lake of the same name and
about four miles by water from the road of stromness where the rover's
vessel was lying




chapter xviii

 fly fleance fly thou mayst escape

 macbeth


it was one branch of the various arts by which norna endeavoured to
maintain her pretensions to supernatural powers that she made herself
familiarly and practically acquainted with all the secret passes and
recesses whether natural or artificial which she could hear of
whether by tradition or otherwise and was by such knowledge often
enabled to perform feats which were otherwise unaccountable thus when
she escaped from the tabernacle at burgh-westra it was by a sliding
board which covered a secret passage in the wall known to none but
herself and magnus who she was well assured would not betray her the
profusion also with which she lavished a considerable income
otherwise of no use to her enabled her to procure the earliest
intelligence respecting whatever she desired to know and at the same
time to secure all other assistance necessary to carry her plans into
effect cleveland upon the present occasion had reason to admire both
her sagacity and her resources

upon her applying a little forcible pressure a door which was concealed
under some rich wooden sculpture in the screen which divides the eastern
aisle from the rest of the cathedral opened and disclosed a dark
narrow winding passage into which she entered telling cleveland in a
whisper to follow and be sure he shut the door behind him he obeyed
and followed her in darkness and silence sometimes descending steps of
the number of which she always apprized him sometimes ascending and
often turning at short angles the air was more free than he could have
expected the passage being ventilated at different parts by unseen and
ingeniously contrived spiracles which communicated with the open air
at length their long course ended by norna drawing aside a sliding
panel which opening behind a wooden or box-bed as it is called in
scotland admitted them into an ancient but very mean apartment having
a latticed window and a groined roof the furniture was much
dilapidated and its only ornaments were on the one side of the wall a
garland of faded ribbons such as are used to decorate whale-vessels
and on the other an escutcheon bearing an earl's arms and coronet
surrounded with the usual emblems of mortality the mattock and spade
which lay in one corner together with the appearance of an old man
who in a rusty black coat and slouched hat sat reading by a table
announced that they were in the habitation of the church-beadle or
sexton and in the presence of that respectable functionary

when his attention was attracted by the noise of the sliding panel he
arose and testifying much respect but no surprise took his shadowy
hat from his thin grey locks and stood uncovered in the presence of
norna with an air of profound humility

be faithful said norna to the old man and beware you show not any
living mortal the secret path to the sanctuary

the old man bowed in token of obedience and of thanks for she put
money in his hand as she spoke with a faltering voice he expressed his
hope that she would remember his son who was on the greenland voyage
that he might return fortunate and safe as he had done last year when
he brought back the garland pointing to that upon the wall

my cauldron shall boil and my rhyme shall be said in his behalf
answered norna waits pacolet without with the horses

the old sexton assented and the pythoness commanding cleveland to
follow her went through a back door of the apartment into a small
garden corresponding in its desolate appearance to the habitation
they had just quitted the low and broken wall easily permitted them to
pass into another and larger garden though not much better kept and a
gate which was upon the latch let them into a long and winding lane
through which norna having whispered to her companion that it was the
only dangerous place on their road they walked with a hasty pace it
was now nearly dark and the inhabitants of the poor dwellings on
either hand had betaken themselves to their houses they saw only one
woman who was looking from her door but blessed herself and retired
into her house with precipitation when she saw the tall figure of norna
stalk past her with long strides the lane conducted them into the
country where the dumb dwarf waited with three horses ensconced behind
the wall of a deserted shed on one of these norna instantly seated
herself cleveland mounted another and followed by pacolet on the
third they moved sharply on through the darkness the active and
spirited animals on which they rode being of a breed rather taller than
those reared in zetland

after more than an hour's smart riding in which norna acted as guide
they stopped before a hovel so utterly desolate in appearance that it
resembled rather a cattle-shed than a cottage

here you must remain till dawn when your signal can be seen from your
vessel said norna consigning the horses to the care of pacolet and
leading the way into the wretched hovel which she presently illuminated
by lighting the small iron lamp which she usually carried along with
her it is a poor she said but a safe place of refuge for were we
pursued hither the earth would yawn and admit us into its recesses ere
you were taken for know that this ground is sacred to the gods of old
valhalla and now say man of mischief and of blood are you friend or
foe to norna the sole priestess of these disowned deities

how is it possible for me to be your enemy said cleveland common
gratitude  

common gratitude said norna interrupting him is a common word and
words are the common pay which fools accept at the hands of knaves but
norna must be requited by actions by sacrifices

well mother name your request

that you never seek to see minna troil again and that you leave this
coast in twenty-four hours answered norna

it is impossible said the outlaw i cannot be soon enough found in
the sea-stores which the sloop must have

you can i will take care you are fully supplied and caithness and the
hebrides are not far distant you can depart if you will

and why should i said cleveland if i will not

because your stay endangers others said norna and will prove your
own destruction hear me with attention from the first moment i saw you
lying senseless on the sand beneath the cliffs of sumburgh i read that
in your countenance which linked you with me and those who were dear to
me but whether for good or evil was hidden from mine eyes i aided in
saving your life in preserving your property i aided in doing so the
very youth whom you have crossed in his dearest affections crossed by
tale-bearing and slander

i slander mertoun exclaimed cleveland by heaven i scarce
mentioned his name at burgh-westra if it is that which you mean the
peddling fellow bryce meaning i believe to be my friend because he
found something could be made by me did i have since heard carry
tattle or truth i know not which to the old man which was confirmed
by the report of the whole island but for me i scarce thought of him
as a rival else i had taken a more honourable way to rid myself of
him

was the point of your double-edged knife directed to the bosom of an
unarmed man intended to carve out that more honourable way said
norna sternly

cleveland was conscience-struck and remained silent for an instant ere
he replied there indeed i was wrong but he is i thank heaven
recovered and welcome to an honourable satisfaction

cleveland said the pythoness no the fiend who employs you as his
implement is powerful but with me he shall not strive you are of that
temperament which the dark influences desire as the tools of their
agency bold haughty and undaunted unrestrained by principle and
having only in its room a wild sense of indomitable pride which such
men call honour such you are and as such your course through life has
been onward and unrestrained bloody and tempestuous by me however
it shall be controlled she concluded stretching out her staff as if
in the attitude of determined authority ay even although the demon
who presides over it should now arise in his terrors

cleveland laughed scornfully good mother he said reserve such
language for the rude sailor that implores you to bestow him fair wind
or the poor fisherman that asks success to his nets and lines i have
been long inaccessible both to fear and to superstition call forth your
demon if you command one and place him before me the man that has
spent years in company with incarnate devils can scarce dread the
presence of a disembodied fiend

this was said with a careless and desperate bitterness of spirit which
proved too powerfully energetic even for the delusions of norna's
insanity and it was with a hollow and tremulous voice that she asked
cleveland for what then do you hold me if you deny the power i have
bought so dearly

you have wisdom mother said cleveland at least you have art and
art is power i hold you for one who knows how to steer upon the current
of events but i deny your power to change its course do not
therefore waste words in quoting terrors for which i have no feeling
but tell me at once wherefore you would have me depart

because i will have you see minna no more answered norna because
minna is the destined bride of him whom men call mordaunt
mertoun because if you depart not within twenty-four hours utter
destruction awaits you in these plain words there is no metaphysical
delusion answer me as plainly

in as plain words then answered cleveland i will not leave these
islands not at least till i have seen minna troil and never shall
your mordaunt possess her while i live

hear him said norna hear a mortal man spurn at the means of
prolonging his life hear a sinful a most sinful being refuse the
time which fate yet affords for repentance and for the salvation of an
immortal soul behold him how he stands erect bold and confident in
his youthful strength and courage my eyes unused to tears even my
eyes which have so little cause to weep for him are blinded with
sorrow to think what so fair a form will be ere the second sun set

mother said cleveland firmly yet with some touch of sorrow in his
voice i in part understand your threats you know more than we do of
the course of the halcyon perhaps have the means for i acknowledge you
have shown wonderful skill of combination in such affairs of directing
her cruise our way be it so i will not depart from my purpose for
that risk if the frigate comes hither we have still our shoal water to
trust to and i think they will scarce cut us out with boats as if we
were a spanish xebeck i am therefore resolved i will hoist once more
the flag under which i have cruised avail ourselves of the thousand
chances which have helped us in greater odds and at the worst fight
the vessel to the very last and when mortal man can do no more it is
but snapping a pistol in the powder-room and as we have lived so
will we die

there was a dead pause as cleveland ended and it was broken by his
resuming in a softer tone you have heard my answer mother let us
debate it no further but part in peace i would willingly leave you a
remembrance that you may not forget a poor fellow to whom your services
have been useful and who parts with you in no unkindness however
unfriendly you are to his dearest interests nay do not shun to accept
such a trifle he said forcing upon norna the little silver enchased
box which had been once the subject of strife betwixt mertoun and him
it is not for the sake of the metal which i know you value not but
simply as a memorial that you have met him of whom many a strange tale
will hereafter be told in the seas which he has traversed

i accept your gift said norna in token that if i have in aught
been accessary to your fate it was as the involuntary and grieving
agent of other powers well did you say we direct not the current of the
events which hurry us forward and render our utmost efforts unavailing
even as the wells of tuftiloe can wheel the stoutest vessel round
and round in despite of either sail or steerage pacolet she
exclaimed in a louder voice what ho pacolet

a large stone which lay at the side of the wall of the hovel fell as
she spoke and to cleveland's surprise if not somewhat to his fear the
misshapen form of the dwarf was seen like some overgrown reptile
extricating himself out of a subterranean passage the entrance to which
the stone had covered

norna as if impressed by what cleveland had said on the subject of her
supernatural pretensions was so far from endeavouring to avail herself
of this opportunity to enforce them that she hastened to explain the
phenomenon he had witnessed

such passages she said to which the entrances are carefully
concealed are frequently found in these islands the places of retreat
of the ancient inhabitants where they sought refuge from the rage of
the normans the pirates of that day it was that you might avail
yourself of this in case of need that i brought you hither should you
observe signs of pursuit you may either lurk in the bowels of the earth
until it has passed by or escape if you will through the farther
entrance near the lake by which pacolet entered but now and now
farewell think on what i have said for as sure as you now move and
breathe a living man so surely is your doom fixed and sealed unless
within four-and-twenty hours you have doubled the burgh-head

farewell mother said cleveland as she departed bending a look upon
him in which as he could perceive by the lamp sorrow was mingled with
displeasure

the interview which thus concluded left a strong effect even upon the
mind of cleveland accustomed as he was to imminent dangers and to
hair-breadth escapes he in vain attempted to shake off the impression
left by the words of norna which he felt the more powerful because
they were in a great measure divested of her wonted mystical tone which
he contemned a thousand times he regretted that he had from time to
time delayed the resolution which he had long adopted to quit his
dreadful and dangerous trade and as often he firmly determined that
could he but see minna troil once more were it but for a last farewell
he would leave the sloop as soon as his comrades were extricated from
their perilous situation endeavour to obtain the benefit of the king's
pardon and distinguish himself if possible in some more honourable
course of warfare

this resolution to which he again and again pledged himself had at
length a sedative effect on his mental perturbation and wrapt in his
cloak he enjoyed for a time that imperfect repose which exhausted
nature demands as her tribute even from those who are situated on the
verge of the most imminent danger but how far soever the guilty may
satisfy his own mind and stupify the feelings of remorse by such a
conditional repentance we may well question whether it is not in the
sight of heaven rather a presumptuous aggravation than an expiation of
his sins

when cleveland awoke the grey dawn was already mingling with the
twilight of an orcadian night he found himself on the verge of a
beautiful sheet of water which close by the place where he had rested
was nearly divided by two tongues of land that approach each other from
the opposing sides of the lake and are in some degree united by the
bridge of broisgar a long causeway containing openings to permit the
flow and reflux of the tide behind him and fronting to the bridge
stood that remarkable semicircle of huge upright stones which has no
rival in britain excepting the inimitable monument at stonehenge these
immense blocks of stone all of them above twelve feet and several
being even fourteen or fifteen feet in height stood around the pirate
in the grey light of the dawning like the phantom forms of antediluvian
giants who shrouded in the habiliments of the dead came to revisit
by this pale light the earth which they had plagued by their oppression
and polluted by their sins till they brought down upon it the vengeance
of long-suffering heaven

cleveland was less interested by this singular monument of antiquity
than by the distant view of stromness which he could as yet scarce
discover he lost no time in striking a light by the assistance of one
of his pistols and some wet fern supplied him with fuel sufficient to
make the appointed signal it had been earnestly watched for on board
the sloop for goffe's incapacity became daily more apparent and even
his most steady adherents agreed it would be best to submit to
cleveland's command till they got back to the west indies

bunce who came with the boat to bring off his favourite commander
danced cursed shouted and spouted for joy when he saw him once more
at freedom they had already he said made some progress in
victualling the sloop and they might have made more but for that
drunken old swab goffe who minded nothing but splicing the main-brace

the boat's crew were inspired with the same enthusiasm and rowed so
hard that although the tide was against them and the air or wind
failed they soon placed cleveland once more on the quarter-deck of the
vessel which it was his misfortune to command

the first exercise of the captain's power was to make known to magnus
troil that he was at full freedom to depart that he was willing to make
him any compensation in his power for the interruption of his voyage to
kirkwall and that captain cleveland was desirous if agreeable to mr
troil to pay his respects to him on board his brig thank him for
former favours and apologize for the circumstances attending his
detention

to bunce who as the most civilized of the crew cleveland had
intrusted this message the old plain-dealing udaller made the following
answer tell your captain that i should be glad to think he had never
stopped any one upon the high sea save such as have suffered as little
as i have say too that if we are to continue friends we shall be
most so at a distance for i like the sound of his cannon-balls as
little by sea as he would like the whistle of a bullet by land from my
rifle-gun say in a word that i am sorry i was mistaken in him and
that he would have done better to have reserved for the spaniard the
usage he is bestowing on his countrymen

and so that is your message old snapcholerick said bunce now stap
my vitals if i have not a mind to do your errand for you over the left
shoulder and teach you more respect for gentlemen of fortune but i
won't and chiefly for the sake of your two pretty wenches not to
mention my old friend claud halcro the very visage of whom brought back
all the old days of scene-shifting and candle-snuffing so good morrow
to you gaffer seal's-cap and all is said that need pass between us

no sooner did the boat put off with the pirates who left the brig and
now returned to their own vessel than magnus in order to avoid
reposing unnecessary confidence in the honour of these gentlemen of
fortune as they called themselves got his brig under way and the
wind coming favourably round and increasing as the sun rose he crowded
all sail for scalpa-flow intending there to disembark and go by land to
kirkwall where he expected to meet his daughters and his friend claud
halcro

 a well in the language of those seas denotes one of the
whirlpools or circular eddies which wheel and boil with astonishing
strength and are very dangerous hence the distinction in old english
betwixt wells and waves the latter signifying the direct onward
course of the tide and the former the smooth glassy oily-looking
whirlpools whose strength seems to the eye almost irresistible

chapter xix

 now emma now the last reflection make
 what thou wouldst follow what thou must forsake
 by our ill-omen'd stars and adverse heaven
 no middle object to thy choice is given

 henry and emma


the sun was high in heaven the boats were busily fetching off from the
shore the promised supply of provisions and water which as many
fishing skiffs were employed in the service were got on board with
unexpected speed and stowed away by the crew of the sloop with equal
dispatch all worked with good will for all save cleveland himself
were weary of a coast where every moment increased their danger and
where which they esteemed a worse misfortune there was no booty to be
won bunce and derrick took the immediate direction of this duty while
cleveland walking the deck alone and in silence only interfered from
time to time to give some order which circumstances required and then
relapsed into his own sad reflections

there are two sorts of men whom situations of guilt terror and
commotion bring forward as prominent agents the first are spirits so
naturally moulded and fitted for deeds of horror that they stalk forth
from their lurking-places like actual demons to work in their native
element as the hideous apparition of the bearded man came forth at
versailles on the memorable th october the delighted
executioner of the victims delivered up to him by a bloodthirsty rabble
but cleveland belonged to the second class of these unfortunate beings
who are involved in evil rather by the concurrence of external
circumstances than by natural inclination being indeed one in whom
his first engaging in this lawless mode of life as the follower of his
father nay perhaps even his pursuing it as his father's avenger
carried with it something of mitigation and apology one also who often
considered his guilty situation with horror and had made repeated
though ineffectual efforts to escape from it

such thoughts of remorse were now rolling in his mind and he may be
forgiven if recollections of minna mingled with and aided them he
looked around too on his mates and profligate and hardened as he
knew them to be he could not think of their paying the penalty of his
obstinacy we shall be ready to sail with the ebb tide he said to
himself why should i endanger these men by detaining them till the
hour of danger predicted by that singular woman shall arrive her
intelligence howsoever acquired has been always strangely accurate
and her warning was as solemn as if a mother were to apprize an erring
son of his crimes and of his approaching punishment besides what
chance is there that i can again see minna she is at kirkwall
doubtless and to hold my course thither would be to steer right upon
the rocks no i will not endanger these poor fellows i will sail with
the ebb tide on the desolate hebrides or on the north-west coast of
ireland i will leave the vessel and return hither in some
disguise yet why should i return since it will perhaps be only to see
minna the bride of mordaunt no let the vessel sail with this ebb tide
without me i will abide and take my fate

his meditations were here interrupted by jack bunce who hailing him
noble captain said they were ready to sail when he pleased

when you please bunce for i shall leave the command with you and
go ashore at stromness said cleveland

you shall do no such matter by heaven answered bunce the command
with me truly and how the devil am i to get the crew to obey me
why even dick fletcher rides rusty on me now and then you know well
enough that without you we shall be all at each other's throats in
half an hour and if you desert us what a rope's end does it signify
whether we are destroyed by the king's cruisers or by each other come
come noble captain there are black-eyed girls enough in the world but
where will you find so tight a sea-boat as the little favourite here
manned as she is with a set of tearing lads

 fit to disturb the peace of all the world
 and rule it when tis wildest

you are a precious fool jack bunce said cleveland half angry and
in despite of himself half diverted by the false tones and exaggerated
gesture of the stage-struck pirate

it may be so noble captain answered bunce and it may be that i
have my comrades in my folly here are you now going to play all for
love and the world well lost and yet you cannot bear a harmless
bounce in blank verse well i can talk prose for the matter for i have
news enough to tell and strange news too ay and stirring news to
boot

well prithee deliver them to speak thy own cant like a man of this
world

the stromness fishers will accept nothing for their provisions and
trouble said bunce there is a wonder for you

and for what reason i pray said cleveland it is the first time i
have ever heard of cash being refused at a seaport

true they commonly lay the charges on as thick as if they were
caulking but here is the matter the owner of the brig yonder the
father of your fair imoinda stands paymaster by way of thanks for the
civility with which we treated his daughters and that we may not meet
our due as he calls it on these shores

it is like the frank-hearted old udaller said cleveland but is he
at stromness i thought he was to have crossed the island for kirkwall

he did so purpose said bunce but more folks than king duncan change
the course of their voyage he was no sooner ashore than he was met with
by a meddling old witch of these parts who has her finger in every
man's pie and by her counsel he changed his purpose of going to
kirkwall and lies at anchor for the present in yonder white house that
you may see with your glass up the lake yonder i am told the old woman
clubbed also to pay for the sloop's stores why she should shell out the
boards i cannot conceive an idea except that she is said to be a witch
and may befriend us as so many devils

but who told you all this said cleveland without using his
spy-glass or seeming so much interested in the news as his comrade had
expected

why replied bunce i made a trip ashore this morning to the village
and had a can with an old acquaintance who had been sent by master
troil to look after matters and i fished it all out of him and more
too than i am desirous of telling you noble captain

and who is your intelligencer said cleveland has he got no name

why he is an old fiddling foppish acquaintance of mine called
halcro if you must know said bunce

halcro echoed cleveland his eyes sparkling with surprise claud
halcro why he went ashore at inganess with minna and her
sister where are they

why that is just what i did not want to tell you replied the
confidant yet hang me if i can help it for i cannot baulk a fine
situation that start had a fine effect o ay and the spy-glass is
turned on the house of stennis now well yonder they are it must be
confessed indifferently well guarded too some of the old witch's
people are come over from that mountain of an island hoy as they call
it and the old gentleman has got some fellows under arms himself but
what of all that noble captain give you but the word and we snap up
the wenches to-night clap them under hatches man the capstern by
daybreak up topsails and sail with the morning tide

you sicken me with your villainy said cleveland turning away from
him

umph villainy and sicken you said bunce now pray what have i
said but what has been done a thousand times by gentlemen of fortune
like ourselves

mention it not again said cleveland then took a turn along the deck
in deep meditation and coming back to bunce took him by the hand and
said jack i will see her once more

with all my heart said bunce sullenly

once more will i see her and it may be to abjure at her feet this
cursed trade and expiate my offences  

at the gallows said bunce completing the sentence with all my
heart confess and be hanged is a most reverend proverb

nay but dear jack said cleveland

dear jack answered bunce in the same sullen tone a dear sight you
have been to dear jack but hold your own course i have done with
caring for you for ever i should but sicken you with my villainous
counsels

now must i soothe this silly fellow as if he were a spoiled child
said cleveland speaking at bunce but not to him and yet he has sense
enough and bravery enough too and one would think kindness enough
to know that men don't pick their words during a gale of wind

why that's true clement said bunce and there is my hand upon
it and now i think upon't you shall have your last interview for
it's out of my line to prevent a parting scene and what signifies a
tide we can sail by to-morrow's ebb as well as by this

cleveland sighed for norna's prediction rushed on his mind but the
opportunity of a last meeting with minna was too tempting to be
resigned either for presentiment or prediction

i will go presently ashore to the place where they all are said
bunce and the payment of these stores shall serve me for a pretext
and i will carry any letters or message from you to minna with the
dexterity of a valet de chambre

but they have armed men you may be in danger said cleveland

not a whit not a whit replied bunce i protected the wenches when
they were in my power i warrant their father will neither wrong me nor
see me wronged

you say true said cleveland it is not in his nature i will
instantly write a note to minna and he ran down to the cabin for that
purpose where he wasted much paper ere with a trembling hand and
throbbing heart he achieved such a letter as he hoped might prevail on
minna to permit him a farewell meeting on the succeeding morning

his adherent bunce in the meanwhile sought out fletcher of whose
support to second any motion whatever he accounted himself perfectly
sure and followed by this trusty satellite he intruded himself on the
awful presence of hawkins the boatswain and derrick the quarter-master
who were regaling themselves with a can of rumbo after the fatiguing
duty of the day

here comes he can tell us said derrick so master lieutenant for
so we must call you now i think let us have a peep into your
counsels when will the anchor be a-trip

when it pleases heaven master quarter-master answered bunce for i
know no more than the stern-post

why d  n my buttons said derrick do we not weigh this tide

or to-morrow's tide at farthest said the boatswain why what have
we been slaving the whole company for to get all these stores aboard

gentlemen said bunce you are to know that cupid has laid our
captain on board carried the vessel and nailed down his wits under
hatches

what sort of play-stuff is all this said the boatswain gruffly if
you have any thing to tell us say it in a word like a man

howsomdever said fletcher i always think jack bunce speaks like a
man and acts like a man too and so d'ye see  

hold your peace dear dick best of bullybacks be silent said
bunce gentlemen in one word the captain is in love

why now only think of that said the boatswain not but that i have
been in love as often as any man when the ship was laid up

well but continued bunce captain cleveland is in love yes prince
volscius is in love and though that's the cue for laughing on the
stage it is no laughing matter here he expects to meet the girl
to-morrow for the last time and that we all know leads to another
meeting and another and so on till the halcyon is down on us and then
we may look for more kicks than halfpence

by   said the boatswain with a sounding oath we'll have a mutiny
and not allow him to go ashore eh derrick

and the best way too said derrick

what d'ye think of it jack bunce said fletcher in whose ears this
counsel sounded very sagely but who still bent a wistful look upon his
companion

why look ye gentlemen said bunce i will mutiny none and stap my
vitals if any of you shall

why then i won't for one said fletcher but what are we to do
since howsomdever  

stopper your jaw dick will you said bunce now boatswain i am
partly of your mind that the captain must be brought to reason by a
little wholesome force but you all know he has the spirit of a lion
and will do nothing unless he is allowed to hold on his own course
well i'll go ashore and make this appointment the girl comes to the
rendezvous in the morning and the captain goes ashore we take a good
boat's crew with us to row against tide and current and we will be
ready at the signal to jump ashore and bring off the captain and the
girl whether they will or no the pet-child will not quarrel with us
since we bring off his whirligig along with him and if he is still
fractious why we will weigh anchor without his orders and let him
come to his senses at leisure and know his friends another time

why this has a face with it master derrick said hawkins

jack bunce is always right said fletcher howsomdever the captain
will shoot some of us that is certain

hold your jaw dick said bunce pray who the devil cares do you
think whether you are shot or hanged

why it don't much argufy for the matter of that replied dick
howsomdever  

be quiet i tell you said his inexorable patron and hear me
out we will take him at unawares so that he shall neither have time
to use cutlass nor pops and i myself for the dear love i bear him
will be the first to lay him on his back there is a nice tight-going
bit of a pinnace that is a consort of this chase of the captain's if
i have an opportunity i'll snap her up on my own account

yes yes said derrick let you alone for keeping on the look-out for
your own comforts

faith nay said bunce i only snatch at them when they come fairly
in my way or are purchased by dint of my own wit and none of you could
have fallen on such a plan as this we shall have the captain with us
head hand and heart and all besides making a scene fit to finish a
comedy so i will go ashore to make the appointment and do you possess
some of the gentlemen who are still sober and fit to be trusted with
the knowledge of our intentions

bunce with his friend fletcher departed accordingly and the two
veteran pirates remained looking at each other in silence until the
boatswain spoke at last blow me derrick if i like these two
daffadandilly young fellows they are not the true breed why they are
no more like the rovers i have known than this sloop is to a
first-rate why there was old sharpe that read prayers to his ship's
company every sunday what would he have said to have heard it proposed
to bring two wenches on board

and what would tough old black beard have said answered his
companion if they had expected to keep them to themselves they
deserve to be made to walk the plank for their impudence or to be tied
back to back and set a-diving and i care not how soon

ay but who is to command the ship then said hawkins

why what ails you at old goffe answered derrick

why he has sucked the monkey so long and so often said the
boatswain that the best of him is buffed he is little better than an
old woman when he is sober and he is roaring mad when he is drunk we
have had enough of goffe

why then what d'ye say to yourself or to me boatswain demanded
the quarter-master i am content to toss up for it

rot it no answered the boatswain after a moment's consideration
if we were within reach of the trade-winds we might either of us make
a shift but it will take all cleveland's navigation to get us there
and so i think there is nothing like bunce's project for the present
hark he calls for the boat i must go on deck and have her lowered for
his honour d  n his eyes

the boat was lowered accordingly made its voyage up the lake with
safety and landed bunce within a few hundred yards of the old
mansion-house of stennis upon arriving in front of the house he found
that hasty measures had been taken to put it in a state of defence the
lower windows being barricaded with places left for use of musketry
and a ship-gun being placed so as to command the entrance which was
besides guarded by two sentinels bunce demanded admission at the gate
which was briefly and unceremoniously refused with an exhortation to
him at the same time to be gone about his business before worse came
of it as he continued however importunately to insist on seeing some
one of the family and stated his business to be of the most urgent
nature claud halcro at length appeared and with more peevishness than
belonged to his usual manner that admirer of glorious john expostulated
with his old acquaintance upon his pertinacious folly

you are he said like foolish moths fluttering about a candle which
is sure at last to consume you

and you said bunce are a set of stingless drones whom we can smoke
out of your defences at our pleasure with half-a-dozen of
hand-grenades

smoke a fool's head said halcro take my advice and mind your own
matters or there will be those upon you will smoke you to purpose
either begone or tell me in two words what you want for you are like
to receive no welcome here save from a blunderbuss we are men enough of
ourselves and here is young mordaunt mertoun come from hoy whom your
captain so nearly murdered

tush man said bunce he did but let out a little malapert blood

we want no such phlebotomy here said claud halcro and besides
your patient turns out to be nearer allied to us than either you or we
thought of so you may think how little welcome the captain or any of
his crew are like to be here

well but what if i bring money for the stores sent on board

keep it till it is asked of you said halcro there are two bad
paymasters he that pays too soon and he that does not pay at all

well then let me at least give our thanks to the donor said bunce

keep them too till they are asked for answered the poet

so this is all the welcome i have of you for old acquaintance sake
said bunce

why what can i do for you master altamont said halcro somewhat
moved if young mordaunt had had his own will he would have welcomed
you with the red burgundy number a thousand for god's sake begone
else the stage direction will be enter guard and seize altamont

i will not give you the trouble said bunce but will make my exit
instantly stay a moment i had almost forgot that i have a slip of
paper for the tallest of your girls there minna ay minna is her name
it is a farewell from captain cleveland you cannot refuse to give it
her

ah poor fellow said halcro i comprehend i comprehend farewell
fair armida 

 mid pikes and mid bullets mid tempests and fire
 the danger is less than in hopeless desire

tell me but this is there poetry in it

chokeful to the seal with song sonnet and elegy answered bunce
but let her have it cautiously and secretly

tush man teach me to deliver a billet-doux me who have been in
the wits coffee-house and have seen all the toasts of the kit-cat
club minna shall have it then for old acquaintance sake mr
altamont and for your captain's sake too who has less of the core of
devil about him than his trade requires there can be no harm in a
farewell letter

farewell then old boy for ever and a day said bunce and seizing
the poet's hand gave it so hearty a gripe that he left him roaring
and shaking his fist like a dog when a hot cinder has fallen on his
foot

leaving the rover to return on board the vessel we remain with the
family of magnus troil assembled at their kinsman's mansion of stennis
where they maintained a constant and careful watch against surprise

mordaunt mertoun had been received with much kindness by magnus troil
when he came to his assistance with a small party of norna's
dependants placed by her under his command the udaller was easily
satisfied that the reports instilled into his ears by the jagger
zealous to augment his favour towards his more profitable customer
cleveland by diminishing that of mertoun were without foundation they
had indeed been confirmed by the good lady glowrowrum and by common
fame both of whom were pleased to represent mordaunt mertoun as an
arrogant pretender to the favour of the sisters of burgh-westra who
only hesitated sultan-like on whom he should bestow the handkerchief
but common fame magnus considered was a common liar and he was
sometimes disposed where scandal was concerned to regard the good lady
glowrowrum as rather an uncommon specimen of the same genus he
therefore received mordaunt once more into full favour listened with
much surprise to the claim which norna laid to the young man's duty and
with no less interest to her intention of surrendering to him the
considerable property which she had inherited from her father nay it
is even probable that though he gave no immediate answer to her hints
concerning an union betwixt his eldest daughter and her heir he might
think such an alliance recommended as well by the young man's personal
merits as by the chance it gave of reuniting the very large estate
which had been divided betwixt his own father and that of norna at all
events the udaller received his young friend with much kindness and he
and the proprietor of the mansion joined in intrusting to him as the
youngest and most active of the party the charge of commanding the
night-watch and relieving the sentinels around the house of stennis




chapter xx

 of an outlawe this is the lawe 
 that men him take and bind
 without pitie hang'd to be
 and waive with the wind

 the ballad of the nut brown maid


mordaunt had caused the sentinels who had been on duty since midnight to
be relieved ere the peep of day and having given directions that the
guard should be again changed at sunrise he had retired to a small
parlour and placing his arms beside him was slumbering in an
easy-chair when he felt himself pulled by the watch-cloak in which he
was enveloped

is it sunrise said he already as starting up he discovered the
first beams lying level upon the horizon

mordaunt said a voice every note of which thrilled to his heart

he turned his eyes on the speaker and brenda troil to his joyful
astonishment stood before him as he was about to address her eagerly
he was checked by observing the signs of sorrow and discomposure in her
pale cheeks trembling lips and brimful eyes

mordaunt she said you must do minna and me a favour you must allow
us to leave the house quietly and without alarming any one in order to
go as far as the standing stones of stennis

what freak can this be dearest brenda said mordaunt much amazed at
the request some orcadian observance of superstition perhaps but the
time is too dangerous and my charge from your father too strict that i
should permit you to pass without his consent consider dearest brenda
i am a soldier on duty and must obey orders

mordaunt said brenda this is no jesting matter minna's reason
nay minna's life depends on your giving us this permission

and for what purpose said mordaunt let me at least know that

for a wild and a desperate purpose replied brenda it is that she
may meet cleveland

cleveland said mordaunt should the villain come ashore he shall be
welcomed with a shower of rifle-balls let me within a hundred yards of
him he added grasping his piece and all the mischief he has done me
shall be balanced with an ounce bullet

his death will drive minna frantic said brenda and him who injures
minna brenda will never again look upon

this is madness raving madness said mordaunt consider your
honour consider your duty

i can consider nothing but minna's danger said brenda breaking into
a flood of tears her former illness was nothing to the state she has
been in all night she holds in her hand his letter written in
characters of fire rather than of ink imploring her to see him for a
last farewell as she would save a mortal body and an immortal soul
pledging himself for her safety and declaring no power shall force him
from the coast till he has seen her you must let us pass

it is impossible replied mordaunt in great perplexity this ruffian
has imprecations enough doubtless at his fingers ends but what
better pledge has he to offer i cannot permit minna to go

i suppose said brenda somewhat reproachfully while she dried her
tears yet still continued sobbing that there is something in what
norna spoke of betwixt minna and you and that you are too jealous of
this poor wretch to allow him even to speak with her an instant before
his departure

you are unjust said mordaunt hurt and yet somewhat flattered by her
suspicions you are as unjust as you are imprudent you know you
cannot but know that minna is chiefly dear to me as your sister tell
me brenda and tell me truly if i aid you in this folly have you no
suspicion of the pirate's faith

no none said brenda if i had any do you think i would urge you
thus he is wild and unhappy but i think we may in this trust him

is the appointed place the standing stones and the time daybreak
again demanded mordaunt

it is and the time is come said brenda for heaven's sake let us
depart

i will myself said mordaunt relieve the sentinel at the front door
for a few minutes and suffer you to pass you will not protract this
interview so full of danger

we will not said brenda and you on your part will not avail
yourself of this unhappy man's venturing hither to harm or to seize
him

rely on my honour said mordaunt he shall have no harm unless he
offers any

then i go to call my sister said brenda and quickly left the
apartment

mordaunt considered the matter for an instant and then going to the
sentinel at the front door he desired him to run instantly to the
main-guard and order the whole to turn out with their arms to see the
order obeyed and to return when they were in readiness meantime he
himself he said would remain upon the post

during the interval of the sentinel's absence the front door was slowly
opened and minna and brenda appeared muffled in their mantles the
former leaned on her sister and kept her face bent on the ground as
one who felt ashamed of the step she was about to take brenda also
passed her lover in silence but threw back upon him a look of gratitude
and affection which doubled if possible his anxiety for their safety

the sisters in the meanwhile passed out of sight of the house when
minna whose step till that time had been faint and feeble began to
erect her person and to walk with a pace so firm and so swift that
brenda who had some difficulty to keep up with her could not forbear
remonstrating on the imprudence of hurrying her spirits and exhausting
her force by such unnecessary haste

fear not my dearest sister said minna the spirit which i now feel
will and must sustain me through the dreadful interview i could not
but move with a drooping head and dejected pace while i was in view of
one who must necessarily deem me deserving of his pity or his scorn
but you know my dearest brenda and mordaunt shall also know that the
love i bore to that unhappy man was as pure as the rays of that sun
that is now reflected on the waves and i dare attest that glorious sun
and yonder blue heaven to bear me witness that but to urge him to
change his unhappy course of life i had not for all the temptations
this round world holds ever consented to see him more

as she spoke thus in a tone which afforded much confidence to brenda
the sisters attained the summit of a rising ground whence they
commanded a full view of the orcadian stonehenge consisting of a huge
circle and semicircle of the standing stones as they are called which
already glimmered a greyish white in the rising sun and projected far
to the westward their long gigantic shadows at another time the scene
would have operated powerfully on the imaginative mind of minna and
interested the curiosity at least of her less sensitive sister but at
this moment neither was at leisure to receive the impressions which
this stupendous monument of antiquity is so well calculated to impress
on the feelings of those who behold it for they saw in the lower lake
beneath what is termed the bridge of broisgar a boat well manned and
armed which had disembarked one of its crew who advanced alone and
wrapped in a naval cloak towards that monumental circle which they
themselves were about to reach from another quarter

they are many and they are armed said the startled brenda in a
whisper to her sister

it is for precaution's sake answered minna which alas their
condition renders but too necessary fear no treachery from him that
at least is not his vice

as she spoke or shortly afterwards she attained the centre of the
circle on which in the midst of the tall erect pillars of rude stone
that are raised around lies one flat and prostrate supported by short
stone pillars of which some relics are still visible that had once
served perhaps the purpose of an altar

here she said in heathen times if we may believe legends which
have cost me but too dear our ancestors offered sacrifices to heathen
deities and here will i from my soul renounce abjure and offer up
to a better and a more merciful god than was known to them the vain
ideas with which my youthful imagination has been seduced

she stood by the prostrate table of stone and saw cleveland advance
towards her with a timid pace and a downcast look as different from
his usual character and bearing as minna's high air and lofty
demeanour and calm contemplative posture were distant from those of
the love-lorn and broken-hearted maiden whose weight had almost borne
down the support of her sister as she left the house of stennis if the
belief of those is true who assign these singular monuments exclusively
to the druids minna might have seemed the haxa or high priestess of
the order from whom some champion of the tribe expected inauguration
or if we hold the circles of gothic and scandinavian origin she might
have seemed a descended vision of freya the spouse of the thundering
deity before whom some bold sea-king or champion bent with an awe
which no mere mortal terror could have inflicted upon him brenda
overwhelmed with inexpressible fear and doubt remained a pace or two
behind anxiously observing the motions of cleveland and attending to
nothing around save to him and to her sister

cleveland approached within two yards of minna and bent his head to the
ground there was a dead pause until minna said in a firm but
melancholy tone unhappy man why didst thou seek this aggravation of
our woe depart in peace and may heaven direct thee to a better course
than that which thy life has yet held

heaven will not aid me said cleveland excepting by your voice i
came hither rude and wild scarce knowing that my trade my desperate
trade was more criminal in the sight of man or of heaven than that of
those privateers whom your law acknowledges i was bred in it and but
for the wishes you have encouraged me to form i should have perhaps
died in it desperate and impenitent o do not throw me from you let
me do something to redeem what i have done amiss and do not leave your
own work half-finished

cleveland said minna i will not reproach you with abusing my
inexperience or with availing yourself of those delusions which the
credulity of early youth had flung around me and which led me to
confound your fatal course of life with the deeds of our ancient heroes
alas when i saw your followers that illusion was no more but i do
not upbraid you with its having existed go cleveland detach yourself
from those miserable wretches with whom you are associated and believe
me that if heaven yet grants you the means of distinguishing your name
by one good or glorious action there are eyes left in those lonely
islands that will weep as much for joy as as they must now do for
sorrow

and is this all said cleveland and may i not hope that if i
extricate myself from my present associates if i can gain my pardon by
being as bold in the right as i have been too often in the wrong
cause if after a term i care not how long but still a term which may
have an end i can boast of having redeemed my fame may i not may i
not hope that minna may forgive what my god and my country shall have
pardoned

never cleveland never said minna with the utmost firmness on
this spot we part and part for ever and part without longer
indulgence think of me as of one dead if you continue as you now are
but if which may heaven grant you change your fatal course think of
me then as one whose morning and evening prayers will be for your
happiness though she has lost her own farewell cleveland

he kneeled overpowered by his own bitter feelings to take the hand
which she held out to him and in that instant his confidant bunce
starting from behind one of the large upright pillars his eyes wet with
tears exclaimed 

never saw such a parting scene on any stage but i'll be d  d if you
make your exit as you expect

and so saying ere cleveland could employ either remonstrance or
resistance and indeed before he could get upon his feet he easily
secured him by pulling him down on his back so that two or three of the
boat's crew seized him by the arms and legs and began to hurry him
towards the lake minna and brenda shrieked and attempted to fly but
derrick snatched up the former with as much ease as a falcon pounces on
a pigeon while bunce with an oath or two which were intended to be of
a consolatory nature seized on brenda and the whole party with two or
three of the other pirates who stealing from the water-side had
accompanied them on the ambuscade began hastily to run towards the
boat which was left in charge of two of their number their course
however was unexpectedly interrupted and their criminal purpose
entirely frustrated

when mordaunt mertoun had turned out his guard in arms it was with the
natural purpose of watching over the safety of the two sisters they had
accordingly closely observed the motions of the pirates and when they
saw so many of them leave the boat and steal towards the place of
rendezvous assigned to cleveland they naturally suspected treachery
and by cover of an old hollow way or trench which perhaps had anciently
been connected with the monumental circle they had thrown themselves
unperceived between the pirates and their boat at the cries of the
sisters they started up and placed themselves in the way of the
ruffians presenting their pieces which notwithstanding they dared
not fire for fear of hurting the young ladies secured as they were in
the rude grasp of the marauders mordaunt however advanced with the
speed of a wild deer on bunce who loath to quit his prey yet unable
to defend himself otherwise turned to this side and that alternately
exposing brenda to the blows which mordaunt offered at him this
defence however proved in vain against a youth possessed of the
lightest foot and most active hand ever known in zetland and after a
feint or two mordaunt brought the pirate to the ground with a stroke
from the but of the carabine which he dared not use otherwise at the
same time fire-arms were discharged on either side by those who were
liable to no such cause of forbearance and the pirates who had hold of
cleveland dropped him naturally enough to provide for their own
defence or retreat but they only added to the numbers of their enemies
for cleveland perceiving minna in the arms of derrick snatched her
from the ruffian with one hand and with the other shot him dead on the
spot two or three more of the pirates fell or were taken the rest fled
to their boat pushed off then turned their broadside to the shore and
fired repeatedly on the orcadian party which they returned with little
injury on either side meanwhile mordaunt having first seen that the
sisters were at liberty and in full flight towards the house advanced
on cleveland with his cutlass drawn the pirate presented a pistol and
calling out at the same time mordaunt i never missed my aim he
fired into the air and threw it into the lake then drew his cutlass
brandished it round his head and flung that also as far as his arm
could send it in the same direction yet such was the universal belief
of his personal strength and resources that mordaunt still used
precaution as advancing on cleveland he asked if he surrendered

i surrender to no man said the pirate-captain but you may see i
have thrown away my weapons

he was immediately seized by some of the orcadians without his offering
any resistance but the instant interference of mordaunt prevented his
being roughly treated or bound the victors conducted him to a
well-secured upper apartment in the house of stennis and placed a
sentinel at the door bunce and fletcher both of whom had been
stretched on the field during the skirmish were lodged in the same
chamber and two prisoners who appeared of lower rank were confined
in a vault belonging to the mansion

without pretending to describe the joy of magnus troil who when
awakened by the noise and firing found his daughters safe and his
enemy a prisoner we shall only say it was so great that he forgot
for the time at least to enquire what circumstances were those which
had placed them in danger that he hugged mordaunt to his breast a
thousand times as their preserver and swore as often by the bones of
his sainted namesake that if he had a thousand daughters so tight a
lad and so true a friend should have the choice of them let lady
glowrowrum say what she would

a very different scene was passing in the prison-chamber of the
unfortunate cleveland and his associates the captain sat by the window
his eyes bent on the prospect of the sea which it presented and was
seemingly so intent on it as to be insensible of the presence of the
others jack bunce stood meditating some ends of verse in order to make
his advances towards a reconciliation with cleveland for he began to be
sensible from the consequences that the part he had played towards his
captain however well intended was neither lucky in its issue nor
likely to be well taken his admirer and adherent fletcher lay half
asleep as it seemed on a truckle-bed in the room without the least
attempt to interfere in the conversation which ensued

nay but speak to me clement said the penitent lieutenant if it be
but to swear at me for my stupidity

 what not an oath nay then the world goes hard
 if clifford cannot spare his friends an oath

i prithee peace and be gone said cleveland i have one bosom friend
left yet and you will make me bestow its contents on you or on
myself

i have it said bunce i have it and on he went in the vein of
jaffier 

 then by the hell i merit i'll not leave thee
 till to thyself at least thou'rt reconciled
 however thy resentment deal with me

i pray you once more to be silent said cleveland is it not enough
that you have undone me with your treachery but you must stun me with
your silly buffoonery i would not have believed you would have
lifted a finger against me jack of any man or devil in yonder unhappy
ship

who i exclaimed bunce i lift a finger against you and if i did
it was in pure love and to make you the happiest fellow that ever trode
a deck with your mistress beside you and fifty fine fellows at your
command here is dick fletcher can bear witness i did all for the best
if he would but speak instead of lolloping there like a dutch dogger
laid up to be careened get up dick and speak for me won't you

why yes jack bunce answered fletcher raising himself with
difficulty and speaking feebly i will if i can and i always knew you
spoke and did for the best but howsomdever d'ye see it has turned out
for the worst for me this time for i am bleeding to death i think

you cannot be such an ass said jack bunce springing to his
assistance as did cleveland but human aid came too late he sunk back
on the bed and turning on his face expired without a groan

i always thought him a d  d fool said bunce as he wiped a tear
from his eye but never such a consummate idiot as to hop the perch so
sillily i have lost the best follower and he again wiped his eye

cleveland looked on the dead body the rugged features of which had
remained unaltered by the death-pang a bull-dog he said of the
true british breed and with a better counsellor would have been a
better man

you may say that of some other folks too captain if you are minded
to do them justice said bunce

i may indeed and especially of yourself said cleveland in reply

why then say jack i forgive you said bunce it's but a short
word and soon spoken

i forgive you from all my soul jack said cleveland who had resumed
his situation at the window and the rather that your folly is of
little consequence the morning is come that must bring ruin on us all

what you are thinking of the old woman's prophecy you spoke of said
bunce

it will soon be accomplished answered cleveland come hither what
do you take yon large square-rigged vessel for that you see doubling
the headland on the east and opening the bay of stromness

why i can't make her well out said bunce but yonder is old goffe
takes her for a west indiaman loaded with rum and sugar i suppose for
d  n me if he does not slip cable and stand out to her

instead of running into the shoal-water which was his only safety
said cleveland the fool the dotard the drivelling drunken
idiot he will get his flip hot enough for yon is the halcyon see
she hoists her colours and fires a broadside and there will soon be an
end of the fortune's favourite i only hope they will fight her to the
last plank the boatswain used to be stanch enough and so is goffe
though an incarnate demon now she shoots away with all the sail she
can spread and that shows some sense

up goes the jolly hodge the old black flag with the death's head and
hour-glass and that shows some spunk added his comrade

the hour-glass is turned for us jack for this bout our sand is
running fast fire away yet my roving lads the deep sea or the blue
sky rather than a rope and a yard-arm

there was a moment of anxious and dead silence the sloop though hard
pressed maintaining still a running fight and the frigate continuing
in full chase but scarce returning a shot at length the vessels neared
each other so as to show that the man-of-war intended to board the
sloop instead of sinking her probably to secure the plunder which
might be in the pirate vessel

now goffe now boatswain exclaimed cleveland in an ecstasy of
impatience and as if they could have heard his commands stand by
sheets and tacks rake her with a broadside when you are under her
bows then about ship and go off on the other tack like a wild-goose
the sails shiver the helm's a-lee ah deep-sea sink the
lubbers they miss stays and the frigate runs them aboard

accordingly the various manoeuvres of the chase had brought them so
near that cleveland with his spy-glass could see the man-of-war's-men
boarding by the yards and bowsprit in irresistible numbers their naked
cutlasses flashing in the sun when at that critical moment both ships
were enveloped in a cloud of thick black smoke which suddenly arose on
board the captured pirate

exeunt omnes said bunce with clasped hands

there went the fortune's favourite ship and crew said cleveland at
the same instant

but the smoke immediately clearing away showed that the damage had only
been partial and that from want of a sufficient quantity of powder
the pirates had failed in their desperate attempt to blow up their
vessel with the halcyon

shortly after the action was over captain weatherport of the halcyon
sent an officer and a party of marines to the house of stennis to
demand from the little garrison the pirate seamen who were their
prisoners and in particular cleveland and bunce who acted as captain
and lieutenant of the gang

this was a demand which was not to be resisted though magnus troil
could have wished sincerely that the roof under which he lived had been
allowed as an asylum at least to cleveland but the officer's orders
were peremptory and he added it was captain weatherport's intention to
land the other prisoners and send the whole with a sufficient escort
across the island to kirkwall in order to undergo an examination there
before the civil authorities previous to their being sent off to london
for trial at the high court of admiralty magnus could therefore only
intercede for good usage to cleveland and that he might not be stripped
or plundered which the officer struck by his good mien and
compassionating his situation readily promised the honest udaller
would have said something in the way of comfort to cleveland himself
but he could not find words to express it and only shook his head

old friend said cleveland you may have much to complain of yet you
pity instead of exulting over me for the sake of you and yours i will
never harm human being more take this from me my last hope but my
last temptation also he drew from his bosom a pocket-pistol and gave
it to magnus troil remember me to but no let every one forget me i
am your prisoner sir said he to the officer

and i also said poor bunce and putting on a theatrical countenance
he ranted with no very perceptible faltering in his tone the words of
pierre

 captain you should be a gentleman of honour
 keep off the rabble that i may have room
 to entertain my fate and die with decency




chapter xxi

 joy joy in london now

 southey


the news of the capture of the rover reached kirkwall about an hour
before noon and filled all men with wonder and with joy little
business was that day done at the fair whilst people of all ages and
occupations streamed from the place to see the prisoners as they were
marched towards kirkwall and to triumph in the different appearance
which they now bore from that which they had formerly exhibited when
ranting swaggering and bullying in the streets of that town the
bayonets of the marines were soon seen to glisten in the sun and then
came on the melancholy troop of captives handcuffed two and two
together their finery had been partly torn from them by their captors
partly hung in rags about them many were wounded and covered with
blood many blackened and scorched with the explosion by which a few of
the most desperate had in vain striven to blow up the vessel most of
them seemed sullen and impenitent some were more becomingly affected
with their condition and a few braved it out and sung the same ribald
songs to which they had made the streets of kirkwall ring when they were
in their frolics

the boatswain and goffe coupled together exhausted themselves in
threats and imprecations against each other the former charging goffe
with want of seamanship and the latter alleging that the boatswain had
prevented him from firing the powder that was stowed forward and so
sending them all to the other world together last came cleveland and
bunce who were permitted to walk unshackled the decent melancholy yet
resolved manner of the former contrasting strongly with the stage strut
and swagger which poor jack thought it fitting to assume in order to
conceal some less dignified emotions the former was looked upon with
compassion the latter with a mixture of scorn and pity while most of
the others inspired horror and even fear by their looks and their
language

there was one individual in kirkwall who was so far from hastening to
see the sight which attracted all eyes that he was not even aware of
the event which agitated the town this was the elder mertoun whose
residence kirkwall had been for two or three days part of which had
been spent in attending to some judicial proceedings undertaken at the
instance of the procurator fiscal against that grave professor bryce
snailsfoot in consequence of an inquisition into the proceedings of
this worthy trader cleveland's chest with his papers and other matters
therein contained had been restored to mertoun as the lawful custodier
thereof until the right owner should be in a situation to establish his
right to them mertoun was at first desirous to throw back upon justice
the charge which she was disposed to intrust him with but on perusing
one or two of the papers he hastily changed his mind in broken words
requested the magistrate to let the chest be sent to his lodgings and
hastening homeward bolted himself into the room to consider and
digest the singular information which chance had thus conveyed to him
and which increased in a tenfold degree his impatience for an
interview with the mysterious norna of the fitful-head

it may be remembered that she had required of him when they met in the
churchyard of saint ninian to attend in the outer isle of the cathedral
of saint magnus at the hour of noon on the fifth day of the fair of
saint olla there to meet a person by whom the fate of mordaunt would be
explained to him it must be herself he said and that i should see
her at this moment is indispensable how to find her sooner i know not
and better lose a few hours even in this exigence than offend her by a
premature attempt to force myself on her presence

long therefore before noon long before the town of kirkwall was
agitated by the news of the events on the other side of the island the
elder mertoun was pacing the deserted aisle of the cathedral awaiting
with agonizing eagerness the expected communication from norna the
bell tolled twelve no door opened no one was seen to enter the
cathedral but the last sounds had not ceased to reverberate through the
vaulted roof when gliding from one of the interior side-aisles norna
stood before him mertoun indifferent to the apparent mystery of her
sudden approach with the secret of which the reader is acquainted
went up to her at once with the earnest ejaculation ulla ulla
troil aid me to save our unhappy boy

to ulla troil said norna i answer not i gave that name to the
winds on the night that cost me a father

speak not of that night of horror said mertoun we have need of our
reason let us not think on recollections which may destroy it but aid
me if thou canst to save our unfortunate child

vaughan answered norna he is already saved long since saved think
you a mother's hand and that of such a mother as i am would await your
crawling tardy ineffectual assistance no vaughan i make myself
known to you but to show my triumph over you it is the only revenge
which the powerful norna permits herself to take for the wrongs of ulla
troil

have you indeed saved him saved him from the murderous crew said
mertoun or vaughan speak and speak truth i will believe every
thing all you would require me to assent to prove to me only he is
escaped and safe

escaped and safe by my means said norna safe and in assurance of
an honoured and happy alliance yes great unbeliever yes wise and
self-opinioned infidel these were the works of norna i knew you many
a year since but never had i made myself known to you save with the
triumphant consciousness of having controlled the destiny that
threatened my son all combined against him planets which threatened
drowning combinations which menaced blood but my skill was superior to
all i arranged i combined i found means i made them each disaster
has been averted and what infidel on earth or stubborn demon beyond
the bounds of earth shall hereafter deny my power

the wild ecstasy with which she spoke so much resembled triumphant
insanity that mertoun answered were your pretensions less lofty and
your speech more plain i should be better assured of my son's safety

doubt on vain sceptic said norna and yet know that not only is
our son safe but vengeance is mine though i sought it not vengeance
on the powerful implement of the darker influences by whom my schemes
were so often thwarted and even the life of my son endangered yes
take it as a guarantee of the truth of my speech that cleveland the
pirate cleveland even now enters kirkwall as a prisoner and will soon
expiate with his life the having shed blood which is of kin to norna's

who didst thou say was prisoner exclaimed mertoun with a voice of
thunder who woman didst thou say should expiate his crimes with
his life

cleveland the pirate cleveland answered norna and by me whose
counsel he scorned he has been permitted to meet his fate

thou most wretched of women said mertoun speaking from between his
clenched teeth thou hast slain thy son as well as thy father

my son what son what mean you mordaunt is your son your only
son exclaimed norna is he not tell me quickly is he not

mordaunt is indeed my son said mertoun the laws at least gave
him to me as such but o unhappy ulla cleveland is your son as well as
mine blood of our blood bone of our bone and if you have given him to
death i will end my wretched life along with him

stay hold stop vaughan said norna i am not yet overcome prove
but to me the truth of what you say i would find help if i should
evoke hell but prove your words else believe them i cannot

thou help wretched overweening woman in what have thy
combinations and thy stratagems the legerdemain of lunacy the mere
quackery of insanity in what have these involved thee and yet i will
speak to thee as reasonable nay i will admit thee as powerful hear
then ulla the proofs which you demand and find a remedy if thou
canst 

when i fled from orkney he continued after a pause it is now
five-and-twenty years since i bore with me the unhappy offspring to
whom you had given light it was sent to me by one of your kinswomen
with an account of your illness which was soon followed by a generally
received belief of your death it avails not to tell in what misery i
left europe i found refuge in hispaniola wherein a fair young spaniard
undertook the task of comforter i married her she became mother of the
youth called mordaunt mertoun

you married her said norna in a tone of deep reproach

i did ulla answered mertoun but you were avenged she proved
faithless and her infidelity left me in doubts whether the child she
bore had a right to call me father but i also was avenged

you murdered her said norna with a dreadful shriek

i did that said mertoun without a more direct reply which made an
instant flight from hispaniola necessary your son i carried with me to
tortuga where we had a small settlement mordaunt vaughan my son by
marriage about three or four years younger was residing in
port-royal for the advantages of an english education i resolved never
to see him again but i continued to support him our settlement was
plundered by the spaniards when clement was but fifteen want came to
aid despair and a troubled conscience i became a corsair and involved
clement in the same desperate trade his skill and bravery though then
a mere boy gained him a separate command and after a lapse of two or
three years while we were on different cruises my crew rose on me and
left me for dead on the beach of one of the bermudas i recovered
however and my first enquiries after a tedious illness were after
clement he i heard had been also marooned by a rebellious crew and
put ashore on a desert islet to perish with want i believed he had so
perished

and what assures you that he did not said ulla or how comes this
cleveland to be identified with vaughan

to change a name is common with such adventurers answered mertoun
and clement had apparently found that of vaughan had become too
notorious and this change in his case prevented me from hearing any
tidings of him it was then that remorse seized me and that detesting
all nature but especially the sex to which louisa belonged i resolved
to do penance in the wild islands of zetland for the rest of my life to
subject myself to fasts and to the scourge was the advice of the holy
catholic priests whom i consulted but i devised a nobler penance i
determined to bring with me the unhappy boy mordaunt and to keep always
before me the living memorial of my misery and my guilt i have done so
and i have thought over both till reason has often trembled on her
throne and now to drive me to utter madness my clement my own my
undoubted son revives from the dead to be consigned to an infamous
death by the machinations of his own mother

away away said norna with a laugh when she had heard the story to
an end this is a legend framed by the old corsair to interest my aid
in favour of a guilty comrade how could i mistake mordaunt for my son
their ages being so different

the dark complexion and manly stature may have done much said basil
mertoun strong imagination must have done the rest

but give me proofs give me proofs that this cleveland is my son and
believe me this sun shall sooner sink in the east than they shall have
power to harm a hair of his head

these papers these journals said mertoun offering the pocket-book

i cannot read them she said after an effort my brain is dizzy

clement has also tokens which you may remember but they must have
become the booty of his captors he had a silver box with a runic
inscription with which in far other days you presented me a golden
chaplet

a box said norna hastily cleveland gave me one but a day since i
have never looked at it till now

eagerly she pulled it out eagerly examined the legend around the lid
and as eagerly exclaimed they may now indeed call me reimkennar for
by this rhyme i know myself murderess of my son as well as of my
father

the conviction of the strong delusion under which she had laboured was
so overwhelming that she sunk down at the foot of one of the
pillars mertoun shouted for help though in despair of receiving any
the sexton however entered and hopeless of all assistance from
norna the distracted father rushed out to learn if possible the fate
of his son




chapter xxii

 go some of you cry a reprieve

 beggar's opera


captain weatherport had before this time reached kirkwall in person
and was received with great joy and thankfulness by the magistrates who
had assembled in council for the purpose the provost in particular
expressed himself delighted with the providential arrival of the
halcyon at the very conjuncture when the pirate could not escape her
the captain looked a little surprised and said for that sir you may
thank the information you yourself supplied

that i supplied said the provost somewhat astonished

yes sir answered captain weatherport i understand you to be george
torfe chief magistrate of kirkwall who subscribes this letter

the astonished provost took the letter addressed to captain weatherport
of the halcyon stating the arrival force c of the pirates vessel
but adding that they had heard of the halcyon being on the coast and
that they were on their guard and ready to baffle her by going among
the shoals and through the islands and holms where the frigate could
not easily follow and at the worst they were desperate enough to
propose running the sloop ashore and blowing her up by which much booty
and treasure would be lost to the captors the letter therefore
suggested that the halcyon should cruise betwixt duncansbay head and
cape wrath for two or three days to relieve the pirates of the alarm
her neighbourhood occasioned and lull them into security the more
especially as the letter-writer knew it to be their intention if the
frigate left the coast to go into stromness bay and there put their
guns ashore for some necessary repairs or even for careening their
vessel if they could find means the letter concluded by assuring
captain weatherport that if he could bring his frigate into stromness
bay on the morning of the th of august he would have a good bargain
of the pirates if sooner he was not unlikely to miss them

this letter is not of my writing or subscribing captain weatherport
said the provost nor would i have ventured to advise any delay in your
coming hither

the captain was surprised in his turn all i know is that it reached
me when i was in the bay of thurso and that i gave the boat's crew that
brought it five dollars for crossing the pentland frith in very rough
weather they had a dumb dwarf as cockswain the ugliest urchin my eyes
ever opened upon i give you much credit for the accuracy of your
intelligence mr provost

it is lucky as it is said the provost yet i question whether the
writer of this letter would not rather that you had found the nest cold
and the bird flown

so saying he handed the letter to magnus troil who returned it with a
smile but without any observation aware doubtless with the sagacious
reader that norna had her own reasons for calculating with accuracy on
the date of the halcyon's arrival

without puzzling himself farther concerning a circumstance which seemed
inexplicable the captain requested that the examinations might proceed
and cleveland and altamont as he chose to be called were brought up
the first of the pirate crew on the charge of having acted as captain
and lieutenant they had just commenced the examination when after
some expostulation with the officers who kept the door basil mertoun
burst into the apartment and exclaimed take the old victim for the
young one i am basil vaughan too well known on the windward
station take my life and spare my son's

all were astonished and none more than magnus troil who hastily
explained to the magistrates and captain weatherport that this
gentleman had been living peaceably and honestly on the mainland of
zetland for many years

in that case said the captain i wash my hands of the poor man for
he is safe under two proclamations of mercy and by my soul when i
see them the father and his offspring hanging on each other's neck i
wish i could say as much for the son

but how is it how can it be said the provost we always called the
old man mertoun and the young cleveland and now it seems they are
both named vaughan

vaughan answered magnus is a name which i have some reason to
remember and from what i have lately heard from my cousin norna that
old man has a right to bear it

and i trust the young man also said the captain who had been
looking over a memorandum listen to me a moment added he addressing
the younger vaughan whom we have hitherto called cleveland hark you
sir your name is said to be clement vaughan are you the same who
then a mere boy commanded a party of rovers who about eight or nine
years ago pillaged a spanish village called quempoa on the spanish
main with the purpose of seizing some treasure

it will avail me nothing to deny it answered the prisoner

no said captain weatherport but it may do you service to admit
it well the muleteers escaped with the treasure while you were
engaged in protecting at the hazard of your own life the honour of two
spanish ladies against the brutality of your followers do you remember
any thing of this

i am sure i do said jack bunce for our captain here was marooned
for his gallantry and i narrowly escaped flogging and pickling for
having taken his part

when these points are established said captain weatherport
vaughan's life is safe the women he saved were persons of quality
daughters to the governor of the province and application was long
since made by the grateful spaniard to our government for favour to
be shown to their preserver i had special orders about clement vaughan
when i had a commission for cruizing upon the pirates in the west
indies six or seven years since but vaughan was gone then as a name
amongst them and i heard enough of cleveland in his room however
captain be you cleveland or vaughan i think that as the quempoa hero
i can assure you a free pardon when you arrive in london

cleveland bowed and the blood mounted to his face mertoun fell on his
knees and exhausted himself in thanksgiving to heaven they were
removed amidst the sympathizing sobs of the spectators

and now good master lieutenant what have you got to say for
yourself said captain weatherport to the ci-devant roscius

why little or nothing please your honour only that i wish your
honour could find my name in that book of mercy you have in your hand
for i stood by captain clement vaughan in that quempoa business

you call yourself frederick altamont said captain weatherport i can
see no such name here one john bounce or bunce the lady put on her
tablets

why that is me that is i myself captain i can prove it and i am
determined though the sound be something plebeian rather to live jack
bunce than to hang as frederick altamont

in that case said the captain i can give you some hopes as john
bunce

thank your noble worship shouted bunce then changing his tone he
said ah since an alias has such virtue poor dick fletcher might have
come off as timothy tugmutton but howsomdever d'ye see to use his own
phrase  

away with the lieutenant said the captain and bring forward goffe
and the other fellows there will be ropes reeved for some of them i
think and this prediction promised to be amply fulfilled so strong
was the proof which was brought against them

the halcyon was accordingly ordered round to carry the whole prisoners
to london for which she set sail in the course of two days

during the time that the unfortunate cleveland remained at kirkwall he
was treated with civility by the captain of the halcyon and the
kindness of his old acquaintance magnus troil who knew in secret how
closely he was allied to his blood pressed on him accommodations of
every kind more than he could be prevailed on to accept

norna whose interest in the unhappy prisoner was still more deep was
at this time unable to express it the sexton had found her lying on the
pavement in a swoon and when she recovered her mind for the time had
totally lost its equipoise and it became necessary to place her under
the restraint of watchful attendants

of the sisters of burgh-westra cleveland only heard that they remained
ill in consequence of the fright to which they had been subjected
until the evening before the halcyon sailed when he received by a
private conveyance the following billet

  farewell cleveland we part for ever and it is right that we
 should be virtuous and be happy the delusions which a solitary
 education and limited acquaintance with the modern world had
 spread around me are gone and dissipated for ever but in you i
 am sure i have been thus far free from error that you are one to
 whom good is naturally more attractive than evil and whom only
 necessity example and habit have forced into your late course
 of life think of me as one who no longer exists unless you
 should become as much the object of general praise as now of
 general reproach and then think of me as one who will rejoice in
 your reviving fame though she must never see you more 

the note was signed m t and cleveland with a deep emotion which he
testified even by tears read it an hundred times over and then
clasped it to his bosom

mordaunt mertoun heard by letter from his father but in a very
different style basil bade him farewell for ever and acquitted him
henceforward of the duties of a son as one on whom he notwithstanding
the exertions of many years had found himself unable to bestow the
affections of a parent the letter informed him of a recess in the old
house of jarlshof in which the writer had deposited a considerable
quantity of specie and of treasure which he desired mordaunt to use as
his own you need not fear the letter bore either that you lay
yourself under obligation to me or that you are sharing the spoils of
piracy what is now given over to you is almost entirely the property
of your deceased mother louisa gonzago and is yours by every right
let us forgive each other was the conclusion as they who must meet
no more and they never met more for the elder mertoun against whom
no charge was ever preferred disappeared after the fate of cleveland
was determined and was generally believed to have retired into a
foreign convent

the fate of cleveland will be most briefly expressed in a letter which
minna received within two months after the halcyon left kirkwall the
family were then assembled at burgh-westra and mordaunt was a member of
it for the time the good udaller thinking he could never sufficiently
repay the activity which he had shown in the defence of his daughters
norna then beginning to recover from her temporary alienation of mind
was a guest in the family and minna who was sedulous in her attention
upon this unfortunate victim of mental delusion was seated with her
watching each symptom of returning reason when the letter we allude to
was placed in her hands

 minna it said dearest minna farewell and for ever believe
 me i never meant you wrong never from the moment i came to know
 you i resolved to detach myself from my hateful comrades and had
 framed a thousand schemes which have proved as vain as they
 deserved to be for why or how should the fate of her that is so
 lovely pure and innocent be involved with that of one so
 guilty of these dreams i will speak no more the stern reality
 of my situation is much milder than i either expected or deserved
 and the little good i did has outweighed in the minds of
 honourable and merciful judges much that was evil and criminal i
 have not only been exempted from the ignominious death to which
 several of my compeers are sentenced but captain weatherport
 about once more to sail for the spanish main under the
 apprehension of an immediate war with that country has generously
 solicited and obtained permission to employ me and two or three
 more of my less guilty associates in the same service a measure
 recommended to himself by his own generous compassion and to
 others by our knowledge of the coast and of local circumstances
 which by whatever means acquired we now hope to use for the
 service of our country minna you will hear my name pronounced
 with honour or you will never hear it again if virtue can give
 happiness i need not wish it to you for it is yours
 already farewell minna

minna wept so bitterly over this letter that it attracted the attention
of the convalescent norna she snatched it from the hand of her
kinswoman and read it over at first with the confused air of one to
whom it conveyed no intelligence then with a dawn of recollection then
with a burst of mingled joy and grief in which she dropped it from her
hand minna snatched it up and retired with her treasure to her own
apartment

from that time norna appeared to assume a different character her dress
was changed to one of a more simple and less imposing appearance her
dwarf was dismissed with ample provision for his future comfort she
showed no desire of resuming her erratic life and directed her
observatory as it might be called on fitful-head to be dismantled
she refused the name of norna and would only be addressed by her real
appellation of ulla troil but the most important change remained
behind formerly from the dreadful dictates of spiritual despair
arising out of the circumstances of her father's death she seemed to
have considered herself as an outcast from divine grace besides that
enveloped in the vain occult sciences which she pretended to practise
her study like that of chaucer's physician had been but little in the
bible now the sacred volume was seldom laid aside and to the poor
ignorant people who came as formerly to invoke her power over the
elements she only replied the winds are in the hollow of his
hand her conversion was not perhaps altogether rational for this
the state of a mind disordered by such a complication of horrid
incidents probably prevented but it seemed to be sincere and was
certainly useful she appeared deeply to repent of her former
presumptuous attempts to interfere with the course of human events
superintended as they are by far higher powers and expressed bitter
compunction when such her former pretensions were in any manner
recalled to her memory she still showed a partiality to mordaunt
though perhaps arising chiefly from habit nor was it easy to know how
much or how little she remembered of the complicated events in which she
had been connected when she died which was about four years after the
events we have commemorated it was found that at the special and
earnest request of minna troil she had conveyed her very considerable
property to brenda a clause in her will specially directed that all
the books implements of her laboratory and other things connected with
her former studies should be committed to the flames

about two years before norna's death brenda was wedded to mordaunt
mertoun it was some time before old magnus troil with all his
affection for his daughter and all his partiality for mordaunt was
able frankly to reconcile himself to this match but mordaunt's
accomplishments were peculiarly to the udaller's taste and the old man
felt the impossibility of supplying his place in his family so
absolutely that at length his norse blood gave way to the natural
feeling of the heart and he comforted his pride while he looked around
him and saw what he considered as the encroachments of the scottish
gentry upon the country so zetland is fondly termed by its
inhabitants that as well his daughter married the son of an english
pirate as of a scottish thief in scornful allusion to the highland
and border families to whom zetland owes many respectable landholders
but whose ancestors were generally esteemed more renowned for ancient
family and high courage than for accurately regarding the trifling
distinctions of meum and tuum the jovial old man lived to the
extremity of human life with the happy prospect of a numerous
succession in the family of his younger daughter and having his board
cheered alternately by the minstrelsy of claud halcro and enlightened
by the lucubrations of mr triptolemus yellowley who laying aside his
high pretensions was when he became better acquainted with the manners
of the islanders and remembered the various misadventures which had
attended his premature attempts at reformation an honest and useful
representative of his principal and never so happy as when he could
escape from the spare commons of his sister barbara to the genial table
of the udaller barbara's temper also was much softened by the
unexpected restoration of the horn of silver coins the property of
norna which she had concealed in the mansion of old stourburgh for
achieving some of her mysterious plans but which she now restored to
those by whom it had been accidentally discovered with an intimation
however that it would again disappear unless a reasonable portion was
expended on the sustenance of the family a precaution to which tronda
dronsdaughter probably an agent of norna's owed her escape from a slow
and wasting death by inanition

mordaunt and brenda were as happy as our mortal condition permits us to
be they admired and loved each other enjoyed easy circumstances had
duties to discharge which they did not neglect and clear in conscience
as light of heart laughed sung danced daffed the world aside and
bid it pass

but minna the high-minded and imaginative minna she gifted with such
depth of feeling and enthusiasm yet doomed to see both blighted in
early youth because with the inexperience of a disposition equally
romantic and ignorant she had built the fabric of her happiness on a
quicksand instead of a rock was she could she be happy reader she
was happy for whatever may be alleged to the contrary by the sceptic
and the scorner to each duty performed there is assigned a degree of
mental peace and high consciousness of honourable exertion
corresponding to the difficulty of the task accomplished that rest of
the body which succeeds to hard and industrious toil is not to be
compared to the repose which the spirit enjoys under similar
circumstances her resignation however and the constant attention
which she paid to her father her sister the afflicted norna and to
all who had claims on her were neither minna's sole nor her most
precious source of comfort like norna but under a more regulated
judgment she learned to exchange the visions of wild enthusiasm which
had exerted and misled her imagination for a truer and purer connexion
with the world beyond us than could be learned from the sagas of
heathen bards or the visions of later rhymers to this she owed the
support by which she was enabled after various accounts of the
honourable and gallant conduct of cleveland to read with resignation
and even with a sense of comfort mingled with sorrow that he had at
length fallen leading the way in a gallant and honourable enterprise
which was successfully accomplished by those companions to whom his
determined bravery had opened the road bunce his fantastic follower in
good as formerly in evil transmitted an account to minna of this
melancholy event in terms which showed that though his head was weak
his heart had not been utterly corrupted by the lawless life which he
had for some time led or at least that it had been amended by the
change and that he himself had gained credit and promotion in the same
action seemed to be of little consequence to him compared with the
loss of his old captain and comrade minna read the intelligence
and thanked heaven even while the eyes which she lifted up were
streaming with tears that the death of cleveland had been in the bed of
honour nay she even had the courage to add her gratitude that he had
been snatched from a situation of temptation ere circumstances had
overcome his new-born virtue and so strongly did this reflection
operate that her life after the immediate pain of this event had
passed away seemed not only as resigned but even more cheerful than
before her thoughts however were detached from the world and only
visited it with an interest like that which guardian spirits take for
their charge in behalf of those friends with whom she lived in love or
of the poor whom she could serve and comfort thus passed her life
enjoying from all who approached her an affection enhanced by
reverence insomuch that when her friends sorrowed for her death which
arrived at a late period of her existence they were comforted by the
fond reflection that the humanity which she then laid down was the
only circumstance which had placed her in the words of scripture a
little lower than the angels

 we have been able to learn nothing with certainty of bunce's fate
but our friend dr dryasdust believes he may be identified with an old
gentleman who in the beginning of the reign of george i attended the
rose coffee-house regularly went to the theatre every night told
mercilessly long stories about the spanish main controlled reckonings
bullied waiters and was generally known by the name of captain bounce




author's notes


note i p  fortune-telling rhymes

the author has in chapter i supposed that a very ancient northern
custom used by those who were accounted soothsaying women might have
survived though in jest rather than earnest among the zetlanders
their descendants the following original account of such a scene will
show the ancient importance and consequence of such a prophetic
character as was assumed by norna 

there lived in the same territory greenland a woman named thorbiorga
who was a prophetess and called the little vola or fatal sister the
only one of nine sisters who survived thorbiorga during the winter used
to frequent the festivities of the season invited by those who were
desirous of learning their own fortune and the future events which
impended torquil being a man of consequence in the country it fell to
his lot to enquire how long the dearth was to endure with which the
country was then afflicted he therefore invited the prophetess to his
house having made liberal preparation as was the custom for receiving
a guest of such consequence the seat of the soothsayer was placed in an
eminent situation and covered with pillows filled with the softest
eider down in the evening she arrived together with a person who had
been sent to meet her and show her the way to torquil's habitation she
was attired as follows she had a sky-blue tunick having the front
ornamented with gems from the top to the bottom and wore around her
throat a necklace of glass beads her head-gear was of black
lambskin the lining being the fur of a white wild-cat she leant on a
staff having a ball at the top the staff was ornamented with
brass and the ball or globe with gems or pebbles she wore a hunland
or hungarian girdle to which was attached a large pouch in which she
kept her magical implements her shoes were of sealskin dressed with
the hair outside and secured by long and thick straps fastened by
brazen clasps she wore gloves of the wild-cat's skin with the fur
inmost as this venerable person entered the hall all saluted her with
due respect but she only returned the compliments of such as were
agreeable to her torquil conducted her with reverence to the seat
prepared for her and requested she would purify the apartment and
company assembled by casting her eyes over them she was by no means
sparing of her words the table being at length covered such viands
were placed before thorbiorga as suited her character of a soothsayer
these were a preparation of goat's milk and a mess composed of the
hearts of various animals the prophetess made use of a brazen spoon
and a pointless knife the handle of which was composed of a whale's
tooth and ornamented with two rings of brass the table being removed
torquil addressed thorbiorga requesting her opinion of his house and
guests at the same time intimating the subjects on which he and the
company were desirous to consult her

thorbiorga replied it was impossible for her to answer their enquiries
until she had slept a night under his roof the next morning therefore
the magical apparatus necessary for her purpose was prepared and she
then enquired as a necessary part of the ceremony whether there was
any female present who could sing a magical song called vardlokur
when no songstress such as she desired could be found gudrida the
daughter of torquil replied i am no sorceress or soothsayer but my
nurse haldisa taught me when in iceland a song called
vardlokur then thou knowest more than i was aware of said
torquil but as i am a christian continued gudrida i consider these
rites as matters which it is unlawful to promote and the song itself as
unlawful nevertheless answered the soothsayer thou mayst help us
in this matter without any harm to thy religion since the task will
remain with torquil to provide every thing necessary for the present
purpose torquil also earnestly entreated gudrida till she consented
to grant his request the females then surrounded thorbiorga who took
her place on a sort of elevated stage gudrida then sung the magic song
with a voice so sweet and tuneful as to excel any thing that had been
heard by any present the soothsayer delighted with the melody
returned thanks to the singer and then said much i have now learned
of dearth and disease approaching the country and many things are now
clear to me which before were hidden as well from me as others our
present dearth of substance shall not long endure for the present and
plenty will in the spring succeed to scarcity the contagious diseases
also with which the country has been for some time afflicted will in a
short time take their departure to thee gudrida i can in recompense
for thy assistance on this occasion announce a fortune of higher import
than any one could have conjectured you shall be married to a man of
name here in greenland but you shall not long enjoy that union for
your fate recalls you to iceland where you shall become the mother of a
numerous and honourable family which shall be enlightened by a luminous
ray of good fortune so my daughter wishing thee health i bid thee
farewell the prophetess having afterwards given answers to all
queries which were put to her either by torquil or his guests departed
to show her skill at another festival to which she had been invited for
that purpose but all which she had presaged either concerning the
public or individuals came truly to pass

the above narrative is taken from the saga of erick randa as quoted by
the learned bartholine in his curious work he mentions similar
instances particularly of one heida celebrated for her predictions
who attended festivals for the purpose as a modern scotsman might say
of spaeing fortunes with a gallant tail or retinue of thirty male
and fifteen female attendants see de causis contemptæ a danis adhuc

note ii p  promise of odin

although the father of scandinavian mythology has been as a deity long
forgotten in the archipelago which was once a very small part of his
realm yet even at this day his name continues to be occasionally
attested as security for a promise

it is curious to observe that the rites with which such attestations
are still made in orkney correspond to those of the ancient northmen
it appears from several authorities that in the norse ritual when an
oath was imposed he by whom it was pledged passed his hand while
pronouncing it through a massive ring of silver kept for that
purpose in like manner two persons generally lovers desirous to
take the promise of odin which they considered as peculiarly binding
joined hands through a circular hole in a sacrificial stone which lies
in the orcadian stonehenge called the circle of stennis of which we
shall speak more hereafter the ceremony is now confined to the
troth-plighting of the lower classes but at an earlier period may be
supposed to have influenced a character like minna in the higher ranks


note iii p  the pictish burgh

the pictish burgh a fort which nora is supposed to have converted into
her dwelling-house has been fully described in the notes upon ivanhoe
vol xvii p of this edition an account of the celebrated castle
of mousa is there given to afford an opportunity of comparing it with
the saxon castle of coningsburgh it should however have been
mentioned that the castle of mousa underwent considerable repairs at a
comparatively recent period accordingly torfæus assures us that even
this ancient pigeon-house composed of dry stones was fortification
enough not indeed to hold out a ten years siege like troy in similar
circumstances but to wear out the patience of the besiegers erland
the son of harold the fair-spoken had carried off a beautiful woman
the mother of a norwegian earl also called harold and sheltered
himself with his fair prize in the castle of mousa earl harold followed
with an army and finding the place too strong for assault endeavoured
to reduce it by famine but such was the length of the siege that the
offended earl found it necessary to listen to a treaty of accommodation
and agreed that his mother's honour should be restored by marriage this
transaction took place in the beginning of the thirteenth century in
the reign of william the lion of scotland it is probable that the
improvements adopted by erland on this occasion were those which
finished the parapet of the castle by making it project outwards so
that the tower of mousa rather resembles the figure of a dice-box
whereas others of the same kind have the form of a truncated cone it is
easy to see how the projection of the highest parapet would render the
defence more easy and effectual



note iv p  antique coins found in zetland

while these sheets were passing through the press i received a letter
from an honourable and learned friend containing the following passage
relating to a discovery in zetland within a few weeks the workmen
taking up the foundation of an old wall came on a hearth-stone under
which they found a horn surrounded with massive silver rings like
bracelets and filled with coins of the heptarchy in perfect
preservation the place of finding is within a very short distance of
the supposed residence of norna of the fitful-head thus one of the
very improbable fictions of the tale is verified by a singular
coincidence


note v p  character of norna

the character of norna is meant to be an instance of that singular kind
of insanity during which the patient while she or he retains much
subtlety and address for the power of imposing upon others is still
more ingenious in endeavouring to impose upon themselves indeed
maniacs of this kind may be often observed to possess a sort of double
character in one of which they are the being whom their distempered
imagination shapes out and in the other their own natural self as
seen to exist by other people this species of double consciousness
makes wild work with the patient's imagination and judiciously used
is perhaps a frequent means of restoring sanity of intellect exterior
circumstances striking the senses often have a powerful effect in
undermining or battering the airy castles which the disorder has
excited

a late medical gentleman my particular friend told me the case of a
lunatic patient confined in the edinburgh infirmary he was so far happy
that his mental alienation was of a gay and pleasant character giving a
kind of joyous explanation to all that came in contact with him he
considered the large house numerous servants c of the hospital as
all matters of state and consequence belonging to his own personal
establishment and had no doubt of his own wealth and grandeur one
thing alone puzzled this man of wealth although he was provided with a
first-rate cook and proper assistants although his table was regularly
supplied with every delicacy of the season yet he confessed to my
friend that by some uncommon depravity of the palate every thing which
he ate tasted of porridge this peculiarity of course arose from the
poor man being fed upon nothing else and because his stomach was not so
easily deceived as his other senses


note vi p  birds of prey

so favourable a retreat does the island of hoy afford for birds of prey
that instances of their ravages which seldom occur in other parts of
the country are not unusual there an individual was living in orkney
not long since whom while a child in its swaddling clothes an eagle
actually transported to its nest in the hill of hoy happily the eyry
being known and the bird instantly pursued the child was found
uninjured playing with the young eagles a story of a more ludicrous
transportation was told me by the reverend clergyman who is minister of
the island hearing one day a strange grunting he suspected his
servants had permitted a sow and pigs which were tenants of his
farm-yard to get among his barley crop having in vain looked for the
transgressors upon solid earth he at length cast his eyes upward when
he discovered one of the litter in the talons of a large eagle which
was soaring away with the unfortunate pig squeaking all the while with
terror towards her nest in the crest of hoy


note vii p  the standing stones of stennis

the standing stones of stennis as by a little pleonasm this remarkable
monument is termed furnishes an irresistible refutation of the opinion
of such antiquaries as hold that the circles usually called druidical
were peculiar to that race of priests there is every reason to believe
that the custom was as prevalent in scandinavia as in gaul or britain
and as common to the mythology of odin as to druidical superstition
there is even reason to think that the druids never occupied any part
of the orkneys and tradition as well as history ascribes the stones
of stennis to the scandinavians two large sheets of water
communicating with the sea are connected by a causeway with openings
permitting the tide to rise and recede which is called the bridge of
broisgar upon the eastern tongue of land appear the standing stones
arranged in the form of a half circle or rather a horse-shoe the
height of the pillars being fifteen feet and upwards within this circle
lies a stone probably sacrificial one of the pillars a little to the
westward is perforated with a circular hole through which loving
couples are wont to join hands when they take the promise of odin as
has been repeatedly mentioned in the text the enclosure is surrounded
by barrows and on the opposite isthmus advancing towards the bridge of
broisgar there is another monument of standing stones which in this
case is completely circular they are less in size than those on the
eastern side of the lake their height running only from ten or twelve
to fourteen feet this western circle is surrounded by a deep trench
drawn on the outside of the pillars and i remarked four tumuli or
mounds of earth regularly disposed around it stonehenge excels this
orcadian monument but that of stennis is i conceive the only one in
britain which can be said to approach it in consequence all the
northern nations marked by those huge enclosures the places of popular
meeting either for religious worship or the transaction of public
business of a temporal nature the northern popular antiquities
contain in an abstract of the eyrbiggia saga a particular account of
the manner in which the helga fels or holy rock was set apart by the
pontiff thorolf for solemn occasions

i need only add that different from the monument on salisbury plain
the stones which were used in the orcadian circle seem to have been
raised from a quarry upon the spot of which the marks are visible


footnotes

 we may suppose the beads to have been of the potent adderstone to
which so many virtues were ascribed

 like those anciently borne by porters at the gates of distinguished
persons as a badge of office

editor's notes


a p norna's soothsaying the passage quoted by scott from the
saga of eric the red may be read in its context in vinland the good
edited by mr reeves and published by the clarendon press eric was the
discoverer of greenland and father of leif the lucky who found vinland
new england or nova scotia about the year leif has a statue in
boston massachusetts

b p islands supposed to be haunted in de quincey's
autobiographical essay his sailor brother pink describes the terrors
of those isles one of them the noise of a midnight axe is also found
in ceylon in mexico and elsewhere the editor may be permitted to
refer to the legends collected in his custom and myth

c p cleveland's song lockhart says that scott in his later
years heard this song sung and said capital words whose are they
byron's i suppose but i don't remember them he was astonished when i
told him that they were his own in the pirate he seemed pleased at
the moment but said next minute you have distressed me if memory
goes all is up with me for that was always my strong point this was
in mrs arkwright was the daughter of stephen kemble she set
hohenlinden

d p auld robin gray in the abbotsford mss is a long
correspondence between lady ann lindsay and scott she had known him as
a child there was a project of editing all her poems but perhaps her
own modesty perhaps the quality of the work caused this to be dropped
and scott only edited the ballad with a letter of the lady's this
small quarto sells for some when it comes into the market it has a
frontispiece by charles kirkpatrick sharpe and is apparently the only
book of scott's which is valued as a rarity by bibliomaniacs

e p john was a jacobite in the library of a country house in
the south of england is a copy of dryden's miscellany poems with a
laudatory autograph envoy to judge jeffreys a sufficiently
thoroughgoing king's man

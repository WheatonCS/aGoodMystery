introduction

it is not improbable that some of those who read this book may feel
a wish to know in what manner i became possessed of the manuscript
such a desire is too just and natural to be thwarted and the tale
shall be told as briefly as possible

during the summer of while travelling among those valleys of
switzerland which lie between the two great ranges of the alps and
in which both the rhone and the rhine take their rise i had passed
from the sources of the latter to those of the former river and had
reached that basin in the mountains that is so celebrated for
containing the glacier of the rhone when chance gave me one of
those rare moments of sublimity and solitude which are the more
precious in the other hemisphere from their infrequency on every
side the view was bounded by high and ragged mountains their peaks
glittering near the sun while directly before me and on a level
with the eye lay that miraculous frozen sea out of whose drippings
the rhone starts a foaming river to glance away to the distant
mediterranean for the first time during a pilgrimage of years i
felt alone with nature in europe alas the enjoyment as all such
enjoyments necessarily are amid the throngs of the old world was
short and treacherous a party came round the angle of a rock along
the narrow bridle-path in single file two ladies on horseback
followed by as many gentlemen on foot and preceded by the usual
guide it was but small courtesy to rise and salute the dove-like
eyes and blooming cheeks of the former as they passed they were
english and the gentlemen appeared to recognize me as a countryman
one of the latter stopped and politely inquired if the passage of
the furca was obstructed by snow he was told not and in return for
the information said that i would find the grimsel a little
ticklish but he added smiling the ladies succeeded in
crossing and you will scarcely hesitate i thought i might get
over a difficulty that his fair companions had conquered he then
told me sir herbert taylor was made adjutant-general and wished me
good morning

i sat reflecting on the character hopes pursuits and interests of
man for an hour concluding that the stranger was a soldier who
let some of the ordinary workings of his thoughts overflow in this
brief and casual interview to resume my solitary journey cross the
rhone and toil my way up the rugged side of the grimsel consumed
two more hours and glad was i to come in view of the little chill-
looking sheet of water on its summit which is called the lake of
the dead the path was filled with snow at a most critical point
where indeed a misplaced footstep might betray the incautious to
their destruction a large party on the other side appeared fully
aware of the difficulty for it had halted and was in earnest
discussion with the guide touching the practicability of passing
it was decided to attempt the enterprise first came a female of one
of the sweetest serenest countenances i had ever seen she too
was english and though she trembled and blushed and laughed at
herself she came on with spirit and would have reached my side in
safety had not an unlucky stone turned beneath a foot that was much
too pretty for those wild hills i sprang forward and was so happy
as to save her from destruction she felt the extent of the
obligation and expressed her thanks modestly but with fervor in a
minute we were joined by her husband who grasped my hand with warm
feeling or rather with the emotion one ought to feel who had
witnessed the risk he had just run of losing an angel the lady
seemed satisfied at leaving us together

you are an englishman said the stranger

an american

an american this is singular will you pardon a question you
have more than saved my life you have probably saved my reason 
will you pardon a question can money serve you

i smiled and told him odd as it might appear to him that though
an american i was a gentleman he appeared embarrassed and his
fine face worked until i began to pity him for it was evident he
wished to show me in some way how much he felt he was my debtor
and yet he did not know exactly what to propose

we may meet again i said squeezing his hand

will you receive my card

most willingly

he put viscount householder into my hand and in return i gave him
my own humble appellation

he looked from the card to me and from me to the card and some
agreeable idea appeared to flash upon his mind

shall you visit geneva this summer he asked earnestly

within a month

your address 

hotel de l'ecu

you shall hear from me adieu

we parted he his lovely wife and his guides descending to the
rhone while i pursued my way to the hospice of the grimsel within
the month i received a large packet at l'ecu it contained a
valuable diamond ring with a request that i would wear it as a
memorial of lady householder and a fairly written manuscript the
following short note explained the wishes of the writer

providence brought us together for more purposes than were at first
apparent i have long hesitated about publishing the accompanying
narrative for in england there is a disposition to cavil at
extraordinary facts but the distance of america from my place of
residence will completely save me from ridicule the world must have
the truth and i see no better means than by resorting to your
agency all i ask is that you will have the book fairly printed
and that you will send one copy to my address householder hall
dorsetshire eng and another to captain noah poke stonington
conn in your own country my anna prays for you and is ever your
friend do not forget us

yours most faithfully

householder

i have rigidly complied with this request and having sent the two
copies according to direction the rest of the edition is at the
disposal of any one who may feel an inclination to pay for it in
return for the copy sent to stonington i received the following
letter

on board the derby and dolly
stonnin'tun april st 

author of the spy esquire

dear sir your favor is come to hand and found me in good health
as i hope these few lines will have the same advantage with you i
have read the book and must say there is some truth in it which i
suppose is as much as befalls any book the bible the almanac and
the state laws excepted i remember sir john well and shall gainsay
nothing he testifies to for the reason that friends should not
contradict each other i was also acquainted with the four monikins
he speaks of though i knew them by different names miss poke says
she wonders if it's all true which i wunt tell her seeing that a
little unsartainty makes a woman rational as to my navigating
without geometry thats a matter that wasn't worth booking for it's
no curiosity in these parts bating a look at the compass once or
twice a day and so i take my leave of you with offers to do any
commission for you among the sealing islands for which i sail to-
morrow wind and weather permitting

yours to sarve noah poke

to the author of the spy esquire
 -town   county york state

p s i always told sir john to steer clear of too much
journalizing but he did nothing but write night and day for a
week and as you brew so you must bake the wind has chopped and
we shall take our anchor this tide so no more at present

n b sir john is a little out about my eating the monkey which i
did four years before i fell in with him down on the spanish main
it was not bad food to the taste but was wonderful narvous to the
eye i r'ally thought i had got hold of miss poke's youngest born

chapter i

the author's pedigree also that of his father


the philosopher who broaches a new theory is bound to furnish at
least some elementary proofs of the reasonableness of his
positions and the historian who ventures to record marvels that
have hitherto been hid from human knowledge owes it to a decent
regard to the opinions of others to produce some credible testimony
in favor of his veracity i am peculiarly placed in regard to these
two great essentials having little more than its plausibility to
offer in favor of my philosophy and no other witness than myself to
establish the important facts that are now about to be laid before
the reading world for the first time in this dilemma i fully feel
the weight of responsibility under which i stand for there are
truths of so little apparent probability as to appear fictitious
and fictions so like the truth that the ordinary observer is very
apt to affirm that he was an eye-witness to their existence two
facts that all our historians would do well to bear in mind since a
knowledge of the circumstances might spare them the mortification of
having testimony that cost a deal of trouble discredited in the one
case and save a vast deal of painful and unnecessary labor in the
other thrown upon myself therefore for what the french call les
pieces justificatives of my theories as well as of my facts i see
no better way to prepare the reader to believe me than by giving an
unvarnished the result of the orange-woman's application for had my
worthy ancestor been subjected to the happy accidents and generous
caprices of voluntary charity it is more than probable i should be
driven to throw a veil over those important years of his life that
were notoriously passed in the work-house but which in consequence
of that occurrence are now easily authenticated by valid minutes
and documentary evidence thus it is that there exists no void in
the annals of our family even that period which is usually
remembered through gossiping and idle tales in the lives of most
men being matter of legal record in that of my progenitor and so
continued to be down to the day of his presumed majority since he
was indebted to a careful master the moment the parish could with
any legality putting decency quite out of the question get rid of
him i ought to have said that the orange-woman taking a hint from
the sign of a butcher opposite to whose door my ancestor was found
had very cleverly given him the name of thomas goldencalf

this second important transition in the affairs of my father might
be deemed a presage of his future fortunes he was bound apprentice
to a trader in fancy articles or a shopkeeper who dealt in such
objects as are usually purchased by those who do not well know what
to do with their money this trade was of immense advantage to the
future prosperity of the young adventurer for in addition to the
known fact that they who amuse are much better paid than they who
instruct their fellow-creatures his situation enabled him to study
those caprices of men which properly improved are of themselves a
mine of wealth as well as to gain a knowledge of the important
truth that the greatest events of this life are much oftener the
result of impulse than of calculation

i have it by a direct tradition orally conveyed from the lips of my
ancestor that no one could be more lucky than himself in the
character of his master this personage who came in time to be my
maternal grandfather was one of those wary traders who encourage
others in their follies with a view to his own advantage and the
experience of fifty years had rendered him so expert in the
practices of his calling that it was seldom he struck out a new
vein in his mine without finding himself rewarded for the
enterprise by a success that was fully equal to his expectations

tom he said one day to his apprentice when time had produced
confidence and awakened sympathies between them thou art a lucky
youth or the parish officer would never have brought thee to my
door thou little knowest the wealth that is in store for thee or
the treasures that are at thy command if thou provest diligent and
in particular faithful to my interests my provident grandfather
never missed an occasion to throw in a useful moral notwithstanding
the general character of veracity that distinguished his commerce
now what dost think lad may be the amount of my capital

my ancestor in the male line hesitated to reply for hitherto his
ideas had been confined to the profits never having dared to lift
his thoughts as high as that source from which he could not but see
they flowed in a very ample stream but thrown upon himself by so
unexpected a question and being quick at figures after adding ten
per cent to the sum which he knew the last year had given as the
net avail of their joint ingenuity he named the amount in answered
to the interrogatory

my maternal grandfather laughed in the face of my direct lineal
ancestor

thou judgest tom he said when his mirth was a little abated
by what thou thinkest is the cost of the actual stock before thine
eyes when thou shouldst take into the account that which i term our
floating capital

tom pondered a moment for while he knew that his master had money
in the funds he did not account that as any portion of the
available means connected with his ordinary business and as for a
floating capital he did not well see how it could be of much
account since the disproportion between the cost and the selling
prices of the different articles in which they dealt was so great
that there was no particular use in such an investment as his
master however rarely paid for anything until he was in possession
of returns from it that exceeded the debt some seven-fold he began
to think the old man was alluding to the advantages he obtained in
the way of credit and after a little more cogitation he ventured
to say as much

again my maternal grandfather indulged in a hearty fit of laughter

thou art clever in thy way tom he said and i like the
minuteness of thy calculations for they show an aptitude for trade
but there is genius in our calling as well as cleverness come
hither boy he added drawing tom to a window whence they could
see the neighbors on their way to church for it was on a sunday
that my two provident progenitors indulged in this moral view of
humanity as best fitted the day come hither boy and thou shalt
see some small portion of that capital which thou seemest to think
hid stalking abroad by daylight and in the open streets here
thou seest the wife of our neighbor the pastry-cook with what an
air she tosses her head and displays the bauble thou sold'st her
yesterday well even that slattern idle and vain and little
worthy of trust as she is carries about with her a portion of my
capital

my worthy ancestor stared for he never knew the other to be guilty
of so great an indiscretion as to trust a woman whom they both knew
bought more than her husband was willing to pay for

she gave me a guinea master for that which did not cost a seven-
shilling piece

she did indeed tom and it was her vanity that urged her to it i
trade upon her folly younker and upon that of all mankind now
dost thou see with what a capital i carry on affairs there there
is the maid carrying the idle hussy's patterns in the rear i drew
upon my stock in that wench's possession no later than the last
week for half-a-crown

tom reflected a long time on these allusions of his provident
master and although he understood them about as well as they will
be understood by the owners of half the soft humid eyes and
sprouting whiskers among my readers by dint of cogitation he came
at last to a practical understanding of the subject which before he
was thirty he had to use a french term pretty well exploite

i learn by unquestionable tradition received also from the mouths
of his contemporaries that the opinions of my ancestor underwent
some material changes between the ages of ten and forty a
circumstance that has often led me to reflect that people might do
well not to be too confident of the principles during the pliable
period of life when the mind like the tender shoot is easily bent
aside and subjected to the action of surrounding causes

during the earlier years of the plastic age my ancestor was
observed to betray strong feelings of compassion at the sight of
charity-children nor was he ever known to pass a child especially
a boy that was still in petticoats who was crying with hunger in
the streets without sharing his own crust with him indeed his
practice on this head was said to be steady and uniform whenever
the rencontre took place after my worthy father had had his own
sympathies quickened by a good dinner a fact that maybe imputed to
a keener sense of the pleasure he was about to confer

after sixteen he was known to converse occasionally on the subject
of politics a topic on which he came to be both expert and eloquent
before twenty his usual theme was justice and the sacred rights of
man concerning which he sometimes uttered very pretty sentiments
and such as were altogether becoming in one who was at the bottom of
the great social pot that was then as now actively boiling and
where he was made to feel most the heat that kept it in
ebullition i am assured that on the subject of taxation and on
that of the wrongs of america and ireland there were few youths in
the parish who could discourse with more zeal and unction about
this time too he was heard shouting wilkes and liberty in the
public streets

but as is the case with all men of rare capacities there was a
concentration of powers in the mind of my ancestor which soon
brought all his errant sympathies the mere exuberance of acute and
overflowing feelings into a proper and useful subjection centring
all in the one absorbing and capacious receptacle of self i do not
claim for my father any peculiar quality in this respect for i have
often observed that many of those who like giddy-headed horsemen
that raise a great dust and scamper as if the highway were too
narrow for their eccentric courses before they are fairly seated in
the saddle but who afterward drive as directly at their goals as
the arrow parting from the bow most indulge their sympathies at
the commencement of their careers are the most apt toward the close
to get a proper command of their feelings and to reduce them within
the bounds of common sense and prudence before five-and-twenty my
father was as exemplary and as constant a devotee of plutus as was
then to be found between ratcliffe highway and bridge street i
name these places in particular as all the rest of the great
capital in which he was born is known to be more indifferent to the
subject of money

my ancestor was just thirty when his master who like himself was a
bachelor very unexpectedly and a good deal to the scandal of the
neighborhood introduced a new inmate into his frugal abode in the
person of an infant female child it would seem that some one had
been speculating on his stock of weakness too for this poor
little defenceless and dependent being was thrown upon his care
like tom himself through the vigilance of the parish officers
there were many good-natured jokes practised on the prosperous
fancy-dealer by the more witty of his neighbors at this sudden
turn of good fortune and not a few ill-natured sneers were given
behind his back most of the knowing ones of the vicinity finding a
stronger likeness between the little girl and all the other
unmarried men of the eight or ten adjoining streets than to the
worthy housekeeper who had been selected to pay for her support i
have been much disposed to admit the opinions of these amiable
observers as authority in my own pedigree since it would be
reaching the obscurity in which all ancient lines take root a
generation earlier than by allowing the presumption that little
betsey was my direct male ancestor's master's daughter but on
reflection i have determined to adhere to the less popular but more
simple version of the affair because it is connected with the
transmission of no small part of our estate a circumstance of
itself that at once gives dignity and importance to a genealogy

whatever may have been the real opinion of the reputed father
touching his rights to the honors of that respectable title he soon
became as strongly attached to the child as if it really owed its
existence to himself the little girl was carefully nursed
abundantly fed and throve accordingly she had reached her third
year when the fancy-dealer took the smallpox from his little pet
who was just recovering from the same disease and died at the
expiration of the tenth day

this was an unlooked-for and stunning blow to my ancestor who was
then in his thirty-fifth year and the head shopman of the
establishment which had continued to grow with the growing follies
and vanities of the age on examining his master's will it was
found that my father who had certainly aided materially of late in
the acquisition of the money was left the good-will of the shop
the command of all the stock at cost and the sole executorship of
the estate he was also intrusted with the exclusive guardianship of
little betsey to whom his master had affectionately devised every
farthing of his property an ordinary reader may be surprised that a
man who had so long practised on the foibles of his species should
have so much confidence in a mere shopman as to leave his whole
estate so completely in his power but it must be remembered that
human ingenuity has not yet devised any means by which we can carry
our personal effects into the other world that what cannot be
cured must be endured that he must of necessity have confided this
important trust to some fellow-creature and that it was better to
commit the keeping of his money to one who knowing the secret by
which it had been accumulated had less inducement to be dishonest
than one who was exposed to the temptation of covetousness without
having a knowledge of any direct and legal means of gratifying his
longings it has been conjectured therefore that the testator
thought by giving up his trade to a man who was as keenly alive as
my ancestor to all its perfections moral and pecuniary he provided
a sufficient protection against his falling into the sin of
peculation by so amply supplying him with simpler means of
enriching himself besides it is fair to presume that the long
acquaintance had begotten sufficient confidence to weaken the effect
of that saying which some wit has put into the mouth of a wag make
me your executor father i care not to whom you leave the estate
let all this be as it might nothing can be more certain than that
my worthy ancestor executed his trust with the scrupulous fidelity
of a man whose integrity had been severely schooled in the ethics of
trade little betsey was properly educated for one in her condition
of life her health was as carefully watched over as if she had been
the only daughter of the sovereign instead of the only daughter of a
fancy-dealer her morals were superintended by a superannuated old
maid her mind left to its original purity her person jealously
protected against the designs of greedy fortune-hunters and to
complete the catalogue of his paternal attentions and solicitudes
my vigilant and faithful ancestor to prevent accidents and to
counteract the chances of life so far as it might be done by human
foresight saw that she was legally married the day she reached her
nineteenth year to the person whom there is every reason to think
he believed to be the most unexceptionable man of his acquaintance 
in other words to himself settlements were unnecessary between
parties who had so long been known to each other and thanks to the
liberality of his late master's will in more ways than one a long
minority and the industry of the ci-devant head shopman the
nuptial benediction was no sooner pronounced than our family
stepped into the undisputed possession of four hundred thousand
pounds one less scrupulous on the subject of religion and the law
might not have thought it necessary to give the orphan heiress a
settlement so satisfactory at the termination of her wardship

i was the fifth of the children who were the fruits of this union
and the only one of them all that passed the first year of its life
my poor mother did not survive my birth and i can only record her
qualities through the medium of that great agent in the archives of
the family tradition by all that i have heard she must have been
a meek quiet domestic woman who by temperament and attainments
was admirably qualified to second the prudent plans of my father for
her welfare if she had causes of complaint and that she had
there is too much reason to think for who has ever escaped them
they were concealed with female fidelity in the sacred repository
of her own heart and if truant imagination sometimes dimly drew an
outline of married happiness different from the fact that stood in
dull reality before her eyes the picture was merely commented on by
a sigh and consigned to a cabinet whose key none ever touched but
herself and she seldom

of this subdued and unobtrusive sorrow for i fear it sometimes
reached that intensity of feeling my excellent and indefatigable
ancestor appeared to have no suspicion he pursued his ordinary
occupations with his ordinary single-minded devotion and the last
thing that would have crossed his brain was the suspicion that he
had not punctiliously done his duty by his ward had he acted
otherwise none surely would have suffered more by his delinquency
than her husband and none would have a better right to complain
now as her husband never dreamt of making such an accusation it is
not at all surprising that my ancestor remained in ignorance of his
wife's feelings at the hour of his death

it has been said that the opinions of the successor of the fancy-
dealer underwent some essential changes between the ages of ten and
forty after he had reached his twenty-second year or in other
words the moment he began to earn money for himself as well as for
his master he ceased to cry wilkes and liberty he was not heard
to breathe a syllable concerning the obligations of society toward
the weak and unfortunate for the five years that succeeded his
majority he touched lightly on christian duties in general after
he got to be worth fifty pounds of his own and as for railing at
human follies it would have been rank ingratitude in one who so
very unequivocally got his bread by them about this time his
remarks on the subject of taxation however were singularly
caustic and well applied he railed at the public debt as a public
curse and ominously predicted the dissolution of society in
consequence of the burdens and incumbrances it was hourly
accumulating on the already overloaded shoulders of the trader

the period of his marriage and his succession to the hoardings of
his former master may be dated as the second epocha in the opinions
of my ancestor from this moment his ambition expanded his views
enlarged in proportion to his means and his contemplations on the
subject of his great floating capital became more profound and
philosophical a man of my ancestor's native sagacity whose whole
soul was absorbed in the pursuit of gain who had so long been
forming his mind by dealing as it were with the elements of human
weaknesses and who already possessed four hundred thousand pounds
was very likely to strike out for himself some higher road to
eminence than that in which he had been laboriously journeying
during the years of painful probation the property of my mother had
been chiefly invested in good bonds and mortgages her protector
patron benefactor and legalized father having an unconquerable
repugnance to confiding in that soulless conventional nondescript
body corporate the public the first indication that was given by
my ancestor of a change of purpose in the direction of his energies
was by calling in the whole of his outstanding debts and adopting
the napoleon plan of operations by concentrating his forces on a
particular point in order that he might operate in masses about
this time too he suddenly ceased railing at taxation this change
may be likened to that which occurs in the language of the
ministerial journals when they cease abusing any foreign state with
whom the nation has been carrying on a war that it is at length
believed politic to terminate and for much the same reason as it
was the intention of my thrifty ancestor to make an ally of a power
that he had hitherto always treated as an enemy the whole of the
four hundred thousand pounds were liberally intrusted to the
country the former fancy-dealer's apprentice entering the arena of
virtuous and patriotic speculation as a bull and if with more
caution with at least some portion of the energy and obstinacy of
the desperate animal that gives title to this class of adventurers
success crowned his laudable efforts gold rolled in upon him like
water on a flood buoying him up soul and body to that enviable
height where as it would seem just views can alone be taken of
society in its innumerable phases all his former views of life
which in common with others of a similar origin and similar
political sentiments he had imbibed in early years and which might
with propriety be called near views were now completely obscured by
the sublimer and broader prospect that was spread before him

i am afraid the truth will compel me to admit that my ancestor was
never charitable in the vulgar acceptation of the term but then he
always maintained that his interest in his fellow-creatures was of a
more elevated cast taking a comprehensive glance at all the
bearings of good and evil being of the sort of love which induces
the parent to correct the child that the lesson of present
suffering may produce the blessings of future respectability and
usefulness acting on these principles he gradually grew more
estranged from his species in appearance a sacrifice that was
probably exacted by the severity of his practical reproofs for their
growing wickedness and the austere policy that was necessary to
enforce them by this time my ancestor was also thoroughly
impressed with what is called the value of money a sentiment which
i believe gives its possessor a livelier perception than common of
the dangers of the precious metals as well as of their privileges
and uses he expatiated occasionally on the guaranties that it was
necessary to give to society for its own security never even voted
for a parish officer unless he were a warm substantial citizen and
began to be a subscriber to the patriotic fund and to the other
similar little moral and pecuniary buttresses of the government
whose common and commendable object was to protect our country our
altars and our firesides

the death-bed of my mother has been described to me as a touching
and melancholy scene it appears that as this meek and retired woman
was extricated from the coil of mortality her intellect grew
brighter her powers of discernment stronger and her character in
every respect more elevated and commanding although she had said
much less about our firesides and altars than her husband i see no
reason to doubt that she had ever been quite as faithful as he could
be to the one and as much devoted to the other i shall describe
the important event of her passage from this to a better world as i
have often had it repeated from the lips of one who was present and
who has had an important agency in since making me the man i am
this person was the clergyman of the parish a pious divine a
learned man and a gentleman in feeling as well as by extraction

my mother though long conscious that she was drawing near to her
last great account had steadily refused to draw her husband from
his absorbing pursuits by permitting him to be made acquainted with
her situation he knew that she was ill very ill as he had reason
to think but as he not only allowed her but even volunteered to
order her all the advice and relief that money could command my
ancestor was not a miser in the vulgar meaning of the word he
thought that he had done all that man could do in a case of life
and death interests over which he professed to have no control he
saw dr etherington the rector come and go daily for a month
without uneasiness or apprehension for he thought his discourse had
a tendency to tranquillize my mother and he had a strong affection
for all that left him undisturbed to the enjoyment of the
occupation in which his whole energies were now completely centred
the physician got his guinea at each visit with scrupulous
punctuality the nurses were well received and were well satisfied
for no one interfered with their acts but the doctor and every
ordinary duty of commission was as regularly discharged by my
ancestor as if the sinking and resigned creature from whom he was
about to be forever separated had been the spontaneous choice of his
young and fresh affections

when therefore a servant entered to say that dr etherington
desired a private interview my worthy ancestor who had no
consciousness of having neglected any obligation that became a
friend of church and state was in no small measure surprised

i come mr goldencalf on a melancholy duty said the pious
rector entering the private cabinet to which his application had
for the first time obtained his admission the fatal secret can no
longer be concealed from you and your wife at length consents that
i shall be the instrument of revealing it

the doctor paused for on such occasions it is perhaps as well to
let the party that is about to be shocked receive a little of the
blow through his own imagination and busily enough was that of my
poor father said to be exercised on this painful occasion he grew
pale opened his eyes until they again filled the sockets into which
they had gradually been sinking for twenty years and looked a
hundred questions that his tongue refused to put

it cannot be doctor he at length querulously said that a woman
like betsey has got an inkling into any of the events connected with
the last great secret expedition and which have escaped my jealousy
and experience

i am afraid dear sir that mrs goldencalf has obtained glimpses
of the last great and secret expedition on which we must all sooner
or later embark that have entirely escaped your vigilance but of
this i will speak some other time at present it is my painful duty
to inform you it is the opinion of the physician that your excellent
wife cannot outlive the day if indeed she do the hour

my father was struck with this intelligence and for more than a
minute he remained silent and without motion casting his eyes
toward the papers on which he had lately been employed and which
contained some very important calculations connected with the next
settling day he at length resumed

if this be really so doctor it may be well for me to go to her
since one in the situation of the poor woman may indeed have
something of importance to communicate

it is with this object that i have now come to tell you the truth
quietly answered the divine who knew that nothing was to be gained
by contending with the besetting weakness of such a man at such a
moment

my father bent his head in assent and first carefully enclosing
the open papers in a secretary he followed his companion to the
bedside of his dying wife




chapter ii

touching myself and ten thousand pounds


although my ancestor was much too wise to refuse to look back upon
his origin in a worldly point of view he never threw his
retrospective glances so far as to reach the sublime mystery of his
moral existence and while his thoughts might be said to be ever on
the stretch to attain glimpses into the future they were by far too
earthly to extend beyond any other settling day than those which
were regulated by the ordinances of the stock exchange with him to
be born was but the commencement of a speculation and to die was to
determine the general balance of profit and loss a man who had so
rarely meditated on the grave changes of mortality therefore was
consequently so much the less prepared to gaze upon the visible
solemnities of a death-bed although he had never truly loved my
mother for love was a sentiment much too pure and elevated for one
whose imagination dwelt habitually on the beauties of the stock-
books he had ever been kind to her and of late he was even much
disposed as has already been stated to contribute as much to her
temporal comforts as comported with his pursuits and habits on the
other hand the quiet temperament of my mother required some more
exciting cause than the affections of her husband to quicken those
germs of deep placid womanly love that certainly lay dormant in
her heart like seed withering with the ungenial cold of winter the
last meeting of such a pair was not likely to be attended with any
violent outpourings of grief

my ancestor notwithstanding was deeply struck with the physical
changes in the appearance of his wife

thou art much emaciated betsey he said taking her hand kindly
after a long and solemn pause much more so than i had thought or
could have believed dost nurse give thee comforting soups and
generous nourishment

my mother smiled the ghastly smile of death but waved her hand
with loathing at his suggestion

all this is now too late mr goldencalf she answered speaking
with a distinctness and an energy for which she had long been
reserving her strength food and raiment are no longer among my
wants

well well betsey one that is in want of neither food nor
raiment cannot be said to be in great suffering after all and i
am glad that thou art so much at ease dr etherington tells me thou
art far from being well bodily however and i am come expressly to
see if i can order anything that will help to make thee more easy

mr goldencalf you can my wants for this life are nearly over a
short hour or two will remove me beyond the world its cares its
vanities its  my poor mother probably meant to add its
heartlessness or its selfishness but she rebuked herself and
paused by the mercy of our blessed redeemer and through the
benevolent agency of this excellent man she resumed glancing her
eye upwards at first with holy reverence and then at the divine
with meek gratitude i quit you without alarm and were it not for
one thing i might say without care

and what is there to distress thee in particular betsey asked
my father blowing his nose and speaking with unusual tenderness
if it be in my power to set thy heart at ease on this or on any
other point name it and i will give orders to have it immediately
performed thou hast been a good pious woman and canst have little
to reproach thyself with

my mother looked earnestly and wistfully at her husband never
before had he betrayed so strong an interest in her happiness and
had it not alas been too late this glimmering of kindness might
have lighted the matrimonial torch into a brighter flame than had
ever yet glowed upon the past

mr goldencalf we have an only son 

we have betsey and it may gladden thee to hear that the physician
thinks the boy more likely to live than either of his poor brothers
and sisters

i cannot explain the holy and mysterious principle of maternal
nature that caused my mother to clasp her hands to raise her eyes
to heaven and while a gleam flitted athwart her glassy eyes and
wan cheeks to murmur her thanks to god for the boon she was
herself hastening away to the eternal bliss of the pure of mind and
the redeemed and her imagination quiet and simple as it was had
drawn pictures in which she and her departed babes were standing
before the throne of the most high chanting his glory and shining
amid the stars and yet was she now rejoicing that the last and the
most cherished of all her offsprings was likely to be left exposed
to the evils the vices nay to the enormities of the state of
being that she herself so willingly resigned

it is of our boy that i wish now to speak mr goldencalf replied
my mother when her secret devotion was ended the child will have
need of instruction and care in short of both mother and father

betsey thou forgettest that he will still have the latter

you are much wrapped up in your business mr goldencalf and are
not in other respects qualified to educate a boy born to the curse
and to the temptations of immense riches

my excellent ancestor looked as if he thought his dying consort had
in sooth finally taken leave of her senses

there are public schools betsey i promise thee the child shall
not be forgotten i will have him well taught though it cost me a
thousand a year

his wife reached forth her emaciated hand to that of my father and
pressed the latter with as much force as a dying mother could use
for a fleet moment she even appeared to have gotten rid of her
latest care but the knowledge of character that had been acquired
by the hard experience of thirty years was not to be unsettled by
the gratitude of a moment

i wish mr goldencalf she anxiously resumed to receive your
solemn promise to commit the education of our boy to dr
etherington you know his worth and must have full confidence in
such a man

nothing would give me greater satisfaction my dear betsey and if
dr etherington will consent to receive him i will send jack to his
house this very evening for to own the truth i am but little
qualified to take charge of a child under a year old a hundred a
year more or less shall not spoil so good a bargain

the divine was a gentleman and he looked grave at this speech
though meeting the anxious eyes of my mother his own lost their
displeasure in a glance of reassurance and pity

the charges of his education will be easily settled mr
goldencalf added my mother but the doctor has consented with
difficulty to take the responsibility of my poor babe and that only
under two conditions

the stock-dealer required an explanation with his eyes

one is that the child shall be left solely to his own care after
he has reached his fourth year and the other is that you make an
endowment for the support of two poor scholars at one of the
principal schools

as my mother got out the last words she fell back on her pillow
whence her interest in the subject had enabled her to lift her head
a little and she fairly gasped for breath in the intensity of her
anxiety to hear the answer my ancestor contracted his brow like
one who saw it was a subject that required reflection

thou dost not know perhaps betsey that these endowments swallow
up a great deal of money a great deal and often very uselessly

ten thousand pounds is the sum that has been agreed upon between
mrs goldencalf and me steadily remarked the doctor who in my
soul i believe had hoped that his condition would be rejected
having yielded to the importunities of a dying woman rather than to
his own sense of that which might be either very desirable or very
useful

ten thousand pounds

my mother could not speak though she succeeded in making an
imploring sign of assent

ten thousand pounds is a great deal of money my dear betsey a
very great deal

the color of my mother changed to the hue of death and by her
breathing she appeared to be in the agony

well well betsey said my father a little hastily for he was
frightened at her pallid countenance and extreme distress have it
thine own way the money yes yes it shall be given as thou
wishest now set thy kind heart at rest

the revulsion of feeling was too great for one whose system had been
wound up to a state of excitement like that which had sustained my
mother who an hour before had seemed scarcely able to speak she
extended her hand toward her husband smiled benignantly in his
face whispered the word thanks and then losing all her powers
of body sank into the last sleep as tranquilly as the infant drops
its head on the bosom of the nurse this was after all a sudden
and in one sense an unexpected death all who witnessed it were
struck with awe my father gazed for a whole minute intently on the
placid features of his wife and left the room in silence he was
followed by dr etherington who accompanied him to the private
apartment where they had first met that night neither uttering a
syllable until both were seated

she was a good woman dr etherington said the widowed man
shaking his foot with agitation

she was a good woman mr goldencalf

and a good wife dr etherington

i have always believed her to be a good wife sir

faithful obedient and frugal

three qualities that are of much practical use in the affairs of
this world

i shall never marry again sir

the divine bowed

nay i never could find such another match

again the divine inclined his head though the assent was
accompanied by slight smile

well she has left me an heir

and brought something that he might inherit observed the doctor
dryly

my ancestor looked up inquiringly at his companion but apparently
most of the sarcasm was thrown away

i resign the child to your care dr etherington conformably to
the dying request of my beloved betsey

i accept the charge mr goldencalf comformably to my promise to
the deceased but you will remember that there was a condition
coupled with that promise which must be faithfully and promptly
fulfilled

my ancestor was too much accustomed to respect the punctilios of
trade whose code admits of frauds only in certain categories which
are sufficiently explained in its conventional rules of honor a
sort of specified morality that is bottomed more on the convenience
of its votaries than on the general law of right he respected the
letter of his promise while his soul yearned to avoid its spirit
and his wits were already actively seeking the means of doing that
which he so much desired

i did make a promise to poor betsey certainly he answered in
the way of one who pondered and it was a promise too made under
very solemn circumstances

the promises made to the dead are doubly binding since by their
departure to the world of spirits it may be said they leave the
performance to the exclusive superintendence of the being who cannot
lie

my ancestor quailed his whole frame shuddered and his purpose was
shaken

poor betsey left you as her representative in this case however
doctor he observed after the delay of more than a minute casting
his eyes wistfully towards the divine

in one sense she certainly did sir

and a representative with full powers is legally a principal under
a different name i think this matter might be arranged to our
mutual satisfaction dr etherington and the intention of poor
betsey most completely executed she poor woman knew little of
business as was best for her sex and when women undertake affairs
of magnitude they are very apt to make awkward work of it

so that the intention of the deceased be completely fulfilled you
will not find me exacting mr goldencalf

i thought as much i knew there could be no difficulty between two
men of sense who were met with honest views to settle a matter of
this nature the intention of poor betsey doctor was to place her
child under your care with the expectation and i do not deny its
justice that the boy would receive more benefit from your knowledge
than he possibly could from mine

dr etherington was too honest to deny these premises and too
polite to admit them without an inclination of acknowledgment

as we are quite of the same mind good sir concerning the
preliminaries continued my ancestor we will enter a little
nearer into the details it appears to me to be no more than strict
justice that he who does the work should receive the reward this
is a principle in which i have been educated dr etherington it is
one in which i could wish to have my son educated and it is one on
which i hope always to practise

another inclination of the body conveyed the silent assent of the
divine

now poor betsey heaven bless her for she was a meek and
tranquil companion and richly deserves to be rewarded in a future
state but poor betsey had little knowledge of business she
fancied that in bestowing these ten thousand pounds on a charity
she was acting well whereas she was in fact committing injustice
if you are to have the trouble and care of bringing up little jack
who but you should reap the reward

i shall expect mr goldencalf that you will furnish the means to
provide for the child's wants

of that sir it is unnecessary to speak interrupted my ancestor
both promptly and proudly i am a wary man and a prudent man and
am one who knows the value of money i trust but i am no miser to
stint my own flesh and blood jack shall never want for anything
while it is in my power to give it i am by no means as rich sir
as the neighborhood supposes but then i am no beggar i dare say
if all my assets were fairly counted it might be found that i am
worth a plum

you are said to have received a much larger sum than that with the
late mrs goldencalf the divine observed not without reproof in
his voice

ah dear sir i need not tell you what vulgar rumor is but i shall
not undermine my own credit and we will change the subject my
object dr etherington was merely to do justice poor betsey
desired that ten thousand pounds might be given to found a
scholarship or two now what have these scholars done or what are
they likely to do for me or mine the case is different with you
sir you will have trouble much trouble i make no doubt and it is
proper that you should have a sufficient compensation i was about
to propose therefore that you should consent to receive my check
for three or four or even for five thousand pounds continued my
ancestor raising the offer as he saw the frown on the brow of the
doctor deepen yes sir i will even say the latter sum which
possibly will not be too much for your trouble and care and we will
forget the womanish plan of poor betsey in relation to the two
scholarships and the charity five thousand pounds down doctor for
yourself and the subject of the charity forgotten forever

when my father had thus distinctly put his proposition he awaited
its effect with the confidence of a man who had long dealt with
cupidity for a novelty his calculation failed the face of dr
etherington flushed then paled and finally settled into a look of
melancholy reprehension he arose and paced the room for several
minutes in silence during which time his companion believed he was
debating with himself on the chances of obtaining a higher bid for
his consent when he suddenly stopped and addressed my ancestor in a
mild but steady tone

i feel it to be a duty mr goldencalf he said to admonish you
of the precipice over which you hang the love of money which is
the root of all evil which caused judas to betray even his saviour
and god has taken deep root in your soul you are no longer young
and although still proud in your strength and prosperity are much
nearer to your great account than you may be willing to believe it
is not an hour since you witnessed the departure of a penitent soul
for the presence of her god since you heard the dying request from
her lips and since in such a presence and in such a scene you
gave a pledge to respect her wishes and now with the accursed
spirit of gain upper-most you would trifle with these most sacred
obligations in order to keep a little worthless gold in a hand that
is already full to overflowing fancy that the pure spirit of thy
confiding and single-minded wife were present at this conversation
fancy it mourning over thy weakness and violated faith nay i know
not that such is not the fact for there is no reason to believe
that the happy spirits are not permitted to watch near and mourn
over us until we are released from this mass of sin and depravity
in which we dwell and then reflect what must be her sorrow at
hearing how soon her parting request is forgotten how useless has
been the example of her holy end how rooted and fearful are thine
own infirmities

my father was more rebuked by the manner than by the words of the
divine he passed his hand across his brow as if to shut out the
view of his wife's spirit turned drew his writing materials
nearer wrote a check for the ten thousand pounds and handed it to
the doctor with the subdued air of a corrected boy

jack shall be at your disposal good sir he said as the paper
was delivered whenever it may be your pleasure to send for him

they parted in silence the divine too much displeased and my
ancestor too much grieved to indulge in words of ceremony

when my father found himself alone he gazed furtively about the
room to assure himself that the rebuking spirit of his wife had not
taken a shape less questionable than air and then he mused for at
least an hour very painfully on all the principal occurrences of
the night it is said that occupation is a certain solace for grief
and so it proved to be in the present case for luckily my father
had made up that very day his private account of the sum total of
his fortune sitting down therefore to the agreeable task he went
through the simple process of subtracting from it the amount for
which he had just drawn and finding that he was still master of
seven hundred and eighty-two thousand three hundred and eleven
pounds odd shillings and even pence he found a very natural
consolation for the magnitude of the sum he had just given away by
comparing it with the magnitude of that which was left




chapter iii

opinions of our author's ancestor together with some of his own
and some of other people's


dr etherington was both a pious man and a gentleman the second son
of a baronet of ancient lineage he had been educated in most of the
opinions of his caste and possibly he was not entirely above its
prejudices but this much admitted few divines were more willing
to defer to the ethics and principles of the bible than himself his
humility had of course a decent regard to station his charity was
judiciously regulated by the articles of faith and his philanthropy
was of the discriminating character that became a warm supporter of
church and state

in accepting the trust which he was now obliged to assume he had
yielded purely to a benevolent wish to smooth the dying pillow of my
mother acquainted with the character of her husband he had
committed a sort of pious fraud in attaching the condition of the
endowment to his consent for notwithstanding the becoming language
of his own rebuke the promise and all the other little attendant
circumstances of the night it might be questioned which felt the
most surprise after the draft was presented and duly honored he who
found himself in possession or he who found himself deprived of
the sum of ten thousand pounds sterling still dr etherington acted
with the most scrupulous integrity in the whole affair and although
i am aware that a writer who has so many wonders to relate as must
of necessity adorn the succeeding pages of this manuscript should
observe a guarded discretion in drawing on the credulity of his
readers truth compels me to add that every farthing of the money
was duly invested with a single eye to the wishes of the dying
christian who under providence had been the means of bestowing so
much gold on the poor and unlettered as to the manner in which the
charity was finally improved i shall say nothing since no inquiry
on my part has ever enabled me to obtain such information as would
justify my speaking with authority

as for myself i shall have little more to add touching the events
of the succeeding twenty years i was baptized nursed breeched
schooled horsed confirmed sent to the university and graduated
much as befalls all gentlemen of the established church in the
united kingdoms of great britain and ireland or in other words of
the land of my ancestor during these pregnant years dr
etherington acquitted himself of a duty that judging by a very
predominant feeling of human nature which singularly enough
renders us uniformly averse to being troubled with other people's
affairs i think he must have found sufficiently vexatious quite
as well as my good mother had any right to expect most of my
vacations were spent at his rectory for he had first married then
become a father next a widower and had exchanged his town living
for one in the country between the periods of my mother's death and
that on my going to eton and after i quitted oxford much more of
my time was passed beneath his friendly roof than beneath that of my
own parent indeed i saw little of the latter he paid my bills
furnished me with pocket-money and professed an intention to let me
travel after i should reach my majority but satisfied with these
proofs of paternal care he appeared willing to let me pursue my own
course very much in my own way

my ancestor was an eloquent example of the truth of that political
dogma which teaches the efficacy of the division of labor no
manufacturer of the head of a pin ever attained greater dexterity in
his single-minded vocation than was reached by my father in the one
pursuit to which he devoted as far as human ken could reach both
soul and body as any sense is known to increase in acuteness by
constant exercise or any passion by indulgence so did his ardor in
favor of the great object of his affections grow with its growth
and become more manifest as an ordinary observer would be apt to
think the motive of its existence at all had nearly ceased this is
a moral phenomenon that i have often had occasion to observe and
which there is some reason to think depends on a principle of
attraction that has hitherto escaped the sagacity of the
philosophers but which is as active in the immaterial as is that
of gravitation in the material world talents like his so
incessantly and unweariedly employed produced the usual fruits he
grew richer hourly and at the time of which i speak he was pretty
generally known to the initiated to be the warmest man who had
anything to do with the stock exchange

i do not think that the opinions of my ancestor underwent as many
material changes between the ages of fifty and seventy as they had
undergone between the ages of ten and forty during the latter
period the tree of life usually gets deep root its inclination is
fixed whether obtained by bending to the storms or by drawing
toward the light and it probably yields more in fruits of its own
than it gains by tillage and manuring still my ancestor was not
exactly the same man the day he kept his seventieth birthday as he
had been the day he kept his fiftieth in the first place he was
worth thrice the money at the former period that he had been worth
at the latter of course his moral system had undergone all the
mutations that are known to be dependent on a change of this
important character beyond a question during the last five-and-
twenty years of the life of my ancestor his political bias too
was in favor of exclusive privileges and exclusive benefits i do
not mean that he was an aristocrat in the vulgar acceptation to
him feudality was a blank he had probably never heard the word
portcullises rose and fell flanking towers lifted their heads and
embattled walls swept around their fabrics in vain so far as his
imagination was concerned he cared not for the days of courts leet
and courts baron nor for the barons themselves nor for the honors
of a pedigree why should he no prince in the land could more
clearly trace his family into obscurity than himself nor for the
vanities of a court nor for those of society nor for aught else of
the same nature that is apt to have charms for the weak-minded the
imaginative or the conceited his political prepossessions showed
themselves in a very different manner throughout the whole of the
five lustres i have named he was never heard to whisper a censure
against government let its measures or the character of its
administration be what it would it was enough for him that it was
government even taxation no longer excited his ire nor aroused his
eloquence he conceived it to be necessary to order and especially
to the protection of property a branch of political science that he
had so studied as to succeed in protecting his own estate in a
measure against even this great ally itself after he became worth
a million it was observed that all his opinions grew less favorable
to mankind in general and that he was much disposed to exaggerate
the amount and quality of the few boons which providence has
bestowed on the poor the report of a meeting of the whigs generally
had an effect on his appetite a resolution that was suspected of
emanating from brookes's commonly robbed him of a dinner and the
radicals never seriously moved that he did not spend a sleepless
night and pass a large portion of the next day in uttering words
that it would be hardly moral to repeat i may without impropriety
add however that on such occasions he did not spare allusions to
the gallows sir francis burdett in particular was a target for a
good deal of billingsgate and men as upright and as respectable
even as my lords grey landsdowne and holland were treated as if
they were no better than they should be but on these little details
it is unnecessary to dwell for it must be a subject of common
remark that the more elevated and refined men become in their
political ethics the more they are accustomed to throw dirt upon
their neighbors i will just state however that most of what i
have here related has been transmitted to me by direct oral
traditions for i seldom saw my ancestor and when we did meet it
was only to settle accounts to eat a leg of mutton together and to
part like those who at least have never quarrelled

not so with dr etherington habit to say nothing of my own merits
had attached him to one who owed so much to his care and his doors
were always as open to me as if i had been his own son

it has been said that most of my idle time omitting the part
misspent in the schools was passed at the rectory

the excellent divine had married a lovely woman a year or two after
the death of my mother who had left him a widower and the father
of a little image of herself before the expiration of a
twelvemonth owing to the strength of his affections for the
deceased or for his daughter or because he could not please
himself in a second marriage as well as it had been his good fortune
to do in the first dr etherington had never spoken of forming
another connection he appeared content to discharge his duties as
a christian and a gentleman without increasing them by creating any
new relations with society

anna etherington was of course my constant companion during many
long and delightful visits at the rectory three years my junior
the friendship on my part had commenced by a hundred acts of boyish
kindness between the ages of seven and twelve i dragged her about
in a garden-chair pushed her on the swing and wiped her eyes and
uttered words of friendly consolation when any transient cloud
obscured the sunny brightness of her childhood from twelve to
fourteen i told her stories astonished her with narratives of my
own exploits at eton and caused her serene blue eyes to open in
admiration at the marvels of london at fourteen i began to pick up
her pocket-handkerchief hunt for her thimble accompany her in
duets and to read poetry to her as she occupied herself with the
little lady-like employments of the needle about the age of
seventeen i began to compare cousin anna as i was permitted to call
her with the other young girls of my acquaintance and the
comparison was generally much in her favor it was also about this
time that as my admiration grew more warm and manifest she became
less confiding and less frank i perceived too that for a novelty
she now had some secrets that she did not choose to communicate to
me that she was more with her governess and less in my society
than formerly and on one occasion bitterly did i feel the slight
she actually recounted to her father the amusing incidents of a
little birthday fete at which she had been present and which was
given by a gentleman of the vicinity before she even dropped a hint
to me touching the delight she had experienced on the occasion i
was however a good deal compensated for the slight by her saying
kindly as she ended her playful and humorous account of the affair

it would have made you laugh heartily jack to see the droll
manner in which the servants acted their parts there had been a
sort of mystified masque more particularly the fat old butler of
whom they had made a cupid as dick griffin said in order to show
that love becomes drowsy and dull by good eating and drinking i do
wish you could have been there jack

anna was a gentle feminine girl with a most lovely and winning
countenance and i did inherently like to hear her pronounce the
word jack it was so different from the boisterous screech of the
eton boys or the swaggering call of my boon companions at oxford

i should have liked it excessively myself anna i answered more
particularly as you seem to have so much enjoyed the fun

yes but that could not be interrupted miss-mrs norton the
governess for sir harry griffin is very difficult about his
associates and you know my dear that mr goldencalf though a
very respectable young man himself could not expect one of the
oldest baronets of the county to go out of his way to invite the son
of a stock-jobber to be present at a fete given to his own heir

luckily for miss-mrs norton dr etherington had walked away the
moment his daughter ended her recital or she might have met with a
disagreeable commentary on her notions concerning the fitness of
associations anna herself looked earnestly at her governess and i
saw a flush mantle over her sweet face that reminded me of the
ruddiness of morn her soft eyes then fell to the floor and it was
some time before she spoke

the next day i was arranging some fishing-tackle under a window of
the library where my person was concealed by the shrubbery when i
heard the melodious voice of anna wishing the rector good morning
my heart beat quicker as she approached the casement tenderly
inquiring of her parent how he had passed the night the answers
were as affectionate as the questions and then there was a little
pause

what is a stock-jobber father suddenly resumed anna whom i
heard rustling the leaves above my head

a stock-jobber my dear is one who buys and sells in the public
funds with a view to profit

and is it thought a particularly disgraceful employment

why that depends on circumstances on change it seems to be well
enough among merchants and bankers there is some odium attached to
it i believe

and can you say why father

i believe said dr etherington laughing for no other reason
than that it is an uncertain calling one that is liable to sudden
reverses what is termed gambling and whatever renders property
insecure is sure to obtain odium among those whose principal concern
is its accumulation those who consider the responsibility of others
of essential importance to themselves

but is it a dishonest pursuit father

as the times go not necessarily my dear though it may readily
become so

and is it disreputable generally with the world

that depends on circumstances anna when the stock-jobber loses
he is very apt to be condemned but i rather think his character
rises in proportion to his gains but why do you ask these singular
questions love

i thought i heard anna breathe harder than usual and it is certain
that she leaned far out of the window to pluck a rose

why mrs norton said jack was not invited to sir harry griffin's
because his father was a stock-jobber do you think she was right
sir

very likely my dear returned the divine who i fancied was
smiling at the question sir harry has the advantages of birth and
he probably did not forget that our friend jack was not so
fortunate and moreover sir harry while he values himself on his
wealth is not as rich as jack's father by a million or two in
other words as they say on change jack's father could buy ten of
him this motive was perhaps more likely to influence him than the
first in addition sir harry is suspected of gambling himself in
the funds through the aid of agents and a gentleman who resorts to
such means to increase his fortune is a little apt to exaggerate his
social advantages by way of a set-off to the humiliation

and gentlemen do really become stock-jobbers father

anna the world has undergone great changes in my time ancient
opinions have been shaken and governments themselves are getting to
be little better than political establishments to add facilities to
the accumulation of money this is a subject however you cannot
very well understand nor do i pretend to be very profound in it
myself

but is jack's father really so very very rich asked anna whose
thoughts had been wandering from the thread of those pursued by her
father

he is believed to be so

and jack is his heir

certainly he has no other child though it is not easy to say what
so singular a being may do with his money

i hope he will disinherit jack

you surprise me anna you who are so mild and reasonable to wish
such a misfortune to befall our young friend john goldencalf i
gazed upward in astonishment at this extraordinary speech of anna
and at the moment i would have given all my interest in the fortune
in question to have seen her face most of her body was out of the
window for i heard her again rustling the bush above my head in
order to judge of her motive by its expression but an envious rose
grew exactly in the only spot where it was possible to get a
glimpse

why do you wish so cruel a thing resumed dr etherington a
little earnestly

because i hate stock-jobbing and its riches father were jack
poorer it seems to me he would be better esteemed

as this was uttered the dear girl drew back and i then perceived
that i had mistaken her cheek for one of the largest and most
blooming of the flowers dr etherington laughed and i distinctly
heard him kiss the blushing face of his daughter i think i would
have given up my hopes in another million to have been the rector at
tenthpig at that instant

if that be all child he answered set thy heart at rest jack's
money will never bring him into contempt unless through the use he
may make of it alas anna we live in an age of corruption and
cupidity generous motives appear to be lost sight of in the general
desire of gain and he who would manifest a disposition to a pure
and disinterested philanthropy is either distrusted as a hypocrite
or derided as a fool the accursed revolution among our neighbors
the french has quite unsettled opinions and religion itself has
tottered in the wild anarchy of theories to which it has given rise
there is no worldly advantage that has been more austerely denounced
by the divine writers than riches and yet it is fast rising to be
the god of the ascendant to say nothing of an hereafter society is
getting to be corrupted by it to the core and even respect for
birth is yielding to the mercenary feeling

and do you not think pride of birth father a mistaken prejudice
as well as pride of riches

pride of any sort my love cannot exactly be defended on
evangelical principles but surely some distinctions among men are
necessary even for quiet were the levelling principle
acknowledged the lettered and the accomplished must descend to an
equality with the ignorant and vulgar since all men cannot rise to
the attainments of the former class and the world would retrograde
to barbarism the character of a christian gentleman is much too
precious to trifle with in order to carry out an impracticable
theory

anna was silent probably she was confused between the opinions
which she most liked to cherish and the faint glimmerings of truth
to which we are reduced by the ordinary relations of life as for
the good rector himself i had no difficulty in understanding his
bias though neither his premises nor his conclusions possessed the
logical clearness that used to render his sermons so delightful
more especially when he preached about the higher qualities of the
saviour's dispensation such as charity love of our fellows and
in particular the imperative duty of humbling ourselves before god

a month after this accidental dialogue chance made me auditor of
what passed between my ancestor and sir joseph job another
celebrated dealer in the funds in an interview that took place in
the house of the former in cheapside as the difference was so
patent as the french express it i shall furnish the substance of
what passed

this is a serious and a most alarming movement mr goldencalf
observed sir joseph and calls for union and cordiality among the
holders of property should these damnable opinions get fairly
abroad among the people what would become of us i ask mr
goldencalf what would become of us

i agree with you sir joseph it is very alarming frightfully
alarming

we shall have agrarian laws sir your money sir and mine our
hard earnings will become the prey of political robbers and our
children will be beggared to satisfy the envious longings of some
pitiful scoundrel without a six-pence

tis a sad state of things sir joseph and government is very
culpable that it don't raise at least ten new regiments

the worst of it is good mr goldencalf that there are some jack-
a-napeses of the aristocracy who lead the rascals on and lend them
the sanction of their names it is a great mistake sir that we
give so much importance to birth in this island by which means
proud beggars set unwashed blackguards in motion and the
substantial subjects are the sufferers property sir is in danger
and property is the only true basis of society

i am sure sir joseph i never could see the smallest use in
birth

it is of no use but to beget pensioners mr goldencalf now with
property it is a different thing money is the parent of money and
by money a state becomes powerful and prosperous but this accursed
revolution among our neighbors the french has quite unsettled
opinions and alas property is in perpetual danger

sorry am i to say i feel it to be so in every nerve of my body
sir joseph

we must unite and defend ourselves mr goldencalf else both you
and i men warm enough and substantial enough at present will be in
the ditch do you not see that we are in actual danger of a division
of property

god forbid

yes sir our sacred property is in danger

here sir joseph shook my father cordially by the hand and withdrew
i find by a memorandum among the papers of my deceased ancestor
that he paid the broker of sir joseph that day month sixty-two
thousand seven hundred and twelve pounds difference as bull and
bear owing to the fact of the knight having got some secret
information through a clerk in one of the offices an advantage that
enabled him in this instance at least to make a better bargain
than one who was generally allowed to be among the shrewdest
speculators on change

my mind was of a nature to be considerably exercised as the pious
purists express it by becoming the depository of sentiments so
diametrically opposed to each other as those of dr etherington and
those of sir joseph job on the one side i was taught the
degradation of birth on the other the dangers of property anna
was usually my confidant but on this subject i was tongue-tied for
i dared not confess that i had overheard the discourse with her
father and i was compelled to digest the contradictory doctrines by
myself in the best manner i could




chapter iv

showing the ups and downs the hopes and fears and the vagaries of
love some views of death and an account of an inheritance


from my twentieth to my twenty-third year no event occurred of any
great moment the day i became of age my father settled on me a
regular allowance of a thousand a year and i make no doubt i should
have spent my time much as other young men had it not been for the
peculiarity of my birth which i now began to see was wanting in a
few of the requisites to carry me successfully through a struggle
for place with a certain portion of what is called the great world
while most were anxious to trace themselves into obscurity there
was a singular reluctance to effecting the object as clearly and as
distinctly as it was in my power to do from all which as well as
from much other testimony i have been led to infer that the doses
of mystification which appear to be necessary to the happiness of
the human race require to be mixed with an experienced and a
delicate hand our organs both physically and morally are so
fearfully constituted that they require to be protected from
realities as the physical eye has need of clouded glass to look
steadily at the sun so it would seem the mind's eye has also need of
something smoky to look steadily at truth but while i avoided
laying open the secret of my heart to anna i sought various
opportunities to converse with dr etherington and my father on
those points which gave me the most concern from the first i heard
principles which went to show that society was of necessity divided
into orders that it was not only impolitic but wicked to weaken the
barriers by which they were separated that heaven had its seraphs
and cherubs its archangels and angels its saints and its merely
happy and that by obvious induction this world ought to have its
kings lords and commons the usual winding-up of all the doctor's
essays was a lamentation on the confusion in classes that was
visiting england as a judgment my ancestor on the other hand
cared little for social classification or for any other
conservatory expedient but force on this topic he would talk all
day regiments and bayonets glittering in every sentence when most
eloquent on this theme he would cry like mr manners sutton
order order nor can i recall a single disquisition that did not
end with alas jack property is in danger

i shall not say that my mind entirely escaped confusion among these
conflicting opinions although i luckily got a glimpse of one
important truth for both the commentators cordially agreed in
fearing and of necessity in hating the mass of their fellow-
creatures my own natural disposition was inclining to philanthropy
and as i was unwilling to admit the truth of theories that arrayed
me in open hostility against so large a portion of mankind i soon
determined to set up one of my own which while it avoided the
faults should include the excellences of both the others it was
of course no great affair merely to form such a resolution but i
shall have occasion to say a word hereafter on the manner in which i
attempted to carry it out in practice

time moved on and anna became each day more beautiful i thought
that she had lost some of her frankness and girlish gayety it is
true after the dialogue with her father but this i attributed to
the reserve and discretion that became the expanding reason and
greater feeling of propriety that adorn young womanhood with me she
was always ingenuous and simple and were i to live a thousand years
the angelic serenity of countenance with which she invariably
listened to the theories of my busy brain would not be erased from
recollection

we were talking of these things one morning quite alone anna heard
me when i was most sedate with manifest pleasure and she smiled
mournfully when the thread of my argument was entangled by a vagary
of the imagination i felt at my heart's core what a blessing such a
mentor would be and how fortunate would be my lot could i succeed
in securing her for life still i did not could not summon courage
to lay bare my inmost thoughts and to beg a boon that in these
moments of transient humility i feared i never should be worthy to
possess

i have even thought of marrying i continued so occupied with my
own theories as not to weigh with the accuracy that becomes the
frankness and superior advantages which man possesses over the
gentler sex the full import of my words could i find one anna
as gentle as good as beautiful and as wise as yourself who would
consent to be mine i should not wait a minute but unhappily i
fear this is not likely to be my blessed lot i am not the grandson
of a baronet and your father expects to unite you with one who can
at least show that the bloody hand has once been born on his
shield and on the other side my father talks of nothing but
millions during the first part of this speech the amiable girl
looked kindly up at me and with a seeming desire to soothe me but
at its close her eyes dropped upon her work and she remained silent
your father says that every man who has an interest in the state
should give it pledges here anna smiled but so covertly that her
sweet mouth scarce betrayed the impulse and that none others can
ever control it to advantage i have thought of asking my father to
buy a borough and a baronetcy for with the first and the influence
that his money gives he need not long wish for the last but i
never open my lips on any matter of the sort that he does not answer
fol lol der rol jack with your knighthoods and social order and
bishoprics and boroughs property is in danger loans and
regiments if thou wilt give us more order order order bayonets
are what we want boy and good wholesome taxes to accustom the
nation to contribute to its own wants and to maintain its credit
why youngster if the interest on the debt were to remain unpaid
twenty-four hours your body corporate as you call it would die a
natural death and what would then become of your knights barro-
knights and barren enough some of them are getting to be by their
wastefulness and extravagance get thee married jack and settle
prudently there is neighbor silverpenny has an only daughter of a
suitable age and a good hussy is she in the bargain the only
daughter of oliver silverpenny will be a suitable wife for the only
son of thomas goldencalf though i give thee notice boy that thou
wilt be cut off with a competency so keep thy head clear of
extravagant castle-building learn economy in season and above
all make no debts anna laughed as i humorously imitated the
well-known intonations of mr speaker sutton but a cloud darkened
her bright features when i concluded

yesterday i mentioned the subject to your father i resumed and
he thought with me that the idea of the borough and the baronetcy
was a good one you would be the second of your line jack he
said and that is always better than being the first for there is
no security for a man's being a good member of society like that of
his having presented to his eyes the examples of those who have gone
before him and who have been distinguished by their services or
their virtues if your father would consent to come into parliament
and sustain government at this critical moment his origin would be
overlooked and you would have pride in looking back on his acts as
it is i fear his whole soul is occupied with the unworthy and
debasing passion of mere gain money is a necessary auxiliary to
rank and without rank there can be no order and without order no
liberty but when the love of money gets to occupy the place of
respect for descent and past actions a community loses the very
sentiment on which all its noble exploits are bottomed so you see
dear anna that our parents hold very different opinions on a very
grave question and between natural affection and acquired
veneration i scarcely know which to receive if i could find one
sweet and wise and beautiful as thou and who could pity me i
would marry to-morrow and cast all the future on the happiness that
is to be found with such a companion

as usual anna heard me in silence that she did not however view
matrimony with exactly the same eyes as myself was clearly proved
the very next day for young sir harry griffin the father was dead
offered in form and was very decidedly refused

although i was always happy at the rectory i could not help feeling
rather than seeing that as the french express it i occupied a
false position in society known to be the expectant of great
wealth it was not easy to be overlooked altogether in a country
whose government is based on a representation of property and in
which boroughs are openly in market and yet they who had obtained
the accidental advantage of having their fortunes made by their
grandfathers were constantly convincing me that mine vast as it was
thought to be was made by my father ten thousand times did i wish
as it has since been expressed by the great captain of the age
that i had been my own grandson for notwithstanding the probability
that he who is nearest to the founder of a fortune is the most
likely to share the largest in its accumulations as he who is
nearest in descent to the progenitor who has illustrated his race is
the most likely to feel the influence of his character i was not
long in perceiving that in highly refined and intellectual
communities the public sentiment as it is connected with the
respect and influence that are the meed of both directly refutes
the inferences of all reasonable conjectures on the subject i was
out of my place uneasy ashamed proud and resentful in short i
occupied a false position and unluckily one from which i saw no
plausible retreat except by falling back on lombard street or by
cutting my throat anna alone kind gentle serene-eyed anna 
entered into all my joys sympathized in my mortifications and
appeared to view me as i was neither dazzled by my wealth nor
repelled by my origin the day she refused young sir harry griffin i
could have kneeled at her feet and called her blessed

it is said that no moral disease is ever benefited by its study i
was a living proof of the truth of the opinion that brooding over
one's wrongs or infirmities seldom does much more than aggravate the
evil i greatly fear it is in the nature of man to depreciate the
advantages he actually enjoys and to exaggerate those which are
denied him fifty times during the six months that succeeded the
repulse of the young baronet did i resolve to take heart and to
throw myself at the feet of anna and as often was i deterred by the
apprehension that i had nothing to render me worthy of one so
excellent and especially of one who was the granddaughter of the
seventh english baronet i do not pretend to explain the connection
between cause and effect for i am neither physician nor
metaphysician but the tumult of spirits that resulted from so many
doubts hopes fears resolutions and breakings of resolutions
began to affect my health and i was just about to yield to the
advice of my friends among whom anna was the most earnest and the
most sorrowful to travel when an unexpected call to attend the
death-bed of my ancestor was received i tore myself from the
rectory and hurried up to town with the diligence and assiduity of
an only son and heir summoned on an occasion so solemn

i found my ancestor still in the possession of his senses though
given over by the physicians a circumstance that proved a degree of
disinterestedness and singleness of purpose on their part that was
scarcely to be expected towards a patient who it was commonly
believed was worth more than a million my reception by the servants
and by the two or three friends who had assembled on this melancholy
occasion too was sympathizing warm and of a character to show
their solicitude and forethought

my reception by the sick man was less marked the total abstraction
of his faculties in the one great pursuit of his life a certain
sternness of purpose which is apt to get the ascendant with those
who are resolute to gain and which usually communicates itself to
the manners and an absence of those kinder ties that are developed
by the exercise of the more familiar charities of our existence had
opened a breach between us that was not to be filled by the simple
unaided fact of natural affinity i say of natural affinity for
notwithstanding the doubts that cast their shadows on that branch of
my genealogical tree by which i was connected with my maternal
grandfather the title of the king to his crown is not more apparent
than was my direct lineal descent from my father i always believed
him to be my ancestor de jure as well as de facto and could fain
have loved him and honored him as such had my natural yearnings been
met with more lively bowels of sympathy on his side

notwithstanding the long and unnatural estrangement that had thus
existed between the father and son the meeting on the present
occasion was not entirely without some manifestations of feeling

thou art come at last jack said my ancestor i was afraid boy
thou might'st be too late

the difficult breathing haggard countenance and broken utterance
of my father struck me with awe this was the first death-bed by
which i had ever stood and the admonishing picture of time passing
into eternity was indelibly stamped on my memory it was not only a
death-bed scene but it was a family death-bed scene i know not how
it was but i thought my ancestor looked more like the goldencalfs
than i had ever seen him look before

thou hast come at last jack he repeated and i'm glad of it
thou art the only being in whom i have now any concern it might
have been better perhaps had i lived more with my kind but thou
wilt be the gainer ah jack we are but miserable mortals after
all to be called away so suddenly and so young

my ancestor had seen his seventy-fifth birthday but unhappily he
had not settled all his accounts with the world although he had
given the physician his last fee and sent the parson away with a
donation to the poor of the parish that would make even a beggar
merry for a whole life

thou art come at last jack well my loss will be thy gain boy
send the nurse from the room

i did as commanded and we were left to ourselves

take this key handing me one from beneath his pillow and open
the upper drawer of my secretary bring me the packet which is
addressed to thyself

i silently obeyed when my ancestor first gazing at it with a
sadness that i cannot well describe for it was neither worldly nor
quite of an ethereal character but a singular and fearful compound
of both put the papers into my hand relinquishing his hold slowly
and with reluctance

thou wilt wait till i am out of thy sight jack

a tear burst from out its source and fell upon the emaciated hand of
my father he looked at me wistfully and i felt a slight pressure
that denoted affection

it might have been better jack had we known more of each other
but providence made me fatherless and i have lived childless by my
own folly thy mother was a saint i believe but i fear i learned
it too late well a blessing often comes at the eleventh hour

as my ancestor now manifested a desire not to be disturbed i called
the nurse and quitted the room retiring to my own modest chamber
where the packet a large bundle of papers sealed and directed to
myself in the handwriting of the dying man was carefully secured
under a good lock i did not meet my father again but once under
circumstances which admitted of intelligible communion from the
time of our first interview he gradually grew worse his reason
tottered and like the sinful cardinal of shakespeare he died and
gave no sign

three days after my arrival however i was left alone with him and
he suddenly revived from a state approaching to stupor it was the
only time since the first interview in which he had seemed even to
know me

thou art come at last he said in a tone that was already
sepulchral canst tell me boy why they had golden rods to measure
the city his nurse had been reading to him a chapter of the
revelations which had been selected by himself thou seest lad
the wall itself was of jasper and the city was of pure gold i shall
not need money in my new habitation ha it will not be wanted
there i am not crazed jack would i had loved gold less and my
kind more the city itself is of pure gold and the walls of jasper 
precious abode ha jack thou hearest boy i am happy too happy
jack gold gold

the final words were uttered with a shout they were the last that
ever came from the lips of thomas goldencalf the noise brought in
the attendants who found him dead i ordered the room to be cleared
as soon as the melancholy truth was fairly established and remained
several minutes alone with the body the countenance was set in
death the eyes still open had that revolting glare of frenzied
delight with which the spirit had departed and the whole face
presented the dread picture of a hopeless end i knelt and though a
protestant prayed fervently for the soul of the deceased i then
took my leave of the first and the last of all my ancestors

to this scene succeeded the usual period of outward sorrow the
interment and the betrayal of the expectations of the survivors i
observed that the house was much frequented by many who rarely or
never had crossed its threshold during the life of its late owner
there was much cornering much talking in an undertone and looking
at me that i did not understand and gradually the number of regular
visitors increased until it amounted to about twenty among them
were the parson of the parish the trustees of several notorious
charities three attorneys four or five well-known dealers of the
stock exchange foremost among whom was sir joseph job and three of
the professionally benevolent or of those whose sole occupation
appears to be that of quickening the latent charities of their
neighbors

the day after my ancestor was finally removed from our sight the
house was more than usually crowded the secret conferences
increased both in earnestness and in frequency and finally i was
summoned to meet these ill-timed guests in the room which had been
the sanctum sanctorum of the late owner of the dwelling as i
entered among twenty strange faces wondering why i who had
hitherto passed through life so little heeded should be
unseasonably importuned sir joseph job presented himself as the
spokesman of the party

we have sent for you mr goldencalf the knight commenced
decently wiping his eyes because we think that respect for our
late much-esteemed most excellent and very respectable friend
requires that we no longer neglect his final pleasure but that we
should proceed at once to open his will in order that we may take
prompt measures for its execution it would have been more regular
had we done this before he was interred for we cannot have foreseen
his pleasure concerning his venerable remains but it is fully my
determination to have everything done as he has ordered even though
we may be compelled to disinter the body

i am habitually quiescent and possibly credulous but nature has
not denied me a proper spirit what sir joseph job or any one but
myself had to do with the will of my ancestor did not strike me at
first sight and i took care to express as much in terms it was not
easy to misunderstand

the only child and indeed the only known relative of the
deceased i said i do not well see gentlemen how this subject
should interest in this lively manner so many strangers

very spirited and proper no doubt sir returned sir joseph
smiling but you ought to know young gentleman that if there are
such things as heirs there are also such things as executors

this i did know already and i had also somewhere imbibed an opinion
that the latter was commonly the most lucrative situation

have you any reason to suppose sir joseph job that my late father
has selected you to fulfil this trust

that will be better known in the end young gentleman your late
father is known to have died rich very rich not that he has left
as much by half a million as vulgar report will have it but what i
should term comfortably off and it is unreasonable to suppose that
a man of his great caution and prudence should suffer his money to
go to the heir-at-law that heir being a youth only in his twenty-
third year ignorant of business not over-gifted with experience
and having the propensities of all his years in this ill-behaving
and extravagant age without certain trusts and provisions which
will leave his hard earnings for some time to come under the care of
men who like himself know the full value of money

no never tis quite impossible tis more than impossible
exclaimed the bystanders all shaking their heads

and the late mr goldencalf too intimate with most of the
substantial names on change and particularly with sir joseph job
added another

sir joseph job nodded his head smiled stroked his chin and stood
waiting for my reply

property is in danger sir joseph i said ironically but it
matters not if there is a will it is as much my interest to know
it as it can possibly be yours and i am quite willing that a search
be made on the spot

sir joseph looked daggers at me but being a man of business he took
me at my word and receiving the keys i offered a proper person
was immediately set to work to open the drawers the search was
continued for four hours without success every private drawer was
rummaged every paper opened and many a curious glance was cast at
the contents of the latter in order to get some clew to the
probable amount of the assets of the deceased consternation and
uneasiness very evidently increased among most of the spectators as
the fruitless examination proceeded and when the notary ended
declaring that no will was to be found nor any evidence of credits
every eye was fastened on me as if i were suspected of stealing that
which in the order of nature was likely to be my own without the
necessity of crime

there must be a secret repository of papers somewhere said sir
joseph job as if he suspected more than he wished just then to
express mr goldencalf is largely a creditor on the public books
and yet here is not so much as a scrip for a pound

i left the room and soon returned bringing with me the bundle that
had been committed to me by my father

here gentlemen i said is a large packet of papers that were
given to me by the deceased on his death-bed with his own hands it
is as you see sealed with his seal and especially addressed to me
in his own handwriting and it is not violent to suppose that the
contents concern me only still as you take so great an interest in
the affairs of the deceased it shall now be opened and those
contents so far as you can have any right to know them shall not
be hid from you

i thought sir joseph looked grave when he saw the packet and had
examined the handwriting of the envelope all however expressed
their satisfaction that the search was now most probably ended i
broke the seals and exposed the contents of the envelope within it
there were several smaller packets each sealed with the seal of the
deceased and each addressed to me in his own handwriting like the
external covering each of these smaller packets too had a
separate indorsement of its contents taking them as they lay i
read aloud the nature of each before i proceeded to the next they
were also numbered

no i commenced certificates of public stock held by tho
goldencalf june th we were now at june th of the same
year as i laid aside this packet i observed that the sum indorsed
on its back greatly exceeded a million no certificates of bank
of england stock this sum was several hundred thousands of pounds
no south sea annuities nearly three hundred thousand pounds
no bonds and mortgages four hundred and thirty thousand
pounds no the bond of sir joseph job for sixty-three thousand
pounds

i laid down the paper and involuntarily exclaimed property is in
danger sir joseph turned pale but he beckoned to me to proceed
saying we shall soon come to the will sir

no   i hesitated for it was an assignment to myself which
from its very nature i perceived was an abortive attempt to escape
the payment of the legacy duty

well sir no inquired sir joseph with tremulous exultation

is an instrument affecting myself and with which you have no
concern sir

we shall see sir we shall see sir if you refuse to exhibit the
paper there are laws to compel you

to do what sir joseph job to exhibit to my father's debtors
papers that are exclusively addressed to me and which can affect me
only but here is the paper gentlemen that you so much desire to
see no the last will and testament of tho goldencalf dated
june th he died june the th of the same year

ah the precious instrument exclaimed sir joseph job eagerly
extending his hand as if expecting to receive the will

this paper as you perceive gentlemen i said holding it up in a
manner that all present might see it is especially addressed to
myself and it shall not quit my hands until i learn that some other
has a better right to it

i confess my heart failed me as i broke the seals for i had seen
but little of my father and i knew that he had been a man of very
peculiar opinions as well as habits the will was all in his own
handwriting and it was very short summoning courage i read it
aloud in the following words

in the name of god amen i tho goldencalf of the parish of bow
in the city of london do publish and declare this instrument to be
my last will and testament

that is to say i bequeath to my only child and much-beloved son
john goldencalf all my real estate in the parish of bow and city of
london aforesaid to be held in free-simple by him his heirs and
assigns forever

i bequeath to my said only child and much-beloved son john
goldencalf all my personal property of every sort and description
whatever of which i may die possessed including bonds and
mortgages public debt bank stock notes of hand goods and
chattels and all others of my effects to him his heirs or
assigns

i nominate and appoint my said much-beloved son john goldencalf
to be the sole executor of this my last will and testament
counselling him not to confide in any of those who may profess to
have been my friends and particularly to turn a deaf ear to all the
pretensions and solicitations of sir joseph job knight in witness
whereof etc etc

this will was duly executed and it was witnessed by the nurse his
confidential clerk and the housemaid

property is in danger sir joseph i dryly remarked as i gathered
together the papers in order to secure them

this will may be set aside gentlemen cried the knight in a fury
it contains a libel

and for whose benefit sir joseph i quietly inquired with or
without the will my title to my father's assets would seem to be
equally valid

this was so evidently true that the more prudent retired in silence
and even sir joseph after a short delay during which he appeared to
be strangely agitated withdrew the next week his failure was
announced in consequence of some extravagant risks on change and
eventually i received but three shillings and fourpence in the pound
for my bond of sixty-three thousand

when the money was paid i could not help exclaiming mentally
property is in danger

the following morning sir joseph job balanced his account with the
world by cutting his throat




chapter v

about the social-stake system the dangers of concentration and
other moral and immoral curiosities


the affairs of my father were almost as easy of settlement as those
of a pauper in twenty-four hours i was completely master of them
and found myself if not the richest certainly one of the richest
subjects of europe i say subjects for sovereigns frequently have a
way of appropriating the effects of others that would render a
pretension to rivalry ridiculous debts there were none and if
there had been ready money was not wanting the balance in cash in
my favor at the bank amounted in itself to a fortune

the reader may now suppose that i was perfectly happy without a
solitary claim on either my time or my estate i was in the
enjoyment of an income that materially exceeded the revenues of many
reigning princes i had not an ex-pensive nor a vicious habit of any
sort of houses horses hounds packs and menials there were none
to vex or perplex me in every particular save one i was completely
my own master that one was the near dear cherished sentiment that
rendered anna in my eyes an angel and truly she was little short of
it in those of other people and made her the polar star to which
every wish pointed how gladly would i have paid half a million just
then to be the grandson of a baronet with precedency from the
seventeenth century

there was however another and a present cause for un-easiness that
gave me even more concern than the fact that my family reached the
dark ages with so much embarrassing facility in witnessing the
dying agony of my ancestor i had got a dread lesson on the vanity
the hopeless character the dangers and the delusions of wealth
that time can never eradicate the history of its accumulation was
ever present to mar the pleasure of its possession i do not mean
that i suspected what by the world's convention is deemed
dishonesty of that there had been no necessity but simply that the
heartless and estranged existence the waste of energies the
blunted charities and the isolated and distrustful habits of my
father appeared to me to be but poorly requited by the joyless
ownership of its millions i would have given largely to be directed
in such a way as while escaping the wastefulness of the shoals of
scylla i might in my own case steer clear of the miserly rocks of
charybdis

when i drove from between the smoky lines of the london houses into
the green fields and amid the blossoming hedges this earth looked
beautiful and as if it were made to be loved i saw in it the
workmanship of a divine and beneficent creator and it was not
difficult to persuade myself that he who dwelt in the confusion of a
town in order to transfer gold from the pocket of his neighbor to
his own had mistaken the objects of his being my poor ancestor who
had never quitted london stood before me with his dying regrets and
my first resolution was to live in open communion with my kind so
intense indeed did my anxiety to execute this purpose become that
it might have led even to frenzy had not a fortunate circumstance
interposed to save me from so dire a calamity

the coach in which i had taken passage for i purposely avoided the
parade and trouble of post-chaise and servants passed through a
market town of known loyalty on the eve of a contested election
this appeal to the intelligence and patriotism of the constituency
had occurred in consequence of the late incumbent having taken
office the new minister for he was a member of the cabinet had
just ended his canvass and he was about to address his fellow-
subjects from a window of the tavern in which he lodged fatigued
but ready to seek mental relief by any means i threw myself from
the coach secured a room and made one of the multitude

the favorite candidate occupied a large balcony surrounded by his
principal friends among whom it was delightful to see earls lords
john baronets dignitaries of the church tradesmen of influence in
the borough and even a mechanic or two all squeezed together in
the agreeable amalgamation of political affinity here then thought
i is an example of the heavenly charities i the candidate himself
the son and heir of a peer feels that he is truly of the same flesh
and blood as his constituents how amiably he smiles how bland are
his manners and with what cordiality does he shake hands with the
greasiest and the worst there must be a corrective to human pride
a stimulus to the charities a never-ending lesson of benevolence in
this part of our excellent system and i will look farther into it
the candidate appeared and his harangue commenced

memory would fail me were i to attempt recording the precise
language of the orator but his opinions and precepts are so deeply
graven on my recollection that i do not fear misrepresenting them
he commenced with a very proper and eloquent eulogium on the
constitution which he fearlessly pronounced to be in its way the
very perfection of human reason in proof of which he adduced the
well-ascertained fact that it had always been known throughout the
vicissitudes and trials of so many centuries to accommodate itself
to circumstances abhorring change yes my friends he exclaimed
in a burst of patriotic and constitutional fervor whether under
the roses or the lilies the tudors the stuarts or the illustrious
house of brunswick this glorious structure has resisted the storms
of faction has been able to receive under its sheltering roof the
most opposite elements of domestic strife affording protection
warmth aye and food and raiment-here the orator happily laid his
hand on the shoulder of a butcher who wore a frieze overcoat that
made him look not unlike a stall-fed beast yes food and raiment
victuals and drink to the meanest subject in the realm nor is this
all it is a constitution peculiarly english and who is there so
base so vile so untrue to himself to his fathers to his
descendants as to turn his back on a constitution that is
thoroughly and inherently english a constitution that he has
inherited from his ancestors and which by every obligation both
human and divine he is bound to transmit unchanged to posterity 
here the orator who continued to speak however was deafened by
shouts of applause and that part of the subject might very fairly
be considered as definitively settled

from the constitution as a whole the candidate next proceeded to
extol the particular feature of it that was known as the borough of
householder according to his account of this portion of the
government its dwellers were animated by the noblest spirit of
independence the most rooted determination to uphold the ministry
of which he was the least worthy member and were distinguished by
what in an ecstasy of political eloquence he happily termed the most
freeborn understanding of its rights and privileges this loyal and
judicious borough had never been known to waste its favors on those
who had not a stake in the community it understood that fundamental
principle of good government which lays down the axiom that none
were to be trusted but those who had a visible and an extended
interest in the country for without these pledges of honesty and
independence what had the elector to expect but bribery and
corruption a traffic in his dearest rights and a bargaining that
might destroy the glorious institutions under which he dwelt this
part of the harangue was listened to in respectful silence and
shortly after the orator concluded when the electors dispersed
with no doubt a better opinion of themselves and the constitution
than it had probably been their good fortune to entertain since the
previous election

accident placed me at dinner the house being crowded at the same
table with an attorney who had been very active the whole morning
among the householders and who i soon learned from himself was
the especial agent of the owner of the independent borough in
question he told me that he had came down with the expectation of
disposing of the whole property to lord pledge the ministerial
candidate named but the means had not been forthcoming as he had
been led to hope and the bargain was unluckily broken off at the
very moment when it was of the utmost importance to know to whom the
independent electors rightfully belonged

his lordship however continued the attorney winking has done
what is handsome and there can be no more doubt of his election
than there would be of yours did you happen to own the borough

and is the property now open for sale i asked

certainly-my principal can hold out no longer the price is
settled and i have his power of attorney to make the preliminary
bargain tis a thousand pities that the public mind should be left
in this undecided state on the eve of an election

then sir i will be the purchaser

my companion looked at me with astonishment and doubt he had
transacted too much business of this nature however not to feel
his way before he was either off or on

the price of the estate is three hundred and twenty-five thousand
pounds sir and the rental is only six

be it so my name is goldencalf by accompanying me to town you
shall receive the money

goldencalf what sir the only son and heir of the late thomas
goldencalf of cheapside

the same my father has not been dead a month

pardon me sir convince me of your identity we must be particular
in matters of this sort and you shall have possession of the
property in season to secure your own election or that of any of
your friends i will return lord pledge his small advances and
another time he will know better than to fail of keeping his
promises what is a borough good for if a nobleman's word is not
sacred you will find the electors in particular every way worthy
of your favor they are as frank loyal and straightforward a
constituency as any in england no skulking behind the ballot for
them and in all respects they are fearless englishmen who will do
what they say and say whatever their landlord shall please to
require of them

as i had sundry letters and other documents about me nothing was
easier than to convince the attorney of my identity he called for
pen and ink drew out of his pocket the contract that had been
prepared for lord pledge gave it to me to read filled the blanks
and affixing his name called the waiters as witnesses and
presented me the paper with a promptitude and respect that i found
really delightful so much thought i for having given pledges to
society by the purchase of a borough i drew on my bankers for three
hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds and arose from table
virtually the owner of the estate of householder and of the
political consciences of its tenantry

a fact so important could not long be unknown and in a few minutes
all eyes in the coffee-room were upon me the landlord presented
himself and begged i would do him the honor to take possession of
his family parlor there being no other at his disposal i was
hardly installed before a servant in a handsome livery presented the
following note

dear mr goldencalf

i have this moment heard of your being in town and am exceedingly
rejoiced to learn it a long intimacy with your late excellent and
most loyal father justifies my claiming you for a friend and i
waive all ceremony official of course is meant there being no
reason for any other between us and beg to be admitted for half an
hour

dear mr goldencalf

yours very faithfully and sincerely

pledge

 goldencalf esquire

 monday evening

i begged that the noble visitor might not be made to wait a moment
lord pledge met me like an old and intimate friend he made a
hundred handsome inquiries after my dead ancestor spoke feelingly
of his regret at not having been summoned to attend his death-bed
and then very ingenuously and warmly congratulated me on my
succession to so large a property

i hear too you have bought this borough my dear sir i could not
make it convenient just at this particular moment to conclude my own
arrangement but it is a good thing three hundred and twenty
thousand i suppose as was mentioned between me and the other
party

three hundred and twenty-five thousand lord pledge

i perceived by the countenance of the noble candidate that i had
paid the odd five thousand as a fine a circumstance which accounted
for the promptitude of the attorney in the transaction he most
probably pocketing the difference himself

you mean to sit of course

i do my lord as one of the members at the next general election
but at present i shall be most happy to aid your return

my dear mr goldencalf 

really without presuming to compliment lord pledge the noble
sentiments i heard you express this morning were so very proper so
exceedingly statesmanlike so truly english that i shall feel
infinitely more satisfaction in knowing that you fill the vacant
seat than if it were in my own possession

i honor your public spirit mr goldencalf and only wish to god
there was more of it in the world but you can count on our
friendship sir what you have just remarked is true very true
only too true true to a hair-a-a-a i mean my dear mr goldencalf
most especially those sentiments of mine which-a-a-a-i say it
before god without vanity but which as you have so very ably
intimated are so truly proper and english

i sincerely think so lord pledge or i should not have said it i
am peculiarly situated myself with an immense fortune without
rank name or connections nothing is easier than for one of my
years to be led astray and it is my ardent desire to hit upon some
expedient that may connect me properly with society

marry my dear young friend select a wife from among the fair and
virtuous of this happy isle unluckily i can propose nothing in this
way myself for both my own sisters are disposed of

i have made choice already i thank you a thousand times my dear
lord pledge although i scarcely dare execute my own wishes there
are objections if i were only the child now of a baronet's second
son or 

become a baronet yourself once more interrupted my noble friend
with an evident relief from suspense for i verily believe he
thought i was about to ask for something better your affair shall
be arranged by the end of the week and if there is anything else i
can do for you i beg you to name it without reserve

if i could hear a few more of those remarkable sentiments of yours
concerning the stake we should all have in society i think it would
relieve my mind

my companion looked at me a moment with a very awkward sort of an
intensity drew his hand across his brows reflected and then
obligingly complied

you attach too much importance mr goldencalf to a few certainly
very just but very ill-arranged ideas that a man without a proper
stake in society is little better than the beasts of the fields i
hold to be so obvious that it is unnecessary to dwell on the point
reason as you will forward or backward you arrive at the same
result he that hath nothing is usually treated by mankind little
better than a dog and he that is little better than a dog usually
has nothing again what distinguishes the savage from the civilized
man why civilization to be sure now what is civilization the
arts of life what feeds nourishes sustains the arts of life
money or property by consequence civilization is property and
property is civilization if the control of a country is in the
hands of those who possess the property the government is a
civilized government but on the other hand if it is in the hands
of those who have no property the government is necessarily an
uncivilized government it is quite impossible that any one should
become a safe statesman who does not possess a direct property
interest in society you know there is not a tyro of our political
sect who does not fully admit the truth of this axiom

mr pitt

why pitt was certainly an exception in one way but then you will
recollect he was the immediate representative of the tories who
own most of the property of england

mr fox

fox represented the whigs who own all the rest you know no my
dear goldencalf reason as you will we shall always arrive at the
same results you will of course as you have just said take one
of the seats yourself at the next general election

i shall be too proud of being your colleague to hesitate

this speech sealed our friendship for it was a pledge to my noble
acquaintance of his future connection with the borough he was much
too high-bred to express his thanks in vulgar phrases though high-
breeding rarely exhibits all its finer qualities pending an
election but a man of the world and one of a class whose main
business it is to put the suaviter in modo as the french have it en
evidence the reader may be sure that when we parted that night i
was in perfect good humor with myself and as a matter of course
with my new acquaintance

the next day the canvass was renewed and we had another convincing
speech on the subject of the virtue of a stake in society for
lord pledge was tactician enough to attack the citadel once assured
of its weak point rather than expend his efforts on the outworks of
the place that night the attorney arrived from town with the title-
deeds all properly executed they had been some time in preparation
for lord pledge and the following morning early the tenants were
served with the usual notices with a handsomely expressed sentiment
on my part in favor of a stake in society about noon lord pledge
walked over the course as it is expressed at newmarket and
doncaster after dinner we separated my noble friend returning to
town while i pursued my way to the rectory

anna never appeared more fresh more serene more elevated above
mortality than when we met a week after i had quitted householder
in the breakfast-parlor of her father's abode

you are beginning to look like yourself again jack she said
extending her hand with the simple cordiality of an englishwoman
and i hope we shall find you more rational

ah anna if i could only presume to throw myself at your feet and
tell you how much and what i feel i should be the happiest fellow
in all england

as it is you are the most miserable the laughing girl answered
as crimsoned to the temples she drew away the hand i was foolishly
pressing against my heart let us go to breakfast mr goldencalf 
my father has ridden across the country to visit dr liturgy

anna i said after seating myself and taking a cup of tea from
fingers that were rosy as the morn i fear you are the greatest
enemy that i have on earth

john goldencalf exclaimed the startled girl turning pale and
then flushing violently pray explain yourself

i love you to my heart's core could marry you and then i fear
worship you as man never before worshipped woman

anna laughed faintly

and you feel in danger of the sin of idolatry she at length
succeeded in saying

no i am in danger of narrowing my sympathies of losing a broad
and safe hold of life of losing my proper stake in society of in
short of becoming as useless to my fellows as my poor poor father
and of making an end as miserable oh anna could you have
witnessed the hopelessness of that death-bed you could never wish
me a fate like his

my pen is unequal to convey an adequate idea of the expression with
which anna regarded me wonder doubt apprehension affection and
anguish were all beaming in her eyes but the unnatural brightness
of these conflicting sentiments was tempered by a softness that
resembled the pearly lustre of an italian sky

if i yield to my fondness anna in what will my condition differ
from that of my miserable father's he concentrated his feelings in
the love of money and i yes i feel it here i know it is here i
should love you so intensely as to shut out every generous sentiment
in favor of others i have a fearful responsibility on my shoulders-
-wealth gold gold beyond limits and to save my very soul i must
extend not narrow my interest in my fellow-creatures were there a
hundred such annas i might press you all to my heart but one no-
-no twould be misery twould be perdition the very excess of
such a passion would render me a heartless miser unworthy of the
confidence of my fellow-men

the radiant and yet serene eyes of anna seemed to read my soul and
when i had done speaking she arose stole timidly to my side of the
table as woman approaches when she feels most placed her velvet-
like hand on my burning forehead pressed its throbbing pulses
gently to her heart burst into tears and fled

we dined alone nor did we meet again until the dinner hour the
manner of anna was soothing gentle even affectionate but she
carefully avoided the subject of the morning as for myself i was
constantly brooding over the danger of concentrating interests and
of the excellence of the social-stake system your spirits will be
better jack in a day or two said anna when we had taken wine
after the soup country air and old friends will restore your
freshness and color

if there were a thousand annas i could be happy as man was never
happy before but i must not dare not lessen my hold on society

all of which proves my insufficiency to render you happy but here
comes francis with yesterday morning's paper let us see what
society is about in london

after a few moments of intense occupation with the journal an
exclamation of pleasure and surprise escaped the sweet girl on
raising my eyes i saw her gazing as i fancied fondly at myself

read what you have that seems to give you so much pleasure

she complied reading with an eager and tremulous voice the
following paragraph

his majesty has been most graciously pleased to raise john
goldencalf of householder hall in the county of dorset and of
cheapside esquire to the dignity of a baronet of the united
kingdoms of great britain and ireland

sir john goldencalf i have the honor to drink to your health and
happiness cried the delighted girl brightening like the dawn and
wetting her pouting lip with liquor less ruby than itself here
francis fill a bumper and drink to the new baronet

the gray-headed butler did as ordered with a very good grace and
then hurried into the servants hall to communicate the news

here at least jack is a new hold that society has on you
whatever hold you may have on society

i was pleased because she was pleased and because it showed that
lord pledge had some sense of gratitude although he afterward took
occasion to intimate that i owed the favor chiefly to hope and i
believe my eyes never expressed more fondness

lady goldencalf would not have an awkward sound after all dearest
anna

as applied to one sir john it might possibly do but not as
applied to a hundred anna laughed blushed burst into tears once
more and again fled

what right have i to trifle with the feelings of this single-hearted
and excellent girl said i to myself it is evident that the subject
distresses her she is unequal to its discussion and it is unmanly
and improper in me to treat it in this manner i must be true to my
character as a gentleman and a man aye and under present
circumstances as a baronet and i will never speak of it again as
long as i live

the following day i took leave of dr etherington and his daughter
with the avowed intention of travelling for a year or two the good
rector gave me much friendly advice flattered me with expressions
of confidence in my discretion and squeezing me warmly by the
hand begged me to recollect that i had always a home at the
rectory when i had made my adieus to the father i went with a
sorrowful heart in quest of the daughter she was still in the
little breakfast-parlor that parlor so loved i found her pale
timid sensitive bland but serene little could ever disturb that
heavenly quality in the dear girl if she laughed it was with a
restrained and moderated joy if she wept it was like rain falling
from a sky that still shone with the lustre of the sun it was only
when feeling and nature were unutterably big within her that some
irresistible impulse of her sex betrayed her into emotions like
those i had twice witnessed so lately

you are about to leave us jack she said holding out her hand
kindly and without the affectation of an indifference she did not
feel you will see many strange faces but you will see none who 

i waited for the completion of the sentence but although she
struggled hard for self-possession it was never finished

at my age anna and with my means it would be unbecoming to
remain at home when if i may so express it human nature is
abroad i go to quicken my sympathies to open my heart to my kind
and to avoid the cruel regrets that tortured the death-bed of my
father

well well interrupted the sobbing girl we will talk of it no
more it is best that you should travel and so adieu with a
thousand nay millions of good wishes for your happiness and safe
return you will come back to us jack when tired of other scenes

this was said with gentle earnestness and a sincerity so winning
that it came near upsetting all my philosophy but i could not marry
the whole sex and to bind down my affections in one would have been
giving the death-blow to the development of that sublime principle
on which i was bent and which i had already decided was to make me
worthy of my fortune and the ornament of my species had i been
offered a kingdom however i could not speak i took the
unresisting girl in my arms folded her to my heart pressed a
burning kiss on her cheek and withdrew

you will come back to us jack she half whispered as her hand
was reluctantly drawn through my own

oh anna it was indeed painful to abandon thy frank and gentle
confidence thy radiant beauty thy serene affections and all thy
womanly virtues in order to practise my newly-discovered theory
long did thy presence haunt me nay never did it entirely desert
me putting my constancy to a severe proof and threatening at each
remove to contract the lengthening chain that still bound me to
thee thy fireside and thy altars but i triumphed and went abroad
upon the earth with a heart expanding towards all the creatures of
god though thy image was still enshrined in its inmost core
shining in womanly glory pure radiant and without spot like the
floating prism that forms the lustre of the diamond




chapter vi

a theory of palpable sublimity some practical ideas and the
commencement of adventures


the recollection of the intense feelings of that important period of
my life has in some measure disturbed the connection of the
narrative and may possibly have left some little obscurity in the
mind of the reader on the subject of the new sources of happiness
that had broken on my own intelligence a word here in the way of
elucidation therefore may not be misapplied although it is my
purpose to refer more to my acts and to the wonderful incidents it
will shortly be my duty to lay before the world for a just
understanding of my views than to mere verbal explanations

happiness happiness here and hereafter was my goal i aimed at a
life of useful and active benevolence a deathbed of hope and joy
and an eternity of fruition with such an object before me my
thoughts from the moment that i witnessed the dying regrets of my
father had been intensely brooding over the means of attainment
surprising as no doubt it will appear to vulgar minds i obtained
the clew to this sublime mystery at the late election for the
borough of householder and from the lips of my lord pledge like
other important discoveries it is very simple when understood
being easily rendered intelligible to the dullest capacities as
indeed in equity ought to be the case with every principle that is
so intimately connected with the well-being of man

it is a universally admitted truth that happiness is the only
legitimate object of all human associations the ruled concede a
certain portion of their natural rights for the benefits of peace
security and order with the understanding that they are to enjoy
the remainder as their own proper indefeasible estate it is true
that there exist in different nations some material differences of
opinion on the subject of the quantities to be bestowed and
retained but these aberrations from a just medium are no more than
so many caprices of the human judgment and in no manner do they
affect the principle i found also that all the wisest and best of
the species or what is much the same thing the most responsible
uniformly maintain that he who has the largest stake in society is
in the nature of things the most qualified to administer its
affairs by a stake in society is meant agreeable to universal
convention a multiplication of those interests which occupy us in
our daily concerns or what is vulgarly called property this
principle works by exciting us to do right through those heavy
investments of our own which would inevitably suffer were we to do
wrong the proposition is now clear nor can the premises readily be
mistaken happiness is the aim of society and property or a vested
interest in that society is the best pledge of our
disinterestedness and justice and the best qualification for its
proper control it follows as a legitimate corollary that a
multiplication of those interests will increase the stake and
render us more and more worthy of the trust by elevating us as near
as may be to the pure and ethereal condition of the angels one of
those happy accidents which sometimes make men emperors and kings
had made me perhaps the richest subject of europe with this polar
star of theory shining before my eyes and with practical means so
ample it would have been clearly my own fault had i not steered my
bark into the right haven if he who had the heaviest investments
was the most likely to love his fellows there could be no great
difficulty for one in my situation to take the lead in philanthropy
it is true that with superficial observers the instance of my own
immediate ancestor might be supposed to form an exception or rather
an objection to the theory so far from this being the case
however it proves the very reverse my father in a great measure
had concentrated all his investments in the national debt now
beyond all cavil he loved the funds intensely grew violent when
they were assailed cried out for bayonets when the mass declaimed
against taxation eulogized the gallows when there were menaces of
revolt and in a hundred other ways prove that where the treasure
is there will the heart be also the instance of my father
therefore like all exceptions only went to prove the excellence of
the rule he had merely fallen into the error of contraction when
the only safe course was that of expansion i resolved to expand to
do that which probably no political economist had ever yet thought
of doing in short to carry out the principle of the social stake
in such a way as should cause me to love all things and
consequently to become worthy of being intrusted with the care of
all things

on reaching town my earliest visit was one of thanks to my lord
pledge at first i had felt some doubts whether the baronetcy would
or would not aid the system of philanthropy for by raising me above
a large portion of my kind it was in so much at least a removal
from philanthropical sympathies but by the time the patent was
received and the fees were paid i found that it might fairly be
considered a pecuniary investment and that it was consequently
brought within the rule i had prescribed for my own government

the next thing was to employ suitable agents to aid in making the
purchases that were necessary to attach me to mankind a month was
diligently occupied in this way as ready money was not wanting and
i was not very particular on the subject of prices at the end of
that time i began to have certain incipient sentiments which went to
prove the triumphant success of the experiment in other words i
owned much and was beginning to take a lively interest in all i
owned

i made purchases of estates in england scotland ireland and
wales this division of real property was meant to equalize my
sentiments justly between the different portions of my native
country not satisfied with this however i extended the system to
the colonies i had east india shares a running ship canada land
a plantation in jamaica sheep at the cape and at new south wales
an indigo concern at bengal an establishment for the collection of
antiques in the ionian isles and a connection with a shipping house
for the general supply of our various dependencies with beer bacon
cheese broadcloths and ironmongery from the british empire my
interests were soon extended into other countries on the garonne
and xeres i bought vineyards in germany i took some shares in
different salt and coal mines the same in south america in the
precious metals in russia i dipped deeply into tallow in
switzerland i set up an extensive manufactory of watches and bought
all the horses for a voiturier on a large scale i had silkworms in
lombardy olives and hats in tuscany a bath in lucca and a
maccaroni establishment at naples to sicily i sent funds for the
purchase of wheat and at rome i kept a connoisseur to conduct a
general agency in the supply of british articles such as mustard
porter pickles and corned beef as well as for the forwarding of
pictures and statues to the lovers of the arts and of virtu

by the time all this was effected i found my hands full of business
method suitable agents and a resolution to succeed smoothed the
way however and i began to look about me and to take breath by
way of relaxation i now descended into details and for a few days i
frequented the meetings of those who are called the saints in
order to see if something might be done towards the attainment of my
object through their instrumentality i cannot say that this
experiment met with all the success i had anticipated i heard a
great deal of subtle discussion found that manner was of more
account than matter and had unreasonable and ceaseless appeals to
my pocket so near a view of charity had a tendency to expose its
blemishes as the brilliancy of the sun is known to exhibit defects
on the face of beauty which escape the eye when seen through the
medium of that artificial light for which they are best adapted and
i soon contented myself with sending my contributions at proper
intervals keeping aloof in person this experiment gave me occasion
to perceive that human virtues like little candles shine best in
the dark and that their radiance is chiefly owing to the atmosphere
of a naughty world from speculating i returned to facts

the question of slavery had agitated the benevolent for some years
and finding a singular apathy in ray own bosom on this important
subject i bought five hundred of each sex to stimulate my
sympathies this led me nearer to the united states of america a
country that i had endeavored to blot out of my recollection for
while thus encouraging a love for the species i had scarcely
thought it necessary to go so far from home as no rule exists
without an exception i confess i was a good deal disposed to
believe that a yankee might very fairly be an omission in an
englishman's philanthropy but in for a penny in for a pound the
negroes led me to the banks of the mississippi where i was soon the
owner of both a sugar and a cotton plantation in addition to these
purchases i took shares in divers south-seamen owned a coral and
pearl fishery of my own and sent an agent with a proposition to
king tamamamaah to create a monopoly of sandalwood in our joint
behalf

the earth and all it contained assumed new glories in my eyes i had
fulfilled the essential condition of the political economists the
jurists the constitution-mongers and all the talents and
decency and had stakes in half the societies of the world i was
fit to govern i was fit to advise to dictate to most of the people
of christendom for i had taken a direct interest in their welfares
by making them my own twenty times was i about to jump into a post-
chaise and to gallop down to the rectory in order to lay my newborn
alliance with the species and all its attendant felicity at the
feet of anna but the terrible thought of monogamy and of its
sympathy-withering consequences as often stayed my course i wrote
to her weekly however making her the participator of a portion of
my happiness though i never had the satisfaction of receiving a
single line in reply

fairly emancipated from selfishness and pledged to the species i
now quitted england on a tour of philanthropical inspection i shall
not weary the reader with an account of my journeys over the beaten
tracks of the continent but transport him and myself at once to
paris in which city i arrived on the th of may anno domini
 i had seen much fancied myself improved and by constant
dwelling on my system saw its excellences as plainly as napoleon
saw the celebrated star which defied the duller vision of his uncle
the cardinal at the same time as usually happens with those who
direct all their energies to a given point the opinions originally
formed of certain portions of my theory began to undergo mutations
as nearer and more practical views pointed out inconsistencies and
exposed defects as regards anna in particular the quiet gentle
unobtrusive and yet distinct picture of womanly loveliness that was
rarely absent from my mind had for the past twelvemonth haunted me
with a constancy of argument that might have unsettled the newtonian
scheme of philosophy itself i already more than questioned whether
the benefit to be derived from the support of one so affectionate
and true would not fully counterbalance the disadvantage of a
concentration of interest so far as the sex was concerned this
growing opinion was fast getting to be conviction when i
encountered on the boulevards one day an old country neighbor of the
rector's who gave me the best account of the family adding after
descanting on the beauty and excellence of anna herself that the
dear girl had quite lately actually refused a peer of the realm who
enjoyed all the acknowledged advantages of youth riches birth
rank and a good name and who had selected her from a deep
conviction of her worth and of her ability to make any sensible man
happy as to my own power over the heart of anna i never entertained
a doubt she had betrayed it in a thousand ways and on a hundred
occasions nor had i been at all backward in letting her understand
how highly i valued her dear self although i had never yet screwed
up my resolution so high as distinctly to propose for her hand but
all my unsettled purposes became concentrated on hearing this
welcome intelligence and taking an abrupt leave of my old
acquaintance i hurried home and wrote the following letter

dear very dear nay dearest anna

i met your old neighbor this morning on the boulevards and during
an interview of an hour we did little else but talk of thee
although it has been my most ardent and most predominant wish to
open my heart to the whole species yet anna i fear i have loved
thee alone absence so far from expanding appears to contract my
affections too many of which centre in thy sweet form and excellent
virtues the remedy i proposed is insufficient and i begin to think
that matrimony alone can leave me master of sufficient freedom of
thought and action to turn the attention i ought to the rest of the
human race thou hast been with me in idea in the four corners of
the earth by sea and by land in dangers and in safety in all
seasons regions and situations and there is no sufficient reason
why those who are ever present in the spirit should be materially
separated thou hast only to say a word to whisper a hope to
breathe a wish and i will throw myself a repentant truant at thy
feet and implore thy pity when united however we will not lose
ourselves in the sordid and narrow paths of selfishness but come
forth again in company to acquire a new and still more powerful hold
on this beautiful creation of which by this act i acknowledge
thee to be the most divine portion

dearest dearest anna thine and the species

forever

john goldencalf

to miss etherington

if there was ever a happy fellow on earth it was myself when this
letter was written sealed and fairly despatched the die was cast
and i walked into the air a regenerated and an elastic being let
what might happen i was sure of anna her gentleness would calm my
irritability her prudence temper my energies her bland but
enduring affections soothe my soul i felt at peace with all around
me myself included and i found a sweet assurance of the wisdom of
the step i had just taken in the expanding sentiment if such were
my sensations now that every thought centred in anna what would
they not become when these personal transports were cooled by habit
and nature was left to the action of the ordinary impulses i began
to doubt of the infallibility of that part of my system which had
given me so much pain and to incline to the new doctrine that by
concentration on particular parts we come most to love the whole on
examination there was reason to question whether it was not on this
principle even that as an especial landholder i attained so great
an interest in my native island for while i certainly did not own
the whole of great britain i felt that i had a profound respect for
everything in it that was in any even the most remote manner
connected with my own particular possessions

a week flew by in delightful anticipations the happiness of this
short but heavenly period became so exciting so exquisite that i
was on the point of giving birth to an improvement on my theory or
rather on the theory of the political economists and constitution-
mongers for it is in fact theirs and not mine when the answer of
anna was received if anticipation be a state of so much happiness 
happiness being the great pursuit of man why not invent a purely
probationary condition of society why not change its elementary
features from positive to anticipating interests which would give
more zest to life and bestow felicity unimpaired by the dross of
realities i had determined to carry out this principle in practice
by an experiment and left the hotel to order an agent to advertise
and to enter into a treaty or two for some new investments without
the smallest intention of bringing them to a conclusion when the
porter delivered me the ardently expected letter i never knew what
would be the effect of taking a stake in society by anticipation
therefore the contents of anna's missive driving every subject that
was not immediately connected with the dear writer and with sad
realities completely out of my head it is not improbable however
that the new theory would have proved to be faulty for i have often
had occasion to remark that heirs in remainder for instance
manifest an hostility to the estate by carrying out the principle
of anticipation rather than any of that prudent respect for social
consequences to which the legislator looks with so much anxiety

the letter of anna was in the following words

good nay dear john

thy letter was put into my hands yesterday this is the fifth
answer i have commenced and you will therefore see that i do not
write without reflection i know thy excellent heart john better
than it is known to thyself it has either led thee to the discovery
of a secret of the last importance to thy fellow-creatures or it
has led thee cruelly astray an experiment so noble and so
praiseworthy ought not to be abandoned on account of a few momentary
misgivings concerning the result do not stay thy eagle flight at
the instant thou art soaring so near the sun should we both judge
it for our mutual happiness i can become thy wife at a future day
we are still young and there is no urgency for an immediate union
in the mean time i will endeavor to prepare myself to be the
companion of a philanthropist by practising on thy theory and by
expanding my own affections render myself worthy to be the wife of
one who has so large a stake in society and who loves so many and
so truly

thine imitator and friend

without change

anna etherington

to sir john goldencalf bart

ps you may perceive that i am in a state of improvement for i
have just refused the hand of lord m'dee because i found i loved
all his neighbors quite as well as i loved the young peer himself

ten thousand furies took possession of my soul in the shape of so
many demons of jealousy anna expanding her affections anna taking
any other stake in society than that i made sure she would accept
through me anna teaching herself to love more than one and that
one myself the thought was madness i did not believe in the
sincerity of her refusal of lord m'dee i ran for a copy of the
peerage for since my own elevation in life i regularly bought both
that work and the baronetage and turned to the page that contained
his name he was a scottish viscount who had just been created a
baron of the united kingdom and his age was precisely that of my
own here was a rival to excite distrust by a singular
contradiction in sentiments the more i dreaded his power to injure
me the more i undervalued his means while i fancied anna was
merely playing with me and had in secret made up her mind to be a
peeress i had no doubt that the subject of her choice was both ill-
favored and awkward and had cheek-bones like a tartar while
reading of the great antiquity of his family which reached
obscurity in the thirteenth century i set it down as established
that the first of his unknown predecessors was a bare-legged thief
and at the very moment that i imagined anna was smiling on him and
retracting her coquettish denial i could have sworn that he spoke
with an unintelligible border accent and that he had red hair

the torment of such pictures grew to be intolerable and i rushed
into the open air for relief how long or whither i wandered i know
not but on the morning of the following day i found i was seated in
a guinguette near the base of montmartre eagerly devouring a roll
and refreshing myself with sour wine when a little recovered from
the shock of discovering myself in a situation so novel for having
no investment in guinguettes i had not taken sufficient interest in
these popular establishments ever to enter one before i had
leisure to look about and survey the company some fifty frenchmen
of the laboring classes were drinking on every side and talking
with a vehemence of gesticulation and a clamor that completely
annihilated thought this then thought i is a scene of popular
happiness these creatures are excellent fellows enjoying
themselves on liquor that has not paid the city duty and perhaps i
may seize upon some point that favors my system among spirits so
frank and clamorous doubtless if any one among them is in
possession of any important social secret it will not fail to escape
him here from meditations of this philosophical character i was
suddenly aroused by a violent blow before me accompanied with an
exclamation in very tolerable english of the word

king

on the centre of the board which did the office of a table and
directly beneath my eyes lay a clenched fist of fearful dimensions
that in color and protuberances bore a good deal of resemblance to a
freshly unearthed jerusalem artichoke its sinews seemed to be
cracking with tension and the whole knob was so expressive of
intense pugnacity that my eyes involuntarily sought its owner's
face i had unconsciously taken my seat directly opposite a man
whose stature was nearly double that of the compact bustling
sputtering and sturdy little fellows who were bawling on every side
of us and whose skinny lips instead of joining in the noise were
so firmly compressed as to render the crevice of the mouth no more
strongly marked than a wrinkle in the brow of a man of sixty his
complexion was naturally fair but exposure had tanned the skin of
his face to the color of the crackle of a roasted pig those parts
which a painter would be apt to term the high lights being
indicated by touches of red nearly as bright as fourth-proof
brandy his eyes were small stern fiery and very gray and just
at the instant they met my admiring look they resembled two stray
coals that by some means had got separated from the body of adjacent
heat in the face he had a prominent well-shaped nose athwart
which the skin was stretched like leather in the process of being
rubbed down on the currier's bench and his ropy black hair was
carefully smoothed over his temples and brows in a way to show that
he was abroad on a holiday excursion

when our eyes met this singular-looking being gave me a nod of
friendly recognition for no better reason that i could discover
than the fact that i did not appear to be a frenchman did mortal
man ever listen to such fools captain he observed as if certain
we must think alike on the subject

really i did not attend to what was said there certainly is much
noise

i don't pretend to understand a word of what they are saying
myself but it sounds like thorough nonsense

my ear is not yet sufficiently acute to distinguish sense from
nonsense by mere intonation and sound but it would seem sir that
you speak english only

therein you are mistaken for being a great traveller i have been
compelled to look about me and as a nat'ral consequence i speak a
little of all languages i do not say that i use the foreign parts
of speech always fundamentally but then i worry through an idee so
as to make it legible and of use especially in the way of eating
and drinking as to french now i can say don-nez-me some van
and don-nez-vous some pan as well as the best of them but when
there are a dozen throats bawling at once as is the case with these
here chaps why one might as well go on the top of ape's hill and
hold a conversation with the people he will meet with there as to
pretend to hold a rational or a discussional discourse for my part
where there is to be a conversation i like every one to have his
turn keeping up the talk as it might be watch and watch but
among these frenchmen it is pretty much as if their idees had been
caged and the door being suddenly opened they fly out in a flock
just for the pleasure of saying they are at liberty

i now perceived that my companion was a reflecting being his
ratiocination being connected by regular links and that he did not
boost his philosophy on the leaping-staff of impulse like most of
those who were sputtering and arguing and wrangling with untiring
lungs in all corners of the guinguette i frankly proposed
therefore that we should quit the place and walk into the road
where our discourse would be less disturbed and consequently more
satisfactory the proposal was well received and we left the
brawlers walking by the outer boulevards towards my hotel in the
rue de rivoli by the way of the champs elysees




chapter vii

touching an amphibious animal a special introduction and its
consequences


i soon took an interest in my new acquaintance he was
communicative shrewd and peculiar and though apt to express
himself quaintly it was always with the pith of one who had seen a
great deal of at least one portion of his fellow-creatures the
conversation under such circumstances did not flag on the
contrary it soon grew more interesting by the stranger's beginning
to touch on his private interests he told me that he was a mariner
who had been cast ashore by one of the accidents of his calling
and by way of cutting in a word in his own favor he gave me to
understand that he had seen a great deal more especially of that
castle of his fellow-creatures who like himself live by frequenting
the mighty deep

i am very happy i said to have met with a stranger who can give
me information touching an entire class of human beings with whom i
have as yet had but little communion in order that we may improve
the occasion to the utmost i propose that we introduce ourselves to
each other at once and swear an eternal friendship or at least
until we may find it convenient to dispense with the obligation

for my part i am one who likes the friendship of a dog better than
his enmity returned my companion with a singleness of purpose
that left him no disposition to waste his breath in idle
compliments i accept the offer therefore with all my heart and
this the more readily because you are the only one i have met for a
week who can ask me how i do without saying come on cong portez-
vous being used to meet with squalls however i shall accept your
offer under the last condition named

i liked the stranger's caution it denoted a proper care of
character and furnished a proof of responsibility the condition
was therefore accepted on my part as frankly as it had been urged on
his

and now sir i added when we had shaken each other very
cordially by the hand may i presume to ask your name

i am called noah and i don't care who knows it i am not ashamed
of either of my names whatever else i may be ashamed of

noah 

poke at your service he pronounced the word slowly and very
distinctly as if what he had just said of his self-confidence were
true as i had afterward occasion to take his signature i shall at
once give it in the proper form capt noah poke

of what part of england are you a native mr poke

i believe i may say of the new parts

i do not know that any portion of the island was so designated
will you have the good-nature to explain yourself

i'm a native of stunin'tun in the state of connecticut in old new
england my parents being dead i was sent to sea a four-year-old
and here i am walking about the kingdom of france without a cent in
my pocket a shipwrecked mariner hard as my lot is to say the
truth i'd about as leave starve as live by speaking their d d
lingo

shipwrecked a mariner starving and a yankee

all that and maybe more too though by your leave commodore
we'll drop the last title i'm proud enough to call myself a yankee
but my back is apt to get up when i hear an englishman use the word
we are yet friends and it may be well enough to continue so until
some good comes of it to one or other of the parties

i ask your pardon mr poke and will not offend again have you
circumnavigated the globe

captain poke snapped his fingers in pure contempt of the simplicity
of the question

has the moon ever sailed round the arth look here a moment
commodore he took from his pocket an apple of which he had been
munching half a-dozen during the walk and held it up to view draw
your lines which way you will on this sphere crosswise or
lengthwise up or down zigzag or parpendic'lar and you will not
find more traverses than i've worked about the old ball

by land as well as by sea

why as to the land i've had my share of that too for it has
been my hard fortune to run upon it when a softer bed would have
given a more quiet nap this is just the present difficulty with me
for i am now tacking about among these frenchmen in order to get
afloat again like an alligator floundering in the mud i lost my
schooner on the northeast coast of russia somewhere hereabouts
pointing to the precise spot on the apple we were up there trading
in skins-and finding no means of reaching home by the road i'd come
and smelling salt water down hereaway i've been shaping my course
westward for the last eighteen months steering as near as might be
directly athwart europe and asia and here i am at last within two
days run of havre which is if i can get good yankee planks
beneath me once more within some eighteen or twenty days run of
home

you allow me then to call the planks yankee

call em what you please commodore though i should prefar to call
em the debby and dolly of stunin'tun to anything else for that
was the name of the craft i lost well the best of us are but
frail and the longest-winded man is no dolphin to swim with his
head under water

pray mr poke permit me to ask where you learned to speak the
english language with so much purity

stunin'tun i never had a mouthful of schooling but what i got at
home it's all homespun i make no boast of scholarship but as for
navigating or for finding my way about the arth i'll turn my back
on no man unless it be to leave him behind now we have people with
us that think a great deal of their geometry and astronomies but i
hold to no such slender threads my way is when there is occasion
to go anywhere to settle it well in my mind as to the place and
then to make as straight a wake as natur will allow taking little
account of charts which are as apt to put you wrong as right and
when they do get you into a scrape it's a smasher depend on
yourself and human natur is my rule though i admit there is some
accommodation in a compass particularly in cold weather

cold weather i do not well comprehend the distinction

why i rather conclude that one's scent gets to be dullish in a
frost but this may be no more than a conceit after all for the two
times i've been wrecked were in summer and both the accidents
happened by sheer dint of hard blowing and in broad daylight when
nothing human short of a change of wind could have saved us

and you prefer this peculiar sort of navigation

to all others especially in the sealing business which is my raal
occupation it's the very best way in the world to discover islands
and everybody knows that we sealers are always on the lookout for
su'thin of that sort

will you suffer me to inquire captain poke how many times you
have doubled cape horn

my navigator threw a quick jealous glance at me as if he
distrusted the nature of the question

why that is neither here nor there perhaps i don't double either
of the capes perhaps i do i get into the south sea with my craft
and it's of no great moment how it's done a skin is worth just as
much in the market though the furrier may not happen to have a
glossary of the road it has travelled

a glossary

what matters a signification commodore when people understand
each other this overland journey has put me to my wits for you
will understand that i've had to travel among natives that cannot
speak a syllable of the homespun so i brought the schooner's
dictionary with me as a sort of terrestrial almanac and i fancied
that as they spoke gibberish to me the best way was to give it to
them back again as near as might be in their own coin hoping i
might hit on su'thin to their liking by this means i've come to be
rather more voluble than formerly

the idea was happy

no doubt it was as is just evinced but having given you a pretty
clear insight into my natur and occupation it is time that i ask a
few questions of you this is a business you must know at which we
do a good deal at stunin'tun and at which we are commonly thought
to be handy

put your questions captain poke i hope the answers will be
satisfactory

your name

john goldencalf by the favor of his majesty sir john goldencalf
baronet 

sir john goldencalf by the favor of his majesty a baronet is
baronet a calling or what sort of a crittur or thing is it

it is my rank in the kingdom to which i belong

i begin to understand what you mean among your nation mankind is
what we call stationed like a ship's people that are called to go
about you have a certain berth in that kingdom of yours much as i
should have in a sealing schooner

exactly so and i presume you will allow that order and propriety
and safety result from this method among mariners

no doubt no doubt we station anew however each v'yage
according to experience i'm not so sure that it would do to take
even the cook from father to son or we might have a pretty mess of
it

here the sealer commenced a series of questions which he put with a
vigor and perseverance that i fear left me without a single fact of
my life unrevealed except those connected with the sacred sentiment
that bound me to anna and which were far too hallowed to escape me
even under the ordeal of a stunin'tun inquisitor in short finding
that i was nearly helpless in such hands i made a merit of
necessity and yielded up my secrets as wood in a vice discharges
its moisture it was scarcely possible that a mind like mine
subjected to the action of such a pair of moral screws should not
yield some hints touching its besetting propensities the captain
seized this clew and he went at the theory like a bulldog at the
muzzle of an ox

to oblige him therefore i entered at some length into an
explanation of my system after the general remarks that were
necessary to give a stranger an insight into its leading principles
i gave him to understand that i had long been looking for one like
him for a purpose that shall now be explained to the reader i had
entertained some negotiations with tamahamaah and had certain
investments in the pearl and whale fisheries it is true but on the
whole my relations with all that portion of mankind who inhabit the
islands of the pacific the northwest coast of america and the
northeast coast of the old continent were rather loose and
generally in an unsettled and vague condition and it appeared to me
that i had been singularly favored in having a man so well adapted
to their regeneration thrown as it were by providence and in a
manner so unusual directly in my way i now frankly proposed
therefore to fit out an expedition that should be partly of trade
and partly of discovery in order to expand my interests in this new
direction and to place my new acquaintance at its head ten minutes
of earnest explanation on my part sufficed to put my companion in
possession of the leading features of the plan when i had ended
this direct appeal to his love of enterprise i was answered by the
favorite exclamation of 

king

i do not wonder captain poke that your admiration breaks out in
this manner for i believe few men fairly enter into the beauty of
this benevolent system who are not struck equally with its grandeur
and its simplicity may i count on your assistance

this is a new idee sir goldencalf 

sir john goldencalf if you please sir

a new idee sir john goldencalf and it needs circumspection
circumspection in a bargain is the certain way to steer clear of
misunderstandings you wish a navigator to take your craft let her
be what she will into unknown seas and i wish naturally to make
a straight course for stunin'tun you see the bargain is in apogee
from the start

money is no consideration with me captain poke

well this is an idee that has brought many a more difficult
contract at once into perigee sir john goldencalf money is always
a considerable consideration with me and i may say also just now
it is rather more so than usual but when a gentleman clears the way
as handsomely as you have now done any bargain may be counted as a
good deal more than half made

a few explicit explanations disposed of this part of the subject
and captain poke accepted of my terms in the spirit of frankness
with which they were made perhaps his decision was quickened by an
offer of twenty napoleons which i did not neglect making on the
spot amicable and in some respects confidential relations were now
established between my new acquaintance and myself and we pursued
our walk discussing the details necessary to the execution of our
project after an hour or two passed in this manner i invited my
companion to go to my hotel meaning that he should partake of my
board until we could both depart for england where it was my
intention to purchase without delay a vessel for the contemplated
voyage in which i also had decided to embark in person

we were obliged to make our way through the throng that usually
frequents the lower part of the champs elysees during the season of
good weather and towards the close of the day this task was nearly
over when my attention was particularly drawn to a group that was
just entering the place of general resort apparently with the
design of adding to the scene of thoughtlessness and amusement but
as i am now approaching the most material part of this extraordinary
work it will be proper to reserve the opening for a new chapter




chapter viii

an introduction to four new characters some touches of philosophy
and a few capital thoughts on political economy


the group which drew my attention was composed of six individuals
two of which were animals of the genus homo or what is vulgarly
termed man and the remainder were of the order primates and of the
class mammalia or what in common parlance are called monkeys

 the first were savoyards and may be generally described as being
unwashed ragged and carnivorous in color swarthy in lineaments
and expression avaricious and shrewd and in appetites voracious
the latter were of the common species of the usual size and of
approved gravity there were two of each sex being very equally
paired as to years and external advantages

the monkeys were all habited with more or less of the ordinary
attire of our modern european civilization but peculiar care had
been taken with the toilet of the senior of the two males this
individual had on the coat of a hussar a cut that would have given
a particular part of his body a more military contour than comported
with his real character were it not for a red petticoat that was
made shorter than common less however with a view to show a
pretty foot and ankle than to leave the nether limbs at liberty to
go through with certain extravagant efforts which the savoyards were
unmercifully exacting from his natural agility he wore a spanish
hat decorated with a few bedraggled feathers a white cockade and
a wooden sword in addition to the latter he carried in his hand a
small broom

observing that my attention was strongly attracted to this party
the ill-favored savoyards immediately commenced a series of
experiments in saltation with the sole view beyond a question to
profit by my curiosity the inoffensive victims of this act of
brutal tyranny submitted with a patience worthy of the profoundest
philosophy meeting the wishes of their masters with a readiness and
dexterity that was beyond all praise one swept the earth another
leaped on the back of a dog a third threw himself head-over-heels
again and again without a murmur and the fourth moved gracefully to
and fro like a young girl in a quadrille all this might have
passed without calling for particular remark since alas the
spectacle is only too common were it not for certain eloquent
appeals that were made to me through the eyes by the individual in
the hussar jacket his look was rarely averted from my face for a
moment and in this way a silent communion was soon established
between us i observed that his gravity was indomitable nothing
could elicit a smile or a change of countenance obedient to the
whip of his brutal master he never refused the required leap for
minutes at a time his legs and petticoat described confused circles
in the air appearing to have taken a final leave of the earth but
the effort ended he invariably descended to the ground with a quiet
dignity and composure that showed how little the inward monkey
partook of the antics of the outward animal drawing my companion a
little aside i ventured to suggest a few thoughts to him on the
subject

really captain poke it appears to me there is great injustice in
the treatment of these poor creatures i said what right have
these two foul-looking blackguards to seize upon beings much more
interesting to the eye and i dare say far more intellectual than
themselves and cause them to throw their legs about in this
extravagant manner under the penalty of stripes and without regard
to their feelings or their convenience i say sir the measure
appears to me intolerably oppressive and it calls for prompt
redress

king

king or subject it does not alter the moral deformity of the act
what have these innocent beings done that they should be subjected
to this disgrace are they not flesh and blood like ourselves do
they not approach nearer to our form and for aught we know to the
contrary to our reason than any other animal and is it tolerable
that our nearest imitations our very cousins should be thus dealt
by are they dogs that they are treated like dogs

why to my notion sir john there isn't a dog on arth that can
take such a summerset their flapjacks are quite extraor'nary

yes sir and more than extraordinary they are oppressive place
yourself mr poke for a single instant in the situation of one of
these persons fancy that you had a hussar jacket squeezed upon your
brawny shoulders a petticoat placed over your lower extremities a
spanish hat with bedraggled feathers set upon your head a wooden
sword stuck at your side and a broom put into your hand and that
these two savoyards were to menace you with stripes unless you
consented to throw summersets for the amusement of strangers i only
ask you to make the case your own sir and then say what course you
would take and what you would do

i would lick both of these young blackguards sir john without
remorse break the sword and broom over their heads kick their
sensibilities till they couldn't see and take my course for
stunin'tun where i belong

yes sir this might do with the savoyards who are young and
feeble 

twouldn't alter the case much if two of these frenchmen were in
their places put in the captain glaring wolfishly about him to
be plain with you sir john goldencalf being human i'd submit to
no such monkey tricks

do not use the term reproachfully mr poke i entreat of you we
call these animals monkeys it is true but we do not know what they
call themselves man is merely an animal and you must very well
know 

harkee sir john interrupted the captain i'm no botanist and
do not pretend to more schooling than a sealer has need of for
finding his way about the arth but as for a man's being an animal
i just wish to ask you now if in your judgment a hog is also an
animal

beyond a doubt and fleas and toads and sea-serpents and
lizards and water-devils we are all neither more nor less than
animals

well if a hog is an animal i am willing to allow the
relationship for in the course of my experience which is not
small i have met with men that you might have mistaken for hogs in
everything but the bristles the snout and the tail i'll never
deny what i've seen with my own eyes though i suffer for it and
therefore i admit that hogs being animals it is more than likely
that some men must be animals too

we call these interesting beings monkeys but how do we know that
they do not return the compliment and call us in their own
particular dialect something quite as offensive it would become
our species to manifest a more equitable and philosophical spirit
and to consider these interesting strangers as an unfortunate family
which has fallen into the hands of brutes and which is in every way
entitled to our commiseration and our active interference hitherto
i have never sufficiently stimulated my sympathies for the animal
world by any investment in quadrupeds but it is my intention to
write to-morrow to my english agent to purchase a pack of hounds and
a suitable stud of horses and by way of quickening so laudable a
resolution i shall forthwith make propositions to the savoyards for
the speedy emancipation of this family of amiable foreigners the
slave-trade is an innocent pastime compared to the cruel oppression
that the gentleman in the spanish hat in particular is compelled
to endure

king

he may be a king sure enough in his own country captain poke a
fact that would add tenfold agony to his unmerited sufferings

hereupon i proceeded without more ado to open a negotiation with the
savoyards the judicious application of a few napoleons soon brought
about a happy understanding between the contracting parties when
the savoyards transferred to my hands the strings which confined
their vassals as the formal and usual acknowledgment of the right
of ownership committing the three others to the keeping of mr
poke i led the individual in the hussar jacket a little on one
side and raising my hat to show that i was superior to the vulgar
feelings of feudal superiority i addressed him briefly in the
following words

although i have ostensibly bought the right which these savoyards
professed to have in your person and services i seize an early
occasion to inform you that virtually you are now free as we are
among a people accustomed to see your race in subjection however
it may not be prudent to proclaim the nature of the present
transaction lest there might be some further conspiracies against
your natural rights we will retire to my hotel forthwith
therefore where your future happiness shall be the subject of our
more mature and of our united deliberations

the respectable stranger in the hussar jacket heard me with
inimitable gravity and self-command until in the warmth of feeling
i raised an arm in earnest gesticulation when most probably
overcome by the emotions of delight that were naturally awakened in
his bosom by this sudden change in his fortune he threw three
summersets or flapjacks as captain poke had quaintly designated
his evolutions in such rapid succession as to render it for a
moment a matter of doubt whether nature had placed his head or his
heels uppermost

making a sign for captain poke to follow i now took my way directly
to the rue de rivoli we were attended by a constantly increasing
crowd until the gate of the hotel was fairly entered and glad was i
to see my charge safely housed for there were abundant indications
of another design upon their rights in the taunts and ridicule of
the living mass that rolled up as it were upon our heels on
reaching my own apartments a courier who had been waiting my
return and who had just arrived express from england put a packet
into my hands stating that it came from my principal english agent
hasty orders were given to attend to the comfort and wants of
captain poke and the strangers orders that were in no danger of
being neglected since sir john goldencalf with the reputed annual
revenue of three millions of francs had unlimited credit with all
the inhabitants of the hotel and i hurried into my cabinet and sat
down to the eager perusal of the different communications

alas there was not a line from anna the obdurate girl still
trifled with my misery and in revenge i entertained a momentary
resolution of adopting the notions of mahmoud in order to qualify
myself to set up a harem

the letters were from a variety of correspondents embracing many of
those who were entrusted with the care of my interests in very
opposite quarters of the world half an hour before i had been dying
to open more intimate relations with the interesting strangers but
my thoughts instantly took a new direction and i soon found that
the painful sentiments i had entertained touching their welfare and
happiness were quite lost in the newly awakened interests that lay
before me it is in this simple manner no doubt that the system to
which i am a convert effects no small part of its own great
purposes no sooner does any one interest grow painful by excess
than a new claim arises to divert the thoughts a new demand is made
on the sensibilities and by lowering our affections from the
intensity of selfishness to the more bland and equable feeling of
impartiality forms that just and generous condition of the mind at
which the political economists aim when they dilate on the glories
and advantages of their favorite theory of the social stake

in this happy frame of mind i fell to reading the letters with
avidity and with the godlike determination to reverence providence
and to do justice fiat justitia ruat coelum

the first epistle was from the agent of the principal west india
estate he acquainted me with the fact that all hopes from the
expected crop were destroyed by a hurricane and he begged that i
would furnish the means necessary to carry on the affairs of the
plantation until another season might repair the loss priding
myself on punctuality as a man of business before i broke another
seal a letter was written to a banker in london requesting him to
supply the necessary credits and to notify the agents in the west
indies of the circumstance as he was a member of parliament i
seized the occasion also to press upon him the necessity of
government's introducing some early measure for the protection of
the sugar-growers a most meritorious class of his fellow-subjects
and one whose exposures and actual losses called loudly for relief
of this nature as i closed the letter i could not help dwelling
with complacency on the zeal and promptitude with which i had acted-
-the certain proof of the usefulness of the theory of investments

the second communication was from the manager of an east india
property that very happily came with its offering to fill the
vacuum left by the failure of the crops just mentioned sugar was
likely to be a drug in the peninsula and my correspondent stated
that the cost of transportation being so much greater than from the
other colonies this advantage would be entirely lost unless
government did something to restore the east indian to his natural
equality i enclosed this letter in one to my lord say and do who
was in the ministry asking him in the most laconic and pointed
terms whether it were possible for the empire to prosper when one
portion of it was left in possession of exclusive advantages to the
prejudice of all the others as this question was put with a truly
british spirit i hope it had some tendency to open the eyes of his
majesty's ministers for much was shortly after said both in the
journals and in parliament on the necessity of protecting our east
indian fellow-subjects and of doing natural justice by establishing
the national prosperity on the only firm basis that of free trade

the next letter was from the acting partner of a large manufacturing
house to which i had advanced quite half the capital in order to
enter into a sympathetic communion with the cotton-spinners the
writer complained heavily of the import duty on the raw material
made some poignant allusions to the increasing competition on the
continent and in america and pretty clearly intimated that the lord
of the manor of householder ought to make himself felt by the
administration in a question of so much magnitude to the nation on
this hint i spake i sat down on the spot and wrote a long letter to
my friend lord pledge in which i pointed out to him the danger that
threatened our political economy that we were imitating the false
theories of the americans the countrymen of captain poke that
trade was clearly never so prosperous as when it was the most
successful that success depended on effort and effort was the most
efficient when the least encumbered and in short that as it was
self-evident a man would jump farther without being in foot-irons
or strike harder without being hand-cuffed so it was equally
apparent that a merchant would make a better bargain for himself
when he could have things all his own way than when his enterprise
and industry were shackled by the impertinent and selfish
interposition of the interests of others in conclusion there was an
eloquent description of the demoralizing consequences of smuggling
and a pungent attack on the tendencies of taxation in general i
have written and said some good things in my time as several of my
dependents have sworn to me in a way that even my natural modesty
cannot repudiate but i shall be excused for the weakness if i now
add that i believe this letter to lord pledge contained some as
clever points as anything i remember in their way the last
paragraph in particular being positively the neatest and the best
turned moral i ever produced

letter fourth was from the steward of the householder estate he
spoke of the difficulty of getting the rents a difficulty that he
imputed altogether to the low price of corn he said that it would
soon be necessary to relet certain farms and he feared that the
unthinking cry against the corn-laws would affect the conditions it
was incumbent on the landed interest to keep an eye on the popular
tendencies as respected this subject for any material variation
from the present system would lower the rental of all the grain-
growing counties in england thirty per cent at least at a blow he
concluded with a very hard rap at the agrarians a party that was
just coming a little into notice in great britain and by a very
ingenious turn in which he completely demonstrated that the
protection of the landlord and the support of the protestant
religion were indissolubly connected there was also a vigorous
appeal to the common sense of the subject on the danger to be
apprehended by the people from themselves which he treated in a way
that a little more expanded would have made a delightful homily on
the rights of man

i believe i meditated on the contents of this letter fully an hour
its writer john dobbs was as worthy and upright a fellow as ever
breathed and i could not but admire the surprising knowledge of men
which shone through every line he had indited something must be
done it was clear and at length i determined to take the bull by
the horns and to address mr huskisson at once as the shortest way
of coming at the evil he was the political sponsor for all the new
notions on the subject of our foreign mercantile policy and by
laying before him in a strong point of view the fatal consequences
of carrying his system to extremes i hoped something might yet be
done for the owners of real estate the bones and sinews of the
land

i shall just add in this place that mr huskisson sent me a very
polite and a very statesman-like reply in which he disclaimed any
intention of meddling improperly with british interests in any way
that taxation was necessary to our system and of course every
nation was the best judge of its own means and resources but that
he merely aimed at the establishment of just and generous
principles by which nations that had no occasion for british
measures should not unhandsomely resort to them and that certain
external truths should stand like so many well-constructed tubs
each on its own bottom i must say i was pleased with this attention
from a man generally reputed as clever as mr huskisson and from
that time i became a convert to most of his opinions

the next communication that i opened was from the overseer of the
estate in louisiana who informed me that the general aspect of
things in that quarter of the world was favorable but the smallpox
had found its way among the negroes and the business of the
plantation would immediately require the services of fifteen able-
bodied men with the usual sprinkling of women and children he
added that the laws of america prohibited the further importation of
blacks from any country without the limits of the union but that
there was a very pretty and profitable internal trade in the
article and that the supply might be obtained in sufficient season
either from the carolinas virginia or maryland he admitted
however that there was some choice between the different stocks of
these several states and that some discretion might be necessary in
making the selection the negro of the carolinas was the most used
to the cotton-field had less occasion for clothes and it had been
proved by experiment could be fattened on red herrings while on
the other hand the negro farther north had the highest instinct
could sometimes reason and that he had even been known to preach
when he had got as high up as philadelphia he much affected also
bacon and poultry perhaps it might be well to purchase samples of
lots from all the different stocks in market

in reply i assented to the latter idea suggesting the expediency of
getting one or two of the higher castes from the north i had no
objection to preaching provided they preached work but i cautioned
the overseer particularly against schismatics preaching in the
abstract could do no harm all depending on doctrine

this advice was given as the result of much earnest observation
those european states that had the most obstinately resisted the
introduction of letters i had recently had occasion to remark were
changing their systems and were about to act on the principle of
causing fire to fight fire they were fast having recourse to
school-books using no other precaution than the simple expedient of
writing them themselves by this ingenious invention poison was
converted into food and truths of all classes were at once put
above the dangers of disputations and heresies

having disposed of the louisianian i very gladly turned to the
opening of the sixth seal the letter was from the efficient trustee
of a company to whose funds i had largely contributed by way of
making an investment in charity it had struck me a short time
previously to quitting home that interests positive as most of
those i had embarked in had a tendency to render the spirit worldly
and i saw no other check to such an evil than by seeking for some
association with the saints in order to set up a balance against
the dangerous propensity a lucky occasion offered through the wants
of the philo-african-anti-compulsion-free-labor society whose
meritorious efforts were about to cease for the want of the great
charity-power gold a draft for five thousand pounds had obtained
me the honor of being advertised as a shareholder and a patron and
i know not why but it certainly caused me to inquire into the
results with far more interest than i had ever before felt in any
similar institution perhaps this benevolent anxiety arose from that
principle in our nature which induces us to look after whatever has
been our own as long as any part of it can be seen

the principal trustee of the philo-african-anti-compulsion-free-
labor society now wrote to state that some of the speculations which
had gone pari passu with the charity had been successful and that
the shareholders were by the fundamental provisions of the
association entitled to a dividend but how often that awkward
word stands between the cup and the lip but that he was of opinion
the establishment of a new factory near a point where the slavers
most resorted and where gold-dust and palm-oil were also to be had
in the greatest quantities and consequently at the lowest prices
would equally benefit trade and philanthropy that by a judicious
application of our means these two interests might be made to see-
saw very cleverly as cause and effect effect and cause that the
black man would be spared an incalculable amount of misery the
white man a grievous burden of sin and the particular agents of so
manifest a good might quite reasonably calculate on making at the
very least forty per cent per annum on their money besides having
all their souls saved in the bargain of course i assented to a
proposition so reasonable in itself and which offered benefits so
plausible

the next epistle was from the head of a great commercial house in
spain in which i had taken some shares and whose interests had been
temporarily deranged by the throes of the people in their efforts to
obtain redress for real or imaginary wrongs my correspondent showed
a proper indignation on the occasion and was not sparing in his
language whenever he was called to speak of popular tumults what
do the wretches wish he asked with much point our lives as well
as our property ah my dear sir this bitter fact impresses us all
by us he meant the mercantile interests with the importance of
strong executives where should we have been but for the bayonets of
the king or what would have become of our altars our firesides
and our persons had it not pleased god to grant us a monarch
indomitable in will brave in spirit and quick in action i wrote
a proper answer of congratulation and turned to the next epistle
which was the last of the communications

the eighth letter was from the acting head of another commercial
house in new york united states of america or the country of
captain poke where it would seem the president by a decided
exercise of his authority had drawn upon himself the execrations of
a large portion of the commercial interests of the country since
the effect of the measure right or wrong as a legitimate
consequence or not by hook or by crook had been to render money
scarce there is no man so keen in his philippics so acute in
discovering and so prompt in analyzing facts so animated in his
philosophy and so eloquent in his complaints as your debtor when
money unexpectedly gets to be scarce credit comfort bones
sinews marrow and all appear to depend on the result and it is no
wonder that under so lively impressions men who have hitherto been
content to jog on in the regular and quiet habits of barter should
suddenly start up into logicians politicians aye or even into
magicians such had been the case with my present correspondent who
seemed to know and to care as little in general of the polity of his
own country as if he had never been in it but who now was ready to
split hairs with a metaphysician and who could not have written
more complacently of the constitution if he had even read it my
limits will not allow an insertion of the whole letter but one or
two of its sentences shall be given is it tolerable my dear sir
he went on to say that the executive of any country i will not
say merely of our own should possess or exercise even admitting
that he does possess them such unheard of powers our condition is
worse than that of the mussulmans who in losing their money usually
lose their heads and are left in a happy insensibility to their
sufferings but alas there is an end of the much boasted liberty
of america the executive has swallowed up all the other branches of
the government and the next thing will be to swallow up us our
altars our firesides and our persons will shortly be invaded and
i much fear that my next letter will be received by you long after
all correspondence shall be prohibited every means of communication
cut off and we ourselves shall be precluded from writing by being
chained like beasts of burden to the car of a bloody tyrant then
followed as pretty a string of epithets as i remember to have heard
from the mouth of the veriest shrew at billingsgate

i could not but admire the virtue of the social-stake system
which kept men so sensibly alive to all their rights let them live
where they would or under what form of government which was so
admirably suited to sustain truth and render us just in reply i
sent back epithet for epithet echoed all the groans of my
correspondent and railed as became a man who was connected with a
losing concern

this closed my correspondence for the present and i arose wearied
with my labors and yet greatly rejoicing in their fruits it was
now late but excitement prevented sleep and before retiring for
the night i could not help looking in upon my guests captain poke
had gone to a room in another part of the hotel but the family of
amiable strangers were fast asleep in the antechamber they had
supped heartily as i was assured and were now indulging in a happy
but temporary oblivion to use an improved expression of all their
wrongs satisfied with this state of things i now sought my own
pillow or according to a favorite phrase of mr noah poke i also
turned in




chapter ix

the commencement of wonders which are the more extraordinary on
account of their truth


i dare say my head had been on the pillow fully an hour before sleep
closed my eyes during this time i had abundant occasion to
understand the activity of what are called the busy thoughts mine
were feverish glowing and restless they wandered over a wild
field one that included anna with her beauty her mild truth her
womanly softness and her womanly cruelty captain poke and his
peculiar opinions the amiable family of quadrupeds and their
wounded sensibilities the excellences of the social-stake system
and in short most of that which i had seen and heard during the
last four-and-twenty hours when sleep did tardily arrive it
overtook me at the very moment that i had inwardly vowed to forget
my heartless mistress and to devote the remainder of my life to the
promulgation of the doctrine of the expansive-super-human-
generalized-affection-principle to the utter exclusion of all
narrow and selfish views and in which i resolved to associate
myself with mr poke as with one who had seen a great deal of this
earth and its inhabitants without narrowing down his sympathies in
favor of any one place or person in particular stunin'tun and
himself very properly excepted

it was broad daylight when i awoke on the following morning my
spirits were calmed by rest and my nerves had been soothed by the
balmy freshness of the atmosphere it appeared that my valet had
entered and admitted the morning air and then had withdrawn as
usual to await the signal of the bell before he presumed to
reappear i lay many minutes in delicious repose enjoying the
periodical return of life and reason bringing with it the pleasures
of thought and its ten thousand agreeable associations the
delightful reverie into which i was insensibly dropping was
however ere long arrested by low murmuring and as i thought
plaintive voices at no great distance from my own bed seating
myself erect i listened intently and with a good deal of surprise
for it was not easy to imagine whence sounds so unusual for that
place and hour could proceed the discourse was earnest and even
animated but it was carried on in so low a tone that it would have
been utterly inaudible but for the deep quiet of the hotel
occasionally a word reached my ear and i was completely at fault in
endeavoring to ascertain even the language that it was in neither
of the five great european tongues i was certain for all these i
either spoke or read and there were particular sounds and
inflections that induced me to think that it savored of the most
ancient of the two classics it is true that the prosody of these
dialects at the same time that it is a shibboleth of learning is a
disputed point the very sounds of the vowels even being a matter of
national convention the latin word dux for instance being ducks
in england docks in italy and dukes in france yet there is a je
ne sais quoi a delicacy in the auricular taste of a true scholar
that will rarely lead him astray when his ears are greeted with
words that have been used by demosthenes or cicero footnote or
chichero or kickero whichever may happen to suit the prejudices of
the reader in the present instance i distinctly heard the word my-
bom-y-nos-fos-kom-i-ton which i made sure was a verb in the dual
number and second person of a greek root but of a signification
that i could not on the instant master but which beyond a question
every scholar will recognize as having a strong analogy to a well-
known line in homer if i was puzzled with the syllables that
accidentally reached me i was no less perplexed with the
intonations of the voices of the different speakers while it was
easy to understand they were of the two sexes they had no direct
affinity to the mumbling sibilations of the english the vehement
monotony of the french the gagging sonorousness of the spaniards
the noisy melody of the italians the ear-splitting octaves of the
germans or the undulating head-over-heels enunciation of the
countrymen of my particular acquaintance captain noah poke of all
the living languages of which i had any knowledge the resemblance
was nearer to the danish and swedish than to any other but i much
doubted at the time i first heard the syllables and still question
if there is exactly such a word as my-bom-y-nos-fos-kom-i-ton to be
found in even either of those tongues i could no longer support the
suspense the classical and learned doubts that beset me grew
intensely painful and arising with the greatest caution in order
not to alarm the speakers i prepared to put an end to them all by
the simple and natural process of actual observation

the voices came from the antechamber the door of which was slightly
open throwing on a dressing-gown and thrusting my feet into
slippers i moved on tiptoe to the aperture and placed my eye in
such a situation as enabled me to command a view of the persons of
those who were still earnestly talking in the adjoining room all
surprise vanished the moment i found that the four monkeys were
grouped in a corner of the apartment where they were carrying on a
very animated dialogue the two oldest of the party a male and a
female being the principal speakers it was not to be expected that
even a graduate of oxford although belonging to a sect so
proverbial for classical lore that many of them knew nothing else
could at the first hearing decide upon the analogies and character
of a tongue that is so little cultivated even in that ancient sea of
learning although i had now certainly a direct clew to the root of
the dialect of the speakers i found it quite impossible to get any
useful acquaintance with the general drift of what was passing among
them as they were my guests however and might possibly be in want
of some of the conveniences that were necessary to their habits or
might even be suffering under still graver embarrassments i
conceived it to be a duty to waive the ordinary usages of society
and at once offer whatever it was in my power to bestow at the risk
of interrupting concerns that they might possibly wish to consider
private using the precaution therefore to make a little noise as
the best means of announcing my approach the door was gently
opened and i presented myself to view at first i was a little at a
loss in what manner to address the strangers but believing that a
people who spoke a language so difficult of utterance and so rich as
that i had just heard like those who use dialects derived from the
slavonian root were most probably the masters of all others and
remembering moreover that french was a medium of thought among all
polite people i determined to have recourse to that
tongue messieurs et mesdames i said inclining my body in
salutation mille pardons four cette intrusion feu convenable but
as i am writing in english it may be well to translate the speeches
as i proceed although i abandon with regret the advantage of going
through them literally and in the appropriate dialect in which they
were originally spoken

gentlemen and ladies i said inclining my body in salutation i
ask a thousand pardons for this inopportune intrusion on your
retirement but overhearing a few of what i much fear are but too
well-grounded complaints touching the false position in which you
are placed as the occupant of this apartment and in that light your
host i have ventured to approach with no other desire than the
wish that you would make me the repository of all your griefs in
order if possible that they may be repaired as soon as
circumstances shall in any manner allow

the strangers were very naturally a little startled at my unexpected
appearance and at the substance of what i had just said i observed
that the two ladies were apparently in some slight degree even
distressed the younger turning her head on one side in maiden
modesty while the elder a duenna sort of looking person dropped
her eyes to the floor but succeeded in better maintaining her self-
possession and gravity the eldest of the two gentlemen approached
me with dignified composure after a moment of hesitation and
returning my salute by waving his tail with singular grace and
decorum he answered as follows i may as well state in this place
that he spoke the french about as well as an englishman who has
lived long enough on the continent to fancy he can travel in the
provinces without being detected for a foreigner au reste his
accent was slightly russian and his enunciation whistling and
harmonious the females especially in some of the lower keys of
their voices made sounds not unlike the sighing tones of the eolian
harp it was really a pleasure to hear them but i have often had
occasion to remark that in every country but one which i do not
care to name the language when uttered by the softer sex takes new
charms and is rendered more delightful to the ear

sir said the stranger when he had done waving his tail i
should do great injustice to my feelings and to the monikin
character in general were i to neglect expressing some small
portion of the gratitude i feel on the present occasion destitute
houseless insulted wanderers and captives fortune has at length
shed a ray of happiness on our miserable condition and hope begins
to shine through the cloud of our distress like a passing gleam of
the sun from my very tail sir in my own name and in that of this
excellent and most prudent matron and in those of these two noble
and youthful lovers i thank you yes honorable and humane being of
the genus homo species anglicus we all return our most tail-felt
acknowledgments of your goodness

here the whole party gracefully bent the ornaments in question over
their heads touching their receding foreheads with the several
tips and bowed i would have given ten thousand pounds at that
moment to have had a good investment in tails in order to emulate
their form of courtesy but naked shorn and destitute as i was
with a feeling of humility i was obliged to put my head a little on
one shoulder and give the ordinary english bob in return for their
more elaborate politeness

if i were merely to say sir i continued when the opening
salutations were thus properly exchanged that i am charmed at this
accidental interview the word would prove very insufficient to
express my delight consider this hotel as your own its domestics
as your domestics its stores of condiments as your stores of
condiments and its nominal tenant as your most humble servant and
friend i have been greatly shocked at the indignities to which you
have hitherto been exposed and now promise you liberty kindness
and all those attentions to which it is very apparent you are fully
entitled by your birth breeding and the delicacy of your
sentiments i congratulate myself a thousand times for having been
so fortunate as to make your acquaintance my greatest desire has
always been to stimulate the sympathies but until to-day various
accidents have confined the cultivation of this heaven-born property
in a great measure to my own species i now look forward however
to a delicious career of new-born interests in the whole of the
animal creation i need scarcely say in that of quadrupeds of your
family in particular

whether we belong to the class of quadrupeds or not is a question
that has a good deal embarrassed our own savans returned the
stranger there is an ambiguity in our physical action that renders
the point a little questionable and therefore i think the higher
castes of our natural philosophers rather prefer classing the entire
monikin species with all its varieties as caudae-jactans or tail-
wavers adopting the term from the nobler part of the animal
formation is not this the better opinion at home my lord
chatterino he asked turning to the youth who stood respectfully
at his side

such i believe my dear doctor was the last classification
sanctioned by the academy the young noble replied with a
readiness that proved him to be both well-informed and intelligent
and at the same time with a reserve of manner that did equal credit
to his modesty and breeding the question of whether we are or are
not bipeds has greatly agitated the schools for more than three
centuries

the use of this gentleman's name i hastily rejoined my dear
sir reminds me that we are but half acquainted with each other
permit me to waive ceremony and to announce myself at once as sir
john goldencalf baronet of householder hall in the kingdom of
great britain a poor admirer of excellence wherever it is to be
found or under whatever form and a devotee of the system of the
social-stake

i am happy to be admitted to the honor of this formal introduction
sir john in return i beg you will suffer me to say that this young
nobleman is in our own dialect no purple or to translate the
appellation my lord chat-terino this young lady is no violet
or my lady chatterissa this excellent and prudent matron is no
 russet or mistress vigilance lynx to translate her
appellation also into the english tongue and that i am no 
brown-study color or dr reasono to give you a literal
signification of my name a poor disciple of the philosophers of our
race an lld and a fudge the travelling tutor of this heir
of one of the most illustrious and the most ancient houses of the
island of leaphigh in the monikin section of mortality

every syllable learned dr reasono that falls from your revered
lips only whets curiosity and adds fuel to the flame of desire
tempting me to inquire further into your private history your
future intentions the polity of your species and all those
interesting topics that will readily suggest themselves to one of
your quick apprehension and extensive acquirements i dread being
thought indiscreet and yet putting yourself in my position i
trust you will overlook a wish so natural and so ardent

apology is unnecessary sir john and nothing would afford me
greater satisfaction than to answer any and every inquiry you may be
disposed to make

then sir to cut short all useless circumlocution suffer me to
ask at once an explanation of the system of enumeration by which you
indicate individuals you are called no brown-study color 


or dr reasono as you are an englishman you will perhaps
understand me better if i refer to a recent practice of the new
london police you may have observed that the men wear letters in
red or white and numbers on the capes of their coats by the
letters the passenger can refer to the company of the officer while
the number indicates the individual now the idea of this
improvement came i make no doubt from our system under which
society is divided into castes for the sake of harmony and
subordination and these castes are designated by colors and shades
of colors that are significant of their stations and pursuits the
individual as in the new police being known by the number our own
language being exceedingly sententious is capable of expressing the
most elaborate of these combinations in a very few sounds i should
add that there is no difference in the manner of distinguishing the
sexes with the exception that each is numbered apart and each has
a counterpart color to that of the same caste in the other sex thus
purple and violet are both noble the former being masculine and the
latter feminine and russet being the counterpart of brown-study
color

and excuse my natural ardor to know more and do you bear these
numbers and colors marked on your attire in your own region

as for attire sir john the monikins are too highly improved
mentally and physically to need any it is known that in all cases
extremes meet the savage is nearer to nature than the merely
civilized being and the creature that has passed the mystifications
of a middle state of improvement finds himself again approaching
nearer to the habits the wishes and the opinions of our common
mother as the real gentleman is more simple in manners than the
distant imitator of his deportment as fashions and habits are
always more exaggerated in provincial towns than in polished
capitals or as the profound philosopher has less pretensions than
the tyro so does our common genus as it draws nearer to the
consummation of its destiny and its highest attainments learn to
reject the most valued usages of the middle condition and to return
with ardor towards nature as to a first love it is on this
principle sir that the monikin family never wear clothes

i could not but perceive that the ladies have manifested some
embarrassment ever since i entered is it possible that their
delicacy has taken the alarm at the state of my toilet

at the toilet itself sir john rather than at its state if i must
speak plainly the female mind trained as it is with us from
infancy upwards in the habits and usages of nature is shocked by
any departure from her rules you will know how to make allowances
for the squeamishness of the sex for i believe it is much alike in
this particular let it come from what quarter of the earth it may

i can only excuse the seeming want of politeness by my ignorance
dr reasono before i ask another question the oversight shall be
repaired i must retire into my own chamber for an instant
gentlemen and ladies and i beg you will find such sources of
amusement as first offer until i can return there are nuts i
believe in this closet sugar is usually kept on that table and
perhaps the ladies might find some relaxation by exercising
themselves on the chairs in a single moment i shall be with you
again

hereupon i withdrew into my bed-chamber and began to lay aside the
dressing-gown as well as my shirt remembering however that i was
but too liable to colds in the head i returned to ask dr reasono
to step in where i was for an instant on mentioning the difficulty
this excellent person assumed the office of preparing his female
friends to overlook the slight innovation of my still wearing the
nightcap and slippers

the ladies would think nothing of it the philosopher good-
humoredly remarked by way of lessening my regrets at having wounded
their sensibilities were you even to appear in a military cloak
and hessian boots provided it was not thought that you were of
their acquaintance and in their immediate society i think you must
have often remarked among the sex of your own species who are
frequently quite indifferent to nudities their prejudices running
counter to ours that appear in the streets but which would cause
them instantly to run out of the room when exhibited in the person
of an acquaintance these conventional asides being tolerated
everywhere by a judicious concession of punctilios that might
otherwise become insupportable

the distinction is too reasonable to require another word of
explanation dear sir now let us rejoin the ladies since i am at
length in some degree fit to be seen

i was rewarded for this bit of delicate attention by an approving
smile from the lovely chatterissa and good mistress lynx no longer
kept her eyes riveted on the floor but bent them on me with looks
of admiration and gratitude

now that this little contre-temps is no longer an obstacle i
resumed permit me to continue those inquiries which you have
hitherto answered with so much amenity and so satisfactorily as you
have no clothes in what manner is the parallel between your usage
and that of the new london police practically completed

although we have no clothes nature whose laws are never violated
with impunity but who is as beneficent as she is absolute has
furnished us with a downy covering to supply their places wherever
clothes are needed for comfort we have coats that defy fashions
require no tailors and never lose their naps but it would be
inconvenient to be totally clad in this manner and therefore the
palms of the hands are as you see ungloved the portions of the
frame on which we seat ourselves are left uncovered most probably
lest some inconvenience should arise from taking accidental and
unfavorable positions this is the part of the monikin frame the
best adapted for receiving paint and the numbers of which i have
spoken are periodically renewed there at public offices appointed
for that purpose our characters are so minute as to escape the
human eye but by using that opera-glass i make no doubt that you
may still see some of my own enregistration although alas unusual
friction great misery and i may say unmerited wrongs have
nearly un-monikined me in this as well as in various other
particulars

as dr reasono had the complaisance to turn round and to use his
tail like the index of a black-board by aid of the glass i very
distinctly traced the figures to which he alluded instead of being
in paint however as he had given me reason to anticipate they
seemed to be branded or burnt in indelibly as we commonly mark
horses thieves and negroes on mentioning the fact to the
philosopher it was explained with his usual facility and
politeness

you are quite right sir he said the omission of paint was to
prevent tautology an offence against the simplicity of the monikin
dialect as well as against monikin taste that would have been
sufficient under our opinions even to overturn the government

tautology

tautology sir john on examining the background of the picture
you will perceive that it is already of a dusky sombre hue now
this being of a meditative and grave character has been denominated
by our academy the brown-study color and it would clearly have
been supererogatory to lay the same tint upon it no sir we avoid
repetitions even in our prayers deeming them to be so many proofs
of an illogical and of an anti-consecutive mind

the system is admirable and i see new beauties at each moment you
enjoy the advantage for instance under this mode of enumeration
of knowing your acquaintances from behind quite as well as if you
met them face to face

the suggestion is ingenious showing an active and an observant
mind but it does not quite reach the motive of the politico-
numerical-identity system of which we are speaking the objects of
this arrangement are altogether of a higher and more useful nature
nor do we usually recognize our friends by their countenances which
at the best are no more than so many false signals but by their
tails

this is admirable what a facility you possess for recognizing an
acquaintance who may happen to be up a tree but may i presume to
inquire dr reasono what are the most approved of the advantages
of the politico-numerical-identity system for impatience is
devouring my vitals

they are connected with the interests of government you know sir
that society is established for the purposes of governments and
governments themselves mainly to facilitate contributions and
taxations now by the numerical system we have every opportunity
of including the whole monikin race in the collections as they are
periodically checked off by their numbers the idea was a happy
thought of an eminent statistician of ours who gained great credit
at court by the invention and in fact who was admitted to the
academy in consequence of its ingenuity

still it must be admitted my dear doctor put in lord chatterino
always with the modesty and perhaps i might add with the
generosity of youth that there are some among us who deny that
society was made for governments and who maintain that governments
were made for society or in other words for monikins

mere theorists my good lord and their opinions even if true are
never practised on practice is everything in political matters and
theories are of no use except as they confirm practice

both theory and practice are perfect i cried and i make no
doubt that the classification into colors or castes enables the
authorities to commence the imposts with the richest or the
purples

sir monikin prudence never lays the foundation-stone at the
summit it seeks the base of the edifice and as contributions are
the walls of society we commence with the bottom when you shall
know us better sir john goldencalf you will begin to comprehend
the beauty and benevolence of the entire monikin economy

i now adverted to the frequent use of this word monikin and
admitting my ignorance desired an explanation of the term as well
as a more general insight into the origin history hopes and
polity of the interesting strangers if they can be so called who
were already so well known to me dr reasono admitted that the
request was natural and was entitled to respect but he delicately
suggested the necessity of sustaining the animal function by
nutriment intimating that the ladies had supped but in an
indifferent way the evening before and acknowledging that
philosopher as he was he should go through the desired explanations
after improving the slight acquaintance he had already made with
certain condiments in one of the armoires with far more zeal and
point than could possibly be done in the present state of his
appetite the suggestion was so very plausible that there was no
resisting it and suppressing my curiosity as well as i could the
bell was rung i retired to my bed-chamber to resume so much of my
attire as was necessary to the semi-civilization of man and then
the necessary orders were given to the domestics who by the way
were suffered to remain under the influence of those ordinary and
vulgar prejudices that are pretty generally entertained by the
human against the monikin family

previously to separating from my new friend dr reasono however i
took him aside and stated that i had an acquaintance in the hotel
a person of singular philosophy after the human fashion and a
great traveller and that i desired permission to let him into the
secret of our intended lecture on the monikin economy and to bring
him with me as an auditor to this request no brown-study
color or dr reasono gave a very cordial assent hinting
delicately at the same time his expectation that this new auditor
who of course was no other than captain noah poke would not deem
it disparaging to his manhood to consult the sensibilities of the
ladies by appearing in the garments of that only decent and
respectable tailor and draper nature to this suggestion i gave a
ready approval when each went his way after the usual salutations
of bowing and tail-waving with a mutual promise of being punctual
to the appointment




chapter x

a great deal of negotiation in which human shrewdness is completely
shamed and human ingenuity is shown to be of a very secondary
quality


mr poke listened to my account of all that had passed with a very
sedate gravity he informed me that he had witnessed so much
ingenuity among the seals and had known so many brutes that seemed
to have the sagacity of men and so many men who appeared to have
the stupidity of brutes that he had no difficulty whatever in
believing every word i told him he expressed his satisfaction too
at the prospect of hearing a lecture on natural philosophy and
political economy from the lips of a monkey although he took
occasion to intimate that no desire to learn anything lay at the
bottom of his compliance for in his country these matters were
pretty generally studied in the district schools the very children
who ran about the streets of stunin'tun usually knowing more than
most of the old people in foreign parts still a monkey might have
some new ideas and for his part he was willing to hear what every
one had to say for if a man didn't put in a word for himself in
this world he might be certain no one else would take the pains to
speak for him but when i came to mention the details of the
programme of the forthcoming interview and stated that it was
expected the audience would wear their own skins out of respect to
the ladies i greatly feared that my friend would have so far
excited himself as to go into fits the rough old sealer swore some
terrible oaths protesting that he would not make a monkey of
himself by appearing in this garb for all the monikin
philosophers or high-born females that could be stowed in a ship's
hold that he was very liable to take cold that he once knew a man
who undertook to play beast in this manner and the first thing the
poor devil knew he had great claws and a tail sprouting out of him
a circumstance that he had always attributed to a just judgment for
striving to make himself more than providence had intended him for
that provided a man's ears were naked he could hear just as well
as if his whole body was naked that he did not complain of the
monkeys going in their skins and that they ought in reason not to
meddle with his clothes that he should be scratching himself the
whole time and thinking what a miserable figure he cut that he
would have no place to keep his tobacco that he was apt to be deaf
when he was cold that he would be d  d if he did any such thing
that human natur and monkey natur were not the same and it was
not to be expected that men and monkeys should follow exactly the
same fashions that the meeting would have the appearance of a
boxing match instead of a philosophical lecture that he never
heard of such a thing at stunin'tun that he should feel sneaking at
seeing his own shins in the presence of ladies that a ship always
made better weather under some canvas than under bare poles that he
might possibly be brought to his shirt and pantaloons but as for
giving up these he would as soon think of cutting the sheet-anchor
off his bows with the vessel driving on a lee-shore that flesh and
blood were flesh and blood and they liked their comfort that he
should think the whole time he was about to go in a-swimming and
should be looking about for a good place to dive together with a
great many more similar objections that have escaped me in the
multitude of things of greater interest which have since occupied my
time i have frequently had occasion to observe that when a man
has one good solid reason for his decision it is no easy matter to
shake it but that he who has a great many usually finds them of
far less account in the struggle of opinions such proved to be the
fact with captain poke on the present occasion i succeeded in
stripping him of his garments one by one until i got him reduced
to the shirt where like a stout ship that is easily brought to her
bearings by the breeze he stuck and hung in a manner to manifest
it would require a heavy strain to bring him down any lower a lucky
thought relieved us all from the dilemma there were a couple of
good large bison-skins among my effects and on suggesting to dr
reasono the expediency of encasing captain poke in the folds of one
of them the philosopher cheerfully assented observing that any
object of a natural and simple formation was agreeable to the
monikin senses their objections were merely to the deformities of
art which they deemed to be so many offences against providence on
this explanation i ventured to hint that being still in the
infancy of the new civilization it would be very agreeable to my
ancient habits could i be permitted to use one of the skins also
while mr poke occupied the other not the slightest objection was
raised to the proposal and measures were immediately taken to
prepare us to appear in good company soon after i received from dr
reasono a protocol of the conditions that were to regulate the
approaching interview this document was written in latin out of
respect to the ancients and as i afterwards understood it was
drawn up by my lord chatterino who had been educated for the
diplomatic career at home previously to the accident which had
thrown him alas into human hands i translate it freely for the
benefit of the ladies who usually prefer their own tongues to any
others

protocol of an interview that is to take place between sir john
goldencalf bart of householder hall in the kingdom of great
britain and no brown-study color or socrates reasono
fudge professor of probabilities in the university of
monikinia and in the kingdom of leaphigh

the contracting parties agree as follows viz

article that there shall be an interview

art that the said interview shall be a peaceable interview and
not a belligerent interview

art that the said interview shall be logical explanatory and
discursory

art that during said interview dr reasono shall have the
privilege of speaking most and sir john goldencalf the privilege of
hearing most

art that sir john goldencalf shall have the privilege of asking
questions and dr reasono the privilege of answering them

art that a due regard shall be had to both human and monikin
prejudices and sensibilities

art that dr reasono and any monikins who may accompany him
shall smooth their coats and otherwise dispose of their natural
vestments in a way that shall be as agreeable as possible to sir
john goldencalf and his friend

art that sir john goldencalf and any man who may accompany him
shall appear in bison-skins wearing no other clothing in order to
render themselves as agreeable as possible to dr reasono and his
friends

art that the conditions of this protocol shall be respected

art that any doubtful significations in this protocol shall be
interpreted as near as may be in favor of both parties

art that no precedent shall be established to the prejudice of
either the human or the monikin dialect by the adoption of the
latin language on this occasion

delighted with this proof of attention on the part of my lord
chatterino i immediately left a card for that young nobleman and
then seriously set about preparing myself with an increased
scrupulousness for the fulfilment of the smallest condition of the
compact captain poke was soon ready and i must say that he looked
more like a quadruped on its hind legs in his new attire than a
human being as for my own appearance i trust it was such as became
my station and character

at the appointed time all the parties were assembled lord
chatterino appearing with a copy of the protocol in his hand this
instrument was formally read by the young peer in a very
creditable manner when a silence ensued as if to invite comment i
know not how it is but i never yet heard the positive stipulations
of any bargain that i did not feel a propensity to look out for
weak places in them i had begun to see that the discussion might
lead to argument argument to comparisons between the two species
and something like an esprit de corps was stirring within me it now
struck me that a question might be fairly raised as to the propriety
of dr reasono's appearing with three backers while i had but one
the objection was therefore urged on my part i hope in a modest
and conciliatory manner in reply my lord chatterino observed it
was true the protocol spoke in general terms of mutual supporters
but if 

sir john goldencalf would be at the trouble of referring to the
instrument itself he would see that the backers of dr reasono were
mentioned in the plural number while that of sir john himself was
alluded to only in the singular number

perfectly true my lord but you will however permit me to remark
that two monikins would completely fulfil the conditions in favor of
dr reasono while he appears here with three there certainly must
be some limits to this plurality or the doctor would have a right
to attend the interview accompanied by all the inhabitants of
leaphigh

the objection is highly ingenious and creditable in the last
degree to the diplomatic abilities of sir john goldencalf but
among monikins two females are deemed equal to only one male in
the eye of the law thus in cases which require two witnesses as
in conveyances of real estate two male monikins are sufficient
whereas it would be necessary to have four female signatures in
order to give the instrument validity in the legal sense
therefore i conceive that dr reasono is attended by only two
monikins

captain poke hereupon observed that this provision in the law of
leaphigh was a good one for he often had occasion to remark that
women quite half the time did not know what they were about and
he thought in general that they require more ballast than men

this reply would completely cover the case my lord i answered
were the protocol purely a monikin document and this assembly
purely a monikin assembly but the facts are notoriously otherwise
the document is drawn up in a common vehicle of thought among
scholars and i gladly seize the opportunity to add that i do not
remember to have seen a better specimen of modern latinity

it is undeniable sir john returned lord chatterino waving his
tail in acknowledgment of the compliment that the protocol itself
is in a language that has now become common property but the mere
medium of thought on such occasions is of no great moment
provided it is neutral as respects the contracting parties
moreover in this particular case article of the protocol
contains a stipulation that no legal consequences whatever are to
follow the use of the latin language a stipulation that leaves the
contracting parties in possession of their original rights now as
the lecture is to be a monikin lecture given by a monikin
philosopher and on monikin grounds i humbly urge that it is proper
the interview should generally be conducted on monikin principles

if by monikin grounds is meant monikin ground which i have a
right to assume since the greater necessarily includes the less i
beg leave to remind your lordship that the parties are at this
moment in a neutral country and that if either of them can set up
a claim of territorial jurisdiction or the rights of the flag
these claims must be admitted to be human since the locataire of
this apartment is a man in control of the locus in quo and pro hac
vice the suzerain

your ingenuity has greatly exceeded my construction sir john and
i beg leave to amend my plea all i mean is that the leading
consideration in this interview is a monikin interest that we are
met to propound explain digest animadvert on and embellish a
monikin theme that the accessory must be secondary to the
principal that the lesser must merge not in your sense but in my
sense in the greater and by consequence that 

you will accord me your pardon my dear lord but i hold 

nay my good sir john i trust to your intelligence to be excused
if i say 

one word my lord chatterino i pray you in order that 

a thousand very cheerfully sir john but 

my lord chatterino

sir john goldencalf

hereupon we both began talking at the same time the noble young
monikin gradually narrowing down the direction of his observations
to the single person of mrs vigilance lynx who i afterwards had
occasion to know was an excellent listener and i in my turn
after wandering from eye to eye settled down into a sort of oration
that was especially addressed to the understanding of captain noah
poke my auditor contrived to get one ear entirely clear of the
bison's skin and nodded approbation of what fell from me with a
proper degree of human and clannish spirit we might possibly have
harangued in this desultory manner to the present time had not the
amiable chatterissa advanced and with the tact and delicacy which
distinguish her sex by placing her pretty patte on the mouth of the
young nobleman effectually checked his volubility when a horse is
running away he usually comes to a dead stop after driving through
lanes and gates and turnpikes the moment he finds himself master
of his own movements in an open field thus in my own case no
sooner did i find myself in sole possession of the argument than i
brought it to a close dr reasono improved the pause to introduce
a proposition that the experiment already made by myself and lord
chatterino being evidently a failure he and mr poke should retire
and make an effort to agree upon an entirely new programme of the
proceedings this happy thought suddenly restored peace and while
the two negotiators were absent i improved the opportunity to
become better acquainted with the lovely chatterissa and her female
mentor lord chatterino who possessed all the graces of diplomacy
who could turn from a hot and angry discussion on the instant to
the most bland and winning courtesy was foremost in promoting my
wishes inducing his charming mistress to throw aside the reserve of
a short acquaintance and to enter at once into a free and
friendly discourse

some time elapsed before the plenipotentiaries returned for it
appears that owing to a constitutional peculiarity or as he
subsequently explained it himself a stunin'tun principle captain
poke conceived he was bound in a bargain to dispute every
proposition which came from the other party this difficulty would
probably have proved insuperable had not dr reasono luckily
bethought him of a frank and liberal proposal to leave every other
article without reserve to the sole dictation of his colleague
reserving to himself the same privilege for all the rest noah
after being well assured that the philosopher was no lawyer
assented and the affair once begun in this spirit of concession
was soon brought to a close and here i would recommend this happy
expedient to all negotiators of knotty and embarrassing treaties
since it enables each party to gain his point and probably leaves
as few openings for subsequent disputes as any other mode that has
yet been adopted the new instrument ran as follows it having been
written in duplicate in english and in monikin it will be seen
that the pertinacity of one of the negotiators gave it very much the
character of a capitulation

protocol of an interview c c c

the contracting parties agree as follows viz

article there shall be an interview

art agreed provided all the parties can come and go at
pleasure

art the said interview shall be conducted generally on
philosophical and liberal principles

art agreed provided tobacco may be used at discretion

art that either party shall have the privilege of propounding
questions and either party the privilege of answering them

art agreed provided no one need listen or no one talk unless
so disposed

art the attire of all present shall be conformable to the
abstract rules of propriety and decorum

art agreed provided the bison-skins may be reefed from time to
time according to the state of the weather

art the provisions of this protocol shall be rigidly respected

art agreed provided no advantage be taken by lawyers

lord chatterino and myself pounced upon the respective documents
like two hawks eagerly looking for flaws or the means of
maintaining the opinions we had before advanced and which we had
both shown so much cleverness in supporting

why my lord there is no provision for the appearance of any
monikins at all at this interview

the generality of the terms leaves it to be inferred that all may
come and go who may be so disposed

your pardon my lord article contains a direct allusion to
bison-skins in the plural and under circumstances from which it
follows by a just deduction that it was contemplated that more
than one wearer of the said skins should be present at the said
interview

perfectly just sir john but you will suffer me to observe that by
article it is conditioned that there shall be an interview and
by article it is furthermore agreed that the said interview shall
be conducted on philosophical and liberal principles now it need
scarcely be urged good sir john that it would be the extreme of
illiberality to deny to one party any privilege that was possessed
by the other

perfectly just my lord were this an affair of mere courtesy but
legal constructions must be made on legal principles or else as
jurists and diplomatists we are all afloat on the illimitable ocean
of conjecture

and yet article expressly stipulates that no advantage shall be
taken by lawyers by considering articles and profoundly and
in conjunction we learn that it was the intention of the
negotiators to spread the mantle of liberality apart from all the
subtleties and devices of mere legal practitioners over the whole
proceedings permit me in corroboration of what is now urged to
appeal to the voices of those who framed the very conditions about
which we are now arguing did you sir continued my lord
chatterino turning to captain poke with emphasis and dignity did
you sir when you drew up this celebrated article  did you deem
that you were publishing authority of which the lawyers could take
advantage

a deep and very sonorous no was the energetic reply of mr poke

my lord chatterino then turning with equal grace to the doctor
first diplomatically waving his tail three times continued

and you sir in drawing up article did you conceive that you
were supporting and promulgating illiberal principles

the question was met by a prompt negative when the young noble
paused and looked at me like one who had completely triumphed

perfectly eloquent completely convincing irrefutably
argumentative and unanswerably just my lord i put in but i
must be permitted to hint that the validity of all laws is derived
from the enactment now the enactment or in the case of a treaty
the virtue of the stipulation is not derived from the intention of
the party who may happen to draw up a law or a clause but from the
assent of the legal deputies in the present instance there are two
negotiators and i now ask permission to address a few questions to
them reversing the order of your own interrogatories and the
result may possibly furnish a clue to the quo animo in a new
light addressing the philosopher i continued did you sir in
assenting to article imagine that you were defeating justice
countenancing oppression and succoring might to the injury of
right

the answer was a solemn and i do not doubt a very conscientious
no

and you sir turning to captain poke did you in assenting to
article in the least conceive that by any possibility the foes
of humanity could torture your approbation into the means of
determining that the bison-skin wearers were not to be upon a
perfect footing with the best monikins of the land

blast me if i did

but sir john goldencalf the socratic method of reasoning 

was first resorted to by yourself my lord 

nay good sir 

permit me my dear lord 

sir john 

my lord 

hereupon the gentle chatterissa again advanced and by another
timely interposition of her graceful tact she succeeded in
preventing the reply the parallel of the runaway horse was acted
over and i came to another stand-still lord chatterino now
gallantly proposed that the whole affair should be referred with
full powers to the ladies i could not refuse and the
plenipotentiaries retired under a growling accompaniment of captain
poke who pretty plainly declared that women caused more quarrels
than all the rest of the world and from the little he had seen he
expected it would turn out the same with monikinas

the female sex certainly possess a facility of composition that is
denied our portion of the creation in an incredibly short time the
referees returned with the following programme

the cat does not leap upon the mouse with more avidity than lord
chatterino and myself pounced upon the third protocol seeking new
grounds for the argument that each was resolved on

auguste cher auguste exclaimed the lovely chatterissa in the
prettiest parisian accent i thought i had ever heard pour moi

a moi monseignear i put in flourishing my copy of the protocol-
-i was checked n the midst of this controversial ardor by a tug at
the bison-skin when casting a look behind me i saw captain poke
winking and making other signs that he wished to say a word in a
corner

i think sir john observed the worthy sealer if we ever mean to
let this bargain come to a catastrophe it might as well be done
now the females have been cunning but the deuce is in it if we
cannot weather upon two women before the matter is well over in
stunin'tun when it is thought best to accommodate proposals why we
object and raise a breeze in the beginning but towards the end we
kinder soften and mollify or else trade would come to a stand the
hardest gale must blow its pipe out trust to me to floor the best
argument the best monkey of them all can agitate

this matter is getting serious noah and i am filled with an
esprit de corps do you not begin yourself to feel human

kinder but more bisonish than anything else let them go on sir
john and when the time comes we will take them aback or set me
down as a pettifogger

the captain winked knowingly and i began to see that there was some
sense in his opinion on rejoining our friends or allies i scarce
know which to call them i found that the amiable chatterissa had
equally calmed the diplomatic ardor of her lover again and we now
met on the best possible terms the protocol was accepted by
acclamation and preparations were instantly commenced for the
lecture of dr reasono




chapter xi

a philosophy that is bottomed on something substantial some reasons
plainly presented and cavilling objections put to flight by a
charge of logical bayonets


dr reasono was quite as reasonable in the personal embellishments
of his lyceum as any public lecturer i remember to have seen who
was required to execute his functions in the presence of ladies if
i say that his coat had been brushed his tail newly curled and
that his air was a little more than usually solemnized as captain
poke described it in a decent whisper i believe all will be said
that is either necessary or true he placed himself behind a foot-
stool which served as a table smoothed its covering a little with
his paws and at once proceeded to business it may be well to add
that he lectured without notes and as the subject did not
immediately call for experiments without any apparatus

waving his tail towards the different parts of the room in which his
audience were seated the philosopher commenced

as the present occasion my hearers he said is one of those
accidental calls upon science to which all belonging to the
academies are liable and does not demand more than the heads of our
thesis to be explained i shall not dig into the roots of the
subject but limit myself to such general remarks as may serve to
furnish the outlines of our philosophy natural moral and
political 

how sir i cried have you a political as well as a moral
philosophy

beyond a question and a very useful philosophy it is no interests
require more philosophy than those connected with politics to
resume our philosophy natural moral and political reserving most
of the propositions demonstrations and corollaries for greater
leisure and a more advanced state of information in the class
prescribing to myself these salutary limits therefore i shall
begin only with nature

nature is a term that we use to express the pervading and governing
principle of created things it is known both as a generic and a
specific term signifying in the former character the elements and
combinations of omnipotence as applied to matter in general and in
the latter its particular subdivisions in connection with matter in
its infinite varieties it is moreover subdivided into its physical
and moral attributes which admit also of the two grand distinctions
just named thus when we say nature in the abstract meaning
physically we should be understood as alluding to those general
uniform absolute consistent and beautiful laws which control and
render harmonious as a great whole the entire action affinities
and destinies of the universe and when we say nature in the
speciality we would be understood to speak of the nature of a rock
of a tree of air fire water and land again in alluding to a
moral nature in the abstract we mean sin and its weaknesses its
attractions its deformities-in a word its totality while on the
other hand when we use the term in this sense under the limits of
a speciality we confine its signification to the particular shades
of natural qualities that mark the precise object named let us
illustrate our positions by a few brief examples

when we say oh nature how art thou glorious sublime
instructive we mean that her laws emanate from a power of
infinite intelligence and perfection and when we say oh nature
how art thou frail vain and insufficient we mean that she is
after all but a secondary quality inferior to that which brought
her into existence for definite limited and doubtless useful
purposes in these examples we treat the principle in the abstract

the examples of nature in the speciality will be more familiar
and although in no degree more true will be better understood by
the generality of my auditors especial nature in the physical
signification is apparent to the senses and is betrayed in the
outward forms of things through their force magnitude substance
and proportions and in its more mysterious properties to
examination by their laws harmony and action especial moral
nature is denoted in the different propensities capacities and
conduct of the different classes of all moral beings in this latter
sense we have monikin nature dog nature horse nature hog nature
human nature 

permit me dr reasono i interrupted to inquire if by this
classification you intend to convey more than may be understood by
the accidental arrangement of your examples

purely the latter i do assure you sir john

and do you admit the great distinctions of animal and vegetable
natures

our academies are divided on this point one school contends that
all living nature is to be embraced in a great comprehensive genus
while another admits of the distinctions you have named i am of the
latter opinion inclining to the belief that nature herself has
drawn the line between the two classes by bestowing on one the
double gift of the moral and physical nature and by withdrawing the
former from the other the existence of the moral nature is denoted
by the presence of the will the academy of leaphigh has made an
elaborate classification of all the known animals of which the
sponge is at the bottom of the list and the monikin at the top

sponges are commonly uppermost growled noah

sir said i with a disagreeable rising at the throat am i to
understand that your savans account man an animal in a middle state
between a sponge and a monkey

really sir john this warmth is quite unsuited to philosophical
discussion if you continue to indulge in it i shall find myself
compelled to postpone the lecture

at this rebuke i made a successful effort to restrain myself
although my esprit de corps nearly choked me intimating as well as
i could a change of purpose dr reasono who had stood suspended
over his table with an air of doubt waved his tail and proceeded-
-

sponges oysters crabs sturgeons clams toads snakes lizards
skunks opossums ant-eaters baboons negroes wood-chucks lions
esquimaux sloths hogs hottentots ourang-outangs men and
monikins are beyond a question all animals the only disputed
point among us is whether they are all of the same genus forming
varieties or species or whether they are to be divided into the
three great families of the improvables the unimprovables and the
retrogressives they who maintain that we form but one great family
reason by certain conspicuous analogies that serve as so many links
to unite the great chain of the animal world taking man as a
centre for instance they show that this creature possesses in
common with every other creature some observable property thus
man is in one particular like a sponge in another he is like an
oyster a hog is like a man the skunk has one peculiarity of a man
the ourang-outang another the sloth another 

king

and so on to the end of the chapter this school of philosophers
while it has been very ingeniously supported is not however the
one most in favor just at this moment in the academy of leaphigh 

just at this moment doctor

certainly sir do you not know that truths physical as well as
moral undergo their revolutions the same as all created nature
the academy has paid great attention to this subject and it issues
annually an almanac in which the different phases the revolutions
the periods the eclipses whether partial or total the distances
from the centre of light the apogee and perigee of all the more
prominent truths are calculated with singular accuracy and by the
aid of which the cautious are enabled to keep themselves as near as
possible within the bounds of reason we deem this effort of the
monikin mind as the sublimest of all its inventions and as
furnishing the strongest known evidence of its near approach to the
consummation of our earthly destiny this is not the place to dwell
on that particular point of our philosophy however and for the
present we will postpone the subject

yet you will permit me dr reasono in virtue of clause article
 protocol no which protocol if not absolutely adopted must
be supposed to contain the spirit of that which was to inquire
whether the calculations of the revolutions of truth do not lead to
dangerous moral extravagances ruinous speculations in ideas and
serve to unsettle society

the philosopher withdrew a moment with my lord chatterino to
consult whether it would be prudent to admit of the validity of
protocol no even in this indirect manner whereupon it was
decided between them that as such admission would lay open all the
vexatious questions that had just been so happily disposed of
clause of article having a direct connection with clause 
clauses and forming the whole article and the said article 
in its entirety forming an integral portion of the whole
instrument and the doctrine of constructions enjoining that
instruments are to be construed like wills by their general and
not by their especial tendencies it would be dangerous to the
objects of the interview to allow the application to be granted
but reserving a protest against the concession being interpreted
into a precedent it might be well to concede that as an act of
courtesy which was denied as a right hereupon dr reasono
informed me that these calculations of the revolutions of truth did
lead to certain moral extravagances and in many instances to
ruinous speculations in ideas that the academy of leaphigh and so
far as his information extended the academy of every other country
had found the subject of truth more particularly moral truth the
one of all others the most difficult to manage the most likely to
be abused and the most dangerous to promulgate i was moreover
promised at a future day some illustrations of this branch of the
subject

to pursue the more regular thread of my lecture continued dr
reasono when he had politely made this little digression we now
divide these portions of the created world into animated and
vegetable nature the former is again divided into the improvable
and the unimprovable and the retrogressive the improvable embraces
all those species which are marching by slow progressive but
immutable mutations towards the perfection of terrestrial life or
to that last elevated and sublime condition of mortality in which
the material makes its final struggle with the immaterial mind with
matter the improvable class of animals agreeably to the monikin
dogmas commences with those species in which matter has the most
unequivocal ascendency and terminates with those in which mind is
as near perfection as this mortal coil will allow we hold that mind
and matter in that mysterious union which connects the spiritual
with the physical being commence in the medium state undergoing
not as some men have pretended transmigrations of the soul only
but such gradual and imperceptible changes of both soul and body as
have peopled the world with so many wonderful beings wonderful
mentally and physically and all of which meaning all of the
improvable class are no more than animals of the same great genus
on the high road of tendencies who are advancing towards the last
stage of improvement previously to their final translation to
another planet and a new existence

the retrogressive class is composed of those specimens which owing
to their destiny take a false direction which instead of tending
to the immaterial tend to the material which gradually become more
and more under the influence of matter until by a succession of
physical translations the will is eventually lost and they become
incorporated with the earth itself under this last transformation
these purely materialized beings are chemically analyzed in the
great laboratory of nature and their component parts are separated
thus the bones become rocks the flesh earth the spirits air the
blood water the gristle clay and the ashes of the will are
converted into the element of fire in this class we enumerate
whales elephants hippopotami and divers other brutes which
visibly exhibit accumulations of matter that must speedily triumph
over the less material portions of their natures

and yet doctor there are facts that militate against the theory
the elephant for instance is accounted one of the most intelligent
of all the quadrupeds

a mere false demonstration sir nature delights in these little
equivocations thus we have false suns false rainbows false
prophets false vision and even false philosophy there are entire
races of both our species too as the congo and the esquimaux for
yours and baboons and the common monkeys that inhabit various
parts of the world possessed by the human species for ours which
are mere shadows of the forms and qualities that properly
distinguish the animal in its state of protection

how sir are you not then of the same family as all the other
monkeys that we see hopping and skipping about the streets

no more sir than you are of the same family as the flat-nosed
thick-lipped low-browed ink-skinned negro or the squalid
passionless brutalized esquimaux i have said that nature delights
in vagaries and all these are no more than some of her
mystifications of this class is the elephant who while verging
nearest to pure materialism makes a deceptive parade of the quality
he is fast losing instances of this species of playing trumps if i
may so express it are common in all classes of beings how often
for instance do men just as they are about to fail make a parade
of wealth women seem obdurate an hour before they capitulate and
diplomatists call heaven to be a witness of their resolutions to the
contrary the day before they sign and seal in the case of the
elephant however there is a slight exception to the general rule
which is founded on an extraordinary struggle between mind and
matter the former making an effort that is unusual and which may
be said to form an exception to the ordinary warfare between these
two principles as it is commonly conducted in the retrogressive
class of animals the most infallible sign of the triumph of mind
over matter is in the development of the tail 

king

of the tail dr reasono

by all means sir that seat of reason the tail pray sir john
what other portion of our frames did you imagine was indicative of
intellect

among men dr reasono it is commonly thought the head is the more
honorable member and of late we have made analytical maps of this
part of our physical formation by which it is pretended to know the
breadth and length of a moral quality no less than its boundaries

you have made the best use of your materials such as they were
and i dare say the map in question all things considered is a very
clever performance but in the complication and abstruseness of this
very moral chart one of which i perceive standing on your
mantelpiece you may learn the confusion which still reigns over
the human intellect now in regarding us you can understand the
very converse of your dilemma how much easier for instance is it
to take a yard-stick and by a simple admeasurement of a tail come
to a sound obvious and incontrovertible conclusion as to the extent
of the intellect of the specimen than by the complicated
contradictory self-balancing and questionable process to which you
are reduced were there only this fact it would abundantly
establish the higher moral condition of the monikinrace as it is
compared with that of man

dr reasono am i to understand that the monikin family seriously
entertain a position so extravagant as this that a monkey is a
creature more intellectual and more highly civilized than man

seriously good sir john why you are the first respectable person
it has been my fortune to meet who has even affected to doubt the
fact it is well known that both belong to the improvable class of
animals and that monkeys as you are pleased to term us were once
men with all their passions weaknesses inconsistencies mode of
philosophy unsound ethics frailties incongruities and
subserviency to matter that they passed into the monikin state by
degrees and that large divisions of them are constantly evaporating
into the immaterial world completely spiritualized and free from
the dross of flesh i do not mean in what is called death for that
is no more than an occasional deposit of matter to be resumed in a
new aspect and with a nearer approach to the grand results whether
of the improvable or of the retrogressive classes but those final
mutations which transfer us to another planet to enjoy a higher
state of being and leaving us always on the high road towards final
excellence

all this is very ingenious sir but before you can persuade me
into the belief that man is an animal inferior to a monkey dr
reasono you will allow me to say that you must prove it

ay ay or me either put in captain poke waspishly

were i to cite my proofs gentlemen continued the philosopher
whose spirit appeared to be much less moved by our doubts than ours
were by his position i should in the first place refer you to
history all the monikin writers are agreed in recording the gradual
translation of the species from the human family 

this may do very well sir for the latitude of leaphigh but
permit me to say that no human historian from moses down to buffon
has ever taken such a view of our respective races there is not a
word in any of all these writers on the subject

how should there be sir history is not a prediction but a record
of the past their silence is so much negative proof in our favor
does tacitus for instance speak of the french revolution is not
herodotus silent on the subject of the independence of the american
continent or do any of the greek and roman writers give us the
annals of stunin'tun a city whose foundations were most probably
laid some time after the commencement of the christian era it is
morally impossible that men or monikins can faithfully relate events
that have never happened and as it has never yet happened to any
man who is still a man to be translated to the monikin state of
being it follows as a necessary consequence that he can know
nothing about it if you want historical proof therefore of what i
say you must search the monikin annals for evidence there it is to
be found with an infinity of curious details and i trust the time
is not far distant when i shall have great pleasure in pointing out
to you some of the most approved chapters of our best writers on
this subject but we are not confined to the testimony of history
in establishing our condition to be of the secondary formation the
internal evidence is triumphant we appeal to our simplicity our
philosophy the state of the arts among us in short to all those
concurrent proofs which are dependent on the highest possible state
of civilization in addition to this we have the infallible
testimony which is to be derived from the development of our tails
our system of caudology is in itself a triumphant proof of the
high improvement of the monikin reason

do i comprehend you aright dr reasono when i understand your
system of caudology or tailology to render it into the vernacular
to dogmatize on the possibility that the seat of reason in man
which to-day is certainly in his brains can ever descend into a
tail

if you deem development improvement and simplification a descent
beyond a question sir but your figure is a bad one sir john for
ocular demonstration is before you that a monikin can carry his
tail as high as a man can possibly carry his head our species in
this sense is morally nicked and it costs us no effort to be on a
level with human kings we hold with you that the brain is the
seat of reason while the animal is in what we call the human
probation but that it is a reason undeveloped imperfect and
confused cased as it were in an envelope unsuited to its
functions but that as it gradually oozes out of this straitened
receptable towards the base of the animal it acquires solidity
lucidity and finally by elongation and development point if you
examine the human brain you will find it though capable of being
stretched to a great length compressed in a diminutive compass
involved and snarled whereas the same physical portion of the genus
gets simplicity a beginning and an end a directness and
consecutiveness that are necessary to logic and as has just been
mentioned a point in the monikin seat of reason which by all
analogy go to prove the superiority of the animal possessing
advantages so great

nay sir if you come to analogies they will be found to prove
more than you may wish in vegetation for instance saps ascend for
the purposes of fructification and usefulness and reasoning from
the analogies of the vegetable world it is far more probable that
tails have ascended into brains than that brains have descended into
tails and consequently that men are much more likely to be an
improvement on monkeys than monkeys an improvement on men

i spoke with warmth i know for the doctrine of dr reasono was new
to me and by this time my esprit de corps had pretty effectually
blinded reflection

you gave him a red-hot shot that time sir john whispered captain
poke at my elbow now if you are so disposed i will wring the
necks of all these little blackguards and throw them out of the
window

i immediately intimated that any display of brute force would
militate directly against our cause as the object just at that
moment was to be as immaterial as possible

well well manage it in your own way sir john and i'm quite as
immaterial as you can wish but should these cunning varments
ra'ally get the better of us in the argument i shall never dare
look at miss poke or show my face ag'in in stunin'tun

this little aside was secretly conducted while dr reasono was
drinking a glass of eau sucre but he soon returned to the subject
with the dignified gravity that never forsook him

your remark touching saps has the usual savor of human ingenuity
blended however with the proverbial short-sightedness of the
species it is very true that saps ascend for fructification but
what is this fructification to which you allude it is no more than
a false demonstration of the energies of the plant for all the
purposes of growth life durability and the final conversion of
the vegetable matter into an element the root is the seat of power
and authority and in particular the tap-root above or rather
below all others this tap-root may be termed the tail of
vegetation you may pluck fruits with impunity nay you may even
top all the branches and the tree shall survive but put the axe
to the root and the pride of the forest falls

all this was too evidently true to be denied and i felt worried and
badgered for no man likes to be beaten in a discussion of this
sort and more especially by a monkey i bethought me of the
elephant and determined to make one more thrust by the aid of his
powerful tusks before i gave up the point

i am inclined to think dr reasono i put in as soon as possible
that your savans have not been very happy in illustrating their
theory by means of the elephant this animal besides being a mass
of flesh is too well provided with intellect to be passed off for a
dunce and he not only has one but he might almost be said to be
provided with two tails

that has been his chief misfortune sir matter in the great
warfare between itself and mind has gone on the principle of
divide and conquer you are nearer the truth than you imagined
for the trunk of the elephant is merely the abortion of a tail and
yet you see it contains nearly all the intelligence that the
animal possesses on the subject of the fate of the elephant
however theory is confirmed by actual experiment do not your
geologists and naturalists speak of the remains of animals which
are no longer to be found among living things

certainly sir the mastodon the megatherium iguanodon and the
plesiosaurus 

and do you not also find unequivocal evidences of animal matter
incorporated with rocks

this fact must be admitted too

these phenomena as you call them are no more than the final
deposits which nature has made in the cases of those creatures in
which matter has completely overcome its rival mind so soon as the
will is entirely extinct the being ceases to live or it is no
longer an animal it falls and reverts altogether to the element of
matter the processes of decomposition and incorporation are longer
or shorter according to circumstances and these fossil remains of
which your writers say so much are merely cases that have met with
accidental obstacles to their final decomposition as respects our
two species a very cursory examination of their qualities ought to
convince any candid mind of the truth of our philosophy thus the
physical part of man is much greater in proportion to the spiritual
than it is in the monikin his habits are grosser and less
intellectual he requires sauce and condiments in his food he is
farther removed from simplicity and by necessary implication from
high civilization he eats flesh a certain proof that the material
principle is still strong in the ascendant he has no cauda -

on this point dr reasono i would inquire if your scholars attach
any weight to traditions

the greatest possible sir it is the monikin tradition that our
species is composed of men refined of diminished matter and
augmented minds with the seat of reason extricated from the
confinement and confusion of the caput and extended unravelled
and rendered logical and consecutive in the cauda

well sir we too have our traditions and an eminent writer at no
great distance of time has laid it down as incontrovertible that
men once had caudae

a mere prophetic glance into the future as coming events are known
to cast their shadows before

sir the philosopher in question establishes his position by
pointing to the stumps

he has unluckily mistaken a foundation-stone for a ruin such
errors are not unfrequent with the ardent and ingenious that men
will have tails i make no doubt but that they have ever reached
this point of perfection i do most solemnly deny there are many
premonitory symptoms of their approaching this condition the
current opinions of the day the dress habits fashions and
philosophy of the species encourage the belief but hitherto you
have never reached the enviable distinction as to traditions even
your own are all in favor of our theory thus for instance you
have a tradition that the earth was once peopled by giants now
this is owing to the fact that men were formerly more under the
influence of matter and less under that of mind than to day you
admit that you diminish in size and improve in moral attainments
all of which goes to establish the truth of the monikin philosophy
you begin to lay less stress on physical and more on moral
excellences and in short many things show that the time for the
final liberation and grand development of your brains is not far
distant this much i very gladly concede for while the dogmas of
our schools are not to be disregarded i very cheerfully admit that
you are our fellow-creatures though in a more infant and less
improved condition of society

king

here dr reasono announced the necessity of taking a short
intermission in order to refresh himself i retired with captain
poke to have a little communication with my fellow-mortal under
the peculiar circumstances in which we were placed and to ask his
opinion of what had been said noah swore bitterly at some of the
conclusions of the monikin philosopher affirming that he should
like no better sport than to hear him lecture in the streets of
stunin'tun where he assured me such doctrine would not be
tolerated any longer than was necessary to sharpen a harpoon or to
load a gun indeed he did not know but the doctor would be
incontinently kicked over into rhode island without ceremony

for that matter continued the indignant old sealer i should ask
no better sport than to have permission to put the big toe of my
right foot under full sail against the part of the blackguard
where his beloved tail is stepped that would soon bring him to
reason why as for his cauda if you will believe me sir john i
once saw a man on the coast of patagonia a savage to be sure and
not a philosopher as this fellow pretends to be who had an
outrigger of this sort as long as a ship's ringtail-boom and what
was he after all but a poor devil who did not know a sea-lion from
a grampus

this assertion of captain poke relieved my mind considerably and
laying aside the bison-skin i asked him to have the goodness to
examine the localities with some particularity about the
termination of the dorsal bone in order to ascertain if there were
any encouraging signs to be discovered captain poke put on his
spectacles for time had brought the worthy mariner to their use as
he said whenever he had occasion to read fine print and after
some time i had the satisfaction to hear him declare that if it
was a cauda i wanted there was as good a place to step one as
could be found about any monkey in the universe and you have only
to say the word sir john and i will just step into the next room
and by the help of my knife and a little judgment in choosing i'll
fit you out with a jury-article which if there be any ra'al vartue
in this sort of thing will qualify you at once to be a judge or
for that matter a bishop

we were now summoned again to the lecture-room and i had barely
time to thank captain poke for his obliging offer which
circumstances just then however forbade my accepting




chapter xii

better and better a higher flight of reason more obvious truths
deeper philosophy and facts that even an ostrich might digest


i gladly quit what i fear some present may have considered the
personal part of my lecture resumed dr reasono to turn to those
portions of the theme that should possess a common interest awaken
common pride and excite common felicitations i now propose to say
a few words on that part of our natural philosophy which is
connected with the planetary system the monikin location and as a
consequence from both the creation of the world

although dying with impatience to be enlightened on all these
interesting points you will grant me leave to inquire en passant
dr reasono if your savans receive the mosaic account of the
creation or not

as far as it corroborates our own system sir and no farther
there would be a manifest inconsistency in our giving an
antagonistic validity to any hostile theory let it come from moses
or aaron as one of your native good sense and subsequent
cultivation will readily perceive

permit me to intimate dr reasono that the distinction your
philosophers take in this matter is directly opposed to a very
arbitrary canon in the law of evidence which dictates the necessity
of repudiating the whole of a witness's testimony when we repudiate
a part

that may be a human but it is not a monikin distinction so far
from admitting the soundness of the principle we hold that no
monikin is ever wholly right or that he will be wholly right so
long as he remains in the least under the influence of matter and
we therefore winnow the false from the true rejecting the former as
worse than useless while we take the latter as the nutriment of
facts

i now repeat my apologies for so often interrupting you venerable
and learned sir and i entreat you will not waste another moment in
replying to my interrogatories but proceed at once to an
explanation of your planetary system or of any other little thing
it may suit your convenience to mention when one listens to a real
philosopher one is certain to learn something that is either useful
or agreeable let the subject be what it may

by the monikin philosophy gentlemen continued dr reasono we
divide the great component parts of this earth into land and water
these two principles we term the primary elements human philosophy
has added air and fire to the list but these we reject either
entirely or admit them only as secondary elements that neither air
nor fire is a primary element may be proved by experiment thus
air can be formed in the quality of gases can be rendered pure or
foul is dependent on evaporation being no more than ordinary
matter in a state of high rarefaction fire has no independent
existence requires fuel for its support and is evidently a
property that is derived from the combinations of other principles
thus by putting two or more billets of wood together by rapid
friction you produce fire abstract the air suddenly and your fire
becomes extinct abstract the wood and you have the same result
from these two experiments it is shown that fire has no independent
existence and therefore is not an element on the other hand take
a billet of wood and let it be completely saturated with water the
wood acquires a new property as also by the application of fire
which converts it into ashes and air for its specific gravity is
increased it becomes less inflammable emits vapor more readily
and yields less readily to the blow of the axe place the same
billet under a powerful screw and a vessel beneath compress the
billet and by a sufficient application of force you will have the
wood perfectly dry left beneath the screw and the vessel will
contain water thus is it shown that land all vegetable matter
being no more than fungi of the earth is a primary element and
that water is also a primary element while air and fire are not

having established the elements i shall for brevity's sake
suppose the world created in the beginning the orb was placed in
vacuum stationary and with its axis perpendicular to the plane of
what is now called its orbit its only revolution was the diurnal

and the changes of the seasons

had not yet taken place the days and nights were equal there were
no eclipses the same stars were always visible this state of the
earth is supposed from certain geological proofs to have continued
about a thousand years during which time the struggle between mind
and matter was solely confined to quadrupeds man is thought to have
made his appearance so far as our documents go to establish the
fact about the year of the world one thousand and three about this
period too it is supposed that fire was generated by the friction
of the earth's axis while making the diurnal movement or as some
imagine by the friction of the periphery of the orb rubbing
against vacuum at the rate of so many miles in a minute the fire
penetrating the crust soon got access to the bodies of water that
fill the cavities of the earth from this time is to be dated the
existence of a new and most important agent in the terrestrial
phenomena called steam vegetation now began to appear as the
earth received warmth from within 

pray sir may i ask in what manner all the animals existed
previously

by feeding on each other the strong devoured the weak until the
most diminutive of the animalcula were reached when these turned on
their persecutors and profiting by their insignificance commenced
devouring the strongest you find daily parallels to this phenomenon
in the history of man he who by his energy and force has triumphed
over his equals is frequently the prey of the insignificant and
vile you doubtless know that the polar regions even in the original
attitude of the earth owing to their receiving the rays of the sun
obliquely must have possessed a less genial climate than the parts
of the orb that lie between the arctic and the antarctic circles
this was a wise provision of providence to prevent a premature
occupation of those chosen regions or to cause them to be left
uninhabited until mind had so far mastered matter as to have
brought into existence the first monikin

may i venture to ask to what epoch you refer the appearance of the
first of your species

to the monikin epocha beyond a doubt sir but if you mean to ask
in what year of the world this event took place i should answer
about the year it is true that certain of our writers affect
to think that divers men were approaching to the sublimation of the
monikin mind previously to this period but the better opinion is
that these cases were no more than what are termed premonitory
thus socrates plato confucius aristotle euclid zeno diogenes
and seneca were merely so many admonishing types of the future
condition of man indicating their near approach to the monikin or
to the final translation

and epicurus 

was an exaggeration of the material principle that denoted the
retrogression of a large portion of the race towards brutality and
matter these phenomena are still of daily occurrence

do you then hold the opinion for instance dr reasono that
socrates is now a monikin philosopher with his brain unravelled and
rendered logically consecutive and that epicurus is transformed
perchance into a hippopotamus or a rhinoceros with tusks horns
and hide

you quite mistake our dogmas sir john we do not believe in
transmigration in the individual at all but in the transmigration
of classes thus we hold that whenever a given generation of men
in a peculiar state of society attain in the aggregate a certain
degree of moral improvement or mentality as we term it in the
schools that there is an admixture of their qualities in masses
some believe by scores others think by hundreds and others again
pretend by thousands and if it is found by the analysis that is
regularly instituted by nature that the proportions are just the
material is consigned to the monikin birth if not it is
repudiated and either kneaded anew for another human experiment or
consigned to the vast stores of dormant matter thus all
individuality so far as it is connected with the past is lost

but sir existing facts contradict one of the most important of
your propositions while you admit that a want of a change in the
seasons would be a consequence of the perpendicularity of the
earth's axis to the plane of its present orbit this change in the
seasons is a matter not to be denied flesh and blood testify
against you here no less than reason

i spoke of things as they were sir previously to the birth of the
monikinia since which time a great salutary harmonious and
contemplated alteration has occurred nature had reserved the polar
region for the new species with divers obvious and benevolent
purposes they were rendered uninhabitable by the obliquity of the
sun's rays and though matter in the shape of mastodons and whales
with an instinct of its antagonistic destination had frequently
invaded their precincts it was only to leave the remains of the
first embedded in fields of ice memorials of the uselessness of
struggling against destiny and to furnish proofs of the same great
truth in the instance of the others who if they did enter the
polar basins as masters of the great deep either left their bones
there or returned in the same characters as they went from the
appearance of animal nature on the earth down to the period when
the monikin race arose the regions in question were not only
uninhabited but virtually uninhabitable when however nature
always wary wise beneficent and never to be thwarted had
prepared the way those phenomena were exhibited that cleared the
road for the new species i have alluded to the internal struggle
between fire and water and to their progeny steam this new agent
was now required to act a moment's attention to the manner in which
the next great step in the progress of civilization was made will
show with what foresight and calculation our common mother had
established her laws the earth is flattened at the poles as is
well imagined by some of the human philosophers in consequence of
its diurnal movement commencing while the ball was still in a state
of fusion which naturally threw off a portion of the unkneaded
matter towards the periphery this was not done without the design
of accomplishing a desired end the matter that was thus accumulated
at the equator was necessarily abstracted from other parts and in
this manner the crust of the globe became thinnest at the poles
when a sufficiency of steam had been generated in the centre of the
ball a safety-valve was evidently necessary to prevent a total
disruption as there was no other machinist than nature she worked
with her own tools and agreeably to her own established laws the
thinnest portions of the crust opportunely yielded to prevent a
catastrophe when the superfluous and heated vapor escaped in a
right line with the earth's axis into vacuum this phenomenon
occurred as nearly as we have been able to ascertain about the
year before the christian era commenced or some two centuries
previously to the birth of the first monikins

and why so early may i presume to inquire doctor

simply that there might be time for the new climate to melt the ice
that had accumulated about the islands and continents of that region
for it was only at the southern extremity of the earth that the
explosion had taken place in the course of so many centuries two
hundred and seventy years of the active and unremitted agency of
steam sufficed for this end since the accomplishment of which the
monikin race has been in the undisturbed enjoyment of the whole
territory together with its blessed fruits

am i to understand asked captain poke with more interest than he
had before manifested in the philosopher's lecture that your
folks when at hum live to the south'ard of the belt of ice that
we mariners always fall in with somewhere about the parallel of 
degrees south latitude

precisely so alas that we should this day be so far from those
regions of peace delight intelligence and salubrity but the will
of providence be done doubtless there is a wise motive for our
captivity and sufferings which may yet lead to the further glory of
the monikin race

will you have the kindness to proceed with your explanations
doctor if you deny the annual revolution of the earth in what
manner do you account for the changes of the seasons and other
astronomical phenomena such as the eclipses which so frequently
occur

you remind me that the subject is not yet exhausted the
philosopher hurriedly rejoined hastily and covertly dashing a tear
from his eye prosperity produced some of its usual effects among
the founders of our species for a few centuries they went on
multiplying in numbers elongating and rendering still more
consecutive their cauda improving in knowledge and the arts until
some spirits more audacious than the rest became restive under the
slow march of events which led them towards perfection at a rate
ill-suited to their fiery impatience at this time the mechanic
arts were at the highest pitch of perfection amongst us we have
since in a great measure abandoned them as unsuited to and
unnecessary for an advanced state of civilization we wore clothes
constructed canals and effected other works that were greatly
esteemed among the species from which we had emigrated at this
time also the whole monikin family lived together as one people
enjoyed the same laws and pursued the same objects but a political
sect arose in the region under the direction of misguided and hot-
headed leaders who brought down upon us the just judgment of
providence and a multitude of evils that it will require ages to
remedy this sect soon had recourse to religious fanaticism and
philosophical sophisms to attain its ends it grew rapidly in power
and numbers for we monikins like men as i have had occasion to
observe are seekers of novelties at last it proceeded to absolute
overt acts of treason against the laws of providence itself the
first violent demonstration of its madness and folly was setting up
the doctrine that injustice had been done the monikin race by
causing the safety-valve of the world to be opened within their
region although we were manifestly indebted to this very
circumstance for the benignity of our climate the value of our
possessions the general healthfulness of our families-nay for our
separate existence itself as an independent species yet did these
excited and ill-judging wretches absolutely wage war upon the most
benevolent and the most unequivocal friend they had specious
promises led to theories theories to declamations declamation to
combination combination to denunciation and denunciation to open
hostilities the matter in dispute was debated for two generations
when the necessary degree of madness having been excited the
leaders of the party who by this time had worked themselves through
their hobby into the general control of the monikin affairs called
a meeting of all their partisans and passed certain resolutions
which will never be blotted from the monikin memory so fatal were
their consequences so ruinous for a time their effects they were
conceived in the following terms 

at a full and overflowing meeting of the most monikinized of the
monikin race holden at the house of peleg pat we still used the
human appellations at that epoch in the year of the world 
and of the monikin era plausible shout was called to the chair
and ready quill was named secretary

after several excellent and eloquent addresses from all present
it was unanimously resolved as follows viz

that steam is a curse and not a blessing and that it deserves to
be denounced by all patriotic and true monikins

that we deem it the height of oppression and injustice in nature
that she has placed the great safety-valve of the world within the
lawful limits of the monikin territories

that the said safety-valve ought to be removed forthwith and that
it shall be so removed peaceably if it can forcibly if it must

that we cordially approve of the sentiments of john jaw our
present estimable chief magistrate the incorruptible partisan the
undaunted friend of his friends the uncompromising enemy of steam
and the sound pure orthodox and true monikin

that we recommend the said jaw to the confidence of all
monikins

that we call upon the country to sustain us in our great holy
and glorious design pledging ourselves posterity the bones of our
ancestors and all who have gone before or who may come after us to
the faithful execution of our intentions

signed

plausible shout chairman

ready quill secretary

no sooner were these resolutions promulgated for instead of being
passed at a full meeting it is now understood they were drawn up
between messrs shout and quill under the private dictation of mr
jaw than the public mind began seriously to meditate proceeding to
extremities that perfection in the mechanic arts which had
hitherto formed our pride and boast now proved to be our greatest
enemy it is thought that the leaders of this ill-directed party
meant in truth to confine themselves to certain electioneering
effects but who can stay the torrent or avert the current of
prejudice the stream was setting against steam the whole invention
of the species was put in motion and in one year from the passage
of the resolutions i have recited mountains were transported
endless piles of rocks were thrown into the gulf arches were
constructed and the hole of the safety-valve was hermetically
sealed you will form some idea of the waste of intelligence and
energy on this occasion when i add that it was found by actual
observation that this artificial portion of the earth was thicker
stronger and more likely to be durable than the natural so far did
infatuation lead the victims that they actually caused the whole
region to be sounded and having ascertained the precise locality
of the thinnest portion of the crust john jaw and all the most
zealous of his followers removed to the spot where they
established the seat of their government in triumph all this time
nature rested upon her arms in the quiet of conscious force it was
not long however before our ancestors began to perceive the
consequences of their act in the increase of the cold in the
scarcity of fruits and in the rapid augmentation of the ice the
monikin enthusiasm is easily awakened in favor of any plausible
theory but it invariably yields to physical pressure no doubt the
human race better furnished with the material of physical
resistance does not exhibit so much of this weakness but 

do not flatter us with the exception doctor i find so many points
of resemblance between us that i really begin to think we must have
had the same origin and if you would only admit that man is of the
secondary formation and the monikins of the primary i would accept
the whole of your philosophy without a moment's delay

as such an admission would be contrary to both fact and doctrine i
trust my dear sir you will see the utter impossibility of a
professor in the university of leaphigh making the concession even
in this remote part of the world as i was about to observe the
people began to betray uneasiness at the increasing and constant
inclemency of the weather and mr john jaw found it necessary to
stimulate their passions by a new development of his principles his
friends and partisans were all assembled in the great square of the
new capital and the following resolutions were to use the language
of a handbill that is still preserved in the archives of the
leaphigh historical society for it would seem they were printed
before they were passed unanimously enthusiastically and
finally adopted viz

resolved that this meeting has the utmost contempt for steam

resolved that this meeting defies snow and sterility and all
other natural disadvantages

resolved that we will live forever

resolved that we will henceforward go naked as the most
effectual means of setting the frost at defiance

resolved that we are now over the thinnest part of the earth's
crust in the polar regions

resolved that henceforth we will support no monikin for any
public trust who will not give a pledge to put out all his fires
and to dispense with cooking altogether

resolved that we are animated by the true spirit of patriotism
reason good faith and firmness

resolved that this meeting now adjourn sine die

we are told that the last resolution was just carried by
acclamation when nature arose in her might and took ample
vengeance for all her wrongs the great boiler of the earth burst
with a tremendous explosion carrying away as the thinnest part of
the workmanship not only mr john jaw and all his partisans but
forty thousand square miles of territory the last that was seen of
them was about thirty seconds after the occurrence of the explosion
when the whole mass disappeared near the northern horizon going at
a rate a little surpassing that of a cannon ball which has just left
its gun

king exclaimed noah that is what we sailors call to cut and
run

was nothing ever heard of mr jaw and his companions my good
doctor

nothing that could be depended on some of our naturalists assume
that the monkeys which frequent the other parts of the earth are
their descendants who stunned by the shock have lost their
reasoning powers while at the same time they show glimmerings of
their origin this is in truth the better opinion of our savans
and it is usual with us to distinguish all the human species of
monkeys by the name of the lost monikins since my captivity
chance has thrown me in the way of several of these animals who
were equally under the control of the cruel savoyards and in
conversing with them in order to inquire into their traditions and
to trace the analogies of language i have been led to think there
is some foundation for the opinion of this however hereafter

pray dr reasono what became of the forty thousand square miles
of territory

of that we have a better account for one of our vessels which was
far to the northward on an exploring expedition fell in with it in
longitude degrees from leaphigh latitude degrees s and by her
means it was ascertained that divers islands had been already formed
by falling fragments and judging by the direction of the main body
when last seen the fertility of that part of the world and various
geological proofs we hold that the great western archipelago is the
deposit of the remainder

and the monikin region sir what was the consequence of this
phenomenon to that part of the world

awful sublime various and durable the more important or the
personal consequences shall be mentioned first fully one-third of
the monikin species were scalded to death a great many contracted
asthmas and other diseases of the lungs by inhaling steam most of
the bridges were swept away by the sudden melting of the snows and
large stores of provisions were spoiled by the unexpected appearance
and violent character of the thaw these may be enumerated among the
unpleasant consequences among the pleasant we esteem a final and
agreeable melioration of the climate which regained most of its
ancient character and a rapid and distinct elongation of our
caudtz by a sudden acquisition of wisdom

the secondary or the terrestrial consequences were as follows 
by the suddenness and force with which so much steam rushed into
space finding its outlet several degrees from the pole the earth
was canted from its perpendicular attitude and remained fixed with
its axis having an inclination of degrees to the plane of its
orbit at the same time the orb began to move in vacuum and
restrained by antagonistic attractions to perform what is called
its annual revolution

i can very well understand friend reasono observed noah why
the arth should heel under so sudden a flaw though a well-
ballasted ship would right again when the puff was over but i
cannot understand how a little steam leaking out at one end of a
craft should set her agoing at the rate we are told this world
travels

if the escape of the steam were constant the diurnal motion giving
it every moment a new position the earth would not be propelled in
its orbit of a certainty captain poke but as in fact this
escape of the steam has the character of pulsation being periodical
and regular nature has ordained that it shall occur but once in the
twenty-four hours and this at such a time as to render its action
uniform and its impulsion always in the same direction the
principle on which the earth receives this impetus can be easily
illustrated by a familiar experiment take for instance a double-
barrelled fowling-piece load both barrels with extra quantities of
powder introduce a ball and two wads into each barrel place the
breech within inches of the abdomen and take care to
fire both barrels at once in this case the balls will give an
example of the action of the forty thousand square miles of
territory and the person experimenting will not fail to imitate the
impulsion or the backward movement of the earth

while i do not deny that such an experiment would be likely to set
both parties in motion friend reasono i do not see why the arth
should not finally stop as the man would be sure to do after he
had got through with hopping and kicking and swearing

the reason why the earth once set in motion in vacuum does not
stop can also be elucidated by experiment as follows take
captain noah poke provided as he is by nature with legs and the
power of motion lead him to the place vendome cause him to pay
three sous which will gain him admission to the base of the column
let him ascend to the summit thence let him leap with all his
energy in a direction at right angles with the shaft of the column
into the open air and it will be found that though the original
impulsion would not probably impel the body more than ten or twelve
feet motion would continue until it had reached the earth
corollary hence it is proved that all bodies in which the vis
inertia has been overcome will continue in motion until they come
in contact with some power capable of stopping them

king do you not think mr reasono that the arth makes its
circuit as much owing to this said steam of yours shoving as it
were always a little on one side acting thereby in some fashion as
a rudder which causes her to keep waring as we seamen call it and
as big crafts take more room than small ones in waring why she is
compelled to run so many millions of miles before as it were she
comes up to the wind ag'in now there is reason in such an idee
whereas i never could reconcile it to my natur that these little
bits of stars should keep a craft like the arth in her course with
such a devil of a way on her as we know in reason she must have to
run so far in a twelvemonth why the smallest yaw and for a
hooker of her keel a thousand miles wouldn't be a broader yaw than
a hundred feet in a ship the smallest yaw would send her aboard of
the jupiter or the marcury when there would be a smashing of out-
board work such as mortal never before witnessed

we rather lean to the opinion of the efficacy of attraction sir
nor do i see that your proposition would at all obviate your own
objection

then sir i will just explain myself let us suppose there was a
steamer with a hundred miles of keel let us suppose the steam up
and the craft with a broad offing let us suppose her helm lash'd
hard aport and she going at the rate of ten thousand knots the
hour without bringing up or shortening sail for years at a time
now all this being admitted what would be her course why sir
any child could tell you she would keep turning in a circle of some
fifty or a hundred thousand miles in circumference and such it
appears to me it is much more rational to suppose is the natur of
the arth's traversing than all this steering small among stars and
attractions

there is truly something very plausible captain poke in your
suggestion and i propose that you shall profit by the first
occasion to lay your opinions on the subject more at large before
the academy of leaphigh

with all my heart doctor for i hold that knowledge like good
liquor is given to be passed round from one to another and not to
be gulped in a corner by any particular individle and now i'm
throwing out hints of this natur i will just intimate another that
you may add to your next demonstration by way of what you call a
corollary which is this that is to say if all you tell us about
the bursting of the boiler and the polar kick be true then is the
arth the first steamboat that was ever invented and the boastings
of the french and the english and the spaniards and the italians
on this point are no more than so much smoke

and of the americans too captain poke i ventured to observe

why sir john that is as it may happen i don't well see how
fulton could have stolen the idee seeing that he did not know the
doctor and most probably never heard of leaphigh in his life

we all smiled even to the amiable chatterissa at the nicety of the
navigator's distinctions and the philosopher's lecture in its more
didactic form being now virtually at an end a long and desultory
conversation took place in which a multitude of ingenious questions
were put by captain poke and myself and which were as cleverly
answered by the doctor and his friends

at length dr reasono who philosopher as he was and much as he
loved science had not given himself all this trouble without a view
to what are called ulterior considerations came out with a frank
expose of his wishes accident had apparently combined all the means
for gratifying the burning desire i betrayed to be let into further
details of the monikin polity morals philosophy and all the other
great social interests of the part of the world they inhabit i was
wealthy beyond bounds and the equipment of a proper vessel would be
an expenditure of no moment both the doctor and lord chatterino
were good practical geographers after they were once within the
parallel of degrees south and captain poke according to his own
account of himself had passed half his life in poking about among
the sterile and uninhabited islands of the frozen ocean what was
there to prevent the most earnest wishes of all present from being
gratified the captain was out of employment and no doubt would be
glad to get the command of a good tight sea-boat the strangers
pined for home and it was my most ardent wish to increase my stake
in society by taking a further interest in monikins

on this hint i frankly made a proposal to the old sealer to
undertake the task of restoring these amiable and enlightened
strangers to their own firesides and families the captain soon
began to discover a little of his stunin'tun propensity for the
more i pressed the matter on him the more readily he found
objections the several motives he urged for declining the proposal
may be succinctly given as follows 

it was true that he wanted employment but then he wanted to see
stunin'tun too he doubted whether monkeys would make good sailors
it was no joke to run in among the ice and it might be still less
of one to find our way back again he had seen the bodies of dead
seals and bears that were frozen as hard as stone and which might
for anything he knew have lain in that state a hundred years and
for his part he should like to be buried when he was good for
nothing else how did he know these monikins might not catch the
men when they had once fairly got them in their country and strip
them and make them throw summersets as the savoyards had compelled
the doctor and even the lady chatterissa to do he knew he should
break his neck the very first flap-jack if he were ten years
younger perhaps he should like the frolic he did not believe the
right sort of craft could be found in england and for his part he
liked sailing under the stars and stripes he didn't know but he
might go if he had a crew of stunin'tunners he always knew how to
get along with such people he could scare one by threatening to
tell his marm how he behaved and bring another to reason by hinting
that the gals would shy him if he wasn't more accommodating then
there might be no such place as leaphigh after all or if there
was he might never find it as for wearing a bison-skin under the
equator it was quite out of the question a human skin being a
heavy load to carry in the calm latitudes and finally that he
didn't exactly see what he was to get by it

these objections were met one by one reversing the order in which
they were made and commencing with the last

i offered a thousand pounds sterling as the reward this proposal
brought a gleam of satisfaction into noah's eyes though he shook
his head as if he thought it very little it was then suggested
that there was no doubt we should discover certain islands that were
well stored with seals and that i would waive all claims as owner
and that hereafter he might turn these discoveries to his own
private account at this bait he nibbled and at one time i
thought he was about to suffer himself to be caught but he remained
obstinate after trying all our united rhetoric and doubling the
amount of the pecuniary offer dr reasono luckily bethought him of
the universal engine of human weakness and the old sealer who had
resisted money an influence of known efficacy at stunin'tun 
ambition the secret of new sealing grounds and all the ordinary
inducements that might be thought to have weight with men of his
class was in the end hooked by his own vanity

the philosopher cunningly expatiated on the pleasure there would be
in reading a paper before the academy of leaphigh on the subject of
the captain's peculiar views touching the earth's annual revolution
and of the virtue of sailing planets with their helms lashed hard
aport when all the dogmatical old navigator's scruples melted away
like snow in a thaw




chapter xiii

a chapter of preparations discrimination in character a tight fit
and other conveniences with some judgment


i shall pass lightly over the events of the succeeding month during
this time the whole party were transferred to england a proper
ship had been bought and equipped the family of strangers were put
in quiet possession of their cabins and i had made all ray
arrangements for being absent from england for the next two years
the vessel was a stout-built comfortable ship of about three
hundred tons burden and had been properly constructed to encounter
the dangers of the ice her accommodations were suitably arranged to
meet all the exigencies of both monikin and human wants the
apartments of the ladies being very properly separated from those of
the gentlemen and otherwise rendered decorous and commodious the
lady chatterissa very pleasantly called their private room the
gynecee which as i afterwards ascertained was a term for the
women's apartment obtained from the greek the monikins being quite
as much addicted as we are ourselves to showing their acquirements
by the introduction of words from foreign tongues

noah showed great care in the selection of the ship's company the
service being known to be arduous and the duties of a very
responsible character for this purpose he made a journey expressly
to liverpool the ship lying in the greenland dock at london where
he was fortunate enough to engage five yankees as many englishmen
two norwegians and a swede all of whom had been accustomed to
cruising as near the poles as ordinary men ever succeeded in
reaching he was also well suited in his cook and mates but i
observed that he had great difficulty in finding a cabin-boy to his
mind more than twenty applicants were rejected some for the want
of one qualification and some for the want of another as i was
present at several examinations of different candidates for the
office i got a little insight into his manner of ascertaining their
respective merits

the invariable practice was first to place a bottle of rum and a
pitcher of water before the lad and to order him to try his hand at
mixing a glass of grog four applicants were incontinently rejected
for manifesting a natural inaptitude at hitting the juste milieu in
this important part of the duty of a cabin-boy most of the
candidates however were reasonably expert in the art and the
captain soon came to the next requisite which was to say sir in
a tone as noah expressed it somewhere between the snap of a steel-
trap and the mendicant whine of a beggar fourteen were rejected for
deficiencies on this score the captain remarking that most of them
were the sa'ciest blackguards he had ever fallen in with when he
had at length found one who could mix a tumbler of grog and
answer sir to his liking he proceeded to make experiments on
their abilities in carrying a soup-tureen over a slushed plank in
wiping plates without a napkin and without using their shirt-
sleeves in snuffing candles with their fingers in making a soft
bed with few materials besides boards in mixing the various
compounds of burgoo lobscouse and dough which he affectedly
pronounced duff in fattening pigs on beef-bones and ducks on the
sweepings of the deck in looking at molasses without licking his
lips and in various other similar accomplishments which he
maintained were as familiar to the children of stunin'tun as their
singing-books and the ten commandments the nineteenth candidate to
my uninstructed eyes seemed perfect but noah rejected him for the
want of a quality that he declared was indispensable to the quiet of
the ship it appeared that he was too bony about an essential part
of his anatomy a peculiarity that was very dangerous to a captain
as he himself was once so unfortunate as to put his great toe out of
joint by kicking one of those ill-formed youngsters with
unpremeditated violence a thing that was very apt to happen to a
man in a hurry luckily no twenty passed and was immediately
promoted to the vacant berth the very next day the ship put to sea
in good condition and with every prospect of a fortunate voyage

i will here state that a general election occurred the week before
we sailed and i ran down to householder and got myself returned in
order to protect the interests of those who had a natural right to
look up to me for that small favor

we discharged the pilot when we had the scilly islands over the
taffrail and mr poke took command of the vessel in good earnest
coming down channel he had done little more than rummage about in
the cabin examine the lockers and make his foot acquainted with
the anatomy of poor bob as the cabin-boy was called who judging
from the amount of the captain's practice was admirably well suited
for his station in the great requisite of a kickee but the last
hold of the land loosened by the departure of the pilot our
navigator came forth in his true colors and showed the stuff of
which he was really made the first thing he did was to cause a pull
to be made on every halyard bowline and brace in the ship he then
rattled off both mates in order to show them as he afterwards told
me in confidence that he was captain of his own vessel gave the
people to understand he did not like to speak twice on the same
subject and on the same occasion which he said was a privilege he
very willingly left to congressmen and women and then he appeared
satisfied with himself and all around him

a week after we had taken our departure i ventured to ask captain
poke if it might not be well enough to take an observation and to
resort to some means in order to know where the ship was noah
treated this idea with great disrespect he could see no use in
wearing out quadrants without any necessity for it our course was
south we knew for we were bound to the south pole all we had to
do was to keep america on the starboard and africa on the larboard
hand to be sure there was something to be said about the trades
and a little allowance to be made for currents now and then but he
and the ship would get to be better acquainted before a great while
and then all would go on like clockwork a few days after this
conversation i was on deck just as day dawned and to my surprise
noah who was in his berth called out to the mate through the
skylight to let him know exactly how the land bore no one had yet
seen any land but at this summons we began to look about us and
sure enough there was an island dimly visible on the eastern board
its position by compass was immediately communicated to the captain
who seemed well satisfied with the result renewing his admonition
to the officer of the deck to take care and keep africa on the
larboard hand he turned over in his bed to resume his nap

i afterwards understood from the mates that we had made a very
capital fall upon the trades and that we were getting on
wonderfully well though it was quite as great a mystery to them as
it was to me how the captain could know where the ship was for he
had not touched his quadrant except to wipe it with a silk
handkerchief since we left england about a fortnight after we had
passed the cape de verds noah came on deck in a great rage and
began to storm at the mate and the man at the wheel for not keeping
the ship her course to this the former answered with spirit that
the only order he had received in a fortnight was to keep her
jogging south allowing for variation and that she was heading at
that moment according to orders hereupon noah gave bob who
happened to pass him just then a smart application a posteriori
and swore that the compass was as big a fool as the mate that the
ship was two points off her course that south was hereaway and not
thereaway that he knew by the feel of the wind that it had no
northin in it and we had got it away on the quarter whereas it
ought to be for'ard of the beam that we were running for rio
instead of leaphigh and that if we ever expected to get to the
latter country we must haul up on a good taut bowline the mate
to my surprise suddenly acquiesced and immediately brought the
ship by the wind he afterwards told me in a half-whisper that the
second mate having been sharpening some harpoons had unwittingly
left them much too close to the binnacle and that in fact the
magnet had been attracted by them so as to deceive the man at the
wheel and himself fully twenty degrees as to the real points of the
compass i must say this little occurrence greatly encouraged me
leaving no doubt about our eventual and safe arrival as far at
least as the boundary of ice which separates the human from the
monikin region profiting by this feeling of security i now began
to revive the intercourse with the strangers which had been
partially interrupted by the novel and disagreeable circumstances of
a sea life

the lady chatterissa and her companion as is much the case with
females at sea rarely left the gynecee but as we drew near the
equator the philosopher and the young peer passed most of their
time on deck or aloft dr reasono and i spent half of the mild
nights in discussing subjects connected with my future travels and
as soon as we were well clear of the rain and the thunder and
lightning of the calm latitudes captain poke robert and myself
began to study the language of leaphigh the cabin-boy was included
in this arrangement noah intimating we should find it convenient to
take him on shore with us since a wish to conceal my destination
had induced me to bring no servant along luckily for us the
monikin ingenuity had greatly diminished the labor of the
acquisition the whole language was spoken and written on a system
of decimals which rendered it particularly easy after the
elementary principles were once acquired thus unlike most human
tongues in which the rule usually forms the exception no departure
from its laws was ever allowed under the penalty of the pillory
this provision the captain protested was the best rule of them
all and saved a vast deal of trouble for as he knew by
experience a man might be a perfect adept in the language of
stunin'tun and then be laughed at in new york for his pains the
comprehensiveness of the tongue was also another great advantage
though like all other eminent advantages or excessive good it was
the next-door neighbor to as great an evil thus as my lord
chatterino obligingly explained we-witch-it-me-cum means madam
i love you from the crown of my head to the tip of my tail and as i
love no other half as well it would make me the happiest monikin on
earth if you would consent to become my wife that we might be
models of domestic propriety before all eyes from this time
henceforth and forever in short it was the usual and most solemn
expression for asking in marriage and by the laws of the land was
binding on the proposer until as formally declined by the other
party but unluckily the word we-switch-it-me-cum means madam
i love you from the crown of my head to the tip of my tail and if
i did not love another better it would make me the happiest monikin
on earth if you would consent to become my wife that we might be
models of domestic propriety before all eyes from this time
henceforth and forever now this distinction subtle and
insignificant as it was to the eye and the ear caused a vast deal
of heart-burning and disappointment among the young people of
leaphigh several serious lawsuits had grown out of this cause and
two great political parties had taken root in the unfortunate
mistake of a young monikin of quality who happened to lisp and who
used the fatal word indiscreetly that feud however was now
happily appeased having lasted only a century but it would be
wise as we were all three bachelors to take note of the
distinction captain poke said he thought on the whole he was
perfectly safe as he was much accustomed to the use of the word
switchel but he thought it might be very well to go before some
consul as soon as the ship anchored and enter a formal protest of
our ignorance of all these niceties lest some advantage should be
taken of us by the reptiles of lawyers that he in particular was
not a bachelor and that miss poke would be as furious as a
hurricane if by accident he should happen to forget himself the
matter was deferred for future deliberation

about this time too i had some more interesting communications
with dr reasono on the subject of the private histories of all the
party of which he was the principal member it would seem that the
philosopher though rich in learning and the proprietor of one of
the best developed caudce in the entire monikin world was poor in
the more vulgar attributes of monikin wealth while he bestowed
freely therefore from the stores of his philosophy and through
the medium of the academy of leaphigh on all his fellows he was
obliged to seek an especial recipient for his surplus knowledge in
the shape of a pupil in order to provide for the small remains of
the animal that still lingered in his habits lord chatterino the
orphan heritor of one of the noblest and wealthiest as well as one
of the most ancient houses of leaphigh had been put under his
instruction at a very tender age as had my lady chatterissa under
that of mrs lynx with very much the same objects this young and
accomplished pair had early distinguished each other in monikin
society for their unusual graces of person general attainments
mutual amiableness of disposition harmony of thought and soundness
of principles everything was propitious to the gentle flame which
was kindled in the vestal bosom of chatterissa and which was met by
a passion so ardent and so respectful as that which glowed in the
heart of young no purple the friends of the respective parties
so soon as the budding sympathy between them was observed in order
to prevent the blight of wishes so appropriate had called in the
aid of the matrimonial surveyor-general of leaphigh an officer
especially appointed by the king in council whose duty it is to
take cognizance of the proprieties of all engagements that are
likely to assume a character as grave and durable as that of
marriage dr reasono showed me the certificate issued from the
marriage department on this occasion and which in all his
wanderings he had contrived to conceal within the lining of the
spanish hat the savoyards had compelled him to wear and which he
still preserved as a document that was absolutely indispensable on
his return to leaphigh else he would never be permitted to travel
afoot in company with two young people of birth and of good estates
who were of the different sexes i translate the certificate as
literally as the poverty of the english language will allow

counter signed no ink-color

ordered that the parties make the journey of trial together under
the charge of socrates reasono professor of probabilities in the
university of leaphigh lld f u d g e and of mrs vigilance
lynx licensed duenna

the journey of trial is so peculiar to the monikin system and it
might be so usefully introduced into our own that it may be well to
explain it whenever it is found that a young couple are agreeable
to use a peculiar anglicized anglicism in all the more essential
requisites of matrimony they are sent on the journey in question
under the care of prudent and experienced mentors with a view to
ascertain how far they may be able to support in each other's
society the ordinary vicissitudes of life in the case of
candidates of the more vulgar classes there are official overseers
who usually drag them through a few mud-puddles and then set them
to work at some hard labor that is especially profitable to the
public functionaries who commonly get the greater part of their own
year's work done in this manner but as the moral provisions of all
laws are invented less for those who own acres of land
divided into meadow arable and wood in just proportions than for
those whose virtues are more likely to yield to the fiery ordeal of
temptation the rich and noble after making a proper and useful
manifestation of their compliance with the usage ordinarily retire
to their country seats where they pass the period of probation as
agreeably as they can taking care to cause to be inserted in the
leaphigh gazette however occasional extracts from their letters
describing the pains and hardships they are compelled to endure for
the consolation and edification of those who have neither birth nor
country houses in a good many instances the journey is actually
performed by proxy but the case of my lord chatterino and my lady
chatterissa formed an exception even to these exceptions it was
thought by the authorities that the attachment of a pair so
illustrious offered a good occasion to distinguish the leaphigh
impartiality and on the well-known principle which induces us
sometimes to hang an earl in england the young couple were
commanded actually to go forth with all useful eclat secret orders
being given to their guardians to allow every possible indulgence
at the same time in order that the lieges might see and exult in
the sternness and integrity of their rulers

dr reasono had accordingly taken his departure from the capital for
the mountains where he instructed his wards in a practical
commentary of the ups and downs of life by exposing them on the
verges of precipices and in the delights of the most fertile valleys
which as he justly observed was the greater danger of the two
leading them over flinty paths hungry and cold in order to try
their tempers and setting up establishments with the most awkward
peasants for servants to ascertain the depth of chatterissa's
philosophy with a variety of similar ingenious devices that will
readily suggest themselves to all who have any matrimonial
experience whether they live in palaces or cottages when this part
of the trial was successfully terminated the result having shown
that the gentle chatterissa was of proof so far as mere temper was
concerned the whole party were ordered off to the barrier of ice
which divides the monikin from the human region with a view to
ascertain whether the warmth of their attachment was of a nature
likely to resist the freezing collisions of the world here
unfortunately for the truth must be said an unlucky desire of
dr reasono who was already f u d g e but who had a devouring
ambition to become also m o r e led him into the extreme
imprudence of pushing through an opening where he had formerly
discovered an island on an ancient expedition of the same sort and
on which island he thought he saw a rock that formed a stratum of
what he believed to be a portion of the forty thousand square miles
that were discomposed by the great eruption of the earth's boiler
the philosopher foresaw a thousand interesting results that were
dependent on the ascertaining of this important fact for all the
learning of leaphigh having been exhausted some five hundred years
before in establishing the greatest distance to which any fragment
had been thrown on that memorable occasion great attention had
latterly been given to the discovery of the least distance any
fragment had been hurled perhaps i ought to speak tenderly of the
consequences of a learned zeal but it was entirely owing to this
indiscretion that the whole party fell into the hands of certain
mariners who were sealing on the northern shores of this very
island friends and neighbors as it afterwards appeared of
captain poke who remorselessly seized upon the travellers and
sold them to a homeward-bound india-man which they afterwards fell
in with near the island of st helena st helena the tomb of him
who is a model to all posterity for the moderation of his desires
the simplicity of his character a deep veneration for truth
profound reverence for justice unwavering faith and a clear
appreciation of all the nobler virtues

we came in sight of the island in question just as dr reasono
concluded his interesting narrative and turning to captain poke i
solemnly asked that discerning and shrewd seaman 

if he did not think the future would fully avenge itself of the
past if history would not do ample justice to the mighty dead if
certain names would not be consigned to everlasting infamy for
chaining a hero to a rock and whether his country the land of
freemen would ever have disgraced itself by such an act of
barbarism and vengeance

the captain heard me very calmly then deliberately helping himself
to some tobacco he replied 

harkee sir john at stunin'tun when we catch a ferocious
critter we always put it in a cage i'm no great mathematician as
i've often told you if my dog bites me once i kick him twice i
beat him thrice i chain him

alas there are minds so unfortunately constituted that they have
no sympathies with the sublime all their tendencies are direct and
common-sense like to such men napoleon appears little better than
one who lived among his fellows more in the character of a tiger
than in that of a man they condemn him because he could not reduce
his own sense of the attributes of greatness to the level of their
home-bred morality among this number it would now seem was to be
classed captain noah poke

a wish to relate the manner in which dr reasono and his companions
fell into human hands has caused me to overlook one or two matters
of lighter moment that should not in justice to myself however
be entirely omitted

when we had been at sea two days a very agreeable surprise for the
monikin party was prepared and executed i had caused a certain
number of jackets and trousers to be made of the skins of different
animals such as dogs cats sheep tigers leopards hogs etc
etc with the proper accompaniments of snouts hoofs and claws
and when the ladies came on deck after breakfast their eyes were
no longer offended by our rude innovations upon nature but the
whole crew were flying about the rigging like so many animals of
the different species named noah and myself appeared in the
characters of sea-lions the former having intimated that he
understood the nature of that beast better than any other of
course this delicate attention was properly appreciated and
handsomely acknowledged

i had taken the precaution to order imitation-skins to be made of
cotton which were worn in the low latitudes and as we got near
the falkland islands the real skins were resumed with promptitude
and i might add with pleasure

noah had at first raised some strong objections to the scheme
saying that he should not feel safe in a ship manned and officered
altogether by wild beasts but at last he came to enjoy the thing
as a good joke never failing to hail the men not by their names as
formerly but as he expressed it himself by their natur's
calling out you cat scratch this you tiger jump here you
hog out of that dirt you dog scamper there you horse haul
away and divers other similar conceits that singularly tickled
his fancy the men themselves took up the ball which they kept
rolling embellished with all sorts of nautical witticisms their
surname they had but one viz smith being entirely dropped for
the new appellations thus the sounds of tom dog jack cat
bill tiger sam hog and dick horse were flying about the
deck from morning to night

good humor is a great alleviator of bodily privation from the time
the ship lost sight of staten land we had heavy weather with hard
gales from the southward and westward and we had the utmost
difficulty in making our southing observations now became a very
difficult matter the sun being invisible for a week at a time the
marine instinct of noah at this crisis was of the last importance
to all on board he gave us the cheering assurance however from
time to time that we were going south although the mates declared
that they knew not where the ship was or whither she was running
neither sun moon nor star having now been seen for more than a
week

we had been in this state of anxiety and doubt for about a
fortnight when captain poke suddenly appeared on deck and called
for the cabin-boy in his usual stentorian and no-denial voice by
the name of you bob ape for the duty of robert requiring that he
should be much about the persons of the monikins i had given him a
dress of apes skins as a garb that would be more congenial to
their tastes than that of a pig or a weasel bob ape was soon
forthcoming and as he approached his master he quietly turned his
face from him receiving as a matter of course three or four smart
admonitory hints by way of letting him know that he was to be
active in the performance of the duty on which he was about to be
sent on this occasion i made an odd discovery bob had profited by
the dimensions of his lower garment which had been cut for a much
larger boy one of those who had broken down in essaying the true
doric of sir by stuffing it with an old union-jack-a sort of
sarvice as he afterwards told me that saved him a good deal of
wear and tear of skin to return to passing events however when
robert had been duly kicked he turned about manfully and demanded
the captain's pleasure he was told to bring the largest and fairest
pumpkin he could find from the private stores of mr poke that
navigator never going to sea without a store of articles that he
termed stunin'tun food the captain took the pumpkin between his
legs and carefully peeled off the whole of its greenish-yellow
coat leaving it a globe of a whitish color he then asked for the
tar-bucket and with his fingers traced various marks which were
pretty accurate outlines of the different continents and the larger
islands of the world the region near the south pole however he
left untouched intimating that it contained certain sealing
islands which he considered pretty much as the private property of
the stunin'tunners

now doctor he said pointing to the pumpkin there is the
arth and here is the tar-pot just mark down the position of your
island of leaphigh if you please according to the best accounts
your academy has of the matter make a dab here and there if you
happen to know of any rocks and shoals after that you can lay down
the island where you were captured giving a general idee of its
headlands and of the trending of the coast

dr reasono took a fid and with its end he traced all the desired
objects with great readiness and skill noah examined the work and
seemed satisfied that he had fallen into the hands of a monikin who
had very correct notions of bearings and distances one in short
on whose local knowledge it might do to run even in the night he
then projected the position of stunnin'tun an occupation in which
he took great delight actually designing the meeting-house and the
principal tavern after which the chart was laid aside




chapter xiv

how to steer small how to run the gauntlet with a ship how to go
clear a new-fashioned screw dock and certain mile-stones


captain poke no longer deliberated about the course we were to
steer with his pumpkin for a chart his instinct for an
observation and his nose for a compass the sturdy sealer stood
boldly to the southward or at least he ran dead before a stiff
gale which as he more than once affirmed was as true a norther as
if bred and born in the canadas

after coursing over the billows at a tremendous rate for a day and a
night the captain appeared on deck with a face of unusual meaning
and a mind loaded with its own reflections as was proved by his
winking knowingly whenever he delivered himself of a sentiment a
habit that he had most probably contracted in early youth at
stunin'tun for it seemed to be quite as inveterate as it was
thoroughbred

we shall soon know sir john he observed hitching the sea-lion
skin into symmetry whether it is sink or swim

pray explain yourself mr poke cried i in a little alarm if
anything serious is to happen you are bound to give timely notice

death is always untimely to some critturs sir john

am i to understand sir that you mean to cast away the ship

not if i can help it sir john but a craft that is foreordained to
be a wrack will be a wrack in spite of reefing and bracing look
ahead you dick lion ay there you have it

there we had it sure enough i can only compare the scene which now
met my eyes to a sudden view of the range of the oberland alps
when the spectator is unexpectedly placed on the verge of the
precipice of the weissenstein there he would see before him a
boundless barrier of glittering ice broken into the glorious and
fantastic forms of pinnacles walls and valleys while here we saw
all that was sublime in such a view heightened by the fearful action
of the boisterous ocean which beat upon the impassable boundary in
ceaseless violence

good god captain poke i exclaimed the instant i caught a
glimpse of the formidable danger that menaced us you surely do not
mean to continue madly on with such a warning of the consequences
in plain view

what would you have sir john leaphigh lies on the t'other side of
these ice-islands

but you need not run the ship against them why not go round them

because they go round the arth in this latitude now is the time
to speak sir john if we are bound to leaphigh we have the choice
of three pretty desperate chances to go through to go under or to
go over that there ice if we are to put back there is not a moment
to lose for it may be even now questioned whether the ship would
claw off as we are with a sending sea and this heavy norther

i believe i would at that moment gladly have given up all my
social stakes to be well rid of the adventure still pride that
substitute for so many virtues the greatest and the most potent of
all hypocrites forbade my betraying the desire to retreat i
deliberated while the ship flew and when at length i turned to
the captain to suggest a doubt that might at an earlier notice
possibly have changed the whole aspect of affairs he bluntly told
me it was too late it was safer to proceed than to return if
indeed return were possible in the present state of the winds and
waves making a merit of necessity i braced my nerves to meet the
crisis and remained a submissive and apparently a calm spectator
of that which followed

the walrus such was the name of our good ship by this time was
under easy canvas and yet urged by the gale she rolled down with
alarming velocity towards the boundary of foam where the congealed
and the still liquid element held their strife the summits of the
frozen crags waved in their glittering glory in a way just to show
that they were afloat and i remembered to have heard that at
times as their bases melted entire mountains had been known to
roll over engulfing all that lay beneath to me it seemed but a
moment before the ship was fairly overshadowed by these shining
cliffs which gently undulating waved their frozen summits nearly
a thousand feet in air i looked at noah in alarm for it appeared
to me that he intentionally precipitated us to destruction but
just as i was about to remonstrate he made a sign with his hand
and the vessel was brought to the wind still retreat was
impossible for the heave of the sea was too powerful and the wind
too heavy to leave us any hope of long keeping the walrus from
drifting down upon the ragged peaks that bristled in icy glory to
leeward nor did captain poke himself seem to entertain any such
design for instead of hugging the gale in order to haul off from
the danger he had caused the yards to be laid perfectly square and
we were now running at a great rate in a line nearly parallel with
the frozen coast though gradually setting upon it

keep full let her go through water you jim tiger said the old
sealer whose professional ardor was fairly aroused now sir john
unluckily we are on the wrong side of these ice mountains for the
plain reason that leaphigh lies to the south'ard of them we must be
stirring therefore for no craft that was ever launched could keep
off these crags with such a gale driving home upon them for more
than an hour or two our great concern at present is to look out
for a hole to run into

why have you come so close to the danger with your knowledge of
the consequences

to own the truth sir john natur is natur and i'm getting to be
a little near-sighted as i grow old besides i'm not so sartain
that the danger is the more dangerous for taking a good steady
look plump in its face

noah raised his hand as much as to say he wished no answer and
both of us were immediately occupied in gazing anxiously to leeward
the ship was just opening a small cove in the ice which might have
been a cable's length in depth and a quarter of a mile across its
outer or the widest part its form was regular being that of a
semicircle but at its bottom the ice instead of forming a
continued barrier like all the rest we had yet passed was
separated by a narrow opening that was bounded on each side by a
frowning precipice the two bergs were evidently drawing nearer to
each other but there was still a strait or a watery gorge between
them of some two hundred feet in width as the ship plunged onward
the pass was opened and we caught a glimpse of the distant view to
leeward it was merely a glimpse the impatient walrus allowing us
but a moment for examination but it appeared sufficient for the
purposes of the old sealer we were already across the mouth of the
cove and within a cable's length of the ice again for as we drew
near what may be called the little cape we found ourselves once
more in closer proximity to the menacing mountain it was a moment
when all depended on decision and fortunately our sealer who was
so wary and procrastinating in a bargain never had occasion to make
two drafts on his thoughts in situations of emergency as the ship
cleared the promontory on the eastern side of the cove we again
opened a curvature of the ice which gave a little more water to
leeward tacking was impossible and the helm was put hard aweather
the bow of the walrus fell off and as she rose on the next wave i
thought its send would carry us helplessly down upon the berg but
the good craft obedient to her rudder whirled round as if
sensible herself of the danger and in less time than i had ever
before known her to wear we felt the wind on the other quarter our
cats and dogs bestirred themselves for there was no one there
captain noah poke excepted whose heart did not beat quick and hard
in much less time than usual the yards were braced up on the other
tack and the ship was ploughing heavily against the sea with her
head to the westward it is impossible to give one who has never
been in such a situation a just idea of the feverish impatience
the sinking and mounting of hope as we watch the crablike movement
of a vessel that is clawing off a lee-shore in a gale in the
present case it being well known that the sea was fathomless we
had run so near the danger that not even the smallest of its horrors
was veiled from sight

while the ship labored along i saw the clouds fast shutting in to
windward by the interposition of the promontory of ice the certain
sign that our drift was rapid and as we drew nearer to the point
breathing became labored and even audible here noah took a chew of
tobacco i presume on the principle of enjoying a last quid should
the elements prove fatal and then he went to the wheel in person

let her go through the water he said easing the helm a little 
let her jog ahead or we shall lose command of her in this devil's-
pot

the vessel felt the slight change and drew faster through the
foaming brine bringing us with increasing velocity nearer to the
dreaded point as we came up to the promontory the water fell back
in spray on the decks and there was an instant when it appeared as
if the wind was about to desert us happily the ship had drawn so
far ahead as to feel the good effects of a slight change of current
that was caused by the air rushing obliquely into the cove and as
noah by easing the helm still more had anticipated this
alteration which had been felt adversely but a moment before while
struggling to the eastward of the promontory we drew swiftly past
the icy cape opening the cove handsomely with the ship's head
falling off fast towards the gorge

there was but a minute or two for squaring the yards and obtaining
the proper position to windward of the narrow strait instead of
running down in a direct line for the latter captain poke kept the
ship on such a course as to lay it well open before her head was
pointed towards the passage by this time the two bergs had drawn
so near each other as actually to form an arch across its mouth and
this too at a part so low as to render it questionable whether
there was sufficient elevation to permit the walrus to pass beneath
but retreat was impossible the gale urging the ship furiously
onwards the width of the passage was now but little more than a
hundred feet and it actually required the nicest steerage to keep
our yard-arms clear of the opposite precipices as the vessel
dashed with foaming bows into the gorge the wind drew through the
opening with tremendous violence fairly howling as if in delight at
discovering a passage by which it might continue its furious career
we may have been aided by the sucking of the wind and the waves
both of which were irresistibly drawn towards the pass or it is
quite probable that the skill of captain poke did us good service on
this awful occasion but owing to the one or the other or to the
two causes united the walrus shot into the gorge so accurately as
to avoid touching either of the lateral margins of the ice we were
not so fortunate however with the loftier spars for scarcely was
the vessel beneath the arch when she lifted on a swell and her
main-top-gallant-mast snapped off in the cap the ice groaned and
cracked over our heads and large fragments fell both ahead and
astern of us several of them even tumbling upon our decks one
large piece came down within an inch of the extremity of dr
reasono's tail just escaping the dire calamity of knocking out the
brains of that profound and philo-monikin philosopher in another
instant the ship was through the pass which completely closed with
the crash of an earthquake as soon as possible afterwards

still driven by the gale we ran rapidly towards the south along a
channel less than a quarter of a mile in width the bergs evidently
closing on each side of us and the ship as if conscious of her
jeopardy doing her utmost with captain poke still at the wheel in
a little more than an hour the worst was over the walrus issuing
into an open basin of several leagues in extent which was however
completely encircled by the frozen mountains here noah took a look
at the pumpkin after which he made no ceremony in plumply telling
dr reasono that he had been greatly mistaken in laying down the
position of captivity island as he himself had named the spot where
the amiable strangers had fallen into human hands the philosopher
was a little tenacious of his opinion but what is argument in the
face of facts here was the pumpkin and there were the blue waters
the captain now quite frankly declared that he had great doubts
whether there was any such place as leaphigh at all and as the ship
had a capital position for such an object he bluntly though
privately proposed to me that we should throw all the monikins
overboard project the entire polar basin on his chart as being
entirely free from islands and then go a-sealing i rejected the
propositions firstly as premature secondly as inhuman thirdly
as inhospitable fourthly as inconvenient and lastly as
impracticable

there might have arisen a disagreeable controversy between us on
this point for mr poke had begun to warm and to swear that one
good seal of the true quality of fur was worth a hundred monkeys
when most happily the panther at the masthead cried out that two of
the largest mountains to the southward of us were separating and
that he could discern a passage into another basin hereupon captain
poke concentrated his oaths which he caused to explode like a bomb
and instantly made sail again in the proper direction by three
o'clock pm we had run the gauntlet of the bergs a second time
and were at least a degree nearer the pole in the basin just
alluded to

the mountains had now entirely disappeared in the southern board
but the sea was covered far as the eye could reach with field-ice
noah stood on without apprehension for the water had been smooth
ever since we entered the first opening the wind not having rake
enough to knock up a swell when about a mile from the margin of the
frozen and seemingly interminable plain the ship was brought to the
wind and hove-to

ever since the vessel left the docks there had been six sets of
spars of a form so singular lying among the booms that they had
often been the subject of conversation between the mates and myself
neither of the former being able to tell their uses these sticks
were of no great length some fifteen feet at the most of sound
english oak two or three pairs were alike for they were in pairs
each pair having one of the sides of a shape resembling different
parts of the ship's bottom with the exception that they were
chiefly concave while the bottom of a vessel is mainly convex at
one extremity each pair was firmly connected by a short massive
iron link of about two feet in length and at its opposite end a
large eye-bolt was driven into each stick where it was securely
forelocked when the walrus was stationary we learned for the
first time the uses of these unusual preparations a pair of the
timbers which were of great solidity and strength were dropped
over the stern and sinking beneath the keel their upper
extremities were separated by means of lanyards turned into the eye-
bolts the lanyards were then brought forward to the bilge of the
vessel where by the help of tackles the timbers were rowsed up in
such a manner that the links came close to the false keel and the
timbers themselves were laid snug against each side of the ship as
great care had been taken by means of marks on the vessel as well
as in forming the skids themselves the fit was perfect no less
than five pairs were secured in and near the bilge and as many more
were distributed forwards and aft according to the shape of the
bottom fore-and-aft pieces that reached from one skid to the
other were then placed between those about the bilge of the ship
each of them having a certain number of short ribs extending
upwards and downwards these fore-and-aft pieces were laid along the
waterline their ends entering the skids by means of mortices and
tenons where they were snugly bolted the result of the entire
arrangement was to give the vessel an exterior protection against
the field-ice by means of a sort of network of timber the whole of
which had been so accurately fitted in the dock as to bear equally
on her frame these preparations were not fairly completed before
ten o'clock on the following morning when noah stood directly for
an opening in the ice before us which just about that time began to
be apparent

we sha'nt go so fast for our armor observed the cautious old
sealer but what we want in heels we'll make up in bottom

for the whole of that day we worked our devious course by great
labor and at uncertain intervals to the southward and at night we
fastened the walrus to a floe in waiting for the return of light
just as the day dawned however i heard a tremendous grating sound
against the side of the vessel and rushing on deck i found that we
were completely caught between two immense fields which seemed to
be attracted towards each other for no other apparent purpose than
to crush us here it was that the expedient of captain poke made
manifest its merits protected by the massive timbers and false
ribs the bilge of the ship resisted the pressure and as under
such circumstances something must yield luckily nothing but the
attraction of gravitation was overcome the skids through their
inclination acted as wedges the links pressing against the keel
and in the course of an hour the walrus was gradually lifted out of
the water maintaining her upright position in consequence of the
powerful nip of the floes no sooner was this experiment handsomely
effected than mr poke jumped upon the ice and commenced an
examination of the ship's bottom

here's a dry-dock for you sir john exclaimed the old sealer
chuckling i'll have a patent for this the moment i put foot ag'in
in stunin'tun

a feeling of security to which i had been a stranger ever since we
entered the ice was created by the composure of noah and by his
self-congratulation at what he called his project to get a look at
the walrus's bottom notwithstanding all the fine declarations of
exultation and success however that he flourished among us who
were not mariners i was much disposed to think that like other men
of extraordinary genius he had blundered on the grand result of his
ice-screws and that it was not foreseen and calculated let this
be as it may however all hands were soon on the floe with brooms
scrapers hammers and nails and the opportunity of repairing and
cleaning was thoroughly improved

for four-and-twenty hours the ship remained in the same attitude
still as a church and some of us began to entertain apprehensions
that she might be kept on her frozen blocks forever the accident
had happened according to the statements of captain poke in lat
 degrees  although i never knew in what manner he
ascertained the important particular of our precise situation
thinking it might be well to get some more accurate ideas on this
subject after so long and ticklish a run i procured the quadrant
from bob ape and brought it down upon the ice where i made it a
point as an especial favor the weather being favorable and the
proper hour near that our commander would correct his instinct by a
solar observation noah protested that your old seaman especially
if a sealer and a stunin'tunner had no occasion for such geometry
operations as he termed them that it might be well enough perhaps
necessary for your counting-house silk-gloved captains who run
between new york and liverpool to be rubbing up their glasses and
polishing their sextants for they hardly ever knew where they were
except at such times but as for himself he had little need of
turning star-gazer at his time of life and that as he had already
told me he was getting to be near-sighted and had some doubts
whether he could discern an object like the sun that was known to
be so many thousands of millions of miles from the earth these
scruples however were overcome by my cleaning the glasses
preparing a barrel for him to stand on that he might be at the
customary elevation above his horizon and putting the instrument
into his hands the mates standing near ready to make the
calculations when he gave the sun's declination

we are drifting south'ard i know said mr poke before he
commenced his sight i feel it in my bones we are at this moment
in degrees  having made a southerly drift of more than
eighty miles since yesterday noon now mind my words and see what
the sun will say about it

when the calculations were made our latitude was found to be 
degrees noah was somewhat puzzled by the difference for
which he could in no plausible way account as the observation had
been unusually good and certain but an opinionated and an ingenious
man is seldom at a loss to find a sufficient reason to establish his
own correctness or to prove the mistakes of others

ay i see how it is he said after a little cogitation the sun
must be wrong it should be no wonder if the sun did get a little
out of his track in these high cold latitudes yes yes the sun
must be wrong

i was too much delighted at being certain we were going on our
course to dispute the point and the great luminary was abandoned to
the imputation of sometimes being in error dr reasono took
occasion to say in my private ear that there was a sect of
philosophers in leaphigh who had long distrusted the accuracy of
the planetary system and who had even thrown out hints that the
earth in its annual revolution moved in a direction absolutely
contrary to that which nature had contemplated when she gave the
original polar impulse but that as regarded himself he thought
very little of these opinions as he had frequent occasion to
observe that there was a large class of monikins whose ideas always
went uphill

for two more days and as many nights we continued to drift with the
floes to the southward or as near as might be towards the haven of
our wishes on the fourth morning there was a suitable change in
the weather both thermometer and barometer rose the air became
more bland and most of our cats and dogs notwithstanding we were
still surrounded by the ice began to cast their skins dr reasono
noted these signs and stepping on the floe he brought back with
him a considerable fragment of the frozen element this was carried
to the camboose where it was subjected to the action of fire
which within a given number of minutes pretty much as a matter of
course as i thought caused it to melt the whole process was
watched with an anxiety the most intense by the whole of the
monikins however and when the result was announced the amiable
and lovely chatterissa clapped her pretty little pattes with joy
and gave all the other natural indications of delight which
characterize the emotions of that gentle sex of which she was so
bright an ornament dr reasono was not backwards in explaining the
cause of so much unusual exhilaration for hitherto her manner had
been characterized by the well-bred and sophisticated restraint
which marks high training the experiment had shown by the
infallible and scientific tests of monikin chemistry that we were
now within the influence of a steam-climate and there could no
longer be any rational doubt of our eventual arrival in the polar
basin

the result proved that the philosopher was right about noon the
floes which all that day had begun to assume what is termed a
sloppy character suddenly gave way and the walrus settled down
into her proper element with great equanimity and propriety
captain poke lost no time in unshipping the skids and a smacking
breeze that was well saturated with steam springing up from the
westward we made sail our course was due south without regard to
the ice which yielded before our bows like so much thick water and
just as the sun set we entered the open sea rioting in the
luxuriance of its genial climate in triumph

sail was carried on the ship all that night and just as the day
dawned we made the first mile-stone a proof not to be mistaken
that we were now actually within the monikin region dr reasono had
the goodness to explain to us the history of these aquatic
phenomena it would seem that when the earth exploded its entire
crust throughout the whole of this part of the world was started
upwards in such a way as to give a very uniform depth to the sea
which in no place exceeds four fathoms it follows as a
consequence that no prevalence of northerly winds can force the
icebergs beyond degrees of south latitude as they invariably
ground on reaching the outer edge of the polar bank the floes
being thin are melted of course and thus by this beneficent
prevention the monikin world is kept entirely free from the very
danger to which a vulgar mind would be the most apt to believe it is
the most exposed

a congress of nations had been held about five centuries since
which was called the holy-philo-marine-safety-and-find-the-way
alliance at this congress the high contracting parties agreed to
name a commission to make provision generally for the secure
navigation of the seas one of the expedients of this commission
which by the way is said to have been composed of very illustrious
monikins was to cause massive blocks of stone to be laid down at
measured distances throughout the whole of the basin and in which
other stone uprights were secured the necessary inscriptions were
graved on proper tablets and as we approached the one already
named i observed that it had the image of a monikin carved also in
stone with his tail extended in a right line pointing as mr poke
assured me s and by w half w i had made sufficient progress in
the monikin language to read as we glided past this watermark to
leaphigh  miles one monikin mile however we were next told
was equal to nine english statute miles and consequently we were
not so near our port as was at first supposed i expressed great
satisfaction at finding ourselves so fairly on the road however
and paid dr reasono some well-merited compliments on the high state
of civilization to which his species had evidently arrived the day
was not distant i added when it was reasonable to suppose our own
seas would have floating restaurants and cafes with suitable pot-
houses for the mariners though i did not well see how we were to
provide a substitute for their own excellent organization of mile-
stones the doctor received my compliments with becoming modesty
saying that he had no doubt mankind would do all that lay in their
power to have good eating and drinking-houses whereever they could
be established but as to the marine milestones he agreed with me
that there was little hope of their being planted until the crust
of the earth should be driven upwards so as to rise within four
fathoms of the surface of the water on the other hand captain poke
held this latter improvement very cheap he affirmed it was no sign
of civilization at all for as a man became civilized he had less
need of primers and finger-boards and as for leaphigh any
tolerable navigator could see it bore s by w half w allowing for
variation distant english miles to these objections i was
silent for i had frequent occasion to observe that men very often
underrate any advantage of which they have come into the enjoyment
by a providential interposition

just as the sun was in the meridian the cry of land ahead was
heard from aloft the monikins were all smiles and gratitude the
crew were excited by admiration and wonder and as for myself i was
literally ready to jump out of my skin not only with delight but
in some measure also from the exceeding warmth of the atmosphere
our cats and dogs began to uncase bob was obliged to unmask his
most exposed frontier by removing the union-jack and noah himself
fairly appeared on deck in his shirt and night-cap the amiable
strangers were too much occupied to be particular and i slipped
into my state-room to change my toilet to a dress of thin silk that
was painted to resemble the skin of a polar bear a contradiction
between things that is much too common in our species ever to be
deemed out of fashion

we neared the land with great rapidity impelled by a steam-breeze
and just as the sun sank in the horizon our anchor was let go in
the outer harbor of the city of aggregation




chapter xv

an arrival forms of reception several new christenings an
official document and terra firma


it is always agreeable to arrive safe at the end of a long
fatiguing and hazardous journey but the pleasure is considerably
augmented when the visit is paid to a novel region with a steam-
climate and which is peopled by a new species my own satisfaction
too was coupled with the reflection that i had been of real service
to four very interesting and well-bred strangers who had been cast
by an adverse fortune into the hands of humanity and who owed to
me a boon far more precious than life itself a restoration to their
natural and acquired rights their proper stations in society and
sacred liberty the reader will judge therefore with what inward
self-congratulation i now received the acknowledgments of the whole
monikin party and listened to their most solemn protestations ever
to consider not only all they might jointly and severally possess
in the way of estates and dignities at my entire disposal but
their persons as my slaves of course i made as light as possible
of any little service i might have done them protesting in my turn
that i looked upon the whole affair more in the light of a party of
pleasure than a tax reminding them that i had not only obtained an
insight into a new philosophy but that i was already thanks to the
decimal system a tolerable proficient in their ancient and learned
language these civilities were scarcely well over before we were
boarded by the boat of the port-captain

the arrival of a human ship was an event likely to create excitement
in a monikin country and as our approach had been witnessed for
several hours preparations had been made to give us a proper
reception the section of the academy to whom is committed the
custody of the science of indications was hastily assembled by
order of the king who by the way never speaks except through the
mouth of his oldest male first cousin who by the fundamental laws
of the realm is held responsible for all his official acts in
private the king is allowed almost as many privileges as any other
monikin and who as is due to him in simple justice is permitted
to exercise in a public point of view the functions of the eyes
ears nose conscience and tail of the monarch the savans were
active and as they proceeded with method and on well-established
principles their report was quickly made it contained as we
afterwards understood seven sheets of premises eleven of argument
sixteen of conjecture and two lines of deduction this heavy draft
on the monikin intellect was duly achieved by dividing the work into
as many parts as there were members of the section present viz
forty the substance of their labors was to say that the vessel in
sight was a strange vessel that it came to a strange country on a
strange errand being manned by strangers and that its objects were
more likely to be peaceful than warlike since the glasses of the
academy did not enable them to discover any means of annoyance with
the exception of certain wild beasts who appeared however to be
peaceably occupied in working the ship all this was sententiously
expressed in the purest monikin language the effect of the report
was to cause all hostile preparations to be abandoned

no sooner did the boat of the port-captain return to the shore with
the news that the strange ship had arrived with my lord chatterino
my lady chatterissa and dr reasono than there was a general burst
of joy along the strand in a very short time the king alias his
eldest first cousin of the male gender ordered the usual
compliments to be paid to his distinguished subjects a deputation
of young lords the hopes of leaphigh came off to receive their
colleague whilst a bevy of beautiful maidens of noble birth crowded
around the smiling and graceful chatterissa gladdening her heart
with their caressing manners and felicitations the noble pair left
us in separate boats each attended by an appropriate escort we
overlooked the little neglect of forgetting to take leave of us for
joy had quite set them both beside themselves next came a long
procession composed of high numbers all of the brown-study color
these learned and dignified persons were a deputation from the
academy which had sent forth no less than forty of its number to
receive dr reasono the meeting between these loving friends of
monikinity and of knowledge was conducted on the most approved
principles of reason each section there are forty in the academy
of leaphigh made an address to all of which the doctor returned
suitable replies always using exactly the same sentiments but
varying the subject by transpositions as dictionaries are known to
be composed by the ingenious combinations of the twenty-six letters
of the alphabet dr reasono withdrew with his coadjutors to my
surprise paying not a whit more attention to captain poke and
myself than would be paid in any highly-civilized country of
christendom on a similar occasion by a collection of the learned
to the accidental presence of two monkeys i thought this augured
badly and began to feel as became sir john goldencalf bart of
householder hall in the kingdom of great britain when my
sensations were nipped in the bud by the arrival of the officers of
registration and circulation it was the duty of the latter to give
us the proper passports to enter into and to circulate within the
country after the former had properly enregistered our numbers and
colors in such a way as to bring us within the reach of taxation
the officer of registration was very expeditious from long practice
he decided at once that i formed a new class by myself of which
of course i was no the captain and his two mates formed
another nos and bob had a class also to himself and the
honors of no and the crew formed a fresh class being numbered
according to height as the register deemed their merits to be
altogether physical next came the important point of color on
which depended the quality of the class or caste the numbers merely
indicating our respective stations in the particular divisions
after a good deal of deliberation and many interrogatories i was
enregistered as no flesh-color noah as no sea-water color
and his mates and accordingly bob as no smut-color and
the crew as nos etc tar-color the officer now called
upon an assistant to come forth with a sort of knitting-needle
heated red-hot in order to affix the official stamp to each in
succession luckily for us all noah happened to be the first to
whom the agent of the stamp-office applied to uncase and to prepare
for the operation the result was one of those bursts of eloquent
and logical vituperation and of remonstrating outcries to which
any new personal exaction never failed to give birth in the sealer
his discourse on this occasion might be divided into the several
following heads all of which were very ingeniously embellished by
the usual expletives and imagery he was not a beast to be branded
like a horse nor a slave to be treated like a congo nigger he saw
no use in applying the marks to men who were sufficiently
distinguished from monkeys already sir john had a handle before his
name and if he liked it he might carry his name behind his body
by way of counterpoise but for his part he wanted no outriggers of
the sort being satisfied with plain noah poke he was a republican
and it was anti-republican for a man to carry about with him graven
images he thought it might be even flying in the face of the
scriptures or what was worse turning his back on them he said
that the walrus had her name in good legible characters on her
starn and that might answer for both of them he protested d n
his eyes that he wouldn't be branded like a thief he incontinently
wished the keeper of the privy seal to the d -l he insisted there
was no use in the practice unless one threw all aback and went
starn foremost into society a rudeness at which human natur
revolted he knew a man in stunin'tun who had five names and he
should like to know what they would do with him if this practice
should come into fashion there he had no objection to a little
paint but no red-hot knitting-needle should make acquaintance with
his flesh so long as he walked his quarter-deck

the keeper of the seals listened to this remonstrance with singular
patience and decorum a forbearance that was probably owing to his
not understanding a word that had been said but there is a language
that is universal and it is not less easy to comprehend when a man
is in a passion than it is to comprehend any other irritated
animal the officer of the registration department on this hint
politely inquired of me if some part of his official duties were
not particularly disagreeable to no sea-water color on my
admitting that the captain was reluctant to be branded he merely
shrugged his shoulders and observed that the exactions of the
public were seldom agreeable but that duty was duty that the stamp
act was peremptory and not a foot of ours could touch leaphigh
until we were all checked off in this manner in exact conformity
with the registration i was much puzzled what to do by this
indomitable purpose to perform his duty in the officer for to own
the truth my own cuticle had quite as much aversion to the
operation as of captain poke himself it was not the principle so
much as the novelty of its application which distressed me for i
had travelled too much not to know that a stranger rarely enters a
civilized country without being more or less skinned the merest
savages only permitting him to pass unscathed it suddenly came to
my recollection that the monikins had left all the remains of their
particular stores on board consisting of an ample supply of
delicious nuts sending for a bag of the best of them i ordered it
to be put into the register's boat informing him at the same time
that i was conscious they were quite unworthy of him but that i
hoped such as they were he would allow me to make an offering of
them to his wife this attention was properly felt and received and
a few minutes afterwards a certificate in the following words was
put into my hands viz

leaphigh season of promise day of performance whereas certain
persons of the human species have lately presented themselves to be
enregistered according to the statute for the promotion of order
and classification and for the collection of contributions and
whereas these persons are yet in the second class of the animal
probation and are more subject to bodily impressions than the
higher or monikin species now know all monikins etc that they
are stamped in paint and that only by their numbers each class
among them being easily to be distinguished from the others by
outward and indelible proofs

signed

no office-color

i was told that all we had to do now was to mark ourselves with
paint or tar as we might choose the latter being recommended for
the crew taking no further trouble than to number ourselves and
when we went ashore if any of the gens-d'armes inquired why we had
not the legal impression on our persons which quite possibly would
be the case as the law was absolute in its requisitions all we had
to do was to show the certificate but if the certificate was not
sufficient we were men of the world and understood the nature of
things so well that we did not require to be taught so simple a
proposition in philosophy as that which says like causes produce
like effects and he presumed i could not have so far overrated his
merits as to have sent the whole of my nuts into his boat i avow
that i was not very sorry to hear the officer throw out these hints
for they convinced me that my journey through leaphigh would be
accompanied with less embarrassment than i had anticipated since i
now plainly perceived that monikins act on principles that are not
very essentially different from those of the human race in general

the complaisant register and the keeper of the privy seal took their
departure together when we forthwith proceeded to number ourselves
in compliance with his advice as the principle was already settled
we had no difficulty with its application noah bob myself and
the largest of the seamen being all nos and the rest ranking in
order by this time it was night the guard-boats began to appear on
the water and we deferred disembarking until morning

all hands were early afoot it had been arranged that captain poke
and myself attended by bob as a domestic were to land in order
to make a journey through the island while the walrus was to be
left in charge of the mates and the crew the latter having
permission to go ashore from time to time as is the practice with
all seamen in port there was a great deal of preliminary scrubbing
and shaving before the whole party could appear on deck properly
attired for the occasion mr poke wore a thin dress of linen
admirably designed to make him look like a sea-lion a conceit that
he said was not only agreeable to his feelings and habits but which
had a cool and pleasant character that was altogether suited to a
steam-climate for my own part i agreed with the worthy sealer
seeing but little difference between his going in this garb and his
going quite naked my dress was made on a design of my own after
the social-stake system or in other words it was so arranged as
to take an interest in half of the animals of exeter change to
which menagerie the artist by whom it had been painted was sent
expressly in order to consult nature bob wore the effigy as his
master called it of a turnspit

the monikins were by far too polished to crowd about us when we
landed with an impertinent and troublesome curiosity so far from
this we were permitted to approach the capital itself without let
or hindrance as it is less my intention to describe physical things
than to dwell upon the philosophy and the other moral aspects of the
leaphigh world little more will be said of their houses domestic
economy and other improvements in the arts than may be gathered
incidentally as the narrative shall proceed let it suffice to say
on these heads that the leaphigh monikins like men consult or
think they consult which so long as they know no better amounts
to pretty much the same thing their own convenience in all things
the pocket alone excepted and that they continue very laudably to
do as their fathers did before them seldom making changes unless
they may happen to possess the recommendation of being exotics
when indeed they are sometimes adopted probably on account of
their possessing the merit of having been proved suitable to another
state of things

among the first persons we met on entering the great square of
aggregation as the capital of leaphigh is called when rendered into
english was my lord chatterino he was gayly promenading with a
company of young nobles who all seemed to be enjoying their youth
health rank and privileges with infinite gusto we met this party
in a way to render an escape from mutual recognition impossible at
first i thought from his averted eye that it was the intention of
our late shipmate to consider our knowledge of each other as one of
those accidental acquaintances which it is known we all form at
watering-places on journeys or in the country and which it is
ill-mannered to press upon others in town or as captain poke
afterwards expressed it like the intimacy between an englishman and
a yankee that has been formed in the house of the latter on better
wine than is met with anywhere else and which was never yet known
to withstand the influence of a british fog why sir john the
sealer added i once tuck he meant to say took not tucked a
countryman of yours under my wing at stunin'tun during the last
war he was a prisoner as we make prisoners that is he went and
did pretty much as he pleased and the fellow had the best of
everything molasses that a spoon would stand up in pork that would
do to slush down a topmast and new england rum that a king might
set down to but could not get up from well what was the end on't
why as sure as we are among these monkeys the fellow booked me
had i booked but the half of what he guzzled the amount i do
believe would have taken the transaction out of any justice's court
in the state he said my molasses was meagre the pork lean and the
liquor infernal there were truth and gratitude for you he gave the
whul account too as a specimen of what he called american living

hereupon i reminded my companion that an englishman did not like to
receive even favors on compulsion that when he meets a stranger in
his own country and is master of his own actions no man
understands better what true hospitality is as i hoped one day to
show him at householder hall as to his first remark he ought to
remember that an englishman considered america as no more than the
country and that it would be ill-mannered to press an acquaintance
made there

noah like most other men was very reasonable on all subjects that
did not interfere with his prejudices or his opinions and he very
readily admitted the general justice of my reply

it's pretty much as you say sir john he continued in england
you may press men but it won't do to press hospitality get a
volunteer in this way and he is as good a fellow as heart can wish
i shouldn't have cared so much about the chap's book if he had said
nothin ag'in the rum why sir john when the english bombarded
stunin'tun with eighteen pounders i proposed to load our old twelve
with a gallon out of the very same cask for i do think it would
have huv the shot the best part of a mile

 but this digression is leading me from the narrative my lord
chatterino turned his head a little on one side as we were passing
and i was deliberating whether under the circumstances it would be
well-bred to remind him of our old acquaintance when the question
was settled by the decision of captain poke who placed himself in
such a position that it was no easy matter to get round him through
him or over him or who laid himself what he called athwart
hawse

good morning my lord said the straightforward seaman who
generally went at a subject as he went at a seal a fine warm day
and the smell of the land after so long a passage is quite
agreeable to the nose whatever its ups and downs may be to the
legs

the companions of the young peer looked amazed and some of them i
thought notwithstanding gravity and earnestness are rather
characteristic of the monikin physiognomy betrayed a slight
disposition to laugh not so with my lord chatterino himself

he examined us a moment through a glass and then seemed suddenly
and on the whole agreeably struck at seeing us

how goldencalf he cried in surprise you in leaphigh this is
indeed an unexpected satisfaction for it will now be in my power to
prove some of the facts that i am telling my friends by actual
observation here are two of the humans gents of whom i was but
this moment giving you some account 

observing a disposition to merriment in his associates he
continued looking exceedingly grave 

restrain yourselves gentlemen i pray you these are very worthy
people i do assure you in their own way and are not at all to be
ridiculed i scarcely know even in our own marine a better or a
bolder navigator than this honest seaman and as for the one in the
parti-colored skin i will take upon myself to say that he is
really a person of some consideration in his own little circle he
is i believe a member of par par par am i right sir john a
member of 

parliament my lord an mp

ay i thought i had it an mp or a member of parliament in his
own country which i dare say now is some such thing among his
people as a public proclaimer of those laws which come from his
majesty's eldest first cousin of the masculine gender may be among
us some such thing eh now eh is it not sir john

i dare say it is my lord

all very true chatterino put in one of the young monikins with
a very long elaborated tail which he carried nearly perpendicular-
-but what would be even a lawmaker to say nothing of law-breakers
like ourselves among men you should remember my dear fellow that
a mere title or a profession is not the criterion of true
greatness but that the prodigy of a village may be a very common
monikin in town

poh-poh interrupted lord chatterino thou art ever for refining
hightail sir john goldencalf is a very respectable person in the
island of a a a what do you call that said island of yours
goldencalf a a 

great britain my lord

ay great breeches sure enough yet he is a respectable person i
can take it upon myself to say with confidence a very respectable
person in great breeches i dare say he owns no small portion of the
island himself how much now sir john if the truth were told

only the estate and village of householder my lord with a few
scattered manors here and there

well that is a very pretty thing there can be no doubt then you
have money at use

and who is the debtor sneeringly inquired the jack-a-napes
hightail

no other my lord hightail than the realm of great britain

exquisite that egad a noble's fortune in the custody of the
realm of a greek a 

great breeches interrupted my lord chatterino who
notwithstanding he swore he was excessively angry with his friend
for his obstinate incredulity very evidently had to exercise some
forbearance to keep from joining in the general laugh it is a very
respectable country i do protest and i scarcely remember to have
tasted better gooseberries than they grow in that very island

what have they really gardens chatterino

certainly after a fashion and houses and public conveyances and
even universities

you do not mean to say certainly that they have a system

why as to system i believe they are a little at sixes and sevens
i really can't take it upon myself to say that they have a system

oh yes my lord of a certainty we have one the social stake
system

ask the creature whispered audibly the filthy coxcomb hightail
if he himself now has any income

how is it sir john have you an income

yes my lord of one hundred and twelve thousand sovereigns a
year

of what of what demanded two or three voices with well-bred
subdued eagerness

of sovereigns why that means kings

it would appear that the leaphighers while they obey only the
king's eldest first cousin of the masculine gender perform all
their official acts in the name of the sovereign himself for whose
person and character they pretty uniformly express the profoundest
veneration just as we men express admiration for a virtue that we
never practise my declaration therefore produced a strong
sensation and i was soon required to explain myself this i did by
simply stating the truth

oh gold yclept sovereigns exclaimed three or four laughing
heartily why then your famous great breeches people after all
chatterino are so little advanced in civilization as to use gold
harkee signior a a boldercraft have you no currency in
promises

i do not know sir that i rightly comprehend the question

why we poor barbarians sir who live as you see us only in a
state of simplicity and nature there was irony in every syllable
the impudent scoundrel uttered we poor wretches or rather our
ancestors made the discovery that for the purposes of convenience
having as you perceive no pockets it might be well to convert all
our currency into promises now i would ask if you have any of
that coin

not as coin sir but as collateral to coin we have plenty

he speaks of collaterals in currency as if he were discussing a
pedigree are you really mynherr shouldercalf so little advanced
in your country as not to know the immense advantages of a currency
of promises

as i do not understand exactly what the nature of this currency is
sir i cannot answer as readily as i could wish

let us explain it to him for i vow i am really curious to hear
his answer chatterino do you who have some knowledge of the
thing's habits be our interpreter

the matter is thus sir john about five hundred years ago our
ancestors having reached that pass in civilization when they came
to dispense with the use of pockets began to find it necessary to
substitute a new currency for that of the metals which it was
inconvenient to carry of which they might be robbed and which also
was liable to be counterfeited the first expedient was to try a
lighter substitute laws were passed giving value to linen and
cotton in the raw material then compounded and manufactured next
written on and reduced in bulk until having passed through the
several gradations of wrapping-paper brown-paper foolscap and
blotting-paper and having set the plan fairly at work and got
confidence thoroughly established the system was perfected by a
coup de main promises in words were substituted for all other
coin you see the advantage at a glance a monikin can travel
without pockets or baggage and still carry a million the money
cannot be counterfeited nor can it be stolen or burned

but my lord does it not depreciate the value of property

just the contrary an acre that formerly could be bought for one
promise would now bring a thousand

this certainly is a great improvement unless frequent failures 


not at all there has not been a bankruptcy in leaphigh since the
law was passed making promises a legal tender

 i wonder no chancellor of the exchequer ever thought of this at
home

so much for your great breeches chatterino and then there was
another and a very general laugh i never before felt so deep a
sense of national humility

as they have universities cried another coxcomb perhaps this
person has attended one of them

indeed sir i answered i am regularly graduated

it is not easy to see what he has done with his knowledge for
though my sight is none of the worst i cannot trace the smallest
sign of a cauda about him

ah lord chatterino good-naturedly exclaimed the inhabitants of
great breeches carry their brains in their heads

their heads

heads

that's excellent by his majesty's prerogative here's
civilization with a vengeance

i now thought that the general ridicule would overwhelm me two or
three came closer as if in pity or curiosity and at last one
cried out that i actually wore clothes

clothes the wretch chatterino do all your human friends wear
clothes

the young peer was obliged to confess the truth and then there
arose such a clamor as may be fancied took place among the peacocks
when they discovered the daw among them in masquerade human nature
could endure no more and bowing to the company i wished lord
chatterino very hurriedly good-morning and proceeded towards the
tavern

don't forget to step into chatterino house goldencalf before you
sail cried my late fellow-traveller looking over his shoulder
and nodding in quite a friendly way towards me

king exclaimed captain poke that blackguard ate a whole bread-
locker-full of nuts on our outward passage and now he tells us to
step into his chatterino house before we sail

i endeavored to pacify the sealer by an appeal to his philosophy
it was true that men never forgot obligations and were always
excessively anxious to repay them but the monikins were an
exceedingly instructed species they thought more of their minds
than of their bodies as was plain by comparing the smallness of the
latter with the length and development of the seat of reason and
one of his experience should know that good-breeding is decidedly an
arbitrary quality and that we ought to respect its laws however
opposed to our own previous practices

i dare say friend noah you may have observed some material
difference in the usages of paris for instance and those of
stunin'tun

that i have sir john that i have and altogether to the advantage
of stunin'tun be they

we are all addicted to the weakness of believing our own customs
best and it requires that we should travel much before we are able
to decide on points so nice

and do you not call me a traveller haven't i been sixteen times a-
sealing twice a-whaling without counting my cruise overland and
this last run to leaphigh

ay you have gone over much land and much water mr poke but your
stay in any given place has been just long enough to find fault
usages must be worn like a shoe before one can judge of the fit

it is possible noah would have retorted had not mrs vigilance
lynx at that moment come wriggling by in a way to show she was
much satisfied with her safe return home to own the truth while
striving to find apologies for it i had been a little contraire as
the french term it by the indifference of my lord chatterino
which in my secret heart i was not slow in attributing to the
manner in which a peer of the realm of leaphigh regarded de haut en
bas a mere baronet of great britain or great breeches as the
young noble so pertinaciously insisted on terming our illustrious
island now as mrs vigilance was of russet-color a caste of an
inferior standing i had little doubt that she would be as glad to
own an intimacy with sir john goldencalf of householder hall as the
other might be willing to shuffle it off

good-morrow good mrs vigilance i said familiarly endeavoring
to wriggle in a way that would have shaken a tail had it been my
good fortune to be the owner of one good-morrow good mrs
vigilance i'm glad to meet you again on shore

i do not remember that mrs vigilance during the whole period of
our acquaintance was particularly squeamish or topping in her
deportment on the contrary she had rather made herself remarkable
for a modest and commendable reserve but on the present occasion
she disappointed all reasonable expectation by shrinking on one
side uttering a slight scream and hurrying past as if she thought
we might bite her indeed i can only compare her deportment to that
of a female of our own who is so full of vanity as to fancy all
eyes on her and who gives herself airs about a dog or a spider
because she thinks they make her look so much the more interesting
conversation was quite out of the question for the duenna hurried
on bending her head downwards as if heartily ashamed of an
involuntary weakness

well good madam said noah whose stern eye followed her
movements until she was quite lost in the crowd you would have had
a sleepless v'yage if i had foreimagined this sir john these
people stare at us as if we were wild beasts

i cannot say i am of your way of thinking captain poke to me they
seem to take no more notice of us than we should take of two curs
in the streets of london

i begin now to understand what the parsons mean when they talk of
the lost condition of man it's ra'ally awful to witness to what a
state of unfeelingness a people can be abandoned bob get out of
the way you grinning blackguard

hereupon bob received a salutation which would have demolished his
stern-frame had it not been for the unionjack just then i was glad
to see dr reasono advancing towards us surrounded by a group of
attentive listeners all of whom by their years gravity and
deportment i made no question were savants as he drew near i
found he was discoursing of the marvels of his late voyage when
within six feet of us the whole party stopped the doctor continuing
to descant with a very proper gesticulation and in a way to show
that his subject was of infinite interest to his listeners
accidentally turning his eye in our direction he caught a glimpse
of our figures and making a few hurried apologies to those around
him the excellent philosopher came eagerly forward with both hands
extended here was a difference indeed between his treatment and
that of lord chatterino and the duenna the salutation was warmly
returned and the doctor and myself stepped a little apart as he
lost no time in informing me he wished to say a word in private

my dear sir john the philosopher began our arrival has been the
most happily-timed thing imaginable all leaphigh by this time is
filled with the subject and you can scarcely conceive the
importance that is attached to the event new sources of trade
scientific discoveries phenomena both moral and physical and
results that it is thought may serve to raise the monikin
civilization still higher than ever fortunately the academy holds
its most solemn meeting of the year this very day and i have been
formally requested to give the assembly an outline of those events
which have lately passed before my eyes the king's eldest first
cousin of the masculine gender is to attend openly and it is even
conjectured in a way to be quite authentic that the king himself
will be present in his own royal person

how i exclaimed have you a mode in leaphigh of rendering
conjectures certain

beyond a doubt sir or what would our civilization be worth as to
the king's majesty we always deal in the most direct ambiguities
now as respects many of our ceremonies the sovereign is known
morally to be present when he may be actually and physically eating
his dinner at the other extremity of the island this important
illustration of the royal ubiquity is effected by means of a legal
fiction on the other hand the king often indulges his natural
propensities such as curiosity love of fun or detestation of
ennui by coming in person when by the court fiction he is
thought to be seated on his throne in his own royal palace oh as
to all these little accomplishments and graces in the art of truths
we are behind no people in the universe

i beg pardon doctor so his majesty is expected to be at the
academy this morning

in a private box now this affair is of the last importance to me
as a savant to you as a human being for it will have a tendency to
raise your whole species in the monikin estimation and lastly to
learning it will be indispensably necessary that you should attend
with as many of your companions as possible more especially the
better specimens i was coming down to the landing in the hope of
meeting you and a messenger has gone off to the ship to require
that the people be sent ashore forthwith you will have a tribune to
yourselves and really i do not like to express beforehand what i
think concerning the degree of attention you will all receive but
this much i think i can say you will see

this proposition doctor has taken me a little by surprise and i
hardly know what answer to give

you cannot say no sir john for should his majesty hear that you
have refused to come to a meeting at which he is to be present it
would seriously and i might add justly offend him nor could i
answer for the consequences

why i was told that all the power was in the hands of his
majesty's eldest first cousin of the masculine gender in which case
i thought i might snap my fingers at his majesty himself

not in opinion sir john which is one of the three estates of the
government ours is a government of three estates viz the law
opinion and practice by law the king rules by practice his cousin
rules and by opinion the king again rules thus is the strong
point of practice balanced by law and opinion this it is that
constitutes the harmony and perfection of the system no it would
never do to offend his majesty

although i did not very well comprehend the doctor's argument yet
as i had often found in human society theories political moral
theological and philosophical that everybody had faith in and
which nobody understood i thought discussion useless and gave up
the point by promising the doctor to be at the academy in half an
hour which was the time named for our appearance taking the
necessary directions to find the place we separated he to hasten
to make his preparations and i to reach the tavern in order to
deposit our baggage that no decency might be overlooked on an
occasion so solemn




chapter xvi

an inn debts paid in advance and a singular touch of human nature
found closely incorporated with monikin nature


we soon secured rooms ordered dinner brushed our clothes and made
the other little arrangements that it was necessary to observe for
the credit of the species everything being ready we left the inn
and hurried towards the palais des arts et des sciences we had
not got out of sight of the inn however before one of its garcons
was at our heels with a message from his mistress he told us in
very respectful tones that his master was out and that he had
taken with him the key of the strong-box that there was not
actually money enough in the drawer to furnish an entertainment for
such great persons as ourselves and she had taken the liberty to
send us a bill receipted with a request that we would make a small
advance rather than reduce her to the mortification of treating
such distinguished guests in an unworthy manner the bill read as
follows 

no parti-color and friends

to no grape-color dr
to use of apartments with meals and lights as per
agreement pp per diem one day pp 
by cash advanced 
   
 balance due pp 

this seems all right i observed to noah but i am at this
moment as penniless as the good woman herself i really do not see
what we are to do unless bob sends her back his store of nuts 

harkee my nimble-go-hop put in the seaman what is your
pleasure

the waiter referred to the bill as expressing his mistress's wants

what are these p p that i find noted in the bill play or pay
hey

promises of course your honor

oh then you desire fifty promises to provide our dinner

nothing more sir with that sum you shall dine like noblemen ay
sir like aldermen

i was delighted to find that this worthy class of beings have the
same propensities in all countries

here take a hundred answered noah snapping his fingers and
make no bones of it and harkee my worthy lay out every farthing
of them in the fare let there be good cheer and no one will
grumble at the bill i am ready to buy the inn and all it holds at
need

the waiter departed well satisfied with these assurances and
apparently in the anticipation of good vails for his own trouble

we soon got into the current that was setting towards our place of
destination on reaching the gate we found that we were anxiously
expected for there was an attendant in waiting who instantly
conducted us to the seats that were provided for our special
reception it is always agreeable to be among the privileged and i
must own that we were all not a little flattered on finding that an
elevated tribune had been prepared for us in the centre of the
rotunda in which the academy held its sittings so that we could
see and be seen by every individual of the crowded assembly the
whole crew even to the negro cook had preceded us an additional
compliment that i did not fail to acknowledge by suitable
salutations to all the members present after the first feelings of
pleasure and surprise were a little abated i had leisure to look
about me and to survey the company

the academicians occupied the whole of the body of the rotunda the
space taken up by the erection of our temporary tribune alone
excepted while there were sofas chairs tribunes and benches
arranged for the spectators in the outer circles and along the
side-walls of the hall as the edifice itself was very large and
mind had so essentially reduced matter in the monikin species there
could not have been less than fifty thousand tails present just
before the ceremonies commenced dr reasono approached our
tribbune passing from one to another of the party saying a
pleasant and encouraging word to each in a way to create high
expectations in us all as to what was to follow we were so very
evidently honored and distinguished that i struggled hard to subdue
any unworthy feeling of pride as unbecoming human meekness and in
order to maintain a philosophical equanimity under the
manifestations of respect and gratitude that i knew were about to be
lavished upon even the meanest of our party the doctor was yet in
the midst of his pointed attentions when the king's eldest first
cousin of the masculine gender entered and the business of the
meeting immediately began i profited by a short pause however to
say a few words to my companions i told them that there would soon
be a serious demand on their modesty we had performed a great and
generous exploit and it did not become us to lessen its merit by
betraying a vainglorious self-esteem i implored them all to take
pattern by me promising in the end that their new friends would
trebly prize their hardihood self-denial and skill

there was a new member of the academy of latent sympathies to be
received and installed a long discourse was read by one of this
department of the monikin learning which pointed out and enlarged
on the rare merits of the new academician he was followed by the
latter who in a very elaborate production that consumed just
fifty-five minutes in the reading tried all he could to persuade
the audience that the defunct was a loss to the world that no
accident or application would ever repair and that he himself was
precisely the worst person who could have been selected to be his
successor i was a little surprised at the perfect coolness with
which the learned body listened to a reproach that was so very
distinctly and perseveringly thrown as it were into their very
teeth but a more intimate acquaintance with monikin society
satisfied me that any one might say just what he pleased so long
as he allowed that every one else was an excellent fellow and he
himself the poorest devil going when the new member had
triumphantly established his position and just as i thought the
colleagues were bound in common honesty to reconsider their vote
he concluded and took his seat among them with quite as much
assurance as the best philosopher of them all

after a short pause and an abundance of felicitations on his
excellent and self-abasing discourse the newly admitted member
again rose and began to read an essay on some discoveries he had
made in the science of latent sympathies according to his account
of the matter every monikin possessed a fluid which was invisible
like the animalcula which pervade nature and which required only to
be brought into command and to be reduced into more rigid laws to
become the substitute for the senses of sight touch taste
hearing and smelling this fluid was communicable and had already
been so far rendered subject to the will as to make it of service
in seeing in the dark in smelling when the operator had a bad cold
in tasting when the palate was down and in touching by proxy ideas
had been transmitted through its agency sixty-two leagues in one
minute and a half two monikins who were afflicted with diseased
tails had during the last two years been insulated and saturated
and had then lost those embellishments by operations a quantity of
the fluid having been substituted in their places so happily that
the patients fancied themselves more than ever conspicuous for the
length and finesse of their caudce an experiment had also been
successfully tried on a member of the lower house of parliament
who being married to a monikina of unusual mind had for a long
time been supplied with ideas from this source although his partner
was compelled to remain at home in order to superintend the
management of their estate forty-two miles from town during the
whole session he particularly recommended to government the
promotion of this science as it might be useful in obtaining
evidence for the purposes of justice in detecting conspiracies in
collecting the taxes and selecting candidates for trusts of a
responsible nature the suggestion was well received by the king's
cousin more especially those parts that alluded to sedition and the
revenue

this essay was also perfectly well received by the savans for i
afterwards found very little came amiss to the academy and the
members named a committee forthwith to examine into the facts
concerning invisible and unknown fluids their agency importance
and relations to monikin happiness

we were next favored with a discussion on the different
significations of the word gorstchwzyb which rendered into
english means eh the celebrated philologist who treated the
subject discovered amazing ingenuity in expatiating on its
ramifications and deductions first he tried the letters by
transpositions by which he triumphantly proved that it was derived
from all the languages of the ancients the same process showed that
it possessed four thousand and two different significations he next
reasoned most ably and comprehensively for ten minutes backwards
and forwards using no other word but this applied in its various
senses after which he incontrovertibly established that this
important part of speech was so useful as to be useless and he
concluded by a proposition in which the academy coincided by
acclamation that it should be forever and incontinently expunged
from the leaphigh vocabulary as the vote was carried by
acclamation the king's cousin arose and declared that the writer
who should so far offend against good taste as hereafter to make
use of the condemned word should have two inches cut off the
extremity of his tail a shudder among the ladies who i afterwards
ascertained loved to carry their caudae as high as our women like
to carry their heads proved the severity of the decree

an experienced and seemingly much respected member now arose to make
the following proposal he said it was known that the monikin
species were fast approaching perfection that the increase of mind
and the decrease of matter were so very apparent as to admit of no
denial that in his own case he found his physical powers diminish
daily while his mental acquired new distinctness and force that he
could no longer see without spectacles hear without a tube or
taste without high seasoning from all this he inferred that they
were drawing near to some important change and he wished that
portion of the science of latent sympathies which was connected with
the unknown fluid just treated on might be referred to a committee
on the whole in order to make some provision for the wants of a
time when monikins should finally lose their senses there was
nothing to say against a proposition so plausible and it was
accepted nemine contradicente with the exception of a few in the
minority

there was now a good deal of whispering much wagging of tails and
other indications that the real business of the meeting was about to
be touched upon all eyes were turned on dr reasono who after a
suitable pause entered a tribune prepared for solemn occasions and
began his discourse

the philosopher who having committed his essay to memory spoke
extempore commenced with a beautiful and most eloquent apostrophe
to learning and to the enthusiasm which glows in the breasts of all
her real votaries rendering them alike indifferent to their
personal ease their temporal interests danger suffering and
tribulations of the spirit after this exordium which was
pronounced to be unique for its simplicity and truth he entered at
once on the history of his own recent adventures

first alluding to the admirable character of that leaphigh usage
which prescribes the journey of trial our philosopher spoke of the
manner in which he had been selected to accompany my lord chatterino
on an occasion so important to his future hopes he dwelt on the
physical preparations the previous study and the moral machinery
that he had employed with his pupil before they quitted town all
of which there is reason to think were well fitted to their
objects as he was constantly interrupted by murmurs of applause
after some time spent in dilating on these points i had at length
the satisfaction to find him mrs lynx and their two wards fairly
setting out on a journey which as he very justly mentioned proved
to be pregnant with events of so much importance to knowledge in
general to the happiness of the species and to several highly
interesting branches of monikin science in particular i say the
satisfaction for to own the truth i was eager to witness the
effect that would be made on the monikin sensibilities when he came
to speak of my own discernment in detecting their real characters
beneath the contumely and disgrace in which it had been my good
fortune to find them the promptitude with which i had stepped
forward to their relief and the liberality and courage with which i
had furnished the means and encountered the risks that were
necessary to restore them to their native land the anticipation of
this human triumph could not but diffuse a general satisfaction in
our own tribune even the common mariners as they recalled the
dangers through which they had passed feeling a consciousness of
deserving mingled with that soothing sentiment which is ever the
companion of a merited reward as the philosopher drew nearer to the
time when it would be necessary to speak of us i threw a look of
triumph at lord chatterino which however failed of its intended
effect the young peer continuing to whisper to his noble companions
with just is much self-importance and coolness as if he had not been
one of the rescued captives

dr reasono was justly celebrated among his colleagues for
ingenuity and eloquence the excellent morals that he threw into
every possible opening of his subject the beauty of the figures
with which they were illustrated and the masculine tendencies of
his argument gave general delight to the audience the journey of
trial was made to appear what it had been intended to be by the
fathers and sages of the leaphigh institutions a probation replete
with admonitions and instruction the aged and experienced who had
grown callous by time could not conceal their exultation the
mature and suffering looked grave and full of meditation while the
young and sanguine fairly trembled and for once doubted but as
the philosopher led his party from precipice to precipice in safety
as rocks were scaled and seductive valleys avoided a common feeling
of security began to extend itself among the audience and we all
followed him in his last experiment among the ice with that sort of
blind confidence which the soldier comes in time to entertain in
the orders of a tried and victorious general

the doctor was graphic in his account of the manner in which he and
his wards plunged among these new trials the lovely chatterissa
for all his travelling companions were present bent aside her head
and blushed as the philosopher alluded to the manner in which the
pure flame that glowed in her gentle bosom resisted the chill
influence of that cold region and when he recited an ardent
declaration that my lord chatterino had made on the centre of a
floe and the kind and amorous answer of his mistress i thought the
applause of the old academicians would have actually brought the
vaulted dome clattering about our ears

at length he reached the point in the narrative where the amiable
wanderers fell in with the sealers on that unknown island to which
chance and an adverse fortune had unhappily led them in their
pilgrimage i had taken measures secretly to instruct mr poke and
the rest of my companions as to the manner in which it became us to
demean ourselves while the doctor was acquainting the academy with
that first outrage committed by human cupidity or the seizure of
himself and friends we were to rise in a body and turning our
faces a little on one side veil our eyes in sign of shame less
than this it struck me could scarcely be done without manifesting
an improper indifference to monikin rights and more than this
might have been identifying ourselves with the particular
individuals of the species who had perpetrated the wrong but there
was no occasion to exhibit this delicate attention to our learned
hosts the doctor with a refinement of feeling that did credit
indeed to monikin civilization gave an ingenious turn to the whole
affair which at once removed all cause of shame from our species
and which if it left reason for any to blush by a noble act of
disinterestedness threw the entire onus of the obligation on
himself instead of dwelling on the ruthless manner in which he and
his friends had been seized the worthy doctor very tranquilly
informed his listeners that finding himself by hazard brought in
contact with another species and that the means of pushing
important discoveries were unexpectedly placed in his power
conscious it had long been a desideratum with the savans to obtain a
nearer view and more correct notions of human society believing he
had a discretion in the matter of his wards and knowing that the
inhabitants of leaplow a republic which all disliked were
seriously talking of sending out an expedition for this very
purpose he had promptly decided to profit by events to push
inquiry to the extent of his abilities and to hazard all in the
cause of learning and truth by at once engaging the vessel of the
sealers and sailing without dread of consequences forthwith into
the very bosom of the world of man

i have listened with awe to the thunder of the tropics i have held
my breath as the artillery of a fleet vomited forth its fire and
rent the air with sudden concussions i have heard the roar of the
tumbling river of the canadas and i have stood aghast at the
crashing of a forest in a tornado but never before did i feel so
life-stirring so thrilling an emotion of surprise alarm and
sympathy as that which arose within me at the burst of
commendation and delight with which this announcement of self-
devotion and enterprise was received by the audience tails waved
pattes met each other in ecstasy voice whistled to voice and there
was one common cry of exultation of rapture and of glorification
at this proof not of monikin for that would have been frittering
away the triumph but at this proof of leaphigh courage

during the clamor i took an opportunity to express my satisfaction
at the handsome manner in which our friend the doctor had passed
over an acknowledged human delinquency and the ingenuity with which
he had turned the whole of the unhappy transaction to the glory of
leaphigh noah answered that the philosopher had certainly shown a
knowledge of human natur and he presumed of monikin natur in the
matter no one would now dispute his statement since as he knew by
experience no one was so likely to be set down as a liar as he who
endeavored to unsettle the good opinion that either a community or
an individual entertained of himself this was the way at
stunin'tun and he believed this was pretty much the way at new
york or he might say with the whole arth from pole to pole as for
himself however he owned he should like to have a few minutes
private conversation with the sealer in question to hear his
account of the matter he didn't know any owner in his part of the
world who would bear a captain out should be abandon a v'yage in
this way on no better security than the promises of a monkey and
of a monkey too who must of necessity be an utter stranger to
him

when the tumult of applause had a little abated dr reasono
proceeded with his narrative he touched lightly on the
accommodations of the schooner which he gave us reason to think
were altogether of a quality beneath the condition of her
passengers and he added that falling in with a larger and fairer
vessel which was making a passage between bombay and great britain
he profited by the occasion to exchange ships this vessel touched
at the island of st helena where according to the doctor's
account of the matter he found means to pass the greater part of a
week on shore

of the island of st helena he gave a long scientific and
certainly an interesting account it was reported to be volcanic by
the human savans he said but a minute examination and a comparison
of the geological formation etc had quite satisfied him that
their own ancient account which was contained in the mineralogical
works of leaphigh was the true one or in other words that this
rock was a fragment of the polar world that had been blown away at
the great eruption and which had become separated from the rest of
the mass at this spot where it had fallen and become a fixture of
the ocean here the doctor produced certain specimens of rock which
he submitted to the learned present inviting their attention to its
character and asking with great mineralogical confidence if it
did not intimately resemble a well-known stratum of a mountain
within two leagues of the very spot they were in this triumphant
proof of the truth of his proposition was admirably received and
the philosopher was in particular rewarded by the smiles of all the
females present for ladies usually are well pleased with any
demonstration that saves them the trouble of comparison and
reflection

before quitting this branch of his subject the doctor observed
that interesting as were these proofs of the accuracy of their
histories and of the great revolutions of inanimate nature there
was another topic connected with st helena which he felt certain
would excite a lively emotion in the breasts of all who heard him
at the period of his visit the island had been selected as a prison
for a great conqueror and disturber of his fellow-creatures and
public attention was much drawn to the spot by this circumstance
few men coming there who did not permit all their thoughts to be
absorbed by the past acts and the present fortunes of the individual
in question as for himself there was of course no great
attraction in any events connected with mere human greatness the
little struggles and convulsions of the species containing no
particular interest for a devotee of the monikin philosophy but the
manner in which all eyes were drawn in one direction afforded him a
liberty of action that he had eagerly improved in a way that he
humbly trusted would not be thought altogether unworthy of their
approbation while searching for minerals among the cliffs his
attention had been drawn to certain animals that are called monkeys
in the language of those regions which from very obvious
affinities of a physical nature there was some reason to believe
might have had a common origin with the monikin species the academy
would at once see how desirable it was to learn all the interesting
particulars of the habits language customs marriages funerals
religious opinions traditions state of learning and general moral
condition of this interesting people with a view to ascertain
whether they were merely one of those abortions to which it is
known nature is in the practice of giving birth in the outward
appearance of their own species or whether as several of their
best writers had plausibly maintained they were indeed a portion of
those whom they had been in the habit of designating as the lost
monikins he had succeeded in getting access to a family of these
beings and in passing an entire day in their society the result of
his investigations was that they were truly of the monikin family
retaining much of the ingenuity and many of the spiritual notions of
their origin but with their intellects sadly blunted and perhaps
their improvable qualities annihilated by the concussion of the
elements that had scattered them abroad upon the face of the earth
houseless hopeless regionless wanderers the vicissitudes of
climate and a great alteration of habits had certainly wrought
some physical changes but there still remained sufficient
scientific identity to prove they were monikins they even retained
in their traditions some glimmerings of the awful catastrophe by
which they were separated from the rest of their fellow-creatures
but these necessarily were vague and profitless having touched on
several other points connected with these very extraordinary facts
the doctor concluded by saying that he saw but one way in which this
discovery could be turned to any practical advantage beyond the
confirmation it afforded of the truth of their own annals he
suggested the expediency of fitting out expeditions to go among
these islands and seize upon a number of families which being
transported into leaphigh might found a race of useful menials
who while they would prove much less troublesome than those who
possessed all the knowledge of monikins would probably be found
more intelligent and useful than any domestic animal which they at
present owned this happy application of the subject met with
decided commendation i observed that most of the elderly females
put their heads together on the spot and appeared to be
congratulating each other on the prospect of being speedily relieved
from their household cares

dr reasono next spoke of his departure from st helena and of his
finally landing in portugal here agreeably to his account he
engaged certain savoyards to act as his couriers and guides during a
tour he intended to make through portugal spain switzerland
france etc etc etc i listened with admiration never before
had i so lively a perception of the vast difference that is effected
in our views of matters and things by the agency of an active
philosophy as was now furnished by the narrative of the speaker
instead of complaining of the treatment he had received and of the
degradations to which he and his companions had been subjected he
spoke of it all as so much prudent submission on his part to the
customs of the countries in which he happened to find himself and
as the means of ascertaining a thousand important facts both moral
and physical which he proposed to submit to the academy in a
separate memoir another day at present he was admonished by the
clock to conclude and he would therefore hasten his narrative as
much as possible

the doctor with great ingenuousness confessed that he could gladly
have passed a year or two longer in those distant and highly
interesting portions of the earth but he could not forget that he
had a duty to perform to the friends of two noble families the
journey of trial had been completed under the most favorable
auspices and the ladies naturally became anxious to return home
they had accordingly passed into great britain a country remarkable
for maritime enterprise where he immediately commenced the
necessary preparations for their sailing a ship had been procured
under the promise of allowing it to be freighted free of custom-
house charges with the products of leaphigh a thousand
applications had been made to him for permission to be of his party
the natives naturally enough wishing to see a civilized country but
prudence had admonished him to accept of those only who were the
most likely to make themselves useful the king of great britain no
mean prince in human estimation had committed his only son and
heir-apparent to his care with a view to his improvement by
travelling and the lord high admiral himself had asked permission
to take command of an expedition that was of so much importance to
knowledge in general and to his own profession in particular

here dr reasono ascended our tribune and presented bob to the
academy as the prince-royal of great britain and captain poke as
her lord high admiral he pointed out certain peculiarities about
the former the smut in particular which had become pretty
effectually incorporated with the skin as so many signs of royal
birth and ordering the youngster to uncase he drew forth the
union-jack that the lad carefully kept about his nether part as a
fender and exhibited it as his armorial bearings a modification of
its uses that would not have been very far out of the way had
another limb been substituted for the agent as for captain poke he
requested the academicians to study his nautical air in general as
furnishing sufficient proof of his pursuits and of the ordinary
appearance of human sea-men

 turning to me i was then introduced to all present as the
travelling governor and personal attendant of bob and as a very
respectable person in my way he added that he believed also i
had some pretension to be the discoverer of something that was
called the social-stake system which he dared to say was a very
creditable discovery for one of my opportunities

by this prompt substitution of employments i found i had
effectually changed places with the cabin-boy who instead of
waiting on me was in future to receive that trifling attention at
my hands the mates were presented as two rear-admirals at nurse
and the crew was said to be composed of so many post-captains in the
navy of great britain to conclude the audience was given to
understand that we were all brought to leaphigh like the minerals
from st helena as so many specimens of the human species

i shall not deny that dr reasono had taken a very different view of
himself and his acts as well as of me and my acts from those i had
all along entertained myself and yet on reflection it is so
common to consider ourselves in lights very different from those in
which we are viewed by others that i could not on the whole
complain as much of his representations as i had at first thought it
might become me to do at all events i was completely spared the
necessity of blushing for my generosity and disinterestedness and
in other respects was saved the pain of viewing any part of my own
conduct under a consciousness of its attracting attention by its
singularity on the score of merit i must say nevertheless that i
was both surprised and a little indignant but the sudden and
unexpected turn that had been given to the whole affair threw me so
completely off my centre that for the life of me i could not say a
word in my own behalf to make the matter worse that monkey
chatterino nodded to me kindly as if he would show the spectators
that on the whole he thought me a very good sort of fellow

after the lecture was over the audience approached to examine us
taking a great many amiable liberties with our persons and
otherwise showing that we were deemed curiosities worthy of their
study the king's cousin too was not neglectful of us but he had
it announced to the assembly that we were entirely welcome to
leaphigh and that out of respect to dr reasono we were all
promoted to the dignity of honorary monikins for the entire
period of our stay in the country he also caused it to be
proclaimed that if the boys annoyed us in the streets they should
have their tails curled with birch curling-irons as for the doctor
himself it was proclaimed that in addition to his former title of
f u d g e he was now perferred to be even m o r e and
that he was also raised to the dignity of an h o a x the very
highest honor to which any savant of leaphigh could attain 
sic

at length curiosity was appeased and we we're permitted to descend
from the tribune the company ceasing to attend to us in order to
pay attention to each other as i had time now to recollect myself
i did not lose a moment in taking the two mates aside to present a
proposition that we should go in a body before a notary and enter
a protest against the unaccountable errors into which dr reasono
had permitted himself to fall whereby the truth was violated the
rights of persons invaded humanity dishonored and the leaphigh
philosophy misled i cannot say that my arguments were well
received and i was compelled to quit the two rear-admirals and to
go in quest of the crew with the conviction that the former had
been purchased an appeal to the reckless frank loyal natures of
the common seamen i thought would not fail to meet with better
success here too i was fated to encounter disappointment the men
swore a few hearty oaths and affirmed that leaphigh was a good
country they expected pay and rations as a matter of course in
proportion to their new rank and having tasted the sweets of
command they were not yet prepared to quarrel with their good
fortune and to lay aside the silver tankard for the tar-pot

quitting the rascals whose heads really appeared to be turned by
their unexpected elevation i determined to hunt up bob and by dint
of mr poke's ordinary application compel him at least in despite
of the union-jack to return to a sense of his duty and to reassume
his old post as the servitor of my wants i found the little
blackguard in the midst of a bevy of monikinas of all ages who were
lavishing their attentions on his worthless person and otherwise
doing all they could to eradicate everything like humility or any
good quality that might happen to remain in him he certainly gave
me a fair opportunity to commence the attack for he wore the union-
jack over his shoulder in the manner of a royal mantle while the
females of inferior rank pressed about him to kiss its hem the air
with which he received this adulation fairly imposed on even me
and fearful that the monikinas might mob me should i attempt to
undeceive them for monikinas let them be of what species they may
always hug a delusion i abandoned my hostile intentions for the
moment and hurried after mr poke little doubting my ability of
bringing one of his natural rectitude of mind to a right way of
thinking

the captain heard my remonstrances with a decent respect he even
seemed to enter into my feelings with a proper degree of sympathy
he very frankly admitted that i had not been well treated by dr
reasono and he appeared to think that a private conversation with
that individual might yet possibly have the effect of bringing him
to a more reasonable representation of facts but as to any sudden
and violent appeal to public opinion for justice or an ill-advised
recourse to a notary he strenuously objected to both the purport
of his remarks was somewhat as follows 

he was not acquainted with the leaphigh law of protests and in
consequence we might spend our money in paying fees without
reaping any advantage the doctor moreover was a philosopher an
f u d g e and an h o a x and these were fearful odds to
contend against in any country and more especially in a foreign
country he had an innate dislike for lawsuits the loss of my
station was certainly a grievance but still it might be borne as
for himself he never asked for the office of lord high admiral of
great britain but as it had been thrust upon him why he would do
his best to sustain the character he knew his friends at stunin'tun
would be glad to hear of his promotion for though in his country
there were no lords nor even any admirals his countrymen were
always exceedingly rejoiced whenever any of their fellow-citizens
were preferred to those stations by anybody but themselves seeming
to think an honor conferred on one was an honor conferred on the
whole nation he liked to confer honor on his own nation for no
people on arth tuck up a notion of this sort and divided it among
themselves in a way to give each a share sooner than the people of
the states though they were very cautious about leaving any portion
of the credit in first hands and therefore he was disposed to keep
as much as he could while it was in his power he believed he was a
better seaman than most of the lord high admirals who had gone
before him and he had no fears on that score he wondered whether
his promotion made miss poke lady high admiral as i seemed greatly
put out about my own rank he would give me the acting appointment
of a chaplain he didn't think i was qualified to be a sea-officer
and do doubt i had interest enough at home to get it confirmed a
great statesman in his country had said that few die and none
resigned and he didn't like to be the first to set new fashions
for his part he rather looked upon dr reasono as his friend and
it was unpleasant to quarrel with one's friends he was willing to
do anything in reason but resign and if i could persuade the
doctor to say he had fallen into a mistake in my particular case
and that i had been sent to leaphigh as a lord high ambassador lord
high priest or lord high anything else except lord high admiral
why he was ready to swear to it though he now gave notice that in
the event of such an arrangement he should claim to rank me in
virtue of the date of his own commission if he gave up his
appointment a minute sooner than was absolutely necessary he should
lose his own self-respect and never dare look miss poke in the face
again on the whole he should do no such thing and finally he
wished me a good morning as he was about to make a call on the lord
high admiral of leaphigh




chapter xvii

new lords new laws gyration rotation and another nation also an
invitation


i felt that my situation had now become exceedingly peculiar it is
true that my modesty had been unexpectedly spared by the very
ingenious turn dr reasono had given to the history of our
connection with each other but i could not see that i had gained
any other advantage by the expedient all my own species had in a
sense cut me and i was obliged to turn despondingly and not
without humiliation towards the inn where the banquet ordered by
mr poke waited our appearance

i had reached the great square when a tap on the knee drew my
attention to one at my side the applicant for notice was a monikin
who had all the physical peculiarities of a subject of leaphigh and
yet who was to be distinguished from most of the inhabitants of
that country by a longer and less cultivated nap to his natural
garment greater shrewdness about the expression of the eyes and the
mouth a general air of business and for a novelty a bob-cauda
he was accompanied by positively the least well-favored being of the
species i had yet seen i was addressed by the former

good morning sir john goldencalf he commenced with a sort of
jerk that i afterwards learned was meant for a diplomatic
salutation you have not met with the very best treatment to-day
and i have been waiting for a good opportunity to make my
condolences and to offer my services

sir you are only too good i do feel a little wronged and i must
say sympathy is most grateful to my feelings you will however
allow me to express my surprise at your being acquainted with my
real name as well as with my misfortunes

why sir to own the truth i belong to an examining people the
population is very much scattered in my country and we have fallen
into a practice of inquiry that is very natural to such a state of
things i think you must have observed that in passing along a
common highway you rarely meet another without a nod while
thousands are met in a crowded street without even a glance of the
eye we develop this principle sir and never let any fact escape
us for the want of a laudable curiosity

you are not a subject of leaphigh then

god forbid no sir i am a citizen of leaplow a great and a
glorious republic that lies three days sail from this island a new
nation which is in the enjoyment of all the advantages of youth and
vigor and which is a perfect miracle for the boldness of its
conceptions the purity of its institutions and its sacred respect
for the rights of monikins i have the honor to be moreover the
envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary of the republic to
the king of leaphigh a nation from which we originally sprung but
which we have left far behind us in the race of glory and
usefulness i ought to acquaint you with my name sir in return for
the advantage i possess on this head in relation to yourself

hereupon my new acquaintance put into my hand one of his visiting-
cards which contained as follows 

general-commodore-judge-colonel
 people's friend

envoy-extraordinary and minister-plenipotentiary from the republic
of leaplow near his majesty the king of leaphigh

sir said i pulling off my hat with a profound reverence i was
not aware to whom i had the honor of speaking you appear to fill a
variety of employments and i make no doubt with equal skill

yes sir i believe i am about as good at one of my professions as
at another

you will permit me to observe however general a a judge a a 
i scarcely know dear sir which of these titles is the most to your
taste

use which you please sir i began with general but had got as low
as colonel before i left home people's friend is the only
appellation of which i am at all tenacious call me people's friend
sir and you may call me anything else you find most convenient

sir you are only too obliging may i venture to ask if you have
really propria persona filled all these different stations in
life

certainly sir i hope you do not mistake me for an impostor

as far from it as possible but a judge and a commodore for
instance are characters whose duties are so utterly at variance in
human affairs that i will allow i find the conjunction even in a
monikin a little extraordinary

not at all sir i was duly elected to each served my time out in
them all and have honorable discharges to show in every instance

you must have found some perplexity in the performance of duties so
very different

ah i see you have been long enough in leaphigh to imbibe some of
its prejudices it is a sad country for prejudice i got my foot
mired in some of them myself as soon as it touched the land why
sir my card is an illustration of what we call in leaplow
rotation in office

rotation in office

yes sir rotation in office a system that we invented for our
personal convenience and which is likely to be firm as it depends
on principles that are eternal

will you suffer me to inquire colonel if it has any affinity to
the social-stake system

not in the least that as i understand it is a stationary while
this is a rotatory system nothing is simpler we have in leaplow
two enormous boxes made in the form of wheels into one we put the
names of the citizens and into the other the names of the offices
we then draw forth in the manner of a lottery and the thing is
settled for a twelvemonth

i find this rotatory plan exceedingly simple pray sir does it
work as well as it promises

to perfection we grease the wheels of course periodically

and are not frauds sometimes committed by those who are selected to
draw the tickets

oh they are chosen precisely in the same way

but those who draw their tickets

all rotatory they are drawn exactly on the same principle

but there must be a beginning those again who draw their
tickets they may betray their trusts

impossible they are always the most patriotic patriots of the
land no no sir we are not such dunces as to leave anything to
corruption chance does it all chance makes me a commodore to-day 
a judge to-morrow chance makes the lottery boys and chance makes
the patriots it is necessary to see in order to understand how much
purer and useful is your chance patriot for instance than one that
is bred to the calling

why this savors after all of the doctrine of descents which is
little more than matter of chance

it would be so sir i confess were it not that our chances centre
in a system of patriots our approved patriots are our guarantees
against abuses 

hem interrupted the companion of commodore people's friend with
an awkward distinctness as if to recall himself to our
recollection

sir john i crave pardon for great remissness allow me to present
my fellow-citizen brigadier downright a gentleman who is on his
travels like yourself and as excellent a fellow as is to be found
in the whole monikin region

brigadier downright i crave the honor of your acquaintance but
gentlemen i too have been sadly negligent of politeness a banquet
that has cost a hundred promises is waiting my appearance and as
some of the expected guests are unavoidably absent if you would
favor me with your excellent society we might spend an agreeable
hour in the further discussion of these important interests

as neither of the strangers made the smallest objection to the
proposal we were all soon comfortably situated at the dinner-table
the commodore who it would seem was habitually well fed merely
paid a little complimentary attention to the banquet but mr
downright attacked it tooth and nail and i had no great reason to
regret the absence of mr poke in the meantime the conversation
did not flag

i think i understand the outline of your system judge people's
friend i resumed with the exception of the part that relates to
the patriots would it be asking too much to request a little
explanation on that particular point

not in the least sir our social arrangement is founded on a hint
from nature a base as you will concede that is broad enough to
sustain a universe as a people we are a hive that formerly swarmed
from leaphigh and finding ourselves free and independent we set
about forthwith building the social system on not only a sure
foundation but on sure principles observing that nature dealt in
duplicates we pursued the hint as the leading idea 

in duplicates commodore

certainly sir john a monikin has two eyes two ears two nostrils
two lungs two arms two hands two legs two feet and so on to the
end of the chapter on this hint we ordered that there should be
drawn morally in every district of leaplow two distinct and
separate lines that should run at right angles to each other these
were termed the political landmarks of the country and it was
expected that every citizen should range himself along one or the
other all this you will understand however was a moral
contrivance not a physical one

is the obligation of this moral contrivance imperative

not legally it is true but then he who does not respect it is
like one who is out of fashion and he is so generally esteemed a
poor devil that the usage has a good deal more than the force of a
law at first it was intended to make it a part of the
constitution but one of our most experienced statesmen so clearly
demonstrated that by so doing we should not only weaken the nature
of the obligation but most probably raise a party against it that
the idea was abandoned indeed if anything both the letter and the
spirit of the fundamental law have been made to lean a little
against the practice but having been cleverly introduced in the
way of construction it is now bone of our bone and flesh of our
flesh well sir these two great political landmarks being fairly
drawn the first effort of one who aspires to be thought a patriot
is to acquire the practice of toeing the mark promptly and with
facility but should i illustrate my positions by a few experiments
you might comprehend the subject all the better for though in
fact the true evolutions are purely moral as i have just had the
honor to explain yet we have instituted a physical parallel that is
very congenial to our habits with which the neophyte always
commences

here the commodore took a bit of chalk and drew two very distinct
lines crossing each other at right angles through the centre of
the room when this was done he placed his feet together and then
he invited me to examine if it were possible to see any part of the
planks between the extremities of his toes and the lines after a
rigid look i was compelled to confess it was not

this is what we call toeing the mark it is social position no
 almost every citizen gets to be expert in practising it on one
or the other of the two great political lines after this he who
would push his fortunes further commences his career on the great
rotatory principle

your pardon commodore we call the word rotary in english

sir it is not expressive enough for our meaning and therefore we
term it rotatory i shall now give you an example of position no


here the commodore made a spring throwing his body as a soldier
would express it to the right about bringing at the same time
his feet entirely on the other side of the line always rigidly
toeing the mark

sir said i this was extremely well done but is this evolution
as useful as certainly it is dexterous

it has the advantage of changing front sir john a manoeuvre quite
as useful in politics as in war most all in the line get to
practise this too as my friend downright there could show you
were he so disposed

i don't like to expose my flanks or my rear more than another
growled the brigadier

if agreeable i will now show you gyration d or position no 

on my expressing a strong desire to see it the commodore put
himself again in position no and then he threw what captain poke
was in the habit of calling a flap-jack or a summerset coming
down in a way tenaciously to toe the mark

i was much gratified with the dexterity of the commodore and
frankly expressed as much inquiring at the same time if many
attained to the same skill both the commodore and the brigadier
laughed at the simplicity of the question the former answering that
the people of leaplow were exceedingly active and adventurous and
both lines had got to be so expert that at the word of command
they would throw their summersets in as exact time and quite as
promptly as a regiment of guards would go through the evolution of
slapping their cartridge-boxes

what sir i exclaimed in admiration the entire population

virtually sir there is now and then a stumbler but he is
instantly kicked out of sight and uniformly counts for nothing

but as yet commodore your evolutions are altogether too general
to admit of the chance selection of patriots since patriotism is
usually a monopoly

very true sir john i shall therefore come to the main point
without delay thus far it is pretty much an affair of the whole
population as you say few refusing to toe the mark or to throw
the necessary flap-jacks as you have ingeniously termed them the
lines as you may perceive cross each other at right angles and
there is consequently some crowding and occasionally a good deal
of jostling at and near the point of junction we begin to term a
monikin a patriot when he can perform this evolution

here the commodore threw his heels into the air with such rapidity
that i could not very well tell what he was about though it was
sufficiently apparent that he was acting entirely on the rotatory
principle i observed that he alighted with singular accuracy on
the very spot where he had stood before toeing the mark with
beautiful precision

that is what we call gyration d or position no he who can
execute it is considered an adept in our politics and he invariably
takes his position near the enemy or at the junction of the hostile
lines

how sir are these lines then manned as they are with citizens
of the same country deemed hostile

are cats and dogs hostile sir certainly although standing as
it might be face to face acting on precisely the same principle
or the rotatory impulse and professing to have exactly the same
object in view viz the common good they are social political
and i might almost say the moral antipodes of each other they
rarely intermarry never extol and frequently refuse to speak to
one another in short as the brigadier could tell you if he were
so disposed they are antagonist body and soul to be plain sir
they are enemies

this is very extraordinary for fellow-citizens

tis the monikin nature observed mr downright no doubt sir
men are much wiser

as i did not wish to divert the discourse from the present topic i
merely bowed to this remark and begged the judge to proceed

well sir continued the latter you can easily imagine that they
who are placed near the point where the two lines meet have no
sinecures to speak the truth they blackguard each other with all
their abilities he who manifests the most inventive genius in this
high accomplishment being commonly thought the cleverest fellow
now sir none but a patriot could in the nature of things endure
this without some other motive than his country's good and so we
esteem them

but the most patriotic patriots commodore

the minister of leaphigh now toed the mark again placing himself
within a few feet of the point of junction between the two lines
and then he begged me to pay particular attention to his evolution
when all was ready the commodore threw himself as it were
invisibly into the air again head over heels so far as i could
discover and alighted on the antagonist line toeing the mark with
a most astonishing particularity it was a clever gyration beyond a
doubt and the performer looked towards me as if inviting
commendation

admirably executed judge and in a way to induce one to believe
that you must have paid great attention to the practice

i have performed this manoeuvre sir john five times in real life
and my claim to be a patriotic patriot is founded on its invariable
success a single false step might have ruined me but as you say
practice makes perfect and perfection is the parent of success

and yet i do not rightly understand how so sudden a desertion of
one's own side to go over in this active manner head over heels i
may say to another side constitutes a fair claim to be deemed so
pure a character as that of a patriot

what sir is not he who throws himself defencelessly into the very
middle of the ranks of the enemy the hero of the combat now as
this is a political struggle and not a warlike struggle but one in
which the good of the country is alone uppermost the monikin who
thus manifests the greatest devotion to the cause must be the
purest patriot i give you my honor sir all my own claims are
founded entirely on this particular merit

he is right sir john you may believe every word he says
observed the brigadier nodding

i begin to understand your system which is certainly well adapted
to the monikin habits and must give rise to a noble emulation in
the practice of the rotatory principle but i understood you to say
colonel that the people of leaplow are from the hive of leaphigh

just so sir

how happens it then that you dock yourselves of the nobler
member while the inhabitants of this country cherish it as the
apple of the eye nay as the seat of reason itself

you allude to our tails why sir nature has dealt out these
ornaments with a very unequal hand as you may perceive on looking
out of the window we agree that the tail is the seat of reason and
that the extremities are the most intellectual parts but as
governments are framed to equalize these natural inequalities we
denounce them as anti-republican the law requires therefore that
every citizen on attaining his majority shall be docked agreeably
to a standard measure that is kept in each district without some
such expedient there might be an aristocracy of intellect among us
and there would be an end of our liberties this is the
qualification of a voter too and of course we all seek to obtain
it

here the brigadier leaned across the table and whispered that a
great patriot on a most trying occasion had succeeded in throwing
a summerset out of his own into the antagonist line and that as he
carried with him all the sacred principles for which his party had
been furiously contending for many years he had been
unceremoniously dragged back by his tail which unfortunately came
within reach of those quondam friends on whom he had turned his
back and that the law had in truth been passed in the interests
of the patriots he added that the lawful measure allowed a longer
stump than was commonly used but that it was considered underbred
for any one to wear a dock that reached more than two inches and
three quarters of an inch into society and that most of their
political aspirants in particular chose to limit themselves to one
inch and one quarter of an inch as a proof of excessive humility

thanking mr downright for his clear and sensible explanation the
conversation was resumed

i had thought as your institutions are founded on reason and
nature judge i continued that you would be more disposed ta
cultivate this member than to mutilate it and this the more
especially as i understand all monikins believe it to be the very
quintessence of reason

no doubt sir we do cultivate our tails but it is on the
vegetable principle or as the skilful gardener lops the branch that
it may throw out more vigorous shoots it is true we do not expect
to see the tail itself sprouting out anew but then we look to the
increase of its reason and to its more general diffusion in
society the extremities of our cauda as fast as they are lopped
are sent to a great intellectual mill where the mind is extracted
from the matter and the former is sold on public account to the
editors of the daily journals this is the reason our leaplow
journalists are so distinguished for their ingenuity and capacity
and the reason too why they so faithfully represent the average of
the leaplow knowledge

and honesty you ought to add growled the brigadier

i see the beauty of the system judge and very beautiful it is
this essence of lopped tails represents the average of leaplow
brains being a compound of all the tails in the country and as a
daily journal is addressed to the average intellect of the
community there is a singular fitness between the readers and the
readees to complete my stock of information on this head however
will you just allow me to inquire what is the effect of this system
on the totality of leaplow intelligence

wonderful as we are a commonwealth it is necessary to have a
unity of sentiment on all leading matters and by thus compounding
all the extremes of our reasons we get what is called public
opinion which public opinion is uttered through the public
journals 

and a most patriotic patriot is always chosen to be the inspector
of the mill interrupted the brigadier

better and better you send all the finer parts of your several
intellects to be ground up and kneaded together the compound is
sold to the journalists who utter it anew as the results of the
united wisdom of the country 

or as public opinion we make great account of reason in all our
affairs invariably calling ourselves the most enlightened nation on
earth but then we are especially averse to anything like an
insulated effort of the mind which is offensive anti-republican
aristocratic and dangerous we put all our trust in this
representation of brains which is singularly in accordance with the
fundamental base of our society as you must perceive

we are a commercial people too put in the brigadier and being
much accustomed to the laws of insurance we like to deal in
averages

very true brother downright very true we are particularly averse
to anything like inequality ods zooks it is almost as great an
offence for a monikin to know more than his neighbors as it is for
him to act on his own impulses no no we are truly a free and an
independent commonwealth and we hold every citizen as amenable to
public opinion in all he does says thinks or wishes

pray sir do both of the two great political lines send their
tails to the same mills and respect the same general sentiments

no sir we have two public opinions in leaplow

two public opinions

certainly sir the horizontal and the perpendicular

this infers a most extraordinary fertility of thought and one that
i hold to be almost impossible

here the commodore and the brigadier incontinently both laughed as
hard as they could and that too directly in my face

dear me sir john why my dear sir john you are really the
drollest creature gasped the judge holding his sides the very
funniest question i have ev ev ever encountered he now stopped
to wipe his eyes after which he was better able to express himself
the same public opinion forsooth dear me dear me that i should
not have made myself understood i commenced my good sir john by
telling you that we deal in duplicates on a hint from nature and
that we act on the rotatory principle in obedience to the first we
have always two public opinions and although the great political
landmarks are drawn in what may be called a stationary sense they
too are in truth rotatory one which is thought to lie parallel to
the fundamental law or the constitutional meridian of the country
is termed the horizontal and the other the perpendicular line now
as nothing is really stationary in leaplow these two great
landmarks are always acting likewise on the rotatory principle
changing places periodically the perpendicular becoming the
horizontal and vice versa they who toe their respective marks
necessarily taking new views of things as they vary the line of
sight these great revolutions are however very slow and are
quite as imperceptible to those who accompany them as are the
revolutions of our planet to its inhabitants

and the gyrations of the patriots of which the judge has just now
spoken added the brigadier are much the same as the eccentric
movements of the comets that embellish the solar system without
deranging it by their uncertain courses

no sir we should be poorly off indeed if we had but one public
opinion resumed the judge ecod i do not know what would become
of the most patriotic patriots in such a dilemma

pray sir let me ask as you draw for places if you have as many
places as there are citizens

certainly sir our places are divided firstly into the two great
subdivisions of the inner and the outer those who toe the mark
on the most popular line occupy the former and those who toe the
mark on the least popular line take all the rest as a matter of
course the first however it is necessary to explain are the only
places worth having as great care is had to keep the community
pretty nearly equally divided 

excuse the interruption but in what manner is this effected

why as only a certain number can toe the mark we count all those
who are not successful in getting up to the line as outcasts and
after fruitlessly hanging about our skirts for a time they
invariably go over to the other line since it is better to be first
in a village than second in rome we thus keep up something like an
equilibrium in the state which as you must know is necessary to
liberty the minority take the outer places and all the inner are
left to the majority then comes another subdivision of the places
that is to say one division is formed of the honorary and another
of the profitable places the honorary or about nine-tenths of all
the inner places are divided with great impartiality among the
mass of those who have toed the mark on the strongest side and who
usually are satisfied with the glory of the victory the names of
the remainder are put into the wheels to be drawn for against the
prizes on the rotatory principle

and the patriots sir are they included in this chance medley

far from it as a reward for their dangers they have a little
wheel to themselves although they also are compelled to submit to
the rotatory principle their cases differ from those of the others
merely in the fact that they always get something

i would gladly have pursued the conversation which was opening a
flood of light upon my political understanding but just then a
fellow with the air of a footman entered carrying a packet tied to
the end of his cauda turning round he presented his burden with
profound respect and withdrew i found that the packet contained
three notes with the following addresses

to his royal highness bob prince of wales etc etc etc

to my lord high admiral poke etc etc etc

to master goldencalf clerk etc etc etc

apologizing to my guests the seal of my own note was eagerly
opened it read as follows

the right honorable the earl of chatterino lord of the bed-chamber
in waiting on his majesty informs master john goldencalf clerk
that he is commanded to attend the drawing-room this evening when
the nuptial ceremony will take place between the earl of chatterino
and the lady chatterissa the first maid of honor to her majesty the
queen

n b the gentlemen will appear full dress

on explaining the contents of my note to the judge he informed me
that he was aware of the approaching ceremony as he had also an
invitation to be present in his official character i begged as a
particular favor england having no representative at leaphigh that
he would do me the honor to present me in his capacity of a foreign
minister the envoy made no sort of objection and i inquired as to
the costume necessary to be observed as so far as i had seen it
was good-breeding at leaphigh to go naked the envoy had the
goodness to explain that although in point of mere attire
clothing was extremely offensive to the people of both leaphigh and
leaplow yet in the former country no one could present himself at
court foreign ministers excepted without a cauda as soon as we
understood each other on these points we separated with an
understanding that i was to be in readiness together with my
companions of whose interest i had not been forgetful to attend
the envoy and the brigadier when they should call for me at an
hour that was named




chapter xviii

a court a court-dress and a courtier justice in various aspects
as well as honor


my guests were no sooner gone than i sent for the landlady to
inquire if any court-dresses were to be had in the neighborhood she
told me plenty might certainly be had that were suited to the
monikin dimensions but she much doubted whether there was a tail in
all leaphigh natural or artificial that was at all fit for a
person of my stature this was vexatious and i was in a brown
study calling up all my resources for the occasion when mr poke
entered the inn carrying in his hand two as formidable ox-tails as
i remember ever to have seen throwing one towards me he said the
lord high admiral of leaphigh had acquainted him that there was an
invitation out for the prince and himself as well as for the
governor of the former to be present at court within an hour he
had hurried off from what he called a very good dinner considering
there was nothing solid the captain was particularly fond of
pickled pork to let me know the honor that was intended us and on
the way home he had fallen in with dr reasono who on being
acquainted with his errand had not failed to point out the
necessity of the whole party coming en habit de cour here was a
dilemma with a vengeance for the first idea that struck the
captain was the utter impossibility of finding anything in this
way in all leaphigh befitting a lord high admiral of his length of
keel for as to going in an ordinary monikin queue why he should
look like a three-decked ship with a brig's spar stepped for a
lower mast dr reasono however had kindly removed the
embarrassment by conducting him to the cabinet of natural history
where three suitable appendages had been found viz two fine
relics of oxen footnote cauda bovum buf and another a
capital specimen that had formerly been the mental lever or as
the captain expressed it the steering oar of a kangaroo the
latter had been sent off express with a kind consideration for the
honor of great britain to prince bob who was at a villa of one of
the royal family in the neighborhood of aggregation

i was greatly indebted to noah for his dexterity in helping me to a
good fit with my court-dress there was not time for much
particularity for we were in momentary expectation of judge
people's friend's return all we could do therefore was to make a
belt of canvas the captain being always provided with needles
palm etc in his bag and to introduce the smaller end of the
tail through a hole in the belt drawing its base tight up to the
cloth which in its turn was stitched round our bodies this was
but an indifferent substitute for the natural appendage it is true
and the hide had got to be so dry and unyielding that it was
impossible for the least observant person to imagine there was a
particle of brains in it the arrangement had also another
disadvantage the cauda stuck out nearly at right angles with the
position of the body and besides occupying much more space than
would probably be permitted in the royal presence it gave any
jackanapes as noah observed the great advantage over us of
making us yaw at pleasure since he might use the outriggers as
levers but a seaman is inexhaustible in expedients two back-
stays or bob-stays for the captain facetiously gave them both
appellations were soon turned in and the tails were stayed in
in a way to bring them as upright as trysail masts to which spars
indeed according to noah's account of the matter they bore no
small resemblance

the envoy-extraordinary of leaplow accompanied by his friend
brigadier downright arrived just as we were dressed and a most
extraordinary figure the former cut if truth must be said although
obliged to be docked according to the leaplow law to six inches
and brought down to a real bob by both the public opinions of his
country for this was one of the few points on which these
antagonist sentiments were perfectly agreed he now appeared in just
the largest brush i remember to have seen appended to a monikin i
felt a strong inclination to joke the rotatory republican on this
coquetry but then i remembered how sweet any stolen indulgence
becomes and for the life of me i could not give utterance to a
bon-mot the elegance of the minister was rendered the more
conspicuous by the simplicity of the brigadier who had contrived to
moustache his dock a very short one at the best in such a manner
as to render it nearly invisible on my expressing a doubt to mr
downright about his being admitted in such a costume he snapped his
fingers and gave me to understand he knew better he appeared as a
brigadier of leaplow i found afterwards that he was in truth no
soldier but that it was a fashion among his countrymen to travel
under the title of brigadier and this was his uniform and he
should like to see the chamberlain who would presume to call in
question the state of his wardrobe as it was no affair of mine i
prudently dropped the subject and we were soon in the court of the
palace

i shall pass over the parade of guards the state bands the
sergeant-trumpeters the crowd of footmen and pages and conduct the
reader at once to the ante-chamber here we found the usual throng
composed of those who live in the smiles of princes there was a
great deal of politeness much bowing and curtseying and the
customary amount of genteel empressement to be the first to bask in
the sunshine of royalty judge people's friend in his character of
a foreign minister was privileged and we had enjoyed the private
entree and were now of right placed nearest to the great doors of
the royal apartments most of the diplomatic corps were already in
attendance and quite as a matter of course there were a great
many cordial manifestations of the ardent attachment that bound
them and their masters together in the inviolable bonds of a most
sacred amity judge people's friend according to his own account of
the matter represented a great nation a very great nation and yet
i did not perceive that he met with a warm a very warm reception
however as he seemed satisfied with himself and all around him it
would have been unkind not to say rude in a stranger to disturb
his self-esteem and i took especial care therefore not to betray
by the slightest hint my opinion that a good many near his person
seemed to think him and his artificial queue somewhat in the way
the courtiers of leaphigh in particular who are an exceedingly
exclusive and fastidious corps appeared to regard the privileges of
the judge with an evil eye and one or two of them actually held
their noses as he flourished his brush a little too near their
sacred faces as if they found its odor out of fashion while making
these silent observations a page cried out from the lower part of
the saloon room for his royal highness the crown prince of great
britain the crowd opened and that young blackguard bob walked up
the avenue in state he wore the turnspit garment as the base of
his toilet but the superstructure was altogether more in keeping
with the rascal's assumed character the union-jack was thrown over
his shoulder in the fashion of a mantle and it was supported by the
cook and steward of the walrus two blacks both clothed as
alligators the kangaroo's tail was rigged in a way to excite
audible evidences of envy in the heart of mr poke the stepping of
it the captain whispered did the young dog great credit for it
looked as natural as the best wig he had ever seen and then in
addition to the bob-stay it had two guys which acted like the
yoke-lines of a boat or in such a way that by holding one in each
hand the brush could be worked starboard and larboard like a
rudder i have taken this description mainly from the mouth of the
captain and most sincerely do i hope it may be intelligible to the
reader

bob appeared to be conscious of his advantages for on reaching the
upper end of the room he began whisking his tail and flourishing
it to the right and left so as to excite a very perceptible and
lively admiration in the mind of judge people's friend an effect
that so much the more proved the wearer's address for that high
functionary was bound ex officio to entertain a sovereign contempt
for all courtly vanities i saw the eye of the captain kindle
however and when the insolent young coxcomb actually had the
temerity to turn his back on his master and to work his brush under
his very nose human nature could endure no more the right leg of
my lord high admiral slowly retired with somewhat of the caution of
the cat about to spring and then it was projected forward with a
rapidity that absolutely lifted the crown prince from the floor

the royal self-possession of bob could not prevent an exclamation of
pain as well as of surprise and some of the courtiers ran forward
involuntarily to aid him for courtiers always ran involuntarily to
the succor of princes at least a dozen of the ladies offered their
smelling-bottles with the most amiable assiduity and concern to
prevent any disagreeable consequences however i hastened to
acquaint the crowd that in great britain it is the usage to cuff
and kick the whole royal family and that in short it is no more
than the customary tribute of the subject to the prince in proof of
what i said i took good care to give the saucy young scoundrel a
touch of my own homage the monikins who know that different
customs prevail in different nations hastened to compliment the
young scion of royalty in the same manner and both the cook and
steward relieved their ennui by falling into the track of imitation
bob could not stand the last applications and he was about to beat
a retreat when the master of ceremonies appeared to conduct him to
the royal presence

the reader is not to be misled by the honors that were paid to the
imaginary crown prince and to suppose that the court of leaphigh
entertained any peculiar respect for that of great britain it was
merely done on the principle that governed the conduct of our own
learned sovereign king james i when he refused to see the amiable
pocahontas of virginia because she had degraded royalty by
intermarrying with a subject the respect was paid to the caste and
not to the individual to his species or to his nation

let his privileges come from what cause they would bob was glad
enough to get out of the presence of captain poke who had already
pretty plainly threatened in the stunin'tun dialect to unship his
cauda into that of the majesty of leaphigh a few minutes
afterwards the doors were thrown open and the whole company
advanced into the royal apartments

the etiquette of the court of leaphigh differs in many essential
particulars from the etiquette of any other court in the monikin
region neither the king nor his royal consort is ever visible to
any one in the country so far as is vulgarly known on the present
occasion two thrones were placed at opposite extremities of the
salon and a magnificent crimson damask curtain was so closely drawn
before each that it was quite impossible to see who occupied it on
the lowest step there stood a chamberlain or a lady of the bed-
chamber who severally made all the speeches and otherwise
enacted the parts of the illustrious couple the reader will
understand therefore that all which is here attributed to either
of these great personages was in fact performed by one or the other
of the substitutes named and that i never had the honor of actually
standing face to face with their majesties everything that is now
about to be related in short was actually done by deputy on the
part of the monarch and his wife

the king himself merely represents a sentiment all the power
belonging to his eldest first cousin of the masculine gender and
any intercourse with him is entirely of a disinterested or of a
sentimental character he is the head of the church after a very
secular fashion however all the bishops and clergy therefore got
down on their knees and said their prayers though the captain
suggested that it might be their catechisms i never knew which i
observed also that all his law officers did the same thing but as
they never pray and do not know their catechisms i presume the
genuflections were to beg something better than the places they
actually filled after this came a long train of military and naval
officers who soldier-like kissed his paw the civilians next had
a chance and then it was our turn to be presented

i have the honor to present the lord high admiral of great britain
to your majesty said judge people's friend who had waived his
official privilege of going first in order to do us this favor in
person it having been decided on a review of all the principles
that touched the case that nothing human could take precedence of a
monikin at court always making the exception in favor of royalty
as in the case of prince bob

i am happy to see you at my court admiral poke the king politely
rejoined manifesting the tact of high rank in recognizing noah by
his family name to the great surprise of the old sealer

king

you were about to remark  most graciously inquired his majesty
a little at a loss to understand what his visitor would be at

why i could not contain my astonishment at your memory mr king
which has enabled you to recall a name that you probably never
before heard

there was now a great and to me a very unaccountable confusion in
the circle it would seem that the captain had unwittingly
trespassed on two of the most important of the rules of etiquette
in very mortal points he had confessed to the admission of an
emotion as vulgar as that of astonishment in the royal presence and
he had intimated that his majesty had a memory a property of the
mind which as it might prove dangerous to the liberties of
leaphigh were it left in the keeping of any but a responsible
minister it had long been decided it was felony to impute to the
king by the fundamental law of the land the king's eldest first-
cousin of the masculine gender may have as many memories as he
please and he may use them or abuse them as he shall see fit
either in private or in the public service but it is held to be
utterly unconstitutional and unparliamentary and by consequence
extremely underbred to insinuate even in the most remote manner
that the king himself has either a memory a will a determination
a resolution a desire a conceit an intention or in short any
other intellectual property that of a royal pleasure alone
excepted it is both constitutional and parliamentary to say the
king has a royal pleasure provided the context goes to prove that
this royal pleasure is entirely at the disposition of his eldest
first-cousin of the masculine gender

when mr poke was made acquainted with his mistake he discovered a
proper contrition and the final decision of the affair was
postponed in order to have the opinion of the judges on the
propriety of taking bail which i promptly offered to put in in
behalf of my old shipmate this disagreeable little interruption
temporarily disposed of the business of the drawing-room went on

noah was next conducted to the queen who was much inclined always
by deputy to overlook the little mistake into which he had fallen
with her royal consort and to receive him graciously

may it please your majesty i have the honor to present to your
majesty's royal notice the lord noah poke the lord high admiral of
a distant and but little known country called great britain said
the gold stick of the evening judge people's friend being afraid of
committing leaplow and declining to introduce the captain to any
one else

lord poke is a countryman of our royal cousin the prince bob
observed the queen in an exceedingly gracious manner

no marm put in the sealer promptly your cousin bob is no
cousin of mine and if it were lawful for your majesty to have a
memory or an inclination or anything else in that way i should
beg the favor of you to order the young blackguard to be soundly
threshed

the majesty of leaphigh stood aghast by proxy it would seem noah
had now actually fallen into a more serious error than the mistake
he had made with the king by the law of leaphigh the queen is not
a feme couverte she can sue and be sued in her own name holds her
separate estate without the intervention of trustees and is
supposed to have a memory a will an inclination or anything else
in that way except a royal pleasure to which she cannot of
right lay claim as to her the king's first-cousin is a dead
letter he having no more control over her conscience than he has
over the conscience of an apple-woman in short her majesty is
quite as much the mistress of her own convictions and conscience as
it probably ever falls to the lot of women in such high stations to
be the mistress of interests that are of so much importance to those
around them noah innocently enough i do firmly believe had
seriously wounded all those nice sensibilities which are naturally
dependent on such an improved condition of society forbearance
could go no further and i saw by the dark looks around me that
the captain had committed a serious crime he was immediately
arrested and conducted from the presence to an adjoining room into
which i obtained admission after a good deal of solicitation and
some very strong appeals to the sacred character of the rights of
hospitality

it now appeared that in leaphigh the merits of a law are decided
on a principle very similar to the one we employ in england in
judging of the quality of our wines viz its age the older a law
the more it is to be respected no doubt because having proved its
fitness by outlasting all the changes of society it has become more
mellow if not more palatable now by a law of leaphigh that is
coeval with the monarchy he who offends the queen's majesty at a
levee is to lose his head and he who under the same circumstances
offends the king's majesty necessarily the more heinous offence is
to lose his tail in consequence of the former punishment the
criminal is invariably buried and he is consigned to the usual
course of monikin regeneration and resuscitation but in consequence
of the latter it is thought that he is completely thrown without
the pale of reason and is thereby consigned to the class of the
retrogressive animals his mind diminishes and his body increases
the brain for want of the means of development takes the ascending
movement of sap again his forehead dilates bumps reappear and
finally after passing gradually downwards in the scale of
intellect he becomes a mass of insensible matter such at least
is the theory of his punishment

by another law that is even older than the monarchy any one who
offends in the king's palace may be tried by a very summary process
the king's pages acting as his judges in which case the sentence is
to be executed without delay

such was the dilemma to which noah by an indiscretion at court was
suddenly reduced and but for my prompt interference he would
probably have been simultaneously decapitated at both extremities
in obedience to an etiquette which prescribes that under the
circumstances of a court trial neither the king's nor the queen's
rights shall be entitled to precedence in defence of my client i
urged his ignorance of the usages of the country and indeed of
all other civilized countries stunnin'tun alone excepted i stated
that the criminal was an object altogether unworthy of their notice
that he was not a lord high admiral at all but a mere pitiful
sealer i laid some stress on the importance of maintaining friendly
relations with the sealers who cruise so near the monikin region i
tried to convince the judges that noah meant no harm in imputing
moral properties to the king and that so long as he did not impute
immoral properties to his royal consort she might very well afford
to pardon him i then quoted shakspeare's celebrated lines on mercy
which seemed to be well enough received and committed the whole
affair to their better judgment

i should have got along very creditably and most probably obtained
the immediate discharge of my friend had not the attorney-general
of leaphigh been drawn by curiosity into the room although he had
nothing to say to the merits of my arguments he objected to every
one of them on the ground of formality this was too long and that
was too short one was too high and another too low a fifth was
too broad and a sixth too narrow in short there was no figure of
speech of this nature to which he did not resort in order to prove
their worthlessness with the exception that i do not remember he
charged any of my reasons with being too deep

matters were now beginning to look serious for poor noah when a
page came skipping in to say that the wedding was about to take
place and that if his comrades wished to witness it they must
sentence the prisoner without delay many a man it is said has
been hanged in order that the judge might dine but in the present
instance i do believe captain poke was spared in order that his
judges might not miss a fine spectacle i entered into recognizance
in fifty thousand promises for the due appearance of the criminal
on the following morning and we all returned in a body to the
presence-chamber treading on each other's tails in the eagerness
to be foremost

any one who has ever been at a human court must very well know
that while it is the easiest thing in the world to throw it into
commotion by a violation of etiquette matters of mere life and
death are not at all of a nature to disturb its tranquillity there
everything is a matter of routine and propriety and to judge from
experience nothing is so unseemly as to appear to possess human
sympathies the fact is not very different at leaphigh for the
monikin sympathies apparently are quite as obtuse as those of men
although justice compels me to allow that in the case of captain
poke the appeal was made in behalf of a creature of a different
species it is also a settled principle of leaphigh jurisprudence
that it would be monstrous for the king to interfere in behalf of
justice-justice however being always administered in his name
although it certainly is not held to be quite so improper for him to
interfere in behalf of those who have offended justice

as a consequence of these nice distinctions which it requires a
very advanced stage of civilization fully to comprehend both the
king and queen received our whole party when we came back into the
presence exactly as if nothing particular had occurred noah wore
both head and tail erect like another and the lord high admiral of
leaphigh dropped into a familiar conversation with him on the
subject of ballasting ships in just as friendly a manner as if he
were on the best possible terms with the whole royal family this
moral sang froid is not to be ascribed to phlegm but is in fact
the result of high mental discipline which causes the courtier to
be utterly destitute of all feeling except in cases that affect
himself

it was high time now that i should be presented judge people's
friend who had witnessed the dilemma of noah with diplomatic
unconcern very politely renewed the offer of his services in my
favor and i went forward and stood before the throne

sire allow me to present a very eminent literary character among
men a cunning clerk by name goldencalf said the envoy bowing to
his majesty

he is welcome to my court returned the king by proxy

pray mr people's friend is not this one of the human beings who
have lately arrived in my dominions and who have shown so much
cleverness in getting chatterino and his governor through the ice

the very same please your majesty and a very arduous service it
was and right cleverly performed

this reminds me of a duty let my cousin be summoned

i now began to see a ray of hope and to feel the truth of the
saying which teaches us that justice though sometimes slow never
fails to arrive at last i had also now and for the first time a
good view of the king's eldest first-cousin of the masculine gender
who drew near at the summons and while he had the appearance of
listening with the most profound attention to the instructions of
the king of leaphigh was very evidently telling that potentate what
he ought to do the conference ended his majesty's proxy spoke in a
way to be heard by all who had the good fortune to be near the royal
person

reasono did a good thing he said really a very good thing in
bringing us these specimens of the human family but for his
cleverness i might have died without ever dreaming that men were
gifted with tails kings never get hold of the truth at the right
end i wonder if the queen knew it pray did you know my
augusta that men had tails

our exemption from state affairs gives us females better
opportunities than your majesty enjoys to study these matters
returned his royal consort by the mouth of her lady of the bed-
chamber

i dare say i'm very silly but our cousin here thinks it might be
well to do something for these good people for it may encourage
their king himself to visit us some day

an exclamation of pleasure escaped the ladies who declared one and
all it would be delightful to see a real human king it would be so
funny

well well added the good-natured monarch heaven knows what may
happen for i have seen stranger things really we ought to do
something for these good people for although we owe the pleasure
of their visit in a great degree to the cleverness of reasono 
who by the way i'm glad to hear is declared an h o a x yet he
very handsomely admits that but for their exertions none of our
seamikins being within reach it would have been quite impossible to
get through the ice i wish i knew now which was the cleverest and
the most useful of their party

here the queen always thinking and speaking by proxy suggested the
propriety of leaving the point to prince bob

it would be no more than is due to his rank for though they are
men i dare say they have feelings like ourselves

the question was now submitted to bob who sat in judgment on us
all with as much gravity as if accustomed to such duties from
infancy it is said that men soon get to be familiar with elevation
and that while he who has fallen never fails to look backwards he
who has risen invariably limits his vision to the present horizon
such proved to be the case with the princely bob

this person observed the jackanapes pointing to me is a very
good sort of person it is true but he is hardly the sort of person
your majesty wants just now there is the lord high admiral too 
but  bob's but was envenomed by a thousand kicks but you
wish sire to know which of my father's subjects was the most
useful in getting the ship to leaphigh

that is precisely the fact i desire to know

bob hereupon pointed to the cook who it will be remembered was
present as one of his train-bearers i believe i must say sire
that this is the man he fed us all and without food and that in
considerable quantities too nothing could have been done

the little blackguard was rewarded for his impudence by
exclamations of pleasure from all around him it was so clever a
distinction it showed so much reflection it was so very
profound it proved how much he regarded the base of society 
in short it was evident england would be a happy country when he
should be called to the throne in the meantime the cook was
required to come forth and kneel before his majesty

what is your name whispered the lord of the bed-chamber who now
spoke for himself

jack coppers your honor

the lord of the bed-chamber made a communication to his majesty
when the sovereign turned round by proxy with his back towards
jack and giving him the accolade with his tail he bade him rise
as sir jack coppers

i was a silent an admiring an astounded witness of this act of
gross and flagrant injustice some one pulled me aside and then i
recognized the voice of brigadier downright

you think that honors have alighted where they are least due you
think that the saying of your crown prince has more smartness than
truth more malice than honesty you think that the court has judged
on false principles and acted on an impulse rather than on reason
that the king has consulted his own ease in affecting to do justice
that the courtiers have paid a homage to their master in affecting
to pay a homage to merit and that nothing in this life is pure or
free from the taint of falsehood selfishness or vanity alas this
is too much the case with us monikins i must allow though
doubtless among men you manage a vast deal more cleverly




chapter xix

about the humility of professional saints a succession of tails a
bride and bridegroom and other heavenly matters diplomacy
included


perceiving that brigadier downright had an observant mind and that
he was altogether superior to the clannish feeling which is so apt
to render a particular species inimical to all others i asked
permission to cultivate his acquaintance begging at the same time
that he would kindly favor me with such remarks as might be
suggested by his superior wisdom and extensive travels on any of
those customs or opinions that would naturally present themselves in
our actual situation the brigadier took the request in good part
and we began to promenade the rooms in company as the archbishop of
aggregation who was to perform the marriage ceremony was shortly
expected the conversation very naturally turned on the general
state of religion in the monikin region

i was delighted to find that the clerical dogmas of this insulated
portion of the world were based on principles absolutely identical
with those of all christendom the monikins believe that they are a
miserable lost set of wretches who are so debased by nature so
eaten up by envy uncharitableness and all other evil passions
that it is quite impossible they can do anything that is good of
themselves that their sole dependence is on the moral interference
of the great superior power of creation and that the very first
and the one needful step of their own is to cast themselves
entirely on this power for support in a proper spirit of dependence
and humility as collateral to and consequent on this condition of
the mind they lay the utmost stress on a disregard of all the
vanities of life a proper subjection of the lusts of the flesh and
an abstaining from the pomp and vainglory of ambition riches
power and the faculties in short the one thing needful was
humility humility humility once thoroughly humbled to a degree
that put them above the danger of backsliding they obtained
glimpses of security and were gradually elevated to the hopes and
the condition of the just

the brigadier was still eloquently discoursing on this interesting
topic when a distant door opened and a gold stick or some other
sort of stick announced the right reverend father in god his grace
the most eminent and most serene prelate the very puissant and
thrice gracious and glorified saint the primate of all leaphigh

the reader will anticipate the eager curiosity with which i advanced
to get a glimpse of a saint under a system as sublimated as that of
the great monikin family civilization having made such progress as
to strip all the people even to the king and queen entirely of
everything in the shape of clothes i did not well see under what
new mantle of simplicity the heads of the church could take refuge
perhaps they shaved off all the hair from their bodies in sign of
supereminent self-abasement leaving themselves naked to the
cuticle that they might prove by ocular evidence what a poor
ungainly set of wretches they really were carnally considered or
perhaps they went on all-fours to heaven in sign of their unfitness
to enter into the presence of the pure of mind in an attitude more
erect and confident well these fancies of mine only went to prove
how erroneous and false are the conclusions of one whose capacity
has not been amplified and concatenated by the ingenuities of a very
refined civilization his grace the most gracious father in god
wore a mantle of extraordinary fineness and beauty the material of
which was composed of every tenth hair taken from all the citizens
of leaphigh who most cheerfully submitted to be shaved in order
that the wants of his most eminent humility might be decently
supplied the mantle wove from such a warp and such a woof was
necessarily very large and it really appeared to me that the
prelate did not very well know what to do with so much of it more
especially as the contributions include a new robe annually i was
now desirous of getting a sight of his tail for knowing that the
leaphighers take great pride in the length and beauty of that
appurtenance i very naturally supposed that a saint who wore so
fine and glorious a robe by way of humility must have recourse to
some novel expedient to mortify himself on his sensitive subject at
least i found that the ample proportions of the mantle concealed
not only the person but most of the movements of the archbishop
and it was with many doubts of my success that i led the brigadier
behind the episcopal train to reconnoitre the result disappointed
expectation again instead of being destitute of a tail or of
concealing that with which nature had supplied him beneath his
mantle the most gracious dignitary wore no less than six caudae
viz his own and five others added to it by some subtle process
of clerical ingenuity that i shall not attempt to explain one bent
on the other as the captain described them in a subsequent
conversation this extraordinary train was allowed to sweep the
floor the only sign of humility according to my uninstructed
faculties i could discern about the person and appearance of this
illustrious model of clerical self-mortification and humility

the brigadier however was not tardy in setting me right in the
first place he gave me to understand that the hierarchy of leaphigh
was illustrated by the order of their tails thus a deacon wore one
and a half a curate if a minister one and three-quarters and a
rector two a dean two and a half an archdeacon three a bishop
four the primate of leaphigh five and the primate of all
leaphigh six the origin of the custom which was very ancient and
of course very much respected was imputed to the doctrine of a
saint of great celebrity who had satisfactorily proved that as the
tail was the intellectual or the spiritual part of a monikin the
farther it was removed from the mass of matter or the body the
more likely it was to be independent consecutive logical and
spiritualized the idea had succeeded astonishingly at first but
time which will wear out even a cauda had given birth to schisms
in the church on this interesting subject one party contending that
two more joints ought to be added to the archbishop's embellishment
by way of sustaining the church and the other that two joints ought
to be incontinently abstracted in the way of reform

these explanations were interrupted by the appearance of the bride
and bridegroom at different doors the charming chatterissa
advanced with a most prepossessing modesty followed by a glorious
train of noble maidens all keeping their eyes by a rigid ordinance
of hymeneal etiquette dropped to the level of the queen's feet on
the other hand my lord chatterino attended by that coxcomb
hightail and others of his kidney stepped towards the altar with a
lofty confidence which the same etiquette exacted of the
bridegroom the parties were no sooner in their places than the
prelate commenced

the marriage ceremony according to the formula of the established
church of leaphigh is a very solemn and imposing ceremony the
bridegroom is required to swear that he loves the bride and none but
the bride that he has made his choice solely on account of her
merits uninfluenced even by her beauty and that he will so far
command his inclinations as on no account ever to love another a
jot the bride on her part calls heaven and earth to witness that
she will do just what the bridegroom shall ask of her that she will
be his bondwoman his slave his solace and his delight that she is
quite certain no other monikin could make her happy but on the
other hand she is absolutely sure that any other monikin would be
certain to make her miserable when these pledges oaths and
asseverations were duly made and recorded the archbishop caused the
happy pair to be wreathed together by encircling them with his
episcopal tail and they were then pronounced monikin and monikina
i pass over the congratulations which were quite in rule to relate
a short conversation i held with the brigadier

sir said i addressing that person as soon as the prelate said
amen how is this i have seen a certificate myself which
showed that there was a just admeasurement of the fitness of this
union on the score of other considerations than those mentioned in
the ceremony

that certificate has no connection with this ceremony

and yet this ceremony repudiates all the considerations enumerated
in the certificate

this ceremony has no connection with that certificate

so it would seem and yet both refer to the same solemn
engagement

why to tell you the truth sir john goldencalf we monikins for
in these particulars leaphigh is leaplow have two distinct
governing principles in all that we say or do which may be divided
into the theoretical and the practical moral and immoral would not
be inapposite but by the first we control all our interests down
as far as facts when we immediately submit to the latter there may
possibly be something inconsistent in appearance in such an
arrangement but then our most knowing ones say that it works well
no doubt among men you get along without the embarrassment of so
much contradiction

i now advanced to pay my respects to the countess of chatterino who
stood supported by the countess-dowager a lady of great dignity and
elegance of demeanor the moment i appeared the elaborate air of
modesty vanished from the charming countenance of the bride in a
look of natural pleasure and turning to her new mother she
pointed me out as a man the courteous old dowager gave me a very
kind reception inquiring if i had enough good things to eat
whether i was not much astonished at the multitude of strange sights
i beheld in leaphigh said i ought to be much obliged to her son for
consenting to bring me over and invited me to come and see her some
fine morning

i bowed my thanks and then returned to join the brigadier with a
view to seek an introduction to the archbishop before i relate the
particulars of my interview with that pious prelate however it may
be well to say that this was the last i ever saw of any of the
chatterino set as they retired from the presence immediately after
the congratulations were ended i heard however previously to
leaving the region which was within a month of the marriage that
the noble pair kept separate establishments on account of some
disagreement about an incompatibility of temper or a young officer
of the guards i never knew exactly which but as the estates suited
each other so well there is little doubt that on the whole the
match was as happy as could be expected

the archbishop received me with a great deal of professional
benevolence the conversation dropping very naturally into a
comparison of the respective religious systems of great britain and
leaphigh he was delighted when he found we had an establishment
and i believe i was indebted to his knowledge of this fact for his
treating me more as an equal than he might otherwise have done
considering the difference in species i was much relieved by this
for at the commencement of the conversation he had sounded me a
little on doctrine at which i am far from being expert never
having taken an interest in the church and i thought he looked
frowning at some of my answers but when he heard that we really
had a national religion he seemed to think all safe nor did he
once after that inquire whether we were pagans or presbyterians
but when i told him we had actually a hierarchy i thought the good
old prelate would have shaken my hand off and beatified me on the
spot

we shall meet in heaven some day he exclaimed with holy delight
men or monikins it can make no great difference after all we
shall meet in heaven and that too in the upper mansions

the reader will suppose that an alien and otherwise unknown i was
much elated by this distinction to go to heaven in company with the
archbishop of leaphigh was in itself no small favor but to be thus
noticed by him at court was really enough to upset the philosophy of
a stranger i was sorely afraid all the while he would descend to
particulars and that he might have found some essential points of
difference to nip his new-born admiration had he asked me for
instance how many caudae our bishops wear i should have been
badgered for as near as i could recollect their personal
illustration was of another character the venerable prelate
however soon gave me his blessing pressed me warmly to come to his
palace before i sailed promised to send some tracts by me to
england and then hurried away as he said to sign a sentence of
excommunication against an unruly presbyter who had much disturbed
the harmony of the church of late by an attempt to introduce a
schism that he called piety

the brigadier and myself discussed the subject of religion at some
length when the illustrious prelate had taken his leave i was told
that the monikin world was pretty nearly equally divided into two
parts the old and the new the latter had remained uninhabited
until within a few generations when certain monikins who were too
good to live in the old world emigrated in a body and set up for
themselves in the new this the brigadier admitted was the leaplow
account of the matter the inhabitants of the old countries on the
other hand invariably maintaining that they had peopled the new
countries by sending all those of their own communities there who
were not fit to stay at home this little obscurity in the history
of the new world he considers of no great moment as such trifling
discrepancies must always depend on the character of the historian
leaphigh was by no means the only country in the elder monikin
region there were among others for instance leapup and leapdown
leapover and leapthrough leaplong and leapshort leapround and
leapunder each of these countries had a religious establishment
though leaplow being founded on a new social principle had none
the brigadier thought himself on the whole that the chief
consequences of the two systems were that the countries which had
establishments had a great reputation for possessing religion and
those that had no establishments were well enough off in the article
itself though but indifferently supplied on the score of
reputation

i inquired of the brigadier if he did not think an establishment had
the beneficial effect of sustaining truth by suppressing heresies
limiting and curtailing prurient theological fancies and otherwise
setting limits to innovations my friend did not absolutely agree
with me in all these particulars though he very frankly allowed
that it had the effect of keeping two truths from falling out by
separating them thus leapup maintained one set of religious dogmas
under its establishment and leapdown maintained their converse by
keeping these truths apart no doubt religious harmony was
promoted and the several ministers of the gospel were enabled to
turn all their attention to the sins of the community instead of
allowing it to be diverted to the sins of each other as was very
apt to be the case when there was an antagonist interest to oppose

shortly after the king and queen gave us all our conges noah and
myself got through the crowd without injury to our trains and we
separated in the court of the palace he to go to his bed and dream
of his trial on the morrow and i to go home with judge people's
friend and the brigadier who had invited me to finish the evening
with a supper i was left chatting with the last while the first
went into his closet to indite a dispatch to his government
relating to the events of the evening

the brigadier was rather caustic in his comments on the incidents of
the drawing-room a republican himself he certainly did love to
give royalty and nobility some occasional rubs though i must do
this worthy upright monikin the justice to say he was quite
superior to that vulgar hostility which is apt to distinguish many
of his caste and which is founded on a principle as simple as the
fact that they cannot be kings and nobles themselves

while we were chatting very pleasantly quite at our ease and in
undress as it were the brigadier in his bob and i with my tail
aside judge people's friend rejoined us with his dispatch open in
his hand he read aloud what he had written to my great
astonishment for i had been accustomed to think diplomatic
communications sacred but the judge observed that in this case it
was useless to affect secrecy for two very good reasons firstly
because he had been obliged to employ a common leaphigh scrivener to
copy what he had written his government depending on a noble
republican economy which taught it that if it did get into
difficulties by the betrayal of its correspondence it would still
have the money that a clerk would cost to help it out of the
embarrassment and secondly because he knew the government itself
would print it as soon as it arrived for his part he liked to have
the publishing of his own works under these circumstances i was
even allowed to take a copy of the letter of which i now furnish a
fac-simile

sir the undersigned envoy-extraordinary and minister-
plenipotentiary of the north-western leaplow confederate union has
the honor to inform the secretary of state that our interests in
this portion of the earth are in general on the best possible
footing our national character is getting every day to be more and
more elevated our rights are more and more respected and our flag
is more and more whitening every sea after this flattering and
honorable account of the state of our general concerns i hasten to
communicate the following interesting particulars

the treaty between our beloved north-western confederate union and
leaphigh has been dishonored in every one of its articles nineteen
leaplow seamen have been forcibly impressed into a leapthrough
vessel of war the king of leapup has made an unequivocal
demonstration with a very improper part of his person at us and
the king of leapover has caused seven of our ships to be seized and
sold and the money to be given to his mistress

sir i congratulate you on this very flattering condition of our
foreign relations which can only be imputed to the glorious
constitution of which we are the common servants and to the just
dread which the leaplow name has so universally inspired in other
nations

the king has just had a drawing-room in which i took great care to
see that the honor of our beloved country should be faithfully
attended to my cauda was at least three inches longer than that of
the representative of leapup the minister most favored by nature in
this important particular and i have the pleasure of adding that
her majesty the queen deigned to give me a very gracious smile of
the sincerity of that smile there can be no earthly doubt sir for
though there is abundant evidence that she did apply certain
unseemly words to our beloved country lately it would quite exceed
the rules of diplomatic courtesy and be unsustained by proof were
we to call in question her royal sincerity on this public occasion
indeed sir at all the recent drawing-rooms i have received smiles
of the most sincere and encouraging character not only from the
king but from all his ministers his first-cousin in particular
and i trust they will have the most beneficial effects on the
questions at issue between the kingdom of leaphigh and our beloved
country if they would now only do us justice in the very important
affair of the long-standing and long-neglected redress which we
have been seeking in vain at their hands for the last seventy-two
years i should say that our relations were on the best possible
footing

sir i congratulate you on the profound respect with which the
leaplow name is treated in the most distant quarters of the earth
and on the benign influence this fortunate circumstance is likely to
exercise on all our important interests

i see but little probability of effecting the object of my special
mission but the utmost credit is to be attached to the sincerity of
the smiles of the king and queen and of all the royal family

in a late conversation with his majesty he inquired in the kindest
manner after the health of the great sachem this is the title of
the head of the leaplow government and observed that our growth
and prosperity put all other nations to shame and that we might on
all occasions depend on his most profound respect and perpetual
friendship in short sir all nations far and near desire our
alliance are anxious to open new sources of commerce and entertain
for us the profoundest respect and the most inviolable esteem you
can tell the great sachem that this feeling is surprisingly
augmented under his administration and that it has at least
quadrupled during my mission if leaphigh would only respect its
treaties leapthrough would cease taking our seamen leapup have
greater deference for the usages of good society and the king of
leapover would seize no more of our ships to supply his mistress
with pocket-money our foreign relations might be considered to be
without spot as it is sir they are far better off than i could
have expected or indeed had ever hoped to see them and of one
thing you may be diplomatically certain that we are universally
respected and that the leaplow name is never mentioned without all
in company rising and waving their caudae

hon    - etc

p s private

dear sir if you publish this dispatch omit the part where the
difficulties are repeated i beg you will see that my name is put in
with those of the other patriots against the periodical rotation of
the little wheel as i shall certainly be obliged to return home
soon having consumed all my means indeed the expense of
maintaining a tail of which our people have no notion is so very
great that i think none of our missions should exceed a week in
duration

i would especially advise that the message should dilate on the
subject of the high standing of the leaplow character in foreign
nations for to be frank with you facts require that this
statement should be made as often as possible

when this letter was read the conversation reverted to religion
the brigadier explained that the law of leaphigh had various
peculiarities on this subject that i do not remember to have heard
of before thus a monikin could not be born without paying
something to the church a practice which early initiated him into
his duties towards that important branch of the public welfare and
even when he died he left a fee behind him for the parson as an
admonition to those who still existed in the flesh not to forget
their obligations he added that this sacred interest was in short
so rigidly protected that whenever a monikin refused to be plucked
for a new clerical or episcopal mantle there was a method of
fleecing him by the application of red-hot iron rods which
generally singed so much of his skin that he was commonly willing
in the end to let the hair-proctors pick and choose at pleasure

i confess i was indignant at this picture and did not hesitate to
stigmatize the practice as barbarous

your indignation is very natural sir john and is just what a
stranger would be likely to feel when he found mercy and charity
and brotherly love and virtue and above all humility made the
stalking-horses of pride selfishness and avarice but this is the
way with us monikins no doubt men manage better




chapter xx

a very common case or a great deal of law and very little justice-
-heads and tails with the dangers of each


i was early with noah on the following morning the poor fellow
when it is remembered that he was about to be tried for a capital
offence in a foreign country under novel institutions and before
a jury of a different species manifested a surprising degree of
fortitude still the love of life was strong within him as was
apparent by the way in which he opened the discourse

did you observe how the wind was this morning sir john as you
came in the straightforward sealer inquired with a peculiar
interest

it is a pleasant gale from the southward

right off shore if one knew where all them blackguards of rear
admirals and post captains were to be found i don't think sir
john that you would care much about paying those fifty thousand
promises

my recognizances not in the least my dear friend were it not
for our honor it would scarcely be creditable for the walrus to
sail however leaving an unsettled account of her captain's behind
us what would they say at stunin'tun what would your own consort
think of an act so unmanly

why at stunin'tun we think him the smartest who gets the easiest
out of any difficulty and i don't well see why miss poke should
know it or if she did why she should think the worse of her
husband for saving his life

away with these unworthy thoughts and brace yourself to meet the
trial we shall at least get some insight into the leaphigh
jurisprudence come i see you are already dressed for the occasion
let us be as prompt as duellists

noah made up his mind to submit with dignity although he lingered
in the great square in order to study the clouds in a way to show
he might have settled the whole affair with the fore-topsail had he
known where to find his crew fortunately for the reputations of all
concerned however he did not and discarding everything like
apprehension from his countenance the sturdy mariner entered the
old bailey with the tread of a man and the firmness of innocence i
ought to have said sooner that we had received notice early in the
morning that the proceedings had been taken from before the pages
on appeal and that a new venue had been laid in the high criminal
court of leaphigh

brigadier downright met us at the door where also a dozen grave
greasy-looking counsellors gathered about us in a way to show that
they were ready to volunteer in behalf of the stranger on receiving
no more than the customary fee but i had determined to defend noah
myself the court consenting for i had forebodings that our safety
would depend more on an appeal to the rights of hospitality than on
any legal defence it was in our power to offer as the brigadier
kindly volunteered to aid me for nothing i thought proper not to
refuse his services however

i pass over the appearance of the court the empanelling of the
jury and the arraignment for in matters of mere legal forms
there is no great difference between civilized countries all of
them wearing the same semblance of justice the first indictment
for unhappily there were two charged noah with having committed an
assault with malice prepense on the king's dignity with sticks
daggers muskets blunderbusses air-guns and other unlawful
weapons more especially with the tongue in that he had accused his
majesty face to face with having a memory etc etc the other
indictment repeating the formula of the first charged the honest
sealer with feloniously accusing her majesty the queen in defiance
of the law to the injury of good morals and the peace of society
with having no memory etc etc to both these charges the plea of
not guilty was entered as fast as possible in behalf of our
client

i ought to have said before that both brigadier downright and
myself had applied to be admitted of counsel for the accused under
an ancient law of leaphigh as next of kin i as a fellow human
being and the brigadier by adoption

the preliminary forms observed the attorney-general was about to go
into proof in behalf of the crown when my brother downright arose
and said that he intended to save the precious time of the court by
admitting the facts and that it was intended to rest the defence
altogether on the law of the case he presumed the jury were the
judges of the law as well as of the facts according to the rule of
leaplow and that he and his brother goldencalf were quite prepared
to show that the law was altogether with us in this affair the
court received the admission and the facts were submitted to the
jury by consent as proven although the chief-justice took
occasion to remark longbeard dissenting that while the jury were
certainly judges of the law in one sense yet there was another
sense in which they were not judges of the law the dissent of baron
longbeard went to maintain that while the jury were the judges of
the law in the another sense mentioned they were not judges of
the law in the one sense named this difficulty disposed of mr
attorney-general arose and opened for the crown

i soon found that we had one of a very comprehensive and
philosophical turn of mind against us in the advocate of the other
side he commenced his argument by a vigorous and lucid sketch of
the condition of the world previously to the subdivisions of its
different inhabitants into nations and tribes and clans while in
the human or chrysalis condition from this statement he deduced
the regular gradations by which men become separated into
communities and subjected to the laws of civilization or what is
called society having proceeded thus far he touched lightly on the
different phases that the institutions of men had presented and
descended gradually and consecutively to the fundamental principles
of the social compact as they were known to exist among monikins
after a few general observations that properly belonged to the
subject he came to speak of those portions of the elementary
principles of society that are connected with the rights of the
sovereign these he divided into the rights of the king's
prerogative the rights of the king's person and the rights of the
king's conscience here he again generalized a little and in a very
happy manner so well indeed as to leave all his hearers in doubt
as to what he would next be at when by a fierce logical swoop he
descended suddenly on the last of the king's rights as the one that
was most connected with the subject

he triumphantly showed that the branch of the royal immunities that
was chiefly affected by the offence of the prisoner at the bar was
very clearly connected with the rights of the king's conscience
the attributes of royalty observed the sagacious advocate are
not to be estimated in the same manner as the attributes of the
subject in the sacred person of the king are centred many if not
most of the interesting privileges of monikinism that royal
personage in apolitical sense can do no wrong official
infallibility is the consequence such a being has no occasion for
the ordinary faculties of the monikin condition of what use for
instance is a judgment or a conscience to a functionary who can
do no wrong the law in order to relieve one on whose shoulders was
imposed the burden of the state had consequently placed the latter
especially in the keeping of another his majesty's first-cousin is
the keeper of his conscience as is known throughout the realm of
leaphigh a memory is the faculty of the least account to a
personage who has no conscience and while it is not contended that
the sovereign is relieved from the possession of his memory by any
positive statute law or direct constitutional provision it
follows by unavoidable implication and by all legitimate
construction that having no occasion to possess such a faculty it
is the legal presumption he is altogether without it

that simplicity lucidity and distinctness my lords continued
mr attorney-general which are necessary to every well-ordered
mind would be impaired in the case of his majesty were his
intellectual faculties unnecessarily crowded in this useless manner
and the state would be the sufferer my lords the king reigns but
he does not govern this is a fundamental principle of the
constitution nay it is more it is the palladium of our liberties
my lords it is an easy matter to reign in leaphigh it requires no
more than the rights of primogeniture sufficient discretion to
understand the distinction between reigning and governing and a
political moderation that is unlikely to derange the balance of the
state but it is quite a different thing to govern his majesty is
required to govern nothing the slight interests just mentioned
excepted no not even himself the case is far otherwise with his
first-cousin this high functionary is charged with the important
trust of governing it had been found in the early ages of the
monarchy that one conscience or indeed one set of faculties
generally scarcely sufficed for him whose duty it was both to reign
and to govern we all know my lords how insufficient for our
personal objects are our own private faculties how difficult we
find it to restrain even ourselves assisted merely by our own
judgments consciences and memories and in this fact do we
perceive the great importance of investing him who governs others
with an additional set of these grave faculties under a due
impression of the exigency of such a state of things the common
law not statute law my lords which is apt to be tainted with the
imperfections of monikin reason in its isolated or individual state
usually bearing the impress of the single cauda from which it
emanated but the common law the known receptacle of all the common
sense of the nation in such a state of things then has the common
law long since decreed that his majesty's first-cousin should be the
keeper of his majesty's conscience and by necessary legal
implication endowed with his majesty's judgment his majesty's
reason and finally his majesty's memory

my lords this is the legal presumption it would in addition be
easy for me to show in a thousand facts that not only the
sovereign of leaphigh but most other sovereigns are and ever have
been destitute of the faculty of a memory it might be said to be
incompatible with the royal condition to be possessed of this
obtrusive faculty were a prince endowed with a memory he might
lose sight of his high estate in the recollection that he was born
and that he is destined like another to die he might be troubled
with visions of the past nay the consciousness of his very dignity
might be unsettled and weakened by a vivid view of the origin of his
royal race promises obligations attachments duties principles
and even debts might interfere with the due discharge of his sacred
trusts were the sovereign invested with a memory and it has
therefore been decided from time immemorial that his majesty is
utterly without the properties of reason judgment and memory as a
legitimate inference from his being destitute of a conscience

mr attorney-general now directed the attention of the court and
jury to a statute of the d of firstborn th by which it was
enacted that any person attributing to his majesty the possession of
any faculty with felonious intent that might endanger the
tranquillity of the state should suffer decaudization without
benefit of clergy here he rested the case on behalf of the crown

there was a solemn pause after the speaker had resumed his seat
his argument logic and above all his good sense and undeniable
law made a very sensible impression and i had occasion to observe
that noah began to chew tobacco ravenously after a decent interval
however brigadier downright who it would seem in spite of his
military appellation was neither more nor less than a practising
attorney and counsellor in the city of bivouac the commercial
capital of the republic of leaplow arose and claimed a right to be
heard in reply the court now took it into its head to start the
objection for the first time that the advocate had not been duly
qualified to plead or to argue at their bar my brother downright
instantly referred their lordships to the law of adoption and to
that provision of the criminal code which permitted the accused to
be heard by his next of kin

prisoner at the bar said the chief-justice you hear the
statement of counsel is it your desire to commit the management of
your defence to your next of kin

to anybody your honors if the court please returned noah
furiously masticating his beloved weed to anybody who will do it
well my honorables and do it cheap

and do you adopt under the provisions of the statute in such cases
made and provided aaron downright as one of your next of kin and
if so in what capacity

i do i do my lords and your honors i do body and soul if you
please i adopt the brigadier as my father and my fellow human
being and tried friend sir john goldencalf here i adopt him as my
mother

the court now formally assenting the facts were entered of record
and my brother downright was requested to proceed with the defence

the counsel for the prisoner like dandin in racine's comedy of les
plaideurs was disposed to pass over the deluge and to plunge
instantly into the core of his subject he commenced with a review
of the royal prerogatives and with a definition of the words to
reign referring to the dictionary of the academy he showed
triumphantly that to reign was no other than to govern as a
sovereign while to govern in the familiar signification was no
more than to govern in the name of a prince or as a deputy having
successfully established this point he laid down the position that
the greater might contain the less but that the less could not
possibly contain the greater that the right to reign or to govern
in the generic signification of the term must include all the
lawful attributes of him who only governed in the secondary
signification and that consequently the king not only reigned
but governed he then proceeded to show that memory was
indispensable to him who governed since without one he could
neither recollect the laws make a suitable disposition of rewards
and punishments nor in fact do any other intelligent or necessary
act again it was contended that by the law of the land the king's
conscience was in the keeping of his first-cousin now in order
that the king's conscience should be in such keeping it was clear
that he must have a conscience since a nonentity could not be in
keeping or even put in commission and having a conscience it
followed ex necessitate rei that he must have the attributes of a
conscience of which memory formed one of the most essential
features conscience was defined to be the faculty by which we
judge of the goodness or wickedness of our own actions see
johnson's dictionary page letter c london edition rivington
publisher now in what manner can one judge of the goodness or
wickedness of his acts or of those of any other person if he knows
nothing about them and how can he know anything of the past unless
endowed with the faculty of a memory

again it was a political corollary from the institutions of
leaphigh that the king could do no wrong 

i beg your pardon my brother downright interrupted the chief-
justice it is not a corollary but a proposition and one too
that is held to be demonstrated it is the paramount law of the
land

i thank you my lord continued the brigadier as your lordship's
high authority makes my case so much the stronger it is then
settled law gentle monikins of the jury that the sovereign of this
realm can do no wrong it is also settled law their lordships will
correct me if i misstate it is also settled law that the sovereign
is the fountain of honor that he can make war and peace that he
administers justice sees the laws executed 

i beg your pardon again brother downright interrupted the
chief-justice this is not the law but the prerogative it is the
king's prerogative to be and do all this but it is very far from
being law

am i to understand my lord that the court makes a distinction
between that which is prerogative and that which is law

beyond a doubt brother downright if all that is prerogative was
also law we could not get on an hour

prerogative if your lordship pleases or prerogativa is defined
to be an exclusive or peculiar privilege johnson letter p page
 fifth clause from bottom edition as aforesaid speaking slow
in order to enable baron longbeard to make his notes now an
exclusive privilege i humbly urge must supersede all enactments
and 

not at all sir not at all sir not at all sir put in my lord
chief-justice dogmatically-looking out of the window at the clouds
in a way to show that his mind was quite made up not at all good
sir the king has his prerogatives beyond a question and they are
sacred a part of the constitution they are moreover exclusive
and peculiar as stated by johnson but their exclusiveness and
peculiarity are not to be constructed in the vulgar acceptations in
treating of the vast interests of a state the mind must take a wide
range and i hold brother longbeard there is no principle more
settled than the fact that prerogativa is one thing and lex or
the law another the baron bowed assent by exclusion in this
case is meant that the prerogative touches only his majesty the
prerogative is exclusively his property and he may do what he
pleases with it but the law is made for the nation and is
altogether a different matter again by peculiar is clearly meant
peculiarity or that this case is analogous to no other and must be
reasoned on by the aid of a peculiar logic no sir the king can
make peace and war it is true under his prerogative but then his
conscience is hard and fast in the keeping of another who alone can
perform all legal acts

but my lord justice though administered by others is still
administered in the king's name

no doubt in his name this is a part of the peculiar privilege
war is made in his majesty's name too so is peace what is war it
is the personal conflicts between bodies of men of different
nations does his majesty engage in these conflicts certainly not
the war is maintained by taxes does his majesty pay them no thus
we see that while the war is constitutionally the king's it is
practically the people's it follows as a corollary since you
quote corollaries brother downright that there are two wars or
the war of the prerogative and the war of the fact now the
prerogative is a constitutional principle a very sacred one
certainly but a fact is a thing that comes home to every monikin's
fireside and therefore the courts have decided ever since the
reign of timid ii or ever since they dared that the prerogative
was one thing and the law another

my brother downright seemed a good deal perplexed by the
distinctions of the court and he concluded much sooner than he
otherwise would have done summing up the whole of his arguments by
showing or attempting to show that if the king had even these
peculiar privileges and nothing else he must be supposed to have a
memory

the court now called upon the attorney-general to reply but that
person appeared to think his case strong enough as it was and the
matter by agreement was submitted to the jury after a short
charge from the bench

you are not to suffer your intellects to be confused
gentlemonikins by the argument of the prisoner's counsel
concluded the chief-justice he has done his duty and it remains
for you to be equally conscientious you are in this case the
judges of the law and the fact but it is a part of my functions to
inform you what they both are by the law the king is supposed to
have no faculties the inference drawn by counsel that not being
capable of erring the king must have the highest possible moral
attributes and consequently a memory is unsound the constitution
says his majesty can do no wrong this inability may proceed from a
variety of causes if he can do nothing for instance he can do no
wrong the constitution does not say that the sovereign will do no
wrong but that he can do no wrong now gentlemonikins when a
thing cannot be done it becomes impossible and it is of course
beyond the reach of argument it is of no moment whether a person
has a memory if he cannot use it and in such a case the legal
presumption is that he is without a memory for otherwise nature
who is ever wise and beneficent would be throwing away her gifts

gentlemonikins i have already said you are the judges in this
case of both the law and the fact the fate of the prisoner is in
your hands god forbid that it should be in any manner influenced
by me but this is an offence against the king's dignity and the
security of the realm the law is against the prisoner the facts
are all against the prisoner and i do not doubt that your verdict
will be the spontaneous decision of your own excellent judgments
and of such a nature as will prevent the necessity of our ordering a
new trial

the jurors put their tails together and in less than a minute
their foremonikin rendered a verdict of guilty noah sighed and
took a fresh supply of tobacco

the case of the queen was immediately opened by her majesty's
attorney-general the prisoner having been previously arraigned and
a plea entered of not guilty

the queen's advocate made a bitter attack on the animus of the
unfortunate prisoner he described her majesty as a paragon of
excellences as the depositary of all the monikin virtues and the
model of her sex if she who was so justly celebrated for the
gifts of charity meekness religion justice and submission to
feminine duties had no memory he asked leave to demand in the
name of god who had without a memory in what manner was this
illustrious personage to recall her duties to her royal consort her
duties to her royal offspring her duties to her royal self memory
was peculiarly a royal attribute and without its possession no one
could properly be deemed of high and ancient lineage memory
referred to the past and the consideration due to royalty was
scarcely ever a present consideration but a consideration connected
with the past we venerated the past time was divided into the
past present and future the past was invariably a monarchical
interest the present was claimed by republicans the future
belonged to fate if it were decided that the queen had no memory
we should strike a blow at royalty it was by memory as connected
with the public archives that the king derived his title to his
throne it was by memory which recalled the deeds of his ancestors
that he became entitled to our most profound respect

in this manner did the queen's attorney-general speak for about an
hour when he gave way to the counsel for the prisoner but to my
great surprise for i knew that this accusation was much the gravest
of the two since the head of noah would be the price of conviction
my brother downright instead of making a very ingenious reply as i
had fully anticipated merely said a few words in which he
expressed so firm a confidence in the acquittal of his client as to
appear to think a further defence altogether unnecessary he had no
sooner seated himself than i expressed a strong dissatisfaction
with this course and avowed an intention to make an effort in
behalf of my poor friend myself

keep silence sir john whispered my brother downright the
advocate who makes many unsuccessful applications gets to be
disrespected i charge myself with the care of the lord high
admiral's interests at the proper time they shall be duly attended
to

having the profoundest respect for the brigadier's legal
attainments and no great confidence in my own i was fain to
submit in the meantime the business of the court proceeded and
the jury having received a short charge from the bench which was
quite as impartial as a positive injunction to convict could very
well be again rendered the verdict of guilty

in leaphigh although it is deemed indecent to wear clothes it is
also esteemed exceedingly decorous for certain high functionaries to
adorn their persons with suitable badges of their official rank we
have already had an account of the hierarchy of tails and a general
description of the mantle composed of tenth-hairs but i had
forgotten to say that both my lord chief-justice and baron longbeard
had tail-cases made of the skins of deceased monikins which gave
the appearance of greater development to their intellectual organs
and most probably had some influence in the way of coddling their
brains which required great care and attention on account of
incessant use they now drew over these tail-cases a sort of box-
coat of a very bloodthirsty color which we were given to
understand was a sign that they were in earnest and about to
pronounce sentence justice in leaphigh being of singularly
bloodthirsty habits

prisoner at the bar the chief-justice began in a voice of
reproof you have heard the decision of your peers you have been
arraigned and tried on the heinous charge of having accused the
sovereign of this realm of being in possession of the faculty called
a memory thereby endangering the peace of society unsettling the
social relations and setting a dangerous example of insubordination
and of contempt of the laws of this crime after a singularly
patient and impartial hearing you have been found guilty the law
allows the court no discretion in the case it is my duty to pass
sentence forthwith and i now solemnly ask you if you have anything
to say why sentence of decaudization should not be pronounced
against you here the chief-justice took just time enough to gape
and then proceeded you are right in throwing yourself altogether
on the mercy of the court which better knows what is fittest for
you than you can possibly know for yourself you will be taken
noah poke or no sea-water-color forthwith to the centre of
the public square between the hours of sunrise and sunset of this
day where your cauda will be cut off and after it has been divided
into four parts a part will be exposed towards each of the cardinal
points of the compass and the brush thereof being consumed by fire
the ashes will be thrown into your face and this without benefit of
clergy and may the lord have mercy on your soul

noah poke or no sea-water-color put in baron longbeard
without giving the culprit breathing-time you have been indicted
tried and found guilty of the enormous crime of charging the queen-
consort of this realm of being wanting in the ordinary important
and every-day faculty of a memory have you anything to say why
sentence should not be forthwith passed against you no i am sure
you are very right in throwing yourself altogether on the mercy of
the court which is quite disposed to show you all that is in its
power which happens in this case to be none at all i need not
dwell on the gravity of your offence if the law should allow that
the queen has no memory other females might put in claims to the
same privilege and society would become a chaos marriage vows
duties affections and all our nearest and dearest interests would
be unhinged and this pleasant state of being would degenerate into
a moral or rather an immoral pandemonium keeping in view these
all-important considerations and more especially the imperativeness
of the law which does not admit of discretion the court sentences
you to be carried hence without delay to the centre of the great
square where your head will be severed from your body by the public
executioner without benefit of clergy after which your remains are
to be consigned to the public hospitals for the purposes of
dissection

the words were scarcely out of baron longbeard's mouth before both
the attorneys-general started up to move the court in behalf of the
separate dignities of their respective principals mr attorney-
general of the crown prayed the court so far to amend its sentence
as to give precedency to the punishment on account of the offence
against the king and mr attorney-general for the queen to pray
the court it would not be so far forgetful of her majesty's rights
and dignity as to establish a precedent so destructive of both i
caught a glimpse of hope glancing about the eyes of my brother
downright who waiting just long enough to let the two advocates
warm themselves over these points of law arose and moved the court
for a stay of execution on the plea that neither sentence was
legal that delivered by my lord chief-justice containing a
contradiction inasmuch as it ordered the decaudization to take
place between the hours of sunrise and sunset and also forthwith
and that delivered by baron longbeard on account of its ordering
the body to be given up to dissection contrary to the law which
merely made that provision in the case of condemned monikins the
prisoner at the bar being entirely of another species

the court deemed all these objections serious but decided on its
own incompetency to take cognizance of them it was a question for
the twelve judges who were now on the point of assembling and to
whom they referred the whole affair on appeal in the meantime
justice could not be stayed the prisoner must be carried out into
the square and matters must proceed but should either of the
points be finally determined in his favor he could have the benefit
of it so far as circumstances would then allow hereupon the court
rose and the judges counsel and clerks repaired in a body to the
hall of the twelve judges




chapter xxi

better and better more law and more justice tails and heads the
importance of keeping each in its proper place


noah was incontinently transferred to the place of execution where
i promised to meet him in time to receive his parting sigh
curiosity inducing me first to learn the issue on the appeal the
brigadier told me in confidence as we went to the other hall that
the affair was now getting to be one of great interest that
hitherto it had been mere boy's play but it would in future require
counsel of great reading and research to handle the arguments and
that he flattered himself there was a good occasion likely to
present itself for him to show what monikin reason really was

the whole of the twelve wore tail-cases and altogether they
presented a formidable array of intellectual development as the
cause of noah was admitted to be one of more than common urgency
after hearing only three or four other short applications on behalf
of the crown whose rights always have precedence on such occasions
the attorney-general of the king was desired to open his case

the learned counsel spoke in anticipation to the objections of
both his adversaries beginning with those of my brother downright
forthwith he contended might be at any period of the twenty-four
hours according to the actual time of using the term thus
forthwith of a morning would mean in the morning forthwith at
noon would mean at noon and so on to the close of the legal day
moreover in a legal signification forthwith must mean between
sunrise and sunset the statute commanding that all executions shall
take place by the light of the sun and consequently the two terms
ratified and confirmed each other instead of conveying a
contradiction or of neutralizing each other as would most probably
be contended by the opposite counsel

to all this my brother downright as is usual on such occasions
objected pretty much the converse he maintained that all light
proceeded from the sun and that the statute therefore could only
mean that there should be no executions during eclipses a period
when the whole monikin race ought to be occupied in adoration
forthwith moreover did not necessarily mean forthwith for
forthwith meant immediately and between sunrise and sunset meant
between sunrise and sunset which might be immediately or might
not

on this point the twelve judges decided firstly that forthwith did
not mean forthwith secondly that forthwith did mean forthwith
thirdly that forthwith had two legal meanings fourthly that it
was illegal to apply one of these legal meanings to a wrong legal
purpose and fifthly that the objection was of no avail as
respected the case of no sea-water-color ordered therefore
that the criminal lose his tail forthwith

the objection to the other sentence met with no better fate men and
monikins did not differ more than some men differed from other men
or some monikins differed from other monikins ordered that the
sentence be confirmed with costs i thought this decision the
soundest of the two for i had often had occasion to observe that
there were very startling points of resemblance between monkeys and
our own species

the contest now commenced between the two attorneys-general in
earnest and as the point at issue was a question of mere rank it
excited a lively i may say an engrossing interest in all the
hearers it was settled however after a vigorous discussion in
favor of the king whose royal dignity the twelve judges were
unanimously of opinion was entitled to precedency over that of the
queen to my great surprise my brother downright volunteered an
argument on this intricate point making an exceedingly clever
speech in favor of the king's dignity as was admitted by every one
who heard it it rested chiefly on the point that the ashes of the
tail were by the sentence to be thrown into the culprit's face it
is true this might be done physically after decapitation but it
could not be done morally this part of the punishment was designed
for a moral effect and to produce that effect consciousness and
shame were both necessary therefore the moral act of throwing the
ashes into the face of the criminal could only be done while he was
living and capable of being ashamed

meditation chief-justice delivered the opinion of the bench it
contained the usual amount of legal ingenuity and logic was
esteemed as very eloquent in that part which touched on the sacred
and inviolable character of the royal prerogatives prerogativae as
he termed them and was so lucid in pointing out the general
inferiority of the queen-consort that i felt happy her majesty was
not present to hear herself and sex undervalued as might have been
expected it allowed great weight to the distinction taken by the
brigadier the decision was in the following words viz rex et
regina versus no sea-water-color ordered that the officers of
justice shall proceed forthwith to decaudizate the defendant before
they decapitate him provided he has not been forthwith decapitated
before he can be decaudizated

the moment this mandamus was put into the hands of the proper
officer brigadier downright caught me by the knee and led me out
of the hall of justice as if both out lives depended on our
expedition i was about to reproach him for having volunteered to
aid the king's attorney-general when seizing me by the root of the
tail for the want of a button-hole he said with evident
satisfaction

affairs go on swimmingly my dear sir john i do not remember to
have been employed for some years in a more interesting
litigation now this cause which no doubt you think is drawing to
a close has just reached its pivot or turning-point and i see
every prospect of extricating our client with great credit to
myself

how my brother downright i interrupted the accused is finally
sentenced if not actually executed

not so fast my good sir john not so fast by any means nothing
is final in law while there is a farthing to meet the costs or the
criminal can yet gasp i hold our case to be in an excellent way
much better than i have deemed it at any time since the accused was
arraigned

surprise left me no other power than that which was necessary to
demand an explanation

all depends on the single fact dear sir continued my brother
downright whether the head is still on the body of the accused or
not do you proceed as fast as possible to the place of execution
and should our client still have a head keep up his spirits by a
proper religious discourse always preparing him for the worst for
this is no more than wisdom but the instant his tail is separated
from his body run hither as fast as you can to apprise me of the
fact i ask but two things of you speed in coming with the news
and perfect certainty that the tail is not yet attached to the rest
of the frame by even a hair a hair often turns the scales of
justice

the case seems desperate would it not be as well for me to run
down to the palace at once demand an audience of their majesties
throw myself on my knees before the royal pair and implore a
pardon

your project is impracticable for three sufficient reasons
firstly there is not time secondly you would not be admitted
without a special appointment thirdly there is neither a king nor
a queen

no king in leaphigh

i have said it

explain yourself brother downright or i shall be obliged to
refute what you say by the evidence of my own senses

your senses will prove to be false witnesses then formerly there
was a king in leaphigh and one who governed as well as reigned
but the nobles and grandees of the country deeming it indecent to
trouble his majesty with affairs of state any longer took upon
themselves all the trouble of governing leaving to the sovereign
the sole duty of reigning this was done in a way to save his
feelings under the pretence of setting up a barrier to the physical
force and abuses of the mass after a time it was found
inconvenient and expensive to feed and otherwise support the royal
family and all its members were privately shipped to a distant
region which had not yet got to be so far advanced in civilization
as to know how to keep up a monarchy without a monarch

and does leaphigh succeed in effecting this prodigy

wonderfully well by means of decapitations and decaudizations
enough even greater exploits may be performed

but am i to understand literally brother downright there is no
such thing as a monarch in this country

literally

and the presentations

are like these trials to maintain the monarchy

and the crimson curtains 

conceal empty seats

why not then dispense with so much costly representation

in what way could the grandees cry out that the throne is in
danger if there were no throne it is one thing to have no monarch
and another to have no throne but all this time our client is in
great jeopardy hasten therefore and be particular to act as i
have just instructed you

i stopped to hear no more but in a minute was flying towards the
centre of the square it was easy enough to perceive the tail of my
friend waving over the crowd but grief and apprehension had already
rendered his countenance so rueful that at the first glance i did
not recognize his head he was however still in the body for
luckily for himself and more especially for the success of his
principal counsel the gravity of his crimes had rendered unusual
preparations necessary for the execution as the mandate of the
court had not yet arrived justice being as prompt in leaphigh as
her ministers are dilatory two blocks were prepared and the
culprit was about to get down on his hands and knees between them
just as i forced my way through the crowd to his side

ah sir john this is an awful predicament exclaimed the rebuked
noah a ra'ally awful situation for a human christian to have his
enemies lying athwart both bows and starn

while there is life there is hope but it is always best to be
prepared for the worst he who is thus prepared never can meet with
a disagreeable surprise messrs executioners for there were two
that of the king and that of the queen or one at each end of the
unhappy criminal messrs executioners i pray you to give the
culprit a moment to arrange his thoughts and to communicate his
last requests in behalf of his distant family and friends

to this reasonable petition neither of the higher functionaries of
the law made any objection although both insisted if they did not
forthwith bring the culprit to the last stages of preparation they
might lose their places they did not see however but a man might
pause for a moment on the brink of the grave it would seem that
there had been a little misunderstanding between the executioners
themselves on the point of precedency which had been one cause of
the delay and which had been disposed of by an arrangement that
both should operate at the same instant noah was now brought down
to his hands and knees moored head and starn as that unfeeling
blackguard bob who was in the crowd expressed it between the two
blocks his neck lying on one and his tail on the other while in
this edifying attitude i was permitted to address him

it may be well to bethink you of your soul my dear captain i
said for to speak truth these axes have a very prompt and
sanguinary appearance

i know it sir john i know it and not to mislead you i will own
that i have been repenting with all my might ever since that first
vardict that affair of the lord high admiral in particular has
given me a good deal of consarn and i now humbly ask your pardon
for being led away by such a miserable deception which is all owing
to that riptyle dr reasono who i hope will yet meet with his
desarts i forgive everybody and hope everybody will forgive me as
for miss poke it will be a hard case for she is altogether past
expecting another consort and she must be satisfied to be a relic
the rest of her days

repentance repentance my dear noah repentance is the one thing
needful for a man in your extremity

i do i do sir john body and soul i repent from the bottom of
my heart ever having come on this v'y'ge nay i don't know but i
repent ever having come outside of montauk point i might at this
moment have been a school-master or a tavern-keeper in stunnin'tun
and they are both good wholesome berths particularly the last lord
love you sir john if repentance would do any good i should be
pardoned on the spot

here noah caught a glimpse of bob grinning in the crowd and he
asked of the executioners as a last favor that they would have the
boy brought near that he might take an affectionate leave of him
this reasonable request was complied with despite of poor bob's
struggles and the youngster had quite as good reasons for hearty
repentance as the culprit himself just at this trying moment the
mandate for the order of the punishments arrived and the officials
seriously declared that the condemned must be prepared to meet his
fate

the unflinching manner in which captain poke submitted to the mortal
process of decaudization extracted plaudits from and awakened
sympathy in every monikin present having satisfied myself that the
tail was actually separated from the body i ran as fast as legs
could carry me towards the hall of the twelve judges my brother
downright who was impatiently expecting my appearance instantly
arose and moved the bench to issue a mandamus for a stay of
execution in the case of regina versus noah poke or no sea-
water-color by the statute of the d of longevity and flirtilla it
was enacted my lords put in the brigadier that in no case shall
a convicted felon suffer loss of life or limb while it can be
established that he is non compos mentis this is also a rule my
lords of common law but being common sense and common monikinity
it has been thought prudent to enforce it by an especial enactment
i presume mr attorney-general for the queen will scarcely dispute
the law of the case 

not at all my lords though i have some doubts as to the fact the
fact remains to be established answered the other taking snuff

the fact is certain and will not admit of cavil in the case of
rex versus noah poke the court ordered the punishment of
decaudization to take precedence of that of decapitation in the
case of regina versus the same process had been issued from the
bench to that effect the culprit has in consequence lost his
cauda and with it his reason a creature without reason has always
been held to be non compos mentis and by the law of the land is not
liable to the punishments of life or limb

your law is plausible my brother downright observed my lord
chief-justice but it remains for the bench to be put in possession
of the facts at the next term you will perhaps be better prepared 

i pray you my lord to remember that this is a case which will not
admit of three months delay

we can decide the principle a year hence as well as to-day and we
have now sat longer in banco looking at his watch than is either
usual agreeable or expedient

but my lords the proof is at hand here is a witness to establish
that the cauda of noah poke the defendant of record has actually
been separated from his body 

nay nay my brother downright a barrister of your experience must
know that the twelve can only take evidence on affidavit if you had
an affidavit prepared we might possibly find time to hear it
before we adjourn as it is the affair must lie over to another
sitting

i was now in a cold sweat for i could distinctly scent the peculiar
odor of the burning tail the ashes of which being fairly thrown
into noah's face there remained no further obstacle to the process
of decapitation the sentence it will be remembered having kept
his countenance on his shoulders expressly for that object my
brother downright however was not a lawyer to be defeated by so
simple a stumbling-block seizing a paper that was already written
over in a good legal hand which happened to be lying before him he
read it without pause or hesitation in the following manner

regina versus noah poke

kingdom of leaphigh season of nuts personally
this fourth day of the moon appeared before me
meditation lord chief-justice of the court of king's bench john
goldencalf baronet of the kingdom of great britain who being
duly sworn doth depose and say viz that he the said deponent
was present at and did witness the decaudization of the defendant
 in this suit and that the tail of the said noah poke or no 
sea-water-color hath been truly and physically separated from his
 body and further this deponent sayeth not signature etc

having read in the most fluent manner the foregoing affidavit
which existed only in his own brain my brother downright desired
the court to take my deposition to its truth

john goldencalf baronet said the chief-justice you have heard
what has just been read do you swear to its truth

i do

here the affidavit was signed by both my lord chief-justice and
myself and it was duly put on file i afterwards learned that the
paper used by my brother downright on this memorable occasion was no
other than the notes which the chief-justice himself had taken on
one of the arguments in the case in question and that seeing the
names and title of the cause besides finding it no easy matter to
read his own writing that high officer of the crown had very
naturally supposed that all was right as to the rest of the bench
they were in too great a hurry to go to dinner to stop and read
affidavits and the case was instantly disposed of by the following
decision

regina versus noah poke etc ordered that the culprit be
considered non compos mentis and that he be discharged on finding
security to keep the peace for the remainder of his natural life

an officer was instantly dispatched to the great square with this
reprieve and the court rose i delayed a little in order to enter
into the necessary recognizances in behalf of noah taking up at the
same time the bonds given the previous night for his appearance to
answer to the indictments these forms being duly complied with my
brother downright and myself repaired to the place of execution in
order to congratulate our client the former justly elated with his
success which he assured me was not a little to the credit of his
own education

we found noah surprisingly relieved by his liberation from the hands
of the philistines nor was he at all backwards in expressing his
satisfaction at the unexpected turn things had taken according to
his account of the matter he did not set a higher value on his head
than another still it was convenient to have one had it been
necessary to part with it he made no doubt he should have submitted
to do so like a man referring to the fortitude with which he had
borne the amputation of his cauda as a proof of his resolution for
his part he should take very good care how he accused any one with
having a memory or anything else again and he now saw the
excellence of those wise provisions of the laws which cut up a
criminal in order to prevent the repetition of his offences he did
not intend to stay much longer on shore believing he should be less
in the way of temptation on board the walrus than among the
monikins and as for his own people he was sure of soon catching
them on board again for they had now been off their pork twenty-
four hours and nuts were but poor grub for foremast hands after
all philosophers might say what they pleased about governments
but in his opinion the only ra'al tyrant on arth was the belly
he did not remember ever to have had a struggle with his belly and
he had a thousand that the belly didn't get the better that it
would be awkward to lay down the title of lord high admiral but it
was easier to lay down that than to lay down his head that as for
cauda though it was certainly agreeable to be in the fashion he
could do very well without one and when he got back to stunnin'tun
should the worst come to the worst there was a certain saddler in
the place who could give him as good a fit as the one he had lost
that miss poke would have been greatly scandalized however had he
come home after decapitation that it might be well to sail for
leaplow as soon as convenient for in that country he understood
bobs were in fashion and he admitted that he should not like to
cruise about leaphigh for any great length of time unless he could
look as other people look for his part he bore no one a grudge
and he freely forgave everybody but bob out of whom the lord
willing he proposed to have full satisfaction before the ship
should be twenty-four hours at sea etc etc etc

such was the general tendency of the remarks of captain poke as we
proceeded towards the port where he embarked and went on board the
walrus with some eagerness having learned that our rear-admirals
and post-captains had indeed yielded to the calls of nature and
had all gone to their duty swearing they would rather be foremast
jacks in a well-victualled ship than the king of leaphigh upon
nuts

the captain had no sooner entered the boat taking his head with
him than i began to make my acknowledgments to my brother downright
for the able manner in which he had defended my fellow human being
paying at the same time some well-merited compliments to the
ingenious and truly philosophical distinctions of the leaphigh
system of jurisprudence

spare your thanks and your commendations i beg of you good sir
john returned the brigadier as we walked back towards my
lodgings we did as well as circumstances would allow though our
whole defence would have been upset had not the chief-justice very
luckily been unable to read his own handwriting as for the
principles and forms of the monikin law for in these particulars
leaplow is very much like leaphigh as you have seen them displayed
in these two suits why they are such as we have i do not pretend
that they are faultless on the contrary i could point out
improvements myself but we get on with them as well as we can no
doubt among men you have codes that will better bear examination




chapter xxii

a neophyte in diplomacy diplomatic introduction a calculation a
shipment of opinions how to choose an invoice with an assortment


i now began seriously to think of sailing for leaplow for i
confess i was heartily tired of being thought the governor of his
royal highness prince bob and pined to be restored once more to my
proper place in society i was the more incited to make the change
by the representations of the brigadier who assured me that it was
sufficient to come from foreign parts to be esteemed a nobleman in
leaplow and that i need not apprehend in his country any of the
ill-treatment i had received in the one in which i now was after
talking over the matter therefore in a familiar way we determined
to repair at once to the leaplow legation in order to ask for our
passports and to offer at the same time to carry any dispatches
that judge people's friend might have prepared for his government 
it being the custom of the leaplowers to trust to these godsends in
carrying on their diplomatic correspondence

we found the judge in undress and a very different figure he cut
certainly from that which he made when i saw him the previous night
at court then he was all queue now he was all bob he seemed glad
to see us however and quite delighted when i told him of the
intention to sail for leaplow as soon as the wind served he
instantly asked a passage for himself with republican simplicity

there was to be another turn of the great and little wheels he
said and it was quite important to himself to be on the spot for
although everything was beyond all question managed with perfect
republican propriety yet somehow and yet he did not know exactly
how but somehow those who are on the spot always get the best
prizes if i could give him a passage therefore he would esteem it
a great personal favor and i might depend on it the circumstance
would be well received by the party although i did not very well
understand what he meant by this party which was to view the act so
kindly i very cheerfully told the judge that the apartments lately
occupied by my lord chatterino and his friends were perfectly at his
disposal i was then asked when i intended to sail and the answer
was the instant the wind hauled so we could lay out of the harbor
it might be within half an hour hereupon judge people's friend
begged i would have the goodness to wait until he could hunt up a
charge d'affaires his instructions were most peremptory never to
leave the legation without a charge d'affaires but he would just
brush his bob and run into the street and look up one in five
minutes if i would promise to wait so long it would have been
unkind to refuse so trifling a favor and the promise was given the
judge must have run as fast as his legs would carry him for in
about ten minutes he was back again with a diplomatic recruit he
told me his heart had misgiven him sadly the three first to whom he
offered the place had plumply refused it and indeed he did not
know but he should have a quarrel or two on his hands but at last
he had luckily found one who could get nothing else to do and he
pinned him on the spot

so far everything had gone on swimmingly but the new charge had
most unfortunately a very long cauda a fashion that was inexorably
proscribed by the leaplow usages except in cases when the
representative went to court for it seems the leaplow political
ethics like your country buck has two dresses one for every-day
wear and one for sundays the judge intimated to his intended
substitute that it was absolutely indispensable he should submit to
an amputation or he could not possibly confer the appointment
queues being proscribed at home by both public opinions the
horizontal and the perpendicular to this the candidate objected
that he very well knew the leaplow usages on this head but that he
had seen his excellency himself going to court with a singularly
apparent brush and he had supposed from that and from sundry other
little occurrences he did not care to particularize that the
leaplowers were not so bigoted in their notions but they could act
on the principle of doing at rome as is done by the romans to this
the judge replied that this principle was certainly recognized in
all things that were agreeable and that he knew from experience
how hard it was to go in a bob when all around him went in cauda
but that tails were essentially anti-republican and as such had
been formally voted down in leaplow where even the great sachem did
not dare to wear one let him long for it as much as he would and
if it were known that a public charge offended in this particular
although he might be momentarily protected by one of the public
opinions the matter would certainly be taken up by the opposition
public opinion and then the people might order a new turn of the
little wheel which heaven it knew occurred now a great deal
oftener than was either profitable or convenient

hereupon the candidate deliberately undid the fastenings and removed
the queue showing to our admiration that it was false and that
he was after all neither more nor less than a leaplower in
masquerade which by the way i afterwards learned was very apt to
be the case with a great many of that eminently original people
when they got without the limits of their own beloved land judge
people's friend was now perfectly delighted he told us this was
exactly what he could most have wished for here is a bob said
he for the horizontals and perpendiculars and there is a capital
ready-made cauda for his majesty and his majesty's first-cousin a
leaphighized leaplower more especially if there be a dash of
caricature about him is the very thing in our diplomacy finding
matters so much to his mind the judge made out the letter of
appointment on the spot and then proceeded to give his substitute
the usual instructions

you are on all occasions he said to take the utmost care not to
offend the court of leaphigh or the meanest of the courtiers by
advancing any of our peculiar opinions all of which beyond
dispute you have at your finger-ends on this score you are to be
so particular that you may even in your own person pro tempore
abandon republicanism yea sacred republicanism itself knowing
that it can easily be resumed on your return home again you are to
remember there is nothing so undiplomatic or even vulgar as to
have an opinion on any subject unless it should be the opinion of
the persons you may happen to be in company with and as we have
the reputation of possessing that quality in an eminent degree
everywhere but at home take especial heed to eschew vulgarity if
you can you will have the greatest care also to wear the shortest
bob in all your private and the longest tail in all your public
relations this being one of the most important of the celebrated
checks and balances of our government our institutions being
expressly formed by the mass for the particular benefit of all you
will be excessively careful not to let the claims of any one
citizen or even any set of citizens interfere with that harmony
which it is so necessary for the purposes of trade to maintain
with all foreign courts which courts being accustomed themselves to
consider their subjects as cattle to be worked in the traces of the
state are singularly restive whenever they hear of any individual
being made of so much importance should any leaplower become
troublesome on this score give him a bad name at once and in order
to effect that object with your own single-minded and right-loving
countrymen swear that he is a disorganizer and my life on it
both public opinions at home will sustain you for there is nothing
on which our public opinions agree so well as the absolute deference
which they pay to foreign public opinions and this the more
especially in all matters that are likely to affect profits by
deranging commerce you will above all things make it a point to
be in constant relations with some of the readiest paragraph-writers
of the newspapers in order to see that facts are properly stated at
home i would advise you to look out some foreigner who has never
seen leaplow for this employment one that is also paid to write
for the journals of leapup or leapdown or some other foreign
country by which means you will be sure to get an impartial agent
or one who can state things in your own way who is already half
paid for his services and who will not be likely to make blunders
by meddling with distinctive thought when a person of this
character is found let him drop a line now and then in favor of
your own sagacity and patriotism and if he should say a pleasant
thing occasionally about me it will do no harm but may help the
little wheel to turn more readily in order to conceal his origin
let your paragraph-agent use the word our freely the use of this
word as you know being the only qualification of citizenship in
leaplow let him begin to spell the word o-u-r and then proceed to
pronounce it and be careful that he does not spell it h-o-u-r
which might betray his origin above all things you will be
patriotic and republican avoiding the least vindication of your
country and its institutions and satisfying yourself with saying
that the latter are at least well suited to the former if you
should say this in a way to leave the impression on your hearers
that you think the former fitted for nothing else it will be
particularly agreeable and thoroughly republican and most eminently
modest and praiseworthy you will find the diplomatic agents of all
other states sensitive on the point of their peculiar political
usages and prompt to defend them but this is a weakness you will
rigidly abstain from imitating for our polity being exclusively
based on reason you are to show a dignified confidence in the
potency of that fundamental principle nor in any way lessen the
high character that reason already enjoys by giving any one cause
to suspect you think reason is not fully able to take care of
itself with these leading hints and your own natural tendencies
which i am glad to see are eminently fitted for the great objects of
diplomacy being ductile imitative yielding calculating and
above all of a foreign disposition i think you will be able to get
on very cleverly cultivate above all things your foreign
dispositions for you are now on foreign duty and your country
reposes on your shoulders and eminent talents the whole burden of
its foreign interests in this part of the world

here the judge closed his address which was oral apparently well
satisfied with himself and with his raw-hand in diplomacy he then
said 

that he would now go to court to present his substitute and to
take leave himself after which he would return as fast as possible
and detain us no longer than was necessary to put his cauda in
pepper to protect it against the moths for heaven knew what prize
he might draw in the next turn of the little wheel

we promised to meet him at the port where a messenger just then
informed us captain poke had landed and was anxiously waiting our
appearance with this understanding we separated the judge
undertaking to redeem all our promises paid in at the tavern by
giving his own in their stead

the brigadier and myself found noah and the cook bargaining for some
private adventures with a leaphigh broker or two who finding that
the ship was about to sail in ballast were recommending their wares
to the notice of these two worthies

it would be a ra'al sin sir john commenced the captain to
neglect an occasion like this to turn a penny the ship could carry
ten thousand immigrants and they say there are millions of them
going over to leaplow or it might stow half the goods in
aggregation i'm resolved at any rate to use my cabin privilege
and i would advise you as owner to look out for suthin to pay
port-charges with to say the least

the idea is not a bad one friend poke but as we are ignorant of
the state of the market on the other side it might be well to
consult some inhabitant of the country about the choice of articles
here is the brigadier downright whom i have found to be a monikin
of experience and judgment and if you please we will first hear
what he has to say about it

i dabble very little in merchandise returned the brigadier but
as a general principle i should say that no article of leaphigh
manufacture would command so certain a market in leaplow as
opinions

have you any of these opinions for sale i inquired of the broker

plenty of them sir and of all qualities from the very lowest to
the very ighest prices those that may be had for next to nothing
to those that we think a great deal of ourselves we always keeps
them ready packed for exportation and send wast invoices of them
hannually to leaplow in particular opinions are harticles that
help to sell each other and a ship of the tonnage of yours might
stow enough provided they were properly assorted to carry all
before them for the season

expressing a wish to see the packages we were immediately led into
an adjoining warehouse where sure enough there were goodly lots
of the manufactures in question i passed along the shelves reading
the inscriptions of the different packages pointing to several
bundles that had opinions on free trade written on their labels i
asked the brigadier what he thought of that article

why they would have done better a year or two since when we were
settling a new tariff but i should think there would be less demand
for them now

you are quite right sir added the broker we did send large
invoices of them to leaplow formerly and they were all eagerly
bought up the moment they arrived a great many were dyed over
again and sold as of ome manufacture most of these harticles are
now shipped for leapup with whom we have negotiations that give
them a certain value

opinions on democracy and on the policy of governments in
general i should think these would be of no use in leaplow

why sir they goes pretty much hover the whole world we sell
powers on em on hour own continent near by and a great many do go
even to leaplow though what they does with em there i never could
say seeing they are all government monikins in that queer country

an inquiring look extorted a clearer answer from the brigadier 

to admit the fact we have a class among us who buy up these
articles with some eagerness i can only account for it by
supposing they think differing in their tastes from the mass makes
them more enlightened and peculiar

i'll take them all an article that catches these propensities is
sure of sale opinions on events what can possibly be done with
these

that depends a little on their classification returned the
brigadier if they relate to leaplow events while they have a
certain value they cannot be termed of current value but if they
refer to the events of all the rest of the earth take them for
heaven's sake for we trust altogether to this market for our
supplies

on this hint i ordered the whole lot trusting to dispose of the
least fashionable by aid of those that were more in vogue

opinions on domestic literature

you may buy all he has we use no other

opinions on continental literature

why we know little about the goods themselves but i think a
selection might answer

i ordered the bale cut in two and took one half at a venture

opinions of leaplow literature from no up to no 

ah it is proper i should explain put in the broker that we has
two varieties of them ere harticles one is the true harticle as
is got up by our great wits and philosophers they says on the most
approved models but the other is nothing but a sham harticle that
is really manufactured in leaplow and is sent out here to get hour
stamp that's all i never deceives a customer both sell well i
hear on the other side owever

i looked again at the brigadier who quietly nodding assent i took
the whole hundred bales

opinions of the institutions of leaphigh

why them ere is assorted being of all sizes forms and colors
they came coastwise and are chiefly for domestic consumption
though i have known em sent to leaplow with success

the consumers of this article among us observed the brigadier
are very select and rarely take any but of the very best quality
but then they are usually so well stocked that i question if a new
importation would pay freight indeed our consumers cling very
generally to the old fashions in this article not even admitting
the changes produced by time there was an old manufacturer called
whiterock who has a sort of barlow-knife reputation among us and
it is not easy to get another article to compete with his unless
they are very antiquated i would have nothing to do with them

yes this is all true sir we still sends to leaplow quantities of
that ere manufacture and the more hantiquated the harticle the
better it sells but then the new fashions has a most wonderful run
at ome

i'll stick to the real barlow through thick or thin hunt me up a
bale of his notions let them be as old as the flood what have we
here opinions on the institutions of leaplow

take them said the brigadier promptly

this ere gentleman has an hidear of the state of his own market
added the broker giggling wast lots of these things go across
yearly and i don't find that any on em ever comes back

opinions on the state of manners and society in leaplow

i believe i'll take an interest in that article myself sir john
if you can give me a ton or two between decks have you many of this
manufacture

lots on em sir and they do sell so that ere are a good
harticle both at ome and abroad my eye how they does go off in
leaplow

this appears to be also your expectation brigadier by your
readiness to take an interest

to speak the truth nothing sells better in our beloved country

permit me to remark that i find your readiness to purchase this and
the last article a little singular if i have rightly comprehended
our previous conversations you leaplowers profess to have improved
not only on the ancient principles of polity but on the social
condition generally

we will talk of this during the passage homewards sir john
goldencalf but by your leave i will take a share in the
investment in opinions on the state of society and manners in
leaplow especially if they treat at large on the deformities of
the government while they allow us to be genteel this is the true
notch some of these goods have been condemned because the
manufacturers hadn't sufficient skill in dyeing

you shall have a share brigadier harkee mr broker i take it
these said opinions come from some very well-known and approved
manufactory

all sorts sir some good and some good for nothing everything
sells owever i never was in leaplow but we says over ere that
the leaplowers eat and drink and sleep on our opinions lord sir
it would really do your heart good to see the stuff in these
harticles that they does take from us without higgling

i presume brigadier that you use them as an amusement as a means
to pass a pleasant hour of an evening a sort of moral segar

no sir put in the broker they doesn't smoke em my word on't
or they wouldn't buy em in such lots

i now thought enough had been laid in on my own account and i
turned to see what the captain was about he was higgling for a bale
marked opinions on the lost condition of the monikin soul a
little curious to know why he had made this selection i led him
aside and frankly put the question

why to own the truth sir john he said religion is an article
that sells in every market in some shape or other now we are all
in the dark about the leaplow tastes and usages for i always
suspect a native of the country to which i am bound on such a
p'int and if the things shouldn't sell there they'll at least do
at stunnin'tun miss poke alone would use up what there is in that
there bale in a twelvemonth to give the woman her due she's a
desperate consumer of snuff and religion

we had now pretty effectually cleared the shelves and the cook who
had come ashore to dispose of his slush had not yet been able to
get anything

here is a small bale as come from leaplow and a pinched little
thing it is said the broker laughing it don't take at all
here and it might do to go ome again at any rate you will get
the drawback it is filled with distinctive opinions of the
republic of leaplow the cook looked at the brigadier who
appeared to think the speculation doubtful still it was hobson's
choice and after a good deal of grumbling the doctor as noah
always called his cook consented to take the harticle at half
the prime cost

judge people's friend now came trotting down to the port thoroughly
en republican when we immediately embarked and in half an hour
bob was kicked to noah's heart's content and the walrus was fairly
under way for leaplow




chapter xxiii

political boundaries political rights political selections and
political disquisitions with political results


the aquatic mile-stones of the monikin seas have been already
mentioned but i believe i omitted to say that there was a line of
demarcation drawn in the water by means of a similar invention to
point out the limits of the jurisdiction of each state thus all
within these water-marks was under the laws of leaphigh all between
them and those of some other country was the high seas and all
within those of the other country leaplow for instance was under
the exclusive jurisdiction of that other country

with a favorable wind the walrus could run to the watermarks in
about half a day from thence to the water-marks of leaplow was two
days sail and another half day was necessary to reach our haven
as we drew near the legal frontiers of leaphigh several small fast-
sailing schooners were seen hovering just without the jurisdiction
of the king quite evidently waiting our approach one boarded us
just as the outer edge of the spanker-boom got clear of the leaphigh
sovereignty judge people's friend rushed to the side of the ship
and before the crew of the boat could get on deck he had
ascertained that the usual number of prizes had been put into the
little wheel

a monikin in a bob of a most pronounced character or which appeared
to have been subjected to the second amputation being what is
called in leaplow a bob-upon-bob now approached and inquired if
there were any emigrants on board he was made acquainted with our
characters and objects when he understood that our stay would most
likely be short he was evidently a little disappointed

perhaps gentlemen he added you may still remain long enough to
make naturalization desirable

it is always agreeable to be at home in foreign countries but are
there no legal objections

i see none sir you have no tails i believe

none but what are in our trunks i did not know however but the
circumstance of our being of a different species might throw some
obstacles in the way

none in the world sir we act on principles much too liberal for
so narrow an objection you are but little acquainted with the
institutions and policy of our beloved and most happy country i
see sir this is not leaphigh nor leapup nor leapdown nor
leapover nor leapthrough nor leapunder but good old hearty
liberal free and independent most beloved happy and prosperous
beyond example leaplow species is of no account under our system
we would as soon naturalize one animal as another provided it be a
republican animal i see no deficiency about any of you all we ask
is certain general principles you go on two legs 

so do turkeys sir

very true but you have no feathers

neither has a donkey

all very right gentlemen you do not bray however

i will not answer for that put in the captain sending his leg
forwards in a straight line in a way to raise an outcry in bob
that almost upset the leaplower's proposition

at all events gentlemen he observed there is a test that will
put the matter at rest at once

he then desired us in turn to pronounce the word our our
liberties our country our firesides our altars whoever
expressed a wish to be naturalized and could use this word in the
proper manner and in the proper place was entitled to be a
citizen we all did very well but the second mate who being a
herefordshire man could not for the life of him get any nearer to
the doric in the latter shibboleth than our halters now it
would seem that in carrying out a great philanthropic principle in
leaplow halters had been proscribed for whenever a rogue did
anything amiss it had been discovered that instead of punishing
him for the offence the true way to remedy the evil was to punish
the society against which he had offended by this ingenious turn
society was naturally made to look out sharp how it permitted any
one to offend it this excellent idea is like that of certain
dutchmen who when they cut themselves with an ax always apply
salve and lint to the cruel steel and leave the wound to heal as
fast as possible

to return to our examination we all passed but the second mate who
hung in his halter and was pronounced to be incorrigible
certificates of naturalization were delivered on the spot the fees
were paid and the schooner left us

that night it blew a gale and we had no more visitors until the
following morning as the sun rose however we fell in with three
schooners under the leaplow flag all of which seemed bound on
errands of life or death the first that reached us sent a boat on
board and a committee of six bob-upon-bobs hurried up our sides
and lost no time in introducing themselves i shall give their own
account of their business and characters

it would seem that they were what is called a nominating committee
of the horizontals for the city of bivouac the port to which we
were bound where an election was about to take place for members of
the great national council bivouac was entitled to send seven
members and having nominated themselves the committee were now in
quest of a seventh candidate to fill the vacancy in order to secure
the naturalized interests it had been determined to select as new a
comer as possible this would also be maintaining the principle of
liberality in the abstract for this reason they had been cruising
for a week as near as the law would allow to the leaphigh
boundaries and they were now ready to take any one who would serve

to this proposition i again objected the difference of species here
they all fairly laughed in my face brigadier downright included
giving me very distinctly to understand that they thought i had very
contracted notions on matters and things to suppose so trifling an
obstacle could disturb the harmony and unity of a horizontal vote
they went for a principle and the devil himself could not make them
swerve from the pursuit of so sacred an object

i then candidly admitted that nature had not fitted me as admirably
as it had fitted my friend the judge for the throwing of
summersets and i feared that when the order was given to go to the
right about i might be found no better than a bungler this
staggered them a little and i perceived that they looked at each
other in doubt

but you can at least turn round suddenly at need one of them
asked after a pause

certainly sir i answered giving ocular evidence that i was no
idle boaster making a complete gyration on my heels in very good
time

very well admirably well they all cried in a breath the great
political essential is to be able to perform the evolutions in their
essence the facility with which they are performed being no more
than a personal merit

but gentlemen i know little more of your constitution and laws
than i have learned in a few broken discussions with my fellow-
travellers

this is a matter of no moment sir our constitution unlike that
of leaphigh is written down and he who runs can read and then we
have a political fugleman in the house who saves an immense deal of
unnecessary study and reflection to the members all you will have
to do will be to watch his movements and my life on it you will
go as well through the manual exercise as the oldest member there

how sir do all the members take the manoeuvres from this
fugleman

all the horizontals sir the perpendiculars having a fugleman of
their own

well gentlemen i conceive this to be an affair in which i am no
judge and i put myself entirely in the hands of my friends

this answer met with much commendation and manifested as they all
protested great political capabilities the statesman who submitted
all to his friends never failing to rise to eminence in leaplow the
committee took my name in writing and hastened back to their
schooner in order to get into port to promulgate the nomination
these persons were hardly off the deck before another party came up
the opposite side of the ship they announced themselves to be a
nominating committee of the perpendiculars on exactly the same
errand as their opponents they too wished to propitiate the
foreign interests and were in search of a proper candidate captain
poke had been an attentive listener to all that occurred during the
circumstances that preceded my nomination and he now stepped
promptly forward and declared his readiness to serve as there was
quite as little squeamishness on one side as on the other and the
perpendicular committee as it owned itself was greatly pressed for
time the horizontals having the start of them the affair was
arranged in five minutes and the strangers departed with the name
of noah poke the tried patriot the profound jurist and the honest
monikin handsomely placarded on a large board all but the name
having been carefully prepared in advance

when the committee were fairly out of the ship noah look me aside
and made his apologies for opposing me in this important election
his reasons were numerous and ingenious and as usual a little
discursive they might be summed up as follows he never had sat in
a parliament and he was curious to know how it would feel it would
increase the respect of the ship's company to find their commander
of so much account in a strange port he had had some experience at
stunnin'tun by reading the newspapers and he didn't doubt of his
abilities at all a circumstance that rarely failed of making a good
legislator the congressman in his part of the country was some such
man as himself and what was good for the goose was good for the
gander he knew miss poke would be pleased to hear he had been
chosen he wondered if he should be called the honorable noah poke
and whether he should receive eight dollars a day and mileage from
the spot where the ship then was the perpendiculars might count on
him for his word was as good as his bond as for the constitution
he had got on under the constitution at home and he believed a man
who could do that might get on under any constitution he didn't
intend to say a great deal in parliament but what he did say he
hoped might be recorded for the use of his children together with a
great deal more of the same sort of argumentation and apology

the third schooner now brought us to this vessel sent another
committee who announced themselves to be the representatives of a
party that was termed the tangents they were not numerous but
sufficiently so to hold the balance whenever the horizontals and the
perpendiculars crossed each other directly at right angles as was
the case at present and they had now determined to run a single
candidate of their own they too wished to fortify themselves by
the foreign interest as was natural and had come out in quest of a
proper person i suggested the first mate but against this noah
protested declaring that come what would the ship must on no
account be deserted time pressed and while the captain and the
subordinate were hotly disputing the propriety of permitting the
latter to serve bob who had already tasted the sweets of political
importance in his assumed character of prince-royal stepped slyly
up to the committee and gave in his name noah was too much
occupied to discover this well-managed movement and by the time he
had sworn to throw the mate overboard if he did not instantly
relinquish all ambitious projects of this nature he found that the
tangents were off supposing they had gone to some other vessel the
captain allowed himself to be soothed and all went on smoothly
again

from this time until we anchored in the bay of bivouac the
tranquillity and discipline of the walrus were undisturbed i
improved the occasion to study the constitution of leaplow of which
the judge had a copy and to glean such information from my
companions as i believed might be useful in my future career i
thought how pleasant it would be for a foreigner to teach the
leaplowers their own laws and to explain to them the application of
their own principles little however was to be got from the judge
who was just then too much occupied with some calculations
concerning the chances of the little wheel with which he had been
furnished by a leading man of one of the nominating committees

i now questioned the brigadier touching that peculiar usage of his
country which rendered leaphigh opinions concerning the leaplow
institutions society and manners of so much value in the market of
the latter to this i got but an indifferent answer except it was
to say that his countrymen having cleared the interests connected
with the subjects from the rubbish of time and set everything at
work on the philosophical basis of reason and common sense were
exceedingly desirous of knowing what other people thought of the
success of the experiment

i expect to see a nation of sages i can assure you brigadier one
in which even the very children are profoundly instructed in the
great truths of your system and as to the monikinas i am not
without dread of bringing my theoretical ignorance in collision with
their great practical knowledge of the principles of your
government

they are early fed on political pap

no doubt sir no doubt how different must they be from the
females of other countries deeply imbued with the great distinctive
principles of your system devoted to the education of their
children in the same sublime truths and indefatigable in their
discrimination among the meanest of their households

hum

now sir even in england a country which i trust is not the most
debased on earth you will find women beautiful intellectual
accomplished and patriotic who limit their knowledge of these
fundamental points to a zeal for a clique and the whole of whose
eloquence on great national questions is bounded by a few heartfelt
wishes for the downfall of their opponents 

it is very much so at stunnin'tun too if truth must be spoken
remarked noah who had been a listener

who instead of instructing the young suckers that cling to their
sides in just notions of general social distinctions nurture their
young antipathies with pettish philippics against some luckless
chief of the adverse party 

tis pretty much the same at stunnin'tun as i live

who rarely study the great lessons of history in order to point out
to the future statesmen and heroes of the empire the beacons of
crime the incentives for public virtue or the charters of their
liberties but who are indefatigable in echoing the cry of the hour
however false or vulgar and who humanize their attentive offspring
by softly expressed wishes that mr canning or some other
frustrator of the designs of their friends were fairly hanged

stunnin'tun all over

beings that are angels in form soft gentle refined and tearful
as the evening with its dews when there is a question of humanity
or suffering but who seem strangely transformed into she-tigers
whenever any but those of whom they can approve attain to power and
who instead of entwining their soft arms around their husbands and
brothers to restrain them from the hot strife of opinions cheer
them on by their encouragement and throw dirt with the volubility
and wit of fish-women

miss poke to the backbone

in short sir i expect to see an entirely different state of
things at leaplow there when a political adversary is bespattered
with mud your gentle monikinas doubtless appease anger by mild
soothings of philosophy tempering zeal by wisdom and regulating
error by apt and unanswerable quotations from that great charter
which is based on the eternal and immutable principles of right

well sir john if you speak in this elocutionary manner in the
house cried the delighted noah i shall be shy of answering i
doubt now if the brigadier himself could repeat all you have just
said

i have forgotten to inquire mr downright a little about your
leaplow constituency the suffrage is beyond question confined to
those members of society who possess a social stake

certainly sir john they who live and breathe

surely none vote but those who possess the money and houses and
lands of the country

sir you are altogether in error all vote who possess ears and
eyes and noses and bobs and lives and hopes and wishes and
feelings and wants wants we conceive to be a much truer test of
political fidelity than possessions

this is novel doctrine indeed but it is in direct hostility to
the social-stake system

you were never more right sir john as respects your own theory
or never more wrong as respects the truth in leaplow we contend 
and contend justly that there is no broader or bolder fallacy than
to say that a representation of mere effects whether in houses
lands merchandise or money is a security for a good government
property is affected by measures and the more a monikin has the
greater is the bribe to induce him to consult his own interests
although it should be at the expense of those of everybody else

but sir the interest of the community is composed of the
aggregate of these interests

your pardon sir john nothing is composed of it but the aggregate
of the interests of a class if your government is instituted for
their benefit only your social-stake system is all well enough but
if the object be the general good you have no choice but to trust
its custody to the general keeping let us suppose two men since
you happen to be a man and not a monikin let us suppose two men
perfectly equal in morals intelligence public virtue and
patriotism one of whom shall be rich and the other shall have
nothing a crisis arrives in the affairs of their common country
and both are called upon to exercise their franchise on a question-
-as almost all great questions must that unavoidably will have some
influence on property generally which would give the most impartial
vote he who of necessity must be swayed by his personal interest
or he who has no inducement of the sort to go astray

certainly he who has nothing to influence him to go wrong but the
question is not fairly put 

your pardon sir john it is put fairly as an abstract question
and one that is to prove a principle i am glad to hear you say that
a man would be apt to decide in this manner for it shows his
identity with a monikin we hold that all of us are apt to think
most of ourselves on such occasions

my dear brigadier do not mistake sophistry for reason surely if
power belonged only to the poor and the poor or the comparatively
poor always compose the mass they would exercise it in a way to
strip the rich of their possessions

we think not in leaplow cases might exist in which such a state
of things would occur under a reaction but reactions imply abuses
and are not to be quoted to maintain a principle he who was drunk
yesterday may need an unnatural stimulus to-day while he who is
uniformly temperate preserves his proper tone of body without
recourse to a remedy so dangerous such an experiment under a
strong provocation might possibly be made but it could scarcely be
made twice among any people and not even once among a people that
submits in season to a just division of its authority since it is
obviously destructive of a leading principle of civilization
according to our monikin histories all the attacks upon property
have been produced by property's grasping at more than fairly
belongs to its immunities if you make political power a concomitant
of property both may go together certainly but if kept separate
the danger to the latter will never exceed the danger in which it is
put daily by the arts of the money-getters who are in truth the
greatest foes of property as it belongs to others

i remembered sir joseph job and could not but admit that the
brigadier had at least some truth on his side

but do you deny that the sentiment of property elevates the mind
ennobles and purifies

sir i do not pretend to determine what may be the fact among men
but we hold among monikins that the love of money is the root of
all evil

how sir do you account the education which is a consequence of
property as nothing

if you mean my dear sir john that which property is most apt to
teach we hold it to be selfishness but if you mean that he who has
money as a rule will also have in formation to guide him aright i
must answer that experience which is worth a thousand theories
tells us differently we find that on questions which are purely
between those who have and those who have not the haves are
commonly united and we think this would be the fact if they were as
unschooled as bears but on all other questions they certainly do
great discredit to education unless you admit that there are in
every case two rights for with us the most highly educated
generally take the two extremes of every argument i state this to
be the fact with monikins you will remember doubtless educated
men agree much better

but my good brigadier if your position about the greater
impartiality and independence of the elector who is not influenced
by his private interests be true a country would do well to submit
its elections to a body of foreign umpires

it would indeed sir john if it were certain these foreign umpires
would not abuse the power to their own particular advantage if they
could have the feelings and sentiments which ennoble and purify a
nation far more than money and if it were possible they could
thoroughly understand the character habits wants and resources of
another people as things are therefore we believe it is wisest to
trust our own elections to ourselves not to a portion of ourselves
but to all of ourselves

immigrants included put in the captain

why we do carry the principle well out in the case of gentlemen
like yourselves returned the brigadier politely but liberality
is a virtue as a principle sir john your idea of referring the
choice of our representatives to strangers has more merit than you
probably imagine though certainly impracticable for the reasons
already given when we seek justice we commonly look out for some
impartial judge such a judge is unattainable however in the
matter of the interests of a state for the simple reason that power
of this sort permanently wielded would be perverted on a principle
which after a most scrupulous analysis we have been compelled to
admit is incorporated with the very monikin nature viz
selfishness i make no manner of doubt that you men however are
altogether superior to an influence so unworthy

here i could only borrow the use of the brigadier's hum

having ascertained that it would not do to submit the control of
our affairs to utter strangers or to those whose interests are not
identified with our own we set about seeing what could be done with
a selection from among ourselves here we were again met by that
same obstinate principle of selfishness and we were finally driven
to take shelter in the experiment of intrusting the interests of all
to the management of all

and sir are these the opinions of leaphigh

very far from it the difference between leaphigh and leaplow is
just this the leaphighers being an ancient people with a thousand
vested interests are induced as time improves the mind to seek
reasons for their facts while we leaplowers being unshackled by
any such restraints have been able to make an effort to form our
facts on our reasons

why do you then so much prize leaphigh opinions on leaplow
facts

why does every little monikin believe his own father and mother to
be just the two wisest best most virtuous and discreetest old
monikins in the whole world until time opportunity and experience
show him his error

do you make no exceptions then in your franchise but admit every
citizen who as you say has a nose ears bob and wants to the
exercise of the suffrage

perhaps we are less scrupulous on this head than we ought to be
since we do not make ignorance and want of character bars to the
privilege qualifications beyond mere birth and existence may be
useful but they are badly chosen when they are brought to the test
of purely material possessions this practice has arisen in the
world from the fact that they who had property had power and not
because they ought to have it

my dear brigadier this is flying in the face of all experience

for the reason just given and because all experience has hitherto
commenced at the wrong end society should be constructed as you
erect a house not from the roof down but from the foundation
upwards

admitting however that your house has been badly constructed at
first in repairing it would you tear away the walls at random at
the risk of bringing all down about your ears

i would first see that sufficient props were reared and then
proceed with vigor though always with caution courage in such an
experiment is less to be dreaded than timidity half the evils of
life social personal and political are as much the effects of
moral cowardice as of fraud

i then told the brigadier that as his countrymen rejected the
inducements of property in the selection of the political base of
their social compact i expected to find a capital substitute in
virtue

i have always heard that virtue is the great essential of a free
people and doubtless you leaplowers are perfect models in this
important particular

the brigadier smiled before he answered me first looking about to
the right and left as if to regale himself with the odor of
perfection

many theories have been broached on these subjects he replied
in which there has been some confusion between cause and effect
virtue is no more a cause of freedom except as it is connected with
intelligence than vice is a cause of slavery both may be
consequences but it is not easy to say how either is necessarily a
cause there is a homely saying among us monikins which is quite to
the point in this matter set a rogue to catch a rogue now the
essence of a free government is to be found in the responsibility of
its agents he who governs without responsibility is a master while
he who discharges the duties of a functionary under a practical
responsibility is a servant this is the only true test of
governments let them be mystified as they may in other respects
responsibility to the mass of the nation is the criterion of
freedom now responsibility is the substitute for virtue in a
politician as discipline is the substitute for courage in a
soldier an army of brave monikins without discipline would be very
apt to be worsted by an army of monikins of less natural spirit
with discipline so a corps of originally virtuous politicians
without responsibility would be very apt to do more selfish
lawless and profligate acts than a corps of less virtue who were
kept rigidly under the rod of responsibility unrestrained power is
a great corrupter of virtue of itself while the liabilities of a
restrained authority are very apt to keep it in check at least
such is the fact with us monikins men very possibly get along
better

let me tell you mr downright you are now uttering opinions that
are diametrically opposed to those of the world which considers
virtue an indispensable ingredient in a republic

the world meaning always the monikin world knows very little
about real political liberty except as a theory we of leaplow are
in effect the only people who have had much to do with it and i am
now telling you what is the result of my own observation in my own
country if monikins were purely virtuous there would be no
necessity for government at all but being what they are we think
it wisest to set them to watch each other

but yours is self-government which implies self-restraint and
self-restraint is but another word for virtue

if the merit of our system depended on self-government in your
signification or on self-restraint in any signification it would
not be worth the trouble of this argument sir john goldencalf this
is one of those balmy fallacies with which ill-judging moralists
endeavor to stimulate monikins to good deeds our government is
based on a directly opposite principle that of watching and
restraining each other instead of trusting to our ability to
restrain ourselves it is the want of responsibility and not of
constant and active presence which infers virtue and self-control
no one would willingly lay legal restraints on himself in anything
while all are very happy to restrain their neighbors this refers to
the positive and necessary rules of intercourse and the
establishment of rights as to mere morality laws do very little
towards enforcing its ordinances morals usually come of
instruction and when all have political power instruction is a
security that all desire

but when all vote all may wish to abuse their trust to their own
especial advantage and a political chaos will be the consequence

such a result is impossible except as especial advantage is
identified with general advantage a community can no more buy
itself in this manner than a monikin can eat himself let him be as
ravenous as he will admitting that all are rogues necessity would
compel a compromise

you make out a plausible theory and i have little doubt that i
shall find you the wisest the most logical the discreetest and
the most consistent community i have yet visited but another word
how is it that our friend the judge gave such equivocal instructions
to his charge and why in particular did he lay so much stress on
the employment of means which gave the lie flatly to all you have
told me

brigadier downright hereupon stroked his chin and observed that he
thought there might possibly be a shift of wind and he also
wondered quite audibly when we should make the land i afterwards
persuaded him to allow that a monikin was but a monikin after all
whether he had the advantages of universal suffrage or lived under
a despot




chapter xxiv

an arrival an election architecture a rolling-pin and patriotism
of the most approved water


in due time the coast of leaplow made its appearance close under
our larboard bow so sudden was our arrival in this novel and
extraordinary country that we were very near running on it before
we got a glimpse of its shores the seamanship of captain poke
however stood us in hand and by the aid of a very clever pilot
we were soon safely moored in the harbor of bivouac in this happy
land there was no registration no passports no nothin as mr
poke pointedly expressed it the formalities were soon observed
although i had occasion to remark how much easier after all it is
to get along in this world with vice than with virtue a bribe
offered to a custom-house officer was refused and the only trouble
i had on the occasion arose from this awkward obtrusion of a
conscience however the difficulty was overcome though not quite
as easily as if douceurs had happened to be in fashion and we were
permitted to land with all our necessary effects

the city of bivouac presented a singular aspect as i first put foot
within its hallowed streets the houses were all covered with large
placards which at first i took to be lists of the wares to be
vended for the place is notoriously commercial but which on
examination i soon discovered were merely electioneering handbills
the reader will figure to himself my pleasure and surprise on
reading the first that offered it ran as follows

horizontal nomination

horizontal-systematic-indoctrinated-republicans attention

your sacred rights are in danger your dearest liberties are
menaced your wives and children are on the point of dissolution
the infamous and unconstitutional position that the sun gives light
by day and the moon by night is openly and impudently propagated
and now is the only occasion that will probably ever offer to arrest
an error so pregnant with deception and domestic evils we present
to your notice a suitable defender of all those near and dear
interests in the person of

john goldencalf

the known patriot the approved legislator the profound
philosopher the incorruptible statesman to our adopted fellow-
citizens we need not recommend mr goldencalf for he is truly one
of themselves to the native citizens we will only say try him
and you will be more than satisfied

i found this placard of great use for it gave me the first
information i had yet had of the duty i was expected to perform in
the coming session of the great council which was merely to
demonstrate that the moon gave light by day and that the sun gave
light by night of course i immediately set about in my own mind
hunting up the proper arguments by which this grave political
hypothesis was to be properly maintained the next placard was in
favor

noah poke

the experienced navigator who will conduct the ship of state into
the haven of prosperity the practical astronomer who knows by
frequent observations that lunars are not to be got in the dark

perpendiculars be plumb and lay your enemies on their backs

after this i fell in with 

the honorable robert smut

is confidently recommended to all their fellow-citizens by the
nominating committee of the anti-approved-sublimated-politico-
tangents as the real gentleman a ripe scholar footnote i
afterwards found this was a common phrase in leaplow being
uniformly applied to every monikin who wore spectacles an
enlightened politician and a sound democrat

but i should fill the manuscript with nothing else were i to record
a tithe of the commendations and abuse that were heaped on us all
by a community to whom as yet we were absolutely strangers a
single sample of the latter will suffice

affidavit

personally appeared before me john equity justice of the peace
peter veracious etc etc who being duly sworn upon the holy
evangelists doth depose and say viz that he was intimately
acquainted with one john goldencalf in his native country and that
he is personally knowing to the fact that he the said john
goldencalf has three wives seven illegitimate children is
moreover a bankrupt without character and that he was obliged to
emigrate in consequence of having stolen a sheep

sworn etc

signed peter veracious

i naturally felt a little indignant at this impudent statement and
was about to call upon the first passer-by for the address of mr
veracious when the skirts of my skin were seized by one of the
horizontal nominating committee and i was covered with
congratulations on my being happily elected success is an admirable
plaster for all wounds and i really forgot to have the affair of
the sheep and of the illegitimate children inquired into although i
still protest that had fortune been less propitious the rascal who
promulgated this calumny would have been made to smart for his
temerity in less than five minutes it was the turn of captain poke
he too was congratulated in due form for as it appeared the
immigrant interest as noah termed it had actually carried a
candidate on each of the two great opposing tickets thus far all
was well for after sharing his mess so long i had not the
smallest objection to sit in the leaplow parliament with the worthy
sealer but our mutual surprise and i believe i might add
indignation were a good deal excited by shortly encountering a
walking notice which contained a programme of the proceedings to be
observed at the reception of the honorable robert smut

it would seem that the horizontals and the perpendiculars had made
so many spurious and mystified ballots in order to propitiate the
tangents and to cheat each other that this young blackguard
actually stood at the head of the poll a political phenomenon as
i subsequently discovered however by no means of rare occurrence
in the leaplow history of the periodical selection of the wisest and
best

there was certainly an accumulation of interest on arriving in a
strange land to find one's self both extolled and vituperated on
most of the corners in its capital and to be elected to its
parliament all in the same day still i did not permit myself to
be either so much elated or so much depressed as not to have all my
eyes about me in order to get as correctly as possible and as
quickly as possible some insight into the characters tastes
habits wishes and wants of my constituents

i have already declared that it is my intention to dwell chiefly on
the moral excellences and peculiarities of the people of the monikin
world still i could not walk through the streets of bivouac without
observing a few physical usages that i shall mention because they
have an evident connection with the state of society and the
historical recollections of this interesting portion of the polar
region

in the first place i remarked that all sorts of quadrupeds are just
as much at home in the promenades of the town as the inhabitants
themselves a fact that i make no doubt has some very proper
connection with that principle of equal rights on which the
institutions of the country are established in the second place i
could not but see that their dwellings are constructed on the very
minimum of base propping each other as emblematic of the mutual
support obtained by the republican system and seeking their
development in height for the want of breadth a singularity of
customs that i did not hesitate at once to refer to a usage of
living in trees at an epoch not very remote in the third place i
noted instead of entering their dwellings near the ground like men
and indeed like most other unfledged animals that they ascend by
means of external steps to an aperture about half-way between the
roof and the earth where having obtained admission they go up or
down within the building as occasion requires this usage i made
no question was preserved from the period and that too no
distant one when the savage condition of the country induced them
to seek protection against the ravages of wild beasts by having
recourse to ladders which were drawn up after the family into the
top of the tree as the sun sank beneath the horizon these steps or
ladders are generally of some white material in order that they
may even now be found in the dark should the danger be urgent
although i do not know that bivouac is a more disorderly or unsafe
town than another in the present day but habits linger in the
usages of a people and are often found to exist as fashions long
after the motive of their origin has ceased and been forgotten as a
proof of this many of the dwellings of bivouac have still enormous
iron chevaux-de-frise before the doors and near the base of the
stone-ladders a practice unquestionably taken from the original
unsophisticated domestic defences of this wary and enterprising
race among a great many of these chevaux-de-frise i remarked
certain iron images that resemble the kings of chess-men and which
i took at first to be symbols of the calculating qualities of the
owners of the mansions a species of republican heraldry but which
the brigadier told me on inquiry were no more than a fashion that
had descended from the custom of having stuffed images before the
doors in the early days of the settlement to frighten away the
beasts at night precisely as we station scarecrows in a corn-field
two of these well-padded sentinels with a stick stuck up in a fire-
lock attitude he assured me had often been known to maintain a
siege of a week against a she-bear and a numerous family of hungry
cubs in the olden times and now that the danger was gone he
presumed the families which had caused these iron monuments to be
erected had done so to record some marvellous risks of this nature
from which their forefathers had escaped by means of so ingenious an
expedient

everything in bivouac bears the impress of the sublime principle of
the institutions the houses of the private citizens for instance
overtop the roofs of all the public edifices to show that the
public is merely a servant of the citizen even the churches have
this peculiarity proving that the road to heaven is not independent
of the popular will the great hall of justice an edifice of which
the bivouackers are exceedingly proud is constructed in the same
recumbent style the architect with a view to protect himself from
the imputation of believing that the firmament was within reach of
his hand having taken the precaution to run up a wooden finger-
board from the centre of the building which points to the place
where according to the notions of all other people the ridge of
the roof itself should have been raised so very apparent was this
peculiarity noah observed that it seemed to him as if the whole
arth had been rolled down by a great political rolling-pin by
way of giving the country its finishing touch

while making these remarks one drew near at a brisk trot who mr
downright observed eagerly desired our acquaintance surprised at
his pretending to know such a fact without any previous
communication i took the liberty of asking why he thought that we
were the particular objects of the other's haste

simply because you are fresh arrivals this person is one of a
sufficiently numerous class among us who devoured by a small
ambition seek notoriety which by the way they are near obtaining
in more respects than they probably desire by obtruding themselves
on every stranger who touches our shore theirs is not a generous
and frank hospitality that would fain serve others but an irritable
vanity that would glorify themselves the liberal and enlightened
monikin is easily to be distinguished from all of this clique he is
neither ashamed of nor bigoted in favor of any usages simply
because they are domestic with him the criterions of merit are
propriety taste expediency and fitness he distinguishes while
these crave he neither wholly rejects nor wholly lives by
imitation but judges for himself and uses his experience as a
respectable and useful guide while these think that all they can
attain that is beyond the reach of their neighbors is as a matter
of course the sole aim of life strangers they seek because they
have long since decreed that this country with its usages its
people and all it contains being founded on popular rights is all
that is debased and vulgar themselves and a few of their own
particular friends excepted and they are never so happy as when
they are gloating on and basking in the secondary refinements of
what we call the old region their own attainments however being
pretty much godsends or such as we all pick up in our daily
intercourse they know nothing of any foreign country but leaphigh
whose language we happen to speak and as leaphigh is also the very
beau ideal of exclusion in its usages opinions and laws they
deem all who come from that part of the earth as rather more
entitled to their profound homage than any other strangers

here judge people's friend who had been vigorously pumping the
nominating committee on the subject of the chances of the little
wheel suddenly left us with a sneaking self-abased air and with
his nose to the ground like a dog who has just caught a fresh
scent

the next time we met with the ex-envoy he was in mourning for some
political backsliding that i never comprehended he had submitted to
a fresh amputation of the bob and had so thoroughly humbled the
seat of reason that it was not possible for the most envious and
malignant disposition to fancy he had a particle of brains left he
had moreover caused every hair to be shaved off his body which
was as naked as the hand and altogether he presented an edifying
picture of penitence and self-abasement i afterwards understood
that this purification was considered perfectly satisfactory and
that he was thought to be again within the limits of the most
patriotic patriots

in the meantime the bivouacker had approached me and was introduced
as mr gilded wriggle

count poke de stunnin'tun my good sir said the brigadier who
was the master of ceremonies on this occasion and the mogul
goldencalf both noblemen of ancient lineage admirable privileges
and of the purest water gentlemen who when they are at home have
six dinners daily always sleep on diamonds and whose castles are
none of them less than six leagues in extent

my friend general downright has taken too much pains gentlemen
interrupted our new acquaintance your rank and extraction being
self-evident welcome to leaplow i beg you will make free with my
house my dog my cat my horse and myself i particularly beg that
your first your last and all the intermediate visits will be to
me well mogul what do you really think of us you have now been
on shore long enough to have formed a pretty accurate notion of our
institutions and habits i beg you will not judge of all of us by
what you see in the streets 

it is not my intention sir

you are cautious i perceive we are in an awful condition i
confess trampled on by the vulgar and far very far from being the
people that i dare say you expected to see i couldn't be made the
assistant alderman of my ward if i wished it sir too much
jacobism the people are fools sir know nothing sir not fit to
rule themselves much less their betters sir here have a set of
us some hundreds in this very town been telling them what fools
they are how unfit they are to manage their own affairs and how
fast they are going to the devil any time these twenty years and
still we have not yet persuaded them to entrust one of us with
authority to say the truth we are in a most miserable condition
and if anything could ruin this country democracy would have
ruined it just thirty-five years ago

here the wailings of mr wriggle were interrupted by the wailings of
count poke de stunnin'tun the latter by gazing in admiration at
the speaker had inadvertently struck his toe against one of the
forty-three thousand seven hundred and sixty inequalities of the
pavement for everything in leaplow is exactly equal except the
streets and highways and fallen forwards on his nose i have
already had occasion to allude to the sealer's readiness in using
opprobrious epithets this contre-temps happened in the principal
street of bivouac or in what is called the wide-path an avenue of
more than a league in extent but notwithstanding its great length
noah took it up at one end and abused it all the way to the other
with a precision fidelity rapidity and point that excited general
admiration it was the dirtiest worst paved meanest vilest
street he had ever seen and if they had it at stunnin'tun instead
of using it as a street at all they would fence it up at each end
and turn it into a hog-lot here brigadier downright betrayed
unequivocal signs of alarm drawing us aside he vehemently demanded
of the captain if he were mad to berate in this unheard-of manner
the touchstone of bivouac sentiment nationality taste and
elegance this street was never spoken of except by the use of
superlatives a usage by the way that noah himself had by no means
neglected it was commonly thought to be the longest and the
shortest the widest and the narrowest the best built and the worst
built avenue in the universe whatever you say or do he
continued whatever you think or believe never deny the
superlatives of the wide-path if asked if you ever saw a street so
crowded although there be room to wheel a regiment swear it is
stifling if required to name another promenade so free from
interruption protest by your soul that the place is a desert say
what you will of the institutions of the country 

how i exclaimed of the sacred rights of monikins

bedaub them and the mass of the monikins too with just as much
filth as you please indeed if you wish to circulate freely in
genteel society i would advise you to get a pretty free use of the
words jacobins rabble mob agrarians canaille and
democrats for they recommend many to notice who possess nothing
else in our happy and independent country it is a sure sign of
lofty sentiment a finished education a regulated intellect and a
genteel intercourse to know how to bespatter all that portion of
your fellow-creatures for instance who live in one-story
edifices

i find all this very extraordinary your government being
professedly a government of the mass

you have intuitively discovered the reason is it not fashionable
to abuse the government everywhere whatever you do in genteel
life ought to be based on liberal and elevated principles and
therefore abuse all that is animate in leaplow the present
company with their relatives and quadrupeds excepted but do not
raise your blaspheming tongue against anything that is inanimate
respect i entreat of you the houses the trees the rivers the
mountains and above all in bivouac respect the wide-path we are
a people of lively sensibilities and are tender of the reputations
of even our stocks and stones even the leaplow philosophers are all
of a mind on this subject

king

can you account for this very extraordinary peculiarity
brigadier

surely you cannot be ignorant that all which is property is sacred
we have a great respect for property sir and do not like to hear
our wares underrated but lay it on the mass so much the harder and
you will only be thought to be in possession of a superior and a
refined intelligence

here we turned again to mr wriggle who was dying to be noticed
once more

ah gentlemen last from leaphigh he had been questioning one of
our attendants how comes on that great and consistent people

as usual sir great and consistent

i think however we are quite their equals eh chips of the same
blocks

no sir blocks of the same chips

mr wriggle laughed and appeared pleased with the compliment and i
wished i had even laid it on a little thicker

well mogul what are our great forefathers about still pulling to
pieces that sublime fabric of a constitution which has so long been
the wonder of the world and my especial admiration

they are talking of changes sir although i believe they have
effected no great matter the primate of all leaphigh i had
occasion to remark still has seven joints to his tail

ah they are a wonderful people sir said wriggle looking
ruefully at his own bob which as i afterwards understood was a
mere natural abortion i detest change sir were i a leaphigher i
would die in my tail

one for whom nature has done so much in this way is to be excused
a little enthusiasm

a most miraculous people sir the wonder of the world and their
institutions are the greatest prodigy of the times

that is well remarked wriggle put in the brigadier for they
have been tinkering them and altering them any time these five
hundred and fifty years and still they remain precisely the same

very true brigadier very true the marvel of our times but
gentlemen what do you indeed think of us i shall not let you off
with generalities you have now been long enough on shore to have
formed some pretty distinct notions about us and i confess i should
be glad to hear them speak the truth with candor are we not most
miserable forlorn disreputable devils after all

i disclaimed the ability to judge of the social condition of a
people on so short an acquaintance but to this mr wriggle would
not listen he insisted that i must have been particularly disgusted
with the coarseness and want of refinement in the rabble as he
called the mass who by the way had already struck me as being
relatively much the better part of the population so far as i had
seen things more than commonly decent quiet and civil mr
wriggle also very earnestly and piteously begged i would not judge
of the whole country by such samples as i might happen to fall in
with in the highways

i trust mogul you will have charity to believe we are not all of
us quite so bad as appearances no doubt make us in your polished
eyes these rude beings are spoiled by our jacobinical laws but we
have a class sir that is different but if you will not touch on
the people how do you like the town sir a poor place no doubt
after your own ancient capitals

time will remedy all that mr wriggle

do you then think we really want time now that house at the
corner there to my taste is fit for a gentleman in any country 
eh

no doubt sir fit for one

this is but a poor street in the eyes of you travellers i know
this wide-path of ours though we think it rather sublime

you do yourself injustice mr wriggle though not equal to many of
the -

how sir the wide-path not equal to anything on earth i know
several people who have been in the old world so the leaplowers
call the regions of leaphigh leapup leapdown etc and they swear
there is not as fine a street in any part of it i have not had the
good fortune to travel sir but sir permit me sir to say sir
that some of them sir that have travelled sir think sir the
wide-path the most magnificent public avenue sir that their
experienced eyes ever beheld sir yes sir that their very
experienced eyes ever beheld sir

i have seen so little of it as yet mr wriggle that you will
pardon me if i have spoken hastily

oh no offence i despise the monikin who is not above local
vanities and provincial admiration you ought to have seen that
sir for i frankly admit sir that no rabble can be worse than
ours and that we are all going to the devil as fast as ever we
can no sir a most miserable rabble sir but as for this street
and our houses and our cats and our dogs and certain exceptions 
you understand me sir it is quite a different thing pray mogul
who is the greatest personage now in your nation

perhaps i ought to say the duke of wellington sir

well sir allow me to ask if he lives in a better house than that
before us i see you are delighted eh we are a poor new nation
of pitiful traders sir half savage as everybody knows but we do
flatter ourselves that we know how to build a house will you just
step in and see a new sofa that its owner bought only yesterday i
know him intimately and nothing gives me so much pleasure as to
show his new sofa

i declined the invitation on the plea of fatigue and by this means
got rid of so troublesome an acquaintance on leaving me however
he begged that i would not fail to make his house my home swore
terribly at the rabble and invited me to admire a very ordinary
view that was to be obtained by looking up the wide-path in a
particular direction but which embraced his own abode when mr
wriggle was fairly out of earshot i demanded of the brigadier if
bivouac or leaplow contained many such prodigies

enough to make themselves very troublesome and us ridiculous
returned mr downright we are a young nation sir john covering a
great surface with a comparatively small population and as you
are aware separated from the other parts of the monikin region by a
belt of ocean in some respects we are like people in the country
and we possess the merits and failings of those who are so situated
perhaps no nation has a larger share of reflecting and essentially
respectable inhabitants than leaplow but not satisfied with being
what circumstances so admirably fit them to be there is a clique
among us who influenced by the greater authority of older nations
pine to be that which neither nature education manners nor
facilities will just yet allow them to become in short sir we
have the besetting sin of a young community imitation in our case
the imitation is not always happy either it being necessarily an
imitation that is founded on descriptions if the evil were limited
to mere social absurdities it might be laughed at but that
inherent desire of distinction which is the most morbid and
irritable unhappily in the minds of those who are the least able
to attain anything more than a very vulgar notoriety is just as
active here as it is elsewhere and some who have got wealth and
who can never get more than what is purely dependent on wealth
affect to despise those who are not as fortunate as themselves in
this particular in their longings for pre-eminence they turn to
other states leaphigh more especially which is the beau ideal of
all nations and people who wish to set up a caste in opposition to
despotism for rules of thought and declaim against that very mass
which is at the bottom of all their prosperity by obstinately
refusing to allow of any essential innovation on the common rights
in addition to these social pretenders we have our political
indoctrinated

indoctrinated will you explain the meaning of the term

sir an indoctrinated is one of a political school who holds to the
validity of certain theories which have been made to justify a set
of adventitious facts as is eminently the case in our own great
model leaphigh we are peculiarly placed in this country here as
a rule facts meaning political and social facts are greatly in
advance of opinion simply because the former are left chiefly to
their own free action and the latter is necessarily trammelled by
habit and prejudice while in the old region opinion as a rule 
and meaning the leading or better opinion is greatly in advance of
facts because facts are restrained by usage and personal interests
and opinion is incited by study and the necessity of change

permit me to say brigadier that i find your present institutions
a remarkable result to follow such a state of things

they are a cause rather than a consequence opinion as a whole
is everywhere on the advance and it is further advanced even here
as a whole than anywhere else accident has favored the foundation
of the social compact and once founded the facts have been
hastening to their consummation faster than the monikin mind has
been able to keep company with them this is a remarkable but true
state of the whole region in other monikin countries you see
opinion tugging at rooted practices and making desperate efforts to
eradicate them from their bed of vested interests while here you
see facts dragging opinion after them like a tail wriggling behind a
kite footnote one would think that brigadier downright had lately
paid a visit to our own happy and much enlightened land fifty years
since the negro was a slave in new york and incapable of
contracting marriage with a white facts have however been
progressive and from one privilege to another he has at length
obtained that of consulting his own tastes in this matter and so
far as he himself is concerned of doing as he pleases this is the
fact but he who presumes to speak of it has his windows broken by
opinion for his pains note by the editor as to our purely social
imitation and social follies absurd as they are they are
necessarily confined to a small and an immaterial class but the
indoctrinated spirit is a much more serious affair that unsettles
confidence innovates on the right often innocently and ignorantly
and causes the vessel of state to sail like a ship with a drag
towing in her wake

this is truly a novel condition for an enlightened monikin nation

no doubt men manage better but of all this you will learn more in
the great council you may perhaps think it strange that our facts
should preserve their ascendency in opposition to so powerful a foe
as opinion but you will remember that a great majority of our
people if not absolutely on a level with circumstances being
purely practical are much nearer to this level than the class
termed the endoctrinated the last are troublesome and delusive
rather than overwhelming

to return to mr wriggle is his sect numerous

his class flourishes most in the towns in leaplow we are greatly
in want of a capital where the cultivated educated and well-
mannered can assemble and placed by their habits and tastes above
the ordinary motives and feelings of the less instructed they might
form a more healthful independent appropriate and manly public
sentiment than that which now pervades the country as things are
the real elite of this community are so scattered as rather to
receive an impression from than to impart one to society the
leaplow wriggles as you have just witnessed are selfish and
exacting as to their personal pretensions irritably confident as to
the merit of any particular excellence which limits their own
experience and furiously proscribing to those whom they fancy less
fortunate than themselves

good heavens brigadier all this is excessively human

ah it is is it well this is certainly the way with us monikins
our wriggles are ashamed of exactly that portion of our population
of which they have most reason to be proud viz the mass and they
are proud of precisely that portion of which they have most reason
to be ashamed viz themselves but plenty of opportunities will
offer to look further into this and we will now hasten to the inn

as the brigadier appeared to chafe under the subject i remained
silent following him as fast as i could but keeping my eyes open
the reader may be very sure as we went along there was one
peculiarity i could not but remark in this singular town it was
this all the houses were smeared over with some colored earth and
then after all this pains had been taken to cover the material an
artist was employed to make white marks around every separate
particle of the fabric and they were in millions which ingenious
particularity gives the dwellings a most agreeable air of detail
imparting to the architecture in general a sublimity that is based
on the multiplication table if to this be added the black of the
chevaux-de-frise the white of the entrance-ladders and a sort of
standing-collar to the whole immediately under the eves of some
very dazzling hue the effect is not unlike that of a platoon of
drummers in scarlet coats cotton lace and cuffs and capes of
white what renders the similitude more striking is the fact that
no two of the same plantoon appear to be exactly of a size as is
very apt to be the case with your votaries in military music




chapter xxv

a fundamental principle a fundamental law and a fundamental error


the people of leaplow are remarkable for the deliberation of their
acts the moderation of their views and the accumulation of their
wisdom as a matter of course such a people is never in an indecent
haste although i have now been legally naturalized and regularly
elected to the great council fully twenty-four hours three entire
days were allowed for the study of the institutions and to become
acquainted with the genius of a nation who according to their own
account of the matter have no parallel in heaven or earth or in
the waters under the earth before i was called upon to exercise my
novel and important functions i profited by the delay and shall
seize a favorable moment to make the reader acquainted with some of
my acquisitions on this interesting topic

the institutions of leaplow are divided into two great moral
categories viz the legal and the substitutive the former
embraces the provisions of the great elementary and the latter all
the provisions of the great alimentary principle the first
accordingly is limited by the constitution or the great national
allegory while the last is limited by nothing but practice one
contains the proposition and the other its deductions this is all
hypothesis that all corollary the two great political landmarks
the two public opinions the bob-upon-bobs the rotatory action and
the great and little wheels are merely inferential and i shall
therefore say nothing about them in my present treatise which has
a strict relation only to the fundamental law of the land or to the
great and sacred national allegory

it has been already stated that leaplow was originally a scion of
leaphigh the political separation took place in the last
generation when the leaplowers publicly renounced leaphigh and all
it contained just as your catechumen is made to renounce the devil
and all his works this renunciation which is also sometimes called
the denunciation was much more to the liking of leaplow than to
that of leaphigh and a long and sanguinary war was the consequence
the leaplowers after a smart struggle however prevailed in their
firm determination to have no more to do with leaphigh the sequel
will show how far they were right

even preceding the struggle so active was the sentiment of
patriotism and independence that the citizens of leaplow though
ill-provided with the productions of their own industry proudly
resorted to the self-denial of refusing to import even a pin from
the mother country actually preferring nakedness to submission
they even solemnly voted that their venerable progenitor instead of
being as she clearly ought to have been a fond protecting and
indulgent parent was in truth no other than a rapacious
vindictive and tyrannical step-mother this was the opinion it will
be remembered when the two communities were legally united had but
one head wore clothes and necessarily pursued a multitude of their
interests in common

by the lucky termination of the war all this was radically changed
leaplow pointed her thumb at leaphigh and declared her intention
henceforth to manage her own affairs in her own way in order to do
this the more effectually and at the same time to throw dirt into
the countenance of her late step-mother she determined that her own
polity should run so near a parallel and yet should be so obviously
an improvement on that of leaphigh as to demonstrate the
imperfections of the latter to the most superficial observer that
this patriotic resolution was faithfully carried out in practice i
am now about to demonstrate

in leaphigh the old human principle had long prevailed that
political authority came from god though why such a theory should
ever have prevailed anywhere as mr downright once expressed it i
cannot see the devil very evidently having a greater agency in its
exercise than any other influence or intelligence whatever
however the jus divinum was the regulator of the leaphigh social
compact until the nobility managed to get the better of the jus
when the divinum was left to shift for itself it was at this epocha
the present constitution found its birth any one may have observed
that one stick placed on end will fall as a matter of course
unless rooted in the earth two sticks fare no better even with
their tops united but three sticks form a standard this simple and
beautiful idea gave rise to the leaphigh polity three moral props
were erected in the midst of the community at the foot of one of
which was placed the king to prevent it from slipping for all the
danger under such a system came from that of the base slipping at
the foot of the second the nobles and at the foot of the third
the people on the summit of this tripod was raised the machine of
state this was found to be a capital invention in theory though
practice as practice is very apt to do subjected it to some
essential modifications the king having his stick all his own way
gave a great deal of trouble to the two other sets of stick-holders
and unwilling to disturb the theory for that was deemed to be
irrevocably settled and sacred the nobility who for their own
particular convenience paid the principal workmen at the base of
the people's stick to stand steady set about the means of keeping
the king's stick also in a more uniform and serviceable attitude
it was on this occasion that discovering the king never could keep
his end of the great social stick in the place where he had sworn to
keep it they solemnly declared that he must have forgotten where
the constitutional foot-hole was and that he had irretrievably lost
his memory a decision that was the remote cause of the recent
calamity of captain poke the king was no sooner constitutionally
deprived of his memory than it was an easy matter to strip him of
all his other faculties after which it was humanely decreed as
indeed it ought to be in the case of a being so destitute that he
could do no wrong by way of following out the idea on a humane and
christian-like principle and in order to make one part of the
practice conform to the other it was shortly after determined that
he should do nothing his eldest first-cousin of the masculine
gender being legally proclaimed his substitute in the end the
crimson curtain was drawn before the throne as however this
cousin might begin to wriggle the stick in his turn and derange the
balance of the tripod the other two sets of stick-holders next
decided that though his majesty had an undeniable constitutional
right to say who should be his eldest first-cousin of the masculine
gender they had an undoubted constitutional right to say who he
should not be the result of all this was a compromise his majesty
who like other people found the sweets of authority more palatable
than the bitter agreeing to get up on top of the tripod where he
might appear seated on the machine of state to receive salutations
and eat and drink in peace leaving the others to settle among
themselves who should do the work at the bottom as well as they
could in brief such is the history and such was the polity of
leaphigh when i had the honor of visiting that country

the leaplowers were resolute to prove that all this was radically
wrong they determined in the first place that there should be but
one great social beam and in order that it should stand perfectly
steady they made it the duty of every citizen to prop its base
they liked the idea of a tripod well enough but instead of setting
one up in the leaphigh fashion they just reversed its form and
stuck it on top of their beam legs uppermost placing a separate
agent on each leg to work their machine of state taking care
also to send a new one aloft periodically they reasoned thus if
one of the leaphigh beams slip and they will be very apt to slip in
wet weather with the king nobles and people wriggling and shoving
against each other down will come the whole machine of state or
to say the least it will get so much awry as never to work as well
as at first and therefore we will have none of it if on the other
hand one of our agents makes a blunder and falls why he will only
break his own neck he will moreover fall in the midst of us and
should he escape with life we can either catch him and throw him
back again or we can send a better hand up in his place to serve
out the rest of his time they also maintain that one beam
supported by all the citizens is much less likely to slip than
three beams supported by three powers of very uncertain not to say
unequal forces

such in effect is the substance of the respective national
allegories of leaphigh and of leaplow i say allegories for both
governments seem to rely on this ingenious form of exhibiting their
great distinctive national sentiments it would in fact be an
improvement were all constitutions henceforth to be written in this
manner since they would necessarily be more explicit intelligible
and sacred than they are by the present attempt at literality

having explained the governing principles of these two important
states i now crave the reader's attention for a moment while i go
a little into the details of the modus operandi in both cases

leaphigh acknowledged a principle in the outset that leaplow
totally disclaimed viz that of primogeniture being an only child
myself and having no occasion for research on this interesting
subject i never knew the basis of this peculiar right until i came
to read the great leaphigh commentator whiterock on the governing
rules of the social compact i there found that the first-born
morally considered is thought to have better claims to the honors
of the genealogical tree on the father's side than those offspring
whose origin is to be referred to a later period in connubial life
on this obvious and highly discriminating principle the crown the
rights of the nobles and indeed all other rights are transferred
from father to son in the direct male line according to
primogeniture

nothing of this is practised in leaplow there the supposition of
legitimacy is as much in favor of the youngest as of the oldest
born and the practice is in conformity as there is no hereditary
chief to poise on one of the legs of the great tripod the people at
the foot of the beam choose one from among themselves periodically
who is called the great sachem the same people choose another set
few in number who occupy a common seat on another leg these they
term the riddles another set still more numerous and popular in
aspect if not in fact fills a large seat on the third leg these
last from their being supposed to be supereminently popular and
disinterested are familiarly known as the legion they are also
pleasantly nicknamed the bobees an appellation that took its rise
in the circumstance that most of the members of their body have
submitted to the second dock and indeed have nearly obliterated
every sign of a cauda i had most luckily been chosen to sit in
the house of bobees a station for which i felt myself well
qualified in this great essential at least for all the anointing
and forcing resorted to by noah and myself during our voyage out
and our residence in leaphigh had not produced so much as a visible
sprout in either

the great sachem the riddles and the legion had conjoint duties
to perform in certain respects and separate duties in others all
three as they owed their allegorical elevation to so were they
dependent on the people at the foot of the great social stick for
approbation and reward that is to say for all rewards other than
those which they have it in their power to bestow on themselves
there was another authority or agent of the public that is equally
perched on the social beam though not quite so dependent as the
three just named upon the main prop of the people being also
propped by a mechanical disposition of the tripod itself these are
termed the supreme arbitrators and their duties are to revise the
acts of the other three agents of the people and to decide whether
they are or are not in conformity with the recognized principles of
the sacred allegory

i was greatly delighted with my own progress in the study of the
leaplow institutions in the first place i soon discovered that the
principal thing was to reverse the political knowledge i had
acquired in leaphigh as one would turn a tub upside-down when he
wished to draw from its stores at a fresh end and then i was pretty
sure of being within at least the spirit of the leaplow law
everything seemed simple for all was dependent on the common prop
at the base of the great social beam

having got a thorough insight myself into the governing principles
of the system under which i had been chosen to serve i went to look
up my colleague captain poke in order to ascertain how he
understood the great leaplow allegory

i found the mind of the sealer according to a beautiful form of
speech already introduced in this narrative considerably
exercised on the several subjects that so naturally presented
themselves to a man in his situation in the first place he was in
a towering passion at the impudence of bob in presuming to offer
himself as a candidate for the great council and having offered
himself the rage of the captain was in no degree abated by the
circumstance of the young rascal's being at the head of the poll he
most unreservedly swore that no subordinate of his should ever sit
in the same legislative body with himself that he was a republican
by birth and knew the usages of republican governments quite as
well as the best patriot among them and although he admitted that
all sorts of critters were sent to congress in his country no man
ever knew an instance of a cabin-boy's being sent there they might
elect just as much as they pleased but coming ashore and playing
politician were very different things from cleaning his boots and
making his coffee and mixing his grog the captain had just been
waited on by a committee of the perpendiculars half the leaplow
community is on some committee or other by whom he had been
elected and they had given notice that instructions would be sent
in forthwith to all their representatives to perform gyration no
 as soon after the meeting of the council as possible he was no
tumbler and he had sent for a master of political saltation who
had just been with him practising according to noah's own
statement his success was anything but flattering if they would
give a body room sir john he said in a complaining accent i
should think nothing of it but you are expected to stand shoulder
to shoulder yard-arm and yard-arm and throw a flap-jack as handy
as an old woman would toss a johnny-cake it's unreasonable to think
of wearing ship without room but give me room and i'll engage to
get round on the other tack and to luff into the line again as
safely as the oldest cruiser among em though not quite so quick
they do go about spitefully that's sartain

nor were the great national allegories without their difficulties
noah perfectly understood the images of the two tripods though he
was disposed to think that neither was properly secured a mast
would make but bad weather he maintained let it be ever so well
rigged and stayed without being also securely stepped he saw no
use in trusting the heels of the beams to anybody good lashings
were what were wanted and then the people might go about their
private affairs and not fear the work would fall that the king of
leaphigh had no memory he could testify from bitter experience nor
did he believe that he had any conscience and chiefly he desired
to know if we when we got up into our places on the top of the
three inverted beams among the other bobees were to make war on
the great sachem and the riddles or whether we were to consider the
whole affair as a good thing in which the wisest course would be to
make fair weather of it

to all these remarks and questions i answered as well as my own
limited experience would allow taking care to inform my friend that
he had conceived the whole matter a little too literally as all
that he had been reading about the great political beams the
tripods and the legislative boxes was merely an allegory

and pray then sir john what may an allegory be

in this case my good sir it is a constitution

and what is a constitution

why it is sometimes as you perceive an allegory

and are we not to be mast-headed then according to the book

figuratively only

but there are actually such critters as the great sachem and
riddles and above all the bobees we are boney fie-diddle-di-dee
elected

boney fie-diddle-di-dee

and may i take the liberty of asking what it is our duty to do

we are to act practically according to the literality of the
legal implied figurative allegorical significations of the great
national compact under a legitimate construction

i fear we shall have to work doubletides sir john to do so much
in so short a time do you mean that in honest truth there is no
beam

there is and there is not

no fore main and mizzen tops according to what is here written
down

there is not and there is

sir john in the name of god speak out is all this about eight
dollars a day no better than a take in

that i believe is strictly literal

as noah now seemed a little mollified i seized the opportunity to
tell him he must beware how he attempted to stop bob from attending
the council members were privileged going and coming and unless
he was guarded in his course he might have some unpleasant
collision with the sergeant-at-arms besides it was unbecoming the
dignity of a legislator to be wrangling about trifles and he to
whom was confided the great affairs of a state ought to attach the
utmost importance to a grave exterior which commonly was of more
account with his constituents than any other quality any one could
tell whether he was grave or not but it was by no means so easy a
matter to tell whether he or his constituents had the greater cause
to appear so noah promised to be discreet and we parted not to
meet again until we assembled to be sworn in

before continuing the narrative i will just mention that we
disposed of our commercial investments that morning all the
leaphigh opinions brought good prices and i had occasion to see how
well the brigadier understood the market by the eagerness with
which in particular the opinions on the state of society in
leaplow were bought up but by one of those unexpected windfalls
which raise up so many of the chosen of the earth to their high
places the cook did better than any of us it will be remembered
that he had bartered an article of merchandise that he called slush
against a neglected bale of distinctive leaplow opinions which had
no success at all in leaphigh coming as they did from abroad these
articles had taken as novelties in bivouac and he sold them all
before night at enormous advances the cry being that something new
and extraordinary had found its way into the market




chapter xxvi

how to enact laws oratory logic and eloquence all considered in
their every-day aspects


political oaths are very much the same sort of thing everywhere and
i shall say no more about our inauguration than simply to state it
took place as usual the two houses were duly organized and we
proceeded without delay to the transaction of business i will
here state that i was much rejoiced to find brigadier downright
among the bobees the captain whispering that most probably he had
been mistaken for an immigrunt and chosen accordingly

it was not a great while before the great sachem sent us a
communication which contained a compte rendue of the state of the
nation like most accounts it is my good fortune to receive i
thought it particularly long agreeably to the opinions of this
document the people of leaplow were by a good deal the happiest
people in the world they were also considerably more respected
esteemed beloved honored and properly appreciated than any other
monikin community and in short they were the admiration and glory
of the universe i was exceedingly glad to hear this for some of
the facts were quite new to me a circumstance which shows one can
never get correct notions of a nation except from itself

these important facts properly digested we all of us set about our
several duties with a zeal that spoke fairly for our industry and
integrity things commenced swimmingly and it was not long before
the riddles sent us a resolution for concurrence by way of opening
the ball it was conceived in the following terms resolved that
the color which has hitherto been deemed to be black is really
white

as this was the first resolution that involved a principle on which
we had been required to vote i suggested to noah the propriety of
our going round to the brigadier and inquiring what might be the
drift of so singular a proposition our colleague answered the
question with great good-nature giving us to understand that the
perpendiculars and the horizontals had long been at variance on the
mere coloring property of various important questions and the real
matter involved in the resolution was not visible the former had
always maintained by always he meant ever since the time they
maintained the contrary the doctrine of the resolution and the
latter its converse a majority of the riddles just at this moment
are perpendiculars and as it was now seen they had succeeded in
getting a vote on their favorite principle

according to this account of the matter sir john observed the
captain i shall be compelled to maintain that black is white
seeing that i am in on the parpendic'lar interest

i thought with the captain and was pleased that my own legislative
debut was not to be characterized by the promulgation of any
doctrine so much at variance with my preconceived ways of thinking
curious however to know his opinion i asked the brigadier in what
light he felt disposed to view the matter himself

i am elected by the tangents he said and by what i can learn
it is the intention of our friends to steer a middle course and one
of our leaders is already selected who at a proper stage of the
affair is to move an amendment

can you refer me my dear friend to anything connected with the
great national allegory that bears on this point

why there is a clause among the fundamental and immutable laws
which it is thought was intended to meet this very case but
unhappily the sages by whom our allegory was drawn up have not paid
quite as much attention to the phraseology as the importance of the
subject demanded

here the brigadier laid his finger on the clause in question and i
returned to a seat to study its meaning it was conceived as
follows art iv clause the great national council shall in
no case whatever pass any law or resolution declaring white to be
black

after studying this fundamental enactment to the bottom turning it
on every side and finally considering it upside-down i came to the
conclusion that its tenor was on the whole rather more favorable
than unfavorable to the horizontal doctrine it struck me a very
good argument was to be made out of the constitutional question and
that it presented a very fair occasion for a new member to venture
on a maiden speech having so settled the matter entirely to my own
satisfaction i held myself in reserve waiting for the proper
moment to produce an effect

it was not long before the chairman of the committee on the
judiciary one of the effects of the resolution was entirely to
change the coloring of all testimony throughout the vast republic of
leaplow made his report on the subject-matter of the resolution
this person was a tangent who had a besetting wish to become a
riddle although the leaning of our house was decidedly horizontal
and as a matter of course he took the riddle side of this
question the report itself required seven hours in the reading
commencing with the subject at the epocha of the celebrated caucus
that was adjourned sine die by the disruption of the earth's crust
and previously to the distribution of the great monikin family into
separate communities and ending with the subject of the resolution
in his hand the reporter had set his political palette with the
utmost care having completely covered the subject with neutral
tints before he got through with it and glazing the whole down
with ultramarine in such a way as to cause the eye to regard the
matter through a fictitious atmosphere finally he repeated the
resolution verbatim and as it came from the other house

mr speaker now called upon gentlemen to deliver their sentiments
to my utter amazement captain poke arose put his tobacco back into
its box and opened the debate without apology

the honorable captain said he understood this question to be one
implicating the liberties of everybody he understood the matter
literally as it was propounded in the allegory and set forth in
the resolution and as such he intended to look at it with
unprejudiced eyes the natur of this proposal lay altogether in
color what is color after all make the most of it and in the
most favorable position which perhaps is the cheek of a comely
young woman and it is but skin-deep he remembered the time when a
certain female in another part of the univarse who is commonly
called miss poke might have out-rosed the best rose in a placed
called stunnin'tun and what did it all amount to he shouldn't ask
miss poke herself for obvious reasons but he would ask any of the
neighbors how she looked now quitting female natur he would come
to human natur generally he had often remarked that sea water was
blue and he had frequently caused pails to be lowered and the
water brought on deck to see if he could come at any of this
blueing matter for indigo was both scarce and dear in his part of
the world but he never could make out anything by the experiment
from which he concluded that on the whull there was pretty much no
such thing as color at all

as for the resolution before the house it depended entirely on the
meaning of words now after all what is a word why some people's
words are good and other people's words are good for nothing for
his part he liked sealed instruments which might be because he was
a sealer but as for mere words he set but little store by them he
once tuck a man's word for his wages and the long and short of it
was that he lost his money he had known a thousand instances in
which words had proved to be of no value and he did not see why
some gentlemen wished to make them of so much importance here for
his part he was for puffing up nothing no not even a word or a
color above its desarts the people seemed to call for a change in
the color of things and he called upon gentlemen to remember that
this was a free country and one in which the laws ruled and
therefore he trusted they would be disposed to adapt the laws to the
wants of the people what had the people asked of the house in this
matter so far as his knowledge went they had really asked nothing
in words but he understood there was great discontent on the
subject of the old colors and he construed their silence into an
expression of contempt for words in general he was a parpendic'lar
and he should always maintain parpendic'lar sentiments gentlemen
might not agree with him but for one he was not disposed to
jipordyze the liberties of his constituents and therefore he gave
the rizolution just as it came from the riddles without altering a
letter although he did think there was one word misspelt he meant
really which he had been taught to spell ra'aily but he was
ready to sacrifice even his opinions on this point to the good of
the country and therefore he went with the riddles even to their
misprints he hoped the rizolution would pass with the entire
unanimity so important a subject demanded

this speech produced a very strong sensation up to this time the
principal orators of the house had been much in the practice of
splitting hairs about some nice technicality in the great allegory
but noah with the simplicity of a truly great mind had made a home
thrust at the root of the whole matter laying about him with the
single-first i made a few apposite remarks on the necessity of
respecting the vital ordinances of the body politic and asked the
attention of my hearers while i read to them a particular clause
which it had struck me had some allusion to the very point now in
consideration having thus cleared the way i had not the folly to
defeat the objects of so much preparation by an indiscreet
precipitancy so far from it previously to reading the extract from
the constitution i waited until the attention of every member
present was attracted more forcibly by the dignity deliberation
and gravity of my manner than by the substance of what had yet been
said in the midst of this deep silence and expectation i read
aloud in a voice that reached every cranny in the hall 

the great council shall in no case whatever pass any law or
resolution declaring white to be black

if i had been calm in the presentation of this authority i was
equally self-possessed in waiting for its effect looking about me i
saw surprise perplexity doubt wonder and uncertainty in every
countenance if i did not find conviction one fact embarrassed even
me our friends the horizontals were evidently quite as much at
fault as our opponents the perpendiculars instead of being as i
had good reason to hope in an ecstasy of pleasure on hearing their
cause sustained by an authority so weighty

will the honorable member have the goodness to explain from what
author he has quoted one of the leading perpendiculars at length
ventured to inquire

the language you have just heard mr speaker i resumed
believing that now was the favorable instant to follow up the
matter is language that must find an echo in every heart it is
language that can never be used in vain in this venerable hall
language that carries with it conviction and command i observed
that the members were now fairly gaping at each other with wonder 
sir i am asked to name the author from whom i have quoted these
sententious and explicit words sir what you have just heard is to
be found in the article iv clause of the great national
allegory 

order order order shouted a hundred raven throats

i stood aghast even more amazed than the house itself had been only
the instant before

order order order order order continued to be yelled as if a
million of demons were screeching in the hall

the honorable member will please to recollect said the bland and
ex-officio impartial speaker who by the way was a perpendicular
elected by fraud that it is out of order to use personalities

personalities i do not understand sir 

the instrument to which the honorable member has alluded his own
good sense will tell him was never written by itself so far from
this the very members of the convention by which it was drawn up
are at this instant members of this house and most of them
supporters of the resolution now before the house and it will be
deemed personal to throw into their faces former official acts in
this unheard-of manner i am sorry it is my duty to say that the
honorable member is entirely out of order

but sir the sacred national 

sacred sir beyond a doubt but in a sense different from what you
imagine much too sacred sir ever to be alluded to here there are
the works of the commentators the books of constructions and
specially the writings of various foreign and perfectly
disinterested statesmen need i name ekrub in particular that are
at the command of members but so long as i am honored with a seat
in this chair i shall peremptorily decide against all
personalities

i was dumfounded the idea that the authority itself would be
refused never crossed my mind though i had anticipated a sharp
struggle on its construction the constitution only required that no
law should be passed declaring black to be white whereas the
resolution merely ordered that henceforth white should be black
here was matter for discussion nor was i at all sanguine as to the
result but to be thus knocked on the head by a club in the outset
was too much for the modesty of a maiden speech i took my seat in
confusion and i plainly saw that the perpendiculars by their
sneers now expected to carry everything triumphantly their own way
this most probably would have been the case had not one of the
tangents immediately got the floor to move the amendment to the
vast indignation of captain poke and in some degree to my own
mortification this duty was intrusted to the hon robert smut mr
smut commenced with entreating members not to be led away by the
sophistry of the first speaker that honorable member no doubt
felt himself called upon to defend the position taken by his
friends but those that knew him well as it had been his fate to
know him must be persuaded that his sentiments had at least
undergone a sudden and miraculous change that honorable member
denied the existence of color at all he would ask that honorable
member if he had never been instrumental himself in producing what
is generally called black and blue color he should like to know
if that honorable member placed as little value at present on
blows as he now seemed to set on words he begged pardon of the
house but this was a matter of great interest to himself he knew
that there never had been a greater manufacturer of black and blue
color than that honorable member and he wondered at his now so
pertinaciously denying the existence of colors and at his wish to
underrate their value for his part he trusted he understood the
importance of words and the value of hues and while he did not
exactly see the necessity of deeming black so inviolable as some
gentlemen appeared to think it he was not by any means prepared to
go as far as those who had introduced this resolution he did not
believe that public opinion was satisfied with maintaining that
black was black but he thought it was not yet disposed to affirm
that black was white he did not say that such a day might not
arrive he only maintained that it had not yet arrived and with a
view to meet that which he believed was the public sentiment he
should move by way of amendment to strike out the whole of the
resolution after the word really and insert that which would
cause the whole resolution to read as follows viz

resolved that the color which has hitherto been deemed to be
black is really lead-color

hereupon the honorable mr smut took his seat leaving the house to
its own ruminations the leaders of the perpendiculars foreseeing
that if they got half-way this session they might effect the rest
of their object the next determined to accept the compromise and
the resolution amended passed by a handsome majority so this
important point was finally decided for the moment leaving great
hopes among the perpendiculars of being able to lay the horizontals
even flatter on their backs than they were just then

the next question that presented itself was of far less interest
exciting no great attention to understand it however it will be
necessary to refer a little to history the government of
leapthrough had about sixty-three years before caused one hundred
and twenty-six leaplow ships to be burned on the high seas or
otherwise destroyed the pretence was that they incommoded
leapthrough leaplow was much too great a nation to submit to so
heinous an outrage while at the same time she was much too
magnanimous and wise a nation to resent it in an every-day and
vulgar manner instead of getting in a passion and loading her
cannon she summoned all her logic and began to reason after
reasoning the matter with leapthrough for fifty-two years or until
all the parties who had been wronged were dead and could no longer
be benefited by her logic she determined to abate two-thirds of her
pretensions in a pecuniary sense and all her pretensions in an
honorary sense and to compromise the affair by accepting a certain
insignificant sum of money as a salve to the whole wrong
leapthrough conditioned to pay this money in the most solemn and
satisfactory manner and everybody was delighted with the amicable
termination of a very vexatious and a seemingly interminable
discussion leapthrough was quite as glad to get rid of the matter
as leaplow and very naturally under all the circumstances thought
the whole thing at length done with when she conditioned to pay the
money the great sachem of leaplow most unfortunately however had
a will of iron or in other words he thought the money ought to
be paid as well as conditioned to be paid this despotic
construction of the bargain had given rise to unheard-of
dissatisfaction in leapthrough as indeed might have been expected
but it was oddly enough condemned with some heat even in leaplow
itself where it was stoutly maintained by certain ingenious
logicians that the only true way to settle a bargain to pay money
was to make a new one for a less sum whenever the amount fell due a
plan that with a proper moderation and patience would be certain
in time to extinguish the whole debt

several very elaborate patriots had taken this matter in hand and
it was now about to be presented to the house under four different
categories category no had the merit of simplicity and
precision it proposed merely that leaplow should pay the money
itself and take up the bond using its own funds category no 
embraced a recommendation of the great sachem for leaplow to pay
itself using however certain funds of leapthrough category no 
was a proposal to offer ten millions to leapthrough to say no more
about the transaction at all category no was to commence the
negotiating or abating system mentioned without delay in order to
extinguish the claim by instalments as soon as possible

the question came up on the consideration of the different projects
connected with these four leading principles my limits will not
admit of a detailed history of the debate all i can do is merely
to give an outline of the logic that these various propositions set
in motion of the legislative ingenuity of which they were the
parents and of the multitude of legitimate conclusions that so
naturally followed

in favor of category no it was urged that by adopting its
leading idea the affair would be altogether in our own hands and
might consequently be settled with greater attention to purely
leaplow interests that further delay could only proceed from our
own negligence that no other project was so likely to get rid of
this protracted negotiation in so short a time that by paying the
debt with the leaplow funds we should be sure of receiving its
amount in the good legal currency of the republic that it would be
singularly economical as the agent who paid might also be
authorized to receive whereby there would be a saving in salary
and finally that under this category the whole affair might be
brought within the limits of a nutshell and the compass of any
one's understanding

in favor of category no little more than very equivocal
sophisms which savored strongly of commonplace opinions were
presented it was pretended for instance that he who signed a bond
was in equity bound to pay it that if he refused the other party
had the natural and legal remedy of compulsion that it might not
always be convenient for a creditor to pay all the obligations of
other people which he might happen to hold that if his transactions
were extensive money might be wanting to carry out such a
principle and that as a precedent it would comport much more with
leaplow prudence and discretion to maintain the old and tried
notions of probity and justice than to enter on the unknown ocean
of uncertainty that was connected with the new opinions by
admitting which we could never know when we were fairly out of
debt

category no was discussed on an entirely new system of logic
which appeared to have great favor with that class of the members
who were of the more refined school of ethics these orators
referred the whole matter to a sentiment of honor they commenced by
drawing vivid pictures of the outrages in which the original wrongs
had been committed they spoke of ruined families plundered
mariners and blasted hopes they presented minute arithmetical
calculations to show that just forty times as much wrong had in
fact been done as this bond assumed and that as the case
actually stood leaplow ought in strict justice to receive exactly
forty times the amount of the money that was actually included in
the instrument turning from these interesting details they next
presented the question of honor leapthrough by attacking the
leaplow flag and invading leaplow rights had made it principally a
question of honor and in disposing of it the principle of honor
ought never to be lost sight of it was honorable to pay ones
debts this no one could dispute but it was not so clear by any
means that there was any honor in receiving ones dues the
national honor was concerned and they called on members as they
cherished the sacred sentiment to come forward and sustain it by
their votes as the matter stood leaplow had the best of it in
compounding with her creditor as had been done in the treaty
leapthrough lost some honor in refusing to pay the bond she lost
still more and now if we should send her the ten millions
proposed and she should have the weakness to accept it we should
fairly get our foot upon her neck and she could never look us in
the face again

the category no brought up a member who had made political
economy his chief study this person presented the following case 
according to his calculations the wrong had been committed
precisely sixty-three years and twenty-six days and two-thirds of
a day ago for the whole of that long period leaplow had been
troubled with this vexatious question which had hung like a cloud
over the otherwise unimpaired brightness of her political landscape
it was time to get rid of it the sum stipulated was just twenty-
five millions to be paid in twenty-five annual instalments of a
million each now he proposed to reduce the instalments to one-half
the number but in no way to change the sum that point ought to be
considered as irrevocably settled this would diminish the debt one-
half before the first instalment should become due he would effect
a postponement by diminishing the instalments again to six
referring the time to the latest periods named in the last treaty
and always most sacredly keeping the sums precisely the same it
would be impossible to touch the sums which he repeated ought to
be considered as sacred before the expiration of the first seven
years a new arrangement might reduce the instalments to two or
even to one always respecting the sum and finally at the proper
moment a treaty could be concluded declaring that there should be
no instalment at all reserving the point that if there had been an
instalment leaplow could never have consented to reduce it below
one million the result would be that in about five-and-twenty years
the country would be fairly rid of the matter and the national
character which it was agreed on all hands was even now as high as
it well could be would probably be raised many degrees higher the
negotiations had commenced in a spirit of compromise and our
character for consistency required that this spirit of compromise
should continue to govern our conduct as long as a single farthing
remained unpaid

this idea took wonderfully and i do believe it would have passed by
a handsome majority had not a new proposition been presented by an
orator of singularly pathetic powers

the new speaker objected to all four of the categories he said that
each and every one of them would lead to war leapthrough was a
chivalrous and high-minded nation as was apparent by the present
aspect of things should we presume to take up the bond using our
own funds it would mortally offend her pride and she would fight
us did we presume to take up the bond using her funds it would
offend her financial system and she would fight us did we presume
to offer her ten millions to say no more about the matter it would
offend her dignity by intimating that she was to be bought off from
her rights and she would fight us did we presume to adopt the
system of new negotiations it would mortally offend her honor by
intimating that she would not respect her old negotiations and she
would fight us he saw war in all four of the categories he was for
a peace category and he thought he held in his hand a proposition
that by proper management using the most tender delicacy and
otherwise respecting the sensibilities of the high and honorable
nation in question we might possibly get out of this embarrassing
dilemma without actually coming to blows he said to blows for he
wished to impress on honorable members the penalties of war he
invited gentlemen to recollect that a conflict between two great
nations was a serious affair if leapthrough were a little nation
it would be a different matter and the contest might be conducted
in a corner our honor was intimately connected with all we did with
great nations what was war did gentlemen know he would tell them

here the orator drew a picture of war that caused suffering
monikinity to shudder he viewed it in its four leading points its
religious its pecuniary its political and its domestic penalties
he described war to be the demon state of the monikin mind as
opposed to worship to charity brotherly love and all the virtues
on its pecuniary penalties he touched by exhibiting a tax-sheet
buttons which cost sixpence a gross he assured the house would
shortly cost sevenpence a gross here he was reminded that monikins
no longer wore buttons no matter they bought and sold buttons
and the effects on trade were just the same the political penalties
of war he fairly showed to be frightful but when he came to speak
of the domestic penalties there was not a dry eye in the house
captain poke blubbered so loud that i was in an agony lest he should
be called to order

regard that pure spirit he cried crushed as it has been in the
whirlwind of war behold her standing over the sod that covers the
hero of his country the husband of her virgin affections in vain
the orphan at her side turns its tearful eye upwards and asks for
the plumes that so lately pleased its infant fancy in vain its
gentle voice inquires when he is to return when he is to gladden
their hearts with his presence  but i can write no more sobs
interrupted the speaker and he took his seat in an ecstasy of
godliness and benevolence

i hurried across the house to beg the brigadier would introduce me
to this just monikin without a moment's delay i felt as if i could
take him to my heart at once and swear an eternal friendship with a
spirit so benevolent the brigadier was too much agitated at first
to attend to me but after wiping his eyes at least a hundred
times he finally succeeded in arresting the torrents and looked
upwards with a bland smile

is he not a wonderful monikin

wonderful indeed how completely he puts us all to shame such a
monikin can only be influenced by the purest love for the species

yes he is of a class that we call the third monikinity nothing
excites our zeal like the principles of the class of which he is a
member

how have you more than one class of the humane

certainly the original the representative and the speculative

i am devoured by the desire to understand the distinctions my dear
brigadier

the original is an every-day class that feels under the natural
impulses the representative is a more intellectual division that
feels chiefly by proxy the speculatives are those whose sympathies
are excited by positive interests like the last speaker this
person has lately bought a farm by the acre which he is about to
sell in village lots by the foot and war will knock the whole
thing in the head it is this which stimulates his benevolence in so
lively a manner

why this is no more than a development of the social-stake system-
-

i was interrupted by the speaker who called the house to order the
vote on the resolution of the last orator was to be taken it read
as follows 

resolved that it is altogether unbecoming the dignity and
character of leapthrough for leaplow to legislate on the subject of
so petty a consideration as a certain pitiful treaty between the two
countries

unanimity unanimity was shouted by fifty voices unanimity there
was and then the whole house set to work shaking hands and hugging
each other in pure joy at the success of the honorable and
ingenious manner in which it had got rid of this embarrassing and
impertinent question




chapter xxvii

an effect of logarithms on morals an obscuration a dissertation
and a calculation


the house had not long adjourned before captain poke and myself were
favored with a visit from our colleague mr downright who came on
an affair of absorbing interest he carried in his hand a small
pamphlet and the usual salutations were scarcely over before he
directed our attention to a portion of its contents it would seem
that leaplow was on the eve of experiencing a great moral eclipse
the periods and dates of the phenomenon if that can be called a
phenomenon which was of too frequent occurrence had been
calculated with surprising accuracy by the academy of leaphigh
and sent through its minister as an especial favor to our beloved
country in order that we should not be taken by surprise the
account of the affair read as follows 

on the third day of the season of nuts there will be the
commencement of a great moral eclipse in that portion of the
monikin region which lies immediately about the pole the property
in eclipse will be the great moral postulate usually designated by
the term principle and the intervening body will be the great
immoral postulate usually known as interest the frequent
occurrence of the conjunction of these two important postulates has
caused our moral mathematicians to be rather negligent of their
calculations on this subject of late years but to atone for this
inexcusable indifference to one of the most important concerns of
life the calculating committee was instructed to pay unusual
attention to all the obscurations of the present year and this
phenomenon one of the most decided of our age has been calculated
with the utmost nicety and care we give the results

the eclipse will commence by a motive of monikin vanity coming in
contact with the sub-postulate of charity at a m the postulate
in question will be totally hid from view in the course of h 
m from the moment of contact the passage of a political intrigue
will instantly follow when the several sub-postulates of truth
honesty disinterestedness and patriotism will all be obscured in
succession beginning with the lower limb of the first and ending
with all the limbs of the whole of them in h m from the
moment of contact the shadow of vanity and political intrigue will
first be deepened by the approach of prosperity and this will be
soon succeeded by the contact of a great pecuniary interest at 
h m s and in exactly m and - s the whole of the great
moral postulate of principle will be totally hid from view in
consequence of this early passage of the darkest shadow that is ever
cast by interest the passages of the respective shadows of
ambition hatred jealousy and all the other minor satellites of
interest will be invisible

the country principally affected by this eclipse will be the
republic of leaplow a community whose known intelligence and
virtues are perhaps better qualified to resist its influence than
any other the time of occultation will be y m d h m
 s principle will begin to reappear to the moral eye at the end of
this period first by the approach of misfortune whose atmosphere
being much less dense than that of interest will allow of imperfect
views of the obscured postulate but the radiance of the latter will
not be completely restored until the arrival of misery whose
chastening colors invariably permit all truths to be discernible
although through a sombre medium to resume

i gazed at the brigadier in admiration and awe there was nothing
remarkable in the eclipse itself which was quite an every-day
affair but the precision with which it had been calculated added to
its other phenomena the terrible circumstance of obtaining a glimpse
into the future i now began to perceive the immense difference
between living consciously under a moral shadow and living under it
unconsciously the latter was evidently a trifle compared with the
former providence had most kindly provided for our happiness in
denying the ability to see beyond the present moment

noah took the affair even more at heart than myself he told me
with a rueful and prognosticating countenance that we were fast
drawing near to the autumnal equinox when we should reach the
commencement of a natural night of six months duration and
although the benevolent substitute of steam might certainly in some
degree lessen the evil that it was a furious evil after all to
exist for a period so weary without enjoying the light of the sun
he found the external glare of day bad enough but he did not
believe he should be able to endure its total absence natur had
made him a watch and watch critter as for the twilight of which
so much was said it was worse than nothin being neither one thing
nor the other for his part he liked things made out of whole
cloth then he had sent the ship round to a distant roadstead in
order that there might be no more post-captains and rear-admirals
among the people and here had he been as much as four days on
nothing but nuts nuts might do for the philosophy of a monkey but
he found on trial that it played the devil with the philosophy of
a man things were bad enough as they were he pined for a little
pork he cared not who knew it it might not be very sentimental he
knew but it was capital sea-food his natur was pretty much pork
he believed most men had in some way or other more or less pork in
their human natur's nuts might do for monikin natur but human
natur loved meat if monikins did not like it monikins need not
eat it there would be so much the more for those who did like it 
he pined for his natural aliment and as for living nine years in an
eclipse it was quite out of the question the longest stunnin'tun
eclipses seldom went over three hours he once knew deacon spiteful
pray quite through one from apogee to perigee he therefore
proposed that sir john and he should resign their seats without
delay and that they should try to get the walrus to the north'ard
as quick as possible lest they should be caught in the polar night
as for the hon robert smut he wished him no better luck than to
remain where he was all his life and to receive his eight dollars a
day in acorns

although it was impossible not to hear and having heard not to
record the sentiments of noah still my attention was much more
strongly attracted by the demeanor of the brigadier than by the
jeremiad of the sealer to an anxious inquiry if he were not well
our worthy colleague answered plaintively that he mourned over the
misfortune of his country

i have often witnessed the passage of the passions and of the
minor motives across the disc of the great moral postulate
principle but an occultation of its light by a pecuniary interest
and for so long a period is fearful heaven only knows what will
become of us

are not these eclipses after all so many mere illustrations of
the social-stake system i confess this occultation of which you
seem to have so much dread is not so formidable a thing on
reflection as it at first appeared to be

you are quite right sir john as to the character of the eclipse
itself which as a matter of course must depend on the character
of the intervening body but the wisest and best of our philosophers
hold that the entire system of which we are but insignificant parts
is based on certain immutable truths of a divine origin the
premises or postulates of all these truths are so many moral
guides in the management of monikin affairs and the moment they
are lost sight of as will be the case during these frightful nine
years that are to come we shall be abandoned entirely to
selfishness now selfishness is only too formidable when restrained
by principle but left to its own grasping desires and audacious
sophisms to me the moral perspective is terrible we are only too
much addicted to turn our eyes from principle when it is shining in
heavenly radiance and in full glory before us it is not
difficult therefore to foresee the nature of the consequences
which are to follow its total and protracted obscuration

you then conceive there is a rule superior to interest which ought
to be respected in the control of monikin affairs

beyond a doubt else in what should we differ from the beasts of
prey

i do not exactly see whether this does or does not accord with the
notions of the political economists of the social-stake system

as you say sir john it does and it does not your social-stake
system supposes that he who has what is termed a distinct and
prominent interest in society will be the most likely to conduct
its affairs wisely justly and disinterestedly this would be true
if those great principles which lie at the root of all happiness
were respected but unluckily the stake in question instead of
being a stake in justice and virtue is usually reduced to be merely
a stake in property now all experience shows that the great
property-incentives are to increase property protect property and
to buy with property those advantages which ought to be independent
of property viz honors dignities power and immunities i
cannot say how it is with men but our histories are eloquent on
this head we have had the property-principle carried out thoroughly
in our practice and the result has shown that its chief operation
is to render property as intact as possible and the bones and
sinews and marrow of all who do not possess it its slaves in
short the time has been when the rich were even exempt from
contributing to the ordinary exigencies of the state but it is
quite useless to theorize on this subject for by that cry in the
streets the lower limb of the great postulate is beginning to be
obscured and alas we shall soon have too much practical
information

the brigadier was right on referring to the clocks it was found
that in truth the eclipse had commenced some time before and that
we were on the verge of an absolute occultation of principle by the
basest and most sordid of all motives pecuniary interest

the first proof that was given of the true state of things was in
the language of the people the word interest was in every monikin's
mouth while the word principle as indeed was no more than
suitable seemed to be quite blotted out of the leaplow vocabulary
to render a local term into english half of the vernacular of the
country appeared to be compressed into the single word dollar
dollar dollar dollar nothing but dollar fifty thousand
dollars twenty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars met
one at every turn the words rang at the corners in the public
ways at the exchange in the drawing-rooms ay even in the
churches if a temple had been reared for the worship of the
creator the first question was how much did it cost if an artist
submitted the fruits of his labors to the taste of his fellow-
citizens conjectures were whispered among the spectators touching
its value in the current coin of the republic if an author
presented the offspring of his genius to the same arbiters its
merits were settled by a similar standard and one divine who had
made a strenuous but an ill-timed appeal to the charity of his
countrymen by setting forth the beauties as well as the rewards of
the god-like property was fairly put down by a demonstration that
his proposition involved a considerable outlay while it did not
clearly show much was to be gained by going to heaven

brigadier downright had good reasons for his sombre anticipations
for all the acquirements knowledge and experience obtained in
many years of travel were now found to be worse than useless if my
honorable colleague and covoyager ventured a remark on the subject
of foreign policy a portion of politics to which he had given
considerable attention it was answered by a quotation from the
stock market an observation on a matter of taste was certain to
draw forth a nice distinction between the tastes of certain liquors
together with a shrewd investigation of their several prices and
once when the worthy monikin undertook to show from what struck me
to be singularly good data that the foreign relations of the
country were in a condition to require great firmness a proper
prudence and much foresight he was completely silenced by an
antagonist showing from the last sales the high value of lots up
town

in short there was no dealing with any subject that could not
resolve itself into dollars by means of the customary exchanges
the infatuation spread from father to son from husband to wife
from brother to sister and from one collateral to another until it
pretty effectually assailed the whole of what is usually termed
society noah swore bitterly at this antagonist state of things
he affirmed that he could not even crack a walnut in a corner but
every monikin that passed appeared to grudge him the satisfaction
small as it was and that stunin'tun though a scramble-penny place
as any he knew was paradise to leaplow in the present state of
things

it was melancholy to remark how the lustre of the ordinary virtues
grew dim as the period of occultation continued and the eye
gradually got to be accustomed to the atmosphere cast by the shadow
of pecuniary interest i involuntarily shuddered at the open and
undisguised manner in which individuals who might otherwise pass
for respectable monikins spoke of the means that they habitually
employed in effecting their objects and laid bare their utter
forgetfulness of the great postulate that was hid one coolly
vaunted how much cleverer he was than the law another proved to
demonstration that he had outwitted his neighbor while a third
more daring or more expert applied the same grounds of exultation
to the entire neighborhood this had the merit of cunning that of
dissimulation another of deception and all of success

the shadow cast its malign influence on every interest connected
with monikin life temples were raised to god on speculation the
government was perverted to a money-investment in which profit and
not justice and security was the object holy wedlock fast took the
aspect of buying and selling and few prayed who did not identify
spiritual benefits with gold and silver

the besetting propensity of my ancestor soon began to appear in
leaplow many of those pure and unsophisticated republicans shouted
property is in danger as stoutly as it was ever roared by sir
joseph job and dark allusions were made to revolutions and
bayonets but certain proof of the prevalence of the eclipse and
that the shadow of pecuniary interest lay dark on the land was to
be found in the language of what are called the few they began to
throw dirt at all opposed to them like so many fish-women a sure
symptom that the spirit of selfishness was thoroughly awakened from
much experience i hold this sign to be infallible that the
sentiment of aristocracy is active and vigilant i never yet visited
a country in which a minority got into its head the crotchet it was
alone fit to dictate to the rest of its fellow-creatures that it
did not without delay set about proving its position by reviling
and calling names in this particular the few are like women who
conscious of their weakness seldom fail to make up for the want of
vigor in their limbs by having recourse to the vigor of the tongue
the one hangs the many command by the dignity of force the
few vituperate and scold this is i believe the case all over
the world except in those peculiar instances in which the few
happen also to enjoy the privilege of hanging

it is worthy of remark that the terms rabble disorganizers
jacobins and agrarians footnote it is scarcely necessary to
tell the intelligent reader there is no proof that any political
community was ever so bent on self-destruction as to enact agrarian
laws in the vulgar sense in which it has suited the arts of narrow-
minded politicians to represent them ever since the revival of
letters the celebrated agrarian laws of rome did not essentially
differ from the distribution of our own military lands or perhaps
the similitude is greater to the modern russian military colonies
those who feel an interest in this subject would do well to consult
niebuhr note by the editor were bandied from one to the other in
leaplow under this malign influence with precisely the same
justice discrimination and taste as they had been used by my
ancestor in london a few years before like causes notoriously
produce like effects and there is no one thing so much like an
englishman under the property-fever as a leaplow monikin suffering
under the same malady

the effect produced on the state of parties by the passage of the
shadow of pecuniary interest was so singular as to deserve our
notice patriots who had long been known for an indomitable
resolution to support their friends openly abandoned their claims
on the rewards of the little wheel and went over to the enemy and
this too without recourse to the mysteries of the flapjack
judge people's friend was completely annihilated for the moment so
much so indeed as to think seriously of taking another mission 
for during these eclipses long service public virtue calculated
amenity and all the other bland qualities of your patriot pass for
nothing when weighed in the scale against profit and loss it was
fortunate the leapthrough question was in its essence so well
disposed of though the uneasiness of those who bought and sold land
by the inch pushed even that interest before the public again by
insisting that a few millions should be expended in destroying the
munitions of war lest the nation might improvidently be tempted to
make use of them in the natural way the cruisers were accordingly
hauled into the stream and converted into tide-mills the gun-
barrels were transformed into gas-pipes and the forts were
converted as fast as possible into warehouses and tea-gardens
after this it was much the fashion to affirm that the advanced
state of civilization had rendered all future wars quite out of the
question indeed the impetus that was given by the effects of the
shadow in this way to humanity in gross was quite as remarkable
as were its contrary tendencies on humanity in detail

public opinion was not backward in showing how completely it was
acting under the influence of the shadow virtue began to be
estimated by rent-rolls the affluent without hesitation or
indeed opposition appropriated to themselves the sole use of the
word respectable while taste judgment honesty and wisdom
dropped like so many heirlooms quietly into the possession of those
who had money the leaplowers are a people of great acuteness and
of singular knowledge of details every considerable man in bivouac
soon had his social station assigned him the whole community being
divided into classes of hundred-thousand-dollar monikins fifty-
thousand-dollar monikins twenty-thousand-dollar monikins great
conciseness in language was a consequence of this state of feeling
the old questions of is he honest is he capable is he
enlightened is he wise is he good being all comprehended in
the single interrogatory of is he rich

there was one effect of this very unusual state of things that i
had not anticipated all the money-getting classes without
exception showed a singular predilection in favor of what is
commonly called a strong government being not only a republic but
virtually a democracy i found that much the larger portion of this
highly respectable class of citizens were not at all backward in
expressing their wish for a change

how is this i demanded of the brigadier whom i rarely quitted
for his advice and opinions were of great moment to me just at this
particular crisis how is this my good friend i have always been
led to think trade is especially favorable to liberty and here are
all your commercial interests the loudest in their declamations
against the institutions

the brigadier smiled it was but a melancholy smile after all for
his spirits appeared to have quite deserted him

there are three great divisions among politicians he said they
who do not like liberty at all they who like it as low down as
their own particular class and they who like it for the sake of
their fellow-creatures the first are not numerous but powerful by
means of combinations the second is a very irregular corps
including as a matter of course nearly everybody but is wanting
of necessity in concert and discipline since no one descends below
his own level the third are but few alas how few and are
composed of those who look beyond their own selfishness now your
merchants dwelling in towns and possessing concert means and
identity of interests have been able to make themselves remarkable
for contending with despotic power a fact which has obtained for
them a cheap reputation for liberality of opinion but so far as
monikin experience goes men may have proved to be better disposed 
no government that is essentially influenced by commerce has ever
been otherwise than exclusive or aristocratic

i bethought me of venice genoa pisa the hanse towns and all the
other remarkable places of this character in europe and i felt the
justice of my friend's distinction at the same time i could not but
observe how much more the minds of men are under the influence of
names and abstractions than under the influence of positive things
to this opinion the brigadier very readily assented remarking at
the same time that a well-wrought theory had generally more effect
on opinion than fifty facts a result that he attributed to the
circumstance of monikins having a besetting predisposition to save
themselves the trouble of thinking

i was in particular struck with the effect of the occultation of
principle on motives i had often remarked that it was by no means
safe to depend on one's own motives for two sufficient reasons
first that we did not always know what our own motives were and
secondly admitting that we did it was quite unreasonable to
suppose that our friends would believe them what we thought them to
be ourselves in the present instance every monikin seemed
perfectly aware of the difficulty and instead of waiting for his
acquaintances to attribute some moral enormity as his governing
reason he prudently adopted a moderately selfish inducement for his
acts which he proclaimed with a simplicity and frankness that
generally obtained credit indeed the fact once conceded that the
motive was not offensively disinterested and just no one was
indisposed to listen to the projects of his friend who usually rose
in estimation as he was found to be ingenious calculating and
shrewd the effect of all this was to render society singularly
sincere and plain-spoken and one unaccustomed to so much
ingenuousness or who was ignorant of the cause might plausibly
enough suppose at times that accident had thrown him into an
extraordinary association with so many artistes who as it is
commonly expressed lived by their wits i will avow that had it
been the fashion to wear pockets at leaplow i should often have
been concerned for their contents for sentiments so purely
unsophisticated were so openly advanced under the influence of the
shadow that one was inevitably led oftener than was pleasant to
think of the relations between meum and tuum as well as of the
unexpected causes by which they were sometimes disturbed

a vacancy occurred the second day of the eclipse among the
representatives of bivouac and the candidate of the horizontals
would certainly have been chosen to fill it but for a contretemps
connected with this affair of motives the individual in question
had lately performed that which in most other countries and under
other circumstances would have passed for an act of creditable
national feeling but which quite as a matter of course was
eagerly presented to the electors by his opponents as a proof of
his utter unfitness to be intrusted with their interests the
friends of the candidate took the alarm and indignantly denied the
charges of the perpendiculars affirming that their monikin had been
well paid for what he had done in an evil hour the candidate
undertook to explain by means of a handbill in which he stated
that he had been influenced by no other motive than a desire to do
that which he believed to be right such a person was deemed to be
wanting in natural abilities and as a matter of course he was
defeated for your leaplow elector was not such an ass as to confide
the care of his interests to one who knew so little how to take care
of his own

about this time too a celebrated dramatist produced a piece in
which the hero performed prodigies under the excitement of
patriotism and the labor of his pen was incontinently damned for
his pains both pit and boxes the galleries dissenting deciding
that it was out of all nature to represent a monikin incurring
danger in this unheard-of manner without a motive the unhappy
wight altered the last scene by causing his hero to be rewarded by
a good round sum of money when the piece had a very respectable
run for the rest of the season though i question if it ever were as
popular as it would have been had this precaution been taken before
it was first acted




chapter xxviii

the importance of motives to a legislator moral consecutiveness
comets kites and a convoy with some every-day legislation
together with cause and effect


legislation during the occultation of the great moral postulate
principle by the passage of pecuniary interest is at the best but
a melancholy affair it proved to be peculiarly so with us just at
that moment for the radiance of the divine property had been a good
deal obscured in the houses for a long time previously by the
interference of various minor satellites in nothing therefore did
the deplorable state of things which existed make itself more
apparent than in our proceedings

as captain poke and myself notwithstanding our having taken
different stands in politics still continued to live together i
had better opportunities to note the workings of the obscuration on
the ingenuous mind of my colleague than on that of most other
persons he early began to keep a diary of his expenses regularly
deducting the amount at night from the sum of eight dollars and
regarding the balance as so much clear gain his conversation too
soon betrayed a leaning to his personal interests instead of being
of that pure and elevated cast which should characterize the
language of a statesman he laid down the position pretty
dogmatically that legislation after all was work that the
laborer was worthy of his hire and that for his part he felt no
great disposition to go through the vexation and trouble of helping
to make laws unless he could see with a reasonable certainty that
something was to be got by it he thought leaplow had quite laws
enough as it was more than she respected or enforced and if she
wanted any more all she had to do was to pay for them he should
take an early occasion to propose that all our wages or at any
rate his own others might do as they pleased should be raised at
the very least two dollars a day and this while he merely sat in
the house for he wished to engage me to move by way of amendment
that as much more should be given to the committees he did not
think it was fair to exact of a member to be a committee-man for
nothin although most of them were committee-men for nothin and
if we were called on to keep two watches in this manner the least
that could be done would be to give us two pays he said
considering it in the most favorable point of view that there was
great wear and tear of brain in legislation and he should never be
the man he was before he engaged in the trade he assured me that
his idees sometimes were so complicated that he did not know where
to find the one he wanted and that he had wished for a cauda a
thousand times since he had been in the house for by keeping the
end of it in his hand like the bight of a rope he might always
have suthin tangible to cling to he told me as a great secret
that he was fairly tired of rummaging among his thoughts for the
knowledge necessary to understand what was going on and that he had
finally concluded to put himself for the rest of the session under
the convoy of a god-like he had been looking out for a fit fugleman
of this sort and he had pretty much determined to follow the signal
of the great god-like of the parpendic'lars like the rest of them
for it would occasion less confusion in the ranks and enable him to
save himself a vast deal of trouble in making up his mind he didn't
know on the whole but eight dollars a day might give a living
profit provided he could throw all the thinking on his god-like
and turn his attention to suthin else he thought of writing his
v'y'ges for he understood that anything from foreign parts took
like wild-fire in leaplow and if they didn't take he could always
project charts for a living

perhaps it will be necessary to explain what noah meant by saying
that he thought of engaging a god-like the reader has had some
insight into the nature of one set of political leaders in leaplow
who are known by the name of the most patriotic patriots these
persons it is scarcely necessary to say are always with the
majority or in a situation to avail themselves of the evolutions of
the little wheel their great rotatory principle keeps them pretty
constantly in motion it is true but while there is a centrifugal
force to maintain this action great care has been had to provide a
centripetal counterpoise in order to prevent them from bolting out
of the political orbit it is supposed to be owing to this
peculiarity in their party organizations that your leaplow patriot
is so very remarkable for going round and round a subject without
ever touching it

as an offset to this party arrangement the perpendiculars have
taken refuge in the god-likes a god-like in leaplow politics in
some respects resembles a saint in the catholic calendar that is to
say he is canonized after passing through a certain amount of
temptation and vice with a whole skin after having his cause
pleaded for a certain number of years before the high authorities of
his party and usually after having had a pretty good taste of
purgatory canonization attained however all gets to be plain
sailing with him he is spared singular as it may appear even a
large portion of his former wear and tear of brains as noah had
termed it for nothing puts one so much at liberty in this respect
as to have full powers to do all the thinking thinking in company
like travelling in company requires that we should have some
respect to the movements wishes and opinions of others but he who
gets a carte blanche for his sentiments resembles the uncaged bird
and may fly in whatever direction most pleases himself and feel
confident as he goes that his ears will be saluted with the usual
traveller's signal of all's right i can best compare the
operation of your god-like and his votaries to the action of a
locomotive with its railroad train as that goes this follows
faster or slower the movement is certain to be accompanied when
the steam is up they fly when the fire is out they crawl and that
too with a very uneasy sort of motion and when a bolt is broken
they who have just been riding without the smallest trouble to
themselves are compelled to get out and push the load ahead as well
as they can frequently with very rueful faces and in very dirty
ways the cars whisk about precisely as the locomotive whisks
about all the turn-outs are necessarily imitated and in short
one goes after the other very much as it is reasonable to suppose
will happen when two bodies are chained together and the entire
moving power is given to only one of them a god-like in leaplow
moreover is usually a riddle it was the object of noah to hitch on
to one of these moral steam-tugs in order that he too might be
dragged through his duties without effort to himself an expedient
as the old sealer expressed it that would in some degree remedy his
natural want of a cauda by rendering him nothing but tail

i expect sir john he said for he had a practice of expecting by
way of conjecture i expect this is the reason why the leaplowers
dock themselves they find it more convenient to give up the
management of their affairs to some one of these god-likes and fall
into his wake like the tail of a comet which makes it quite
unnecessary to have any other cauda

i understand you they amputate to prevent tautology

noah rarely spoke of any project until his mind was fairly made up
and the execution usually soon followed the proposition the next
thing i heard of him therefore he was fairly under the convoy as
he called it of one of the most prominent of the riddles curious
to know how he liked the experiment after a week's practice i
called his attention to the subject by a pretty direct inquiry

he told me it was altogether the pleasantest mode of legislating
that had ever been devised he was now perfectly master of his own
time and in fact he was making out a set of charts for the leaplow
marine a task that was likely to bring him in a good round sum as
pumpkins were cheap and in the polar seas he merely copied the
monikin authorities and out of it he had things pretty much his own
way as for the great allegory when he wanted a hint about it or
indeed about any other point at issue all he had to do was to
inquire what his god-like thought about it and to vote accordingly
then he saved himself a great deal of breath in the way of argument
out of doors for he and the rest of the clientele of this riddle
having officially invested their patron with all their own parts
the result had been such an accumulation of knowledge in this one
individual as enabled them ordinarily to floor any antagonist by
the simple quotation of his authority such or such is the opinion
of god-like this or of god-like that was commonly sufficient and
then there was no lack of material for he had taken care to provide
himself with a riddle who he really believed had given an opinion
at some time or other on every side of every subject that had ever
been mooted in leaplow he could nullify or mollify or qualify
with the best of them and these which he termed the three fies he
believed were the great requisites of a leaplow legislator he
admitted however that some show of independence was necessary in
order to give value to the opinion of even a god-like for monikin
nature revolted at anything like total mental dependence and that
he had pretty much made up his mind to think for himself on a
question that was to be decided that very day

the case to which the captain alluded was this the city of bivouac
was divided in three pretty nearly equal parts which were separated
from each other by two branches of a marsh one part of the town
being on a sort of island and the other two parts on the respective
margins of the low land it was very desirable to connect these
different portions of the capital by causeways and a law to that
effect had been introduced in the house everybody in or out of the
house was in favor of the project for the causeways had become in
some measure indispensable the only disputed point was the length
of the works in question one who is but little acquainted with
legislation and who has never witnessed the effects of an
occultation of the great moral postulate principle by the orb
pecuniary interest would very plausibly suppose that the whole
affair lay in a nutshell and that all we had to do was to pass a
law ordering the causeways to extend just as far as the public
convenience rendered it necessary but these are mere tyros in the
affairs of monikins the fact was that there were just as many
different opinions and interests at work to regulate the length of
the causeways as there were owners of land along their line of
route the great object was to start in what was called the business
quarter of the town and then to proceed with the work as far as
circumstances would allow we had propositions before us in favor of
from one hundred feet as far as up to ten thousand every inch was
fought for with as much obstinacy as if it were an important breach
that was defended and combinations and conspiracies were as rife as
if we were in the midst of a revolution it was the general idea
that by filling in with dirt a new town might be built wherever the
causeway terminated and fortunes made by an act of parliament the
inhabitants of the island rallied en masse against the causeway
leading one inch from their quarter after it had fairly reached it
and so throughout the entire line monikins battled for what they
called their interests with an obstinacy worthy of heroes

on this great question for it had in truth become of the last
importance by dragging into its consideration most of the leading
measures of the day as well as six or seven of the principal
ordinances of the great national allegory the respective partisans
logically contending that for the time being nothing should
advance a foot in leaplow that did not travel along that causeway
noah determined to take an independent stand this resolution was
not lightly formed for he remained rather undecided until by
waiting a sufficient time he felt quite persuaded that nothing was
to be got by following any other course his god-like luckily was in
the same predicament and everything promised a speedy occasion to
show the world what it was to act on principle and this too in
the middle of a moral eclipse

when the question came to be discussed the landholders along the
first line of the causeway were soon reasoned down by the superior
interests of those who lived on the island the rub was the point
of permitting the work to go any further the islanders manifested
great liberality according to their account of themselves for they
even consented that the causeway should be constructed on the other
marsh to precisely such a distance as would enable any one to go as
near as possible to the hostile quarter without absolutely entering
it to admit the latter they proved to demonstration would be
changing the character of their own island from that of an entrepot
to that of a mere thoroughfare no reasonable monikin could expect
it of them

as the horizontals by some calculation that i never understood had
satisfied themselves it might better answer their purposes to
construct the entire work than to stop anywhere between the two
extremes my duty was luckily on this occasion in exact accordance
with my opinions and as a matter of course i voted this time in
a way of which i could approve noah finding himself a free agent
now made his push for character and took sides with us very
fortunately we prevailed all the beaten interests joining
themselves at the last moment to the weakest side or in other
words to that which was right and leaplow presented the singular
spectacle of having a just enactment passed during the occultation
of the great moral postulate so often named i ought to mention
that i have termed principle a postulate throughout this narrative
simply because it is usually in the dilemma of a disputed
proposition

no sooner was the result known than my worthy colleague came round
to the horizontal side of the house to express his satisfaction
with himself for the course he had just taken he said it was
certainly very convenient and very labor-saving to obey a god-like
and that he got on much better with his charts now he was at liberty
to give his whole mind to the subject but there was suthin he
didn't know what but a sort of stunin'tun feeling in doing what
one thought right after all that caused him to be glad that he had
voted for the whole causeway he did not own any land in leaplow
and therefore he concluded that what he had done he had done for
the best at any rate if he had got nothin by it he had lost
nothin by it and he hoped all would come right in the end the
people of the island it is true had talked pretty fair about what
they would do for those who should sustain their interests but he
had got sick of a currency in promises and fair words at his time
of life didn't go for much and so on the whole he had pretty
much concluded to do as he had done he thought no one could call in
question his vote for he was just as poor and as badly off now he
had voted as he was while he was making up his mind for his part
he shouldn't be ashamed hereafter to look both deacon snort and
the parson in the face when he got home or even miss poke he knew
what it was to have a clean conscience as well as any man for none
so well knew what it was to be without anything as they who had
felt by experience its want his god-like was a very labor-saving
god-like but he had found on inquiry that he came from another
part of the island and that he didn't care a straw which way his
kite-tail noah's manner of pronouncing clientele voted in short
he defied any one to say ought ag'in him this time and he was not
sorry the occasion had offered to show his independence for his
enemies had not been backward in remarking that for some days he
had been little better than a speaking-trumpet to roar out anything
his god-like might wish to have proclaimed he concluded by stating
that he could not hold out much longer without meat of some sort or
other and by begging that i would second a resolution he thought of
offering by which regular substantial rations were to be dealt out
to all the human part of the house the inhumans might live upon
nuts still if they liked them

i remonstrated against the project of the rations made a strong
appeal to his pride by demonstrating that we should be deemed
little better than brutes if we were seen eating flesh and advised
him to cause some of his nuts to be roasted by way of variety
after a good deal of persuasion he promised further abstinence
although he went away with a singularly carnivorous look about the
mouth and an eye that spoke pork in every glance

i was at home the next day busy with my friend the brigadier in
looking over the great national allegory with a view to prevent
falling unwittingly into any more offences of quoting its
opinions when noah burst into the room as rabid as a wolf that had
been bitten by a whole pack of hounds such indeed was in some
measure his situation for according to his statement he had been
baited that morning in the public streets even by every monikin
monikina monikino brat and beggar that he had seen astonished
to hear that my colleague had fallen into this disfavor with his
constitutents i was not slow in asking an explanation

the captain affirmed that the matter was beyond the reach of any
explanation it was in his power to give he had voted in the affair
of the causeway in strict conformity with the dictates of his
conscience and yet here was the whole population accusing him of
bribery nay even the journals had openly flouted at him for what
they called his barefaced and flagrant corruption here the captain
laid before us six or seven of the leading journals of bivouac in
all of which his late vote was treated with quite as little ceremony
as if it had been an unequivocal act of sheep-stealing

i looked at my friend the brigadier for an explanation after
running his eye over the articles in the journals the latter
smiled and cast a look of commiseration at our colleague

you have certainly committed a grave fault here my friend he
said and one that is seldom forgiven in leaplow perhaps i might
say never during the occultation of the great moral postulate as
happens to be the case at present

tell me my sins at once brigadier cried noah with the look of a
martyr and put me out of pain

you have forgotten to display a motive for your stand during the
late hot discussion and as a matter of course the community
ascribes the worst that monikin ingenuity can devise such an
oversight would ruin even a god-like

but my dear mr downright i kindly interposed our colleague
in this instance is supposed to have acted on principle

the brigadier looked up turning his nose into the air like a pup
that has not yet opened its eyes and then intimated that he could
not see the quality i had named it being obscured by the passage of
the orb of pecuniary interest before its disc i now began to
comprehend the case which really was much more grave than at
first i could have believed possible noah himself seemed
staggered for i believe he had fallen on the simple and natural
expedient of inquiring what he himself would have thought of the
conduct of a colleague who had given a vote on a subject so weighty
without exposing a motive

had the captain owned but a foot square of earth at the end of the
causeway observed the brigadier mournfully the matter might be
cleared up but as things are it is beyond dispute a most
unfortunate occurrence

but sir john voted with me and he is no more a free-holder in
leaplow than i am myself

true but sir john voted with the bulk of his political friends

all the horizontals were not in the majority for at least twenty
went on this occasion with the minority

undeniable yet every monikin of them had a visible motive this
owned a lot by the wayside that had houses on the island and
another was the heir of a great proprietor at the same point of the
road each and all had their distinct and positive interests at
stake and not one of them was guilty of so great a weakness as to
leave his cause to be defended by the extravagant pretension of mere
principle

my god-like the greatest of all the riddles absented himself and
did not vote at all

simply because he had no good ground to justify any course he might
take no public monikin can expect to escape censure if he fail to
put his friends in the way of citing some plausible and
intelligible motive for his conduct

how sir cannot a man once in his life do an act without being
bought like a horse or a dog and escape with an inch of character

i shall not take upon myself to say what men can do returned the
brigadier no doubt they manage this affair better than it is
managed here but so far as monikins are concerned there is no
course more certain to involve a total loss of character i may say
so destructive to reputation even for intellect as to act without a
good apparent and substantial motive

in the name of god what is to be done brigadier

i see no other course than to resign your constituents must very
naturally have lost all confidence in you for one who so very
obviously neglects his own interests it cannot be supposed will be
very tenacious about protecting the interests of others if you
would escape with the little character that is left you will
forthwith resign i do not perceive the smallest chance for you by
going through gyration no both public opinions uniformly
condemning the monikin who acts without a pretty obvious as well as
a pretty weighty motive

noah made a merit of necessity and after some further deliberation
between us he signed his name to the following letter to the
speaker which was drawn up on the spot by the brigadier

mr speaker the state of my health obliges me to return the high
political trust which has been confided to me by the citizens of
bivouac into the hands from which it was received in tendering my
resignation i wish to express the great regret with which i part
from colleagues so every way worthy of profound respect and esteem
and i beg you to assure them that wherever fate may hereafter lead
me i shall ever retain the deepest regard for every honorable
member with whom it has been my good fortune to serve the emigrant
interest in particular will ever be the nearest and dearest to my
heart signed

noah poke

the captain did not affix his name to this letter without many heavy
sighs and divers throes of ambition for even a mistaken politician
yields to necessity with regret having changed the word emigrant to
that of immigrunt however he put as good a face as possible on
the matter and wrote the fatal signature he then left the house
declaring he didn't so much begrudge his successor the pay as
nothing but nuts were to be had with the money and that as for
himself he felt as sneaking as he believed was the case with
nebuchadnezzar when he was compelled to get down on all-fours and
eat grass




chapter xxix

some explanations a human appetite a dinner and a bonne bouche


the brigadier and myself remained behind to discuss the general
bearings of this unexpected event

your rigid demand for motives my good sir i remarked reduces
the leaplow political morality very much after all to the level of
the social-stake system of our part of the world

they both depend on the crutch of personal interests it is true
though there is between them the difference of the interests of a
part and of the interests of the whole

and could a part act less commendably than the whole appear to have
acted in this instance

you forget that leaplow just at this moment is under a moral
eclipse i shall not say that these eclipses do not occur often but
they occur quite as frequently in other parts of the region as they
occur here we have three great modes of controlling monikin
affairs viz the one the few and the many 

precisely the same classification exists among men i interrupted

some of our improvements are reflected backward twilight following
as well as preceding the passage of the sun quite coolly returned
the brigadier we think that the many come nearest to balancing the
evil although we are far from believing even them to be immaculate
admitting that the tendencies to wrong are equal in the three
systems which we do not however for we think our own has the
least it is contended that the many escape one great source of
oppression and injustice by escaping the onerous provisions which
physical weakness is compelled to make in order to protect itself
against physical strength

this is reversing a very prevalent opinion among men sir who
usually maintain that the tyranny of the many is the worst sort of
all tyrannies

this opinion has got abroad simply because the lion has not been
permitted to draw his own picture as cruelty is commonly the
concomitant of cowardice so is oppression nine times out of ten the
result of weakness it is natural for the few to dread the many
while it is not natural for the many to dread the few then under
institutions in which the many rule certain great principles that
are founded on natural justice as a matter of course are openly
recognized and it is rare indeed that they do not more or less
influence the public acts on the other hand the control of a few
requires that these same truths should be either mystified or
entirely smothered and the consequence is injustice

but admitting all your maxims brigadier as regards the few and
the many you must yourself allow that here in your beloved leaplow
itself monikins consult their own interests and this after all
is acting on the fundamental principle of the great european social-
stake system

meaning that the goods of the world ought to be the test of
political power by the sad confusion which exists among us at this
moment sir john you must perceive that we are not exactly under
the most salutary of all possible influences i take it that the
great desideratum of society is to be governed by certain great
moral truths the inferences and corollaries of these truths are
principles which come of heaven now agreeably to the monikin
dogmas the love of money is of the earth earthy and at the
first blush it would not seem to be quite safe to receive such an
inducement as the governing motive of one monikin and by a pretty
fair induction it would seem to be equally unwise to admit it for a
good many you will remember also that when none but the rich have
authority they control not only their own property but that of
others who have less your principle supposes that in taking care
of his own the elector of wealth must take care of what belongs to
the rest of the community but our experience shows that a monikin
can be particularly careful of himself and singularly negligent of
his neighbor therefore do we hold that money is a bad foundation
for power

you unsettle everything brigadier without finding a substitute

simply because it is easy to unsettle everything and very difficult
to find substitutes but as respects the base of society i merely
doubt the wisdom of setting up a qualification that we all know
depends on an unsound principle i much fear sir john that so
long as monikins are monikins we shall never be quite perfect and
as to your social-stake system i am of opinion that as society is
composed of all it may be well to hear what all have to say about
its management

many men and i dare say many monikins are not to be trusted
even with the management of their own concerns

very true but it does not follow that other men or other
monikins will lose sight of their own interests on this account if
vested with the right to act as their substitutes you have been
long enough a legislator now to have got some idea how difficult
it is to make even a direct and responsible representative respect
entirely the interests and wishes of his constituents and the fact
will show you how little he will be likely to think of others who
believes that he acts as their master and not as their servant

the amount of all this brigadier is that you have little faith in
monikin disinterestedness in any shape that you believe he who is
intrusted with power will abuse it and therefore you choose to
divide the trust in order to divide the abuses that the love of
money is an earthy quality and not to be confided in as the
controlling power of a state and finally that the social-stake
system is radically wrong inasmuch as it is no more than carrying
out a principle that is in itself defective

my companion gaped like one content to leave the matter there i
wished him a good morning and walked upstairs in quest of noah
whose carnivorous looks had given me considerable uneasiness the
captain was out and after searching for him in the streets for an
hour or two i returned to our abode fatigued and hungry

at no great distance from our own door i met judge people's friend
shorn and dejected and i stopped to say a kind word before going
up the ladder it was quite impossible to see a gentleman whom one
had met in good society and in better fortunes with every hair
shaved from his body his apology for a tail still sore from its
recent amputation and his entire mien expressive of republican
humility without a desire to condole with him i expressed my
regrets therefore as succinctly as possible encouraging him with
the hope of seeing a new covering of down before long but
delicately abstaining from any allusion to the cauda whose loss i
knew was irretrievable to my great surprise however the judge
answered cheerfully discarding for the moment every appearance of
self-abasement and mortification

how is this i cried you are not then miserable

very far from it sir john i never was in better spirits or had
better prospects in my life

i remembered the extraordinary manner in which the brigadier had
saved noah's head and was fully resolved not to be astonished at
any manifestation of monikin ingenuity still i could not forbear
demanding an explanation

why it may seem odd to you sir john to find a politician who is
apparently in the depths of despair really on the eve of a glorious
preferment such however is in fact my case in leaplow humility
is everything the monikin who will take care and repeat
sufficiently often that he is just the poorest devil going that he
is absolutely unfit for even the meanest employment in the land and
in other respects ought to be hooted out of society may very safely
consider himself in a fair way to be elevated to some of the
dignities he declares himself the least fitted to fill

in such a case all he will have to do then will be to make his
choice and denounce himself loudest touching his especial
disqualifications for that very station

you are apt sir john and would succeed if you would only consent
to remain among us said the judge winking

i begin to see into your management after all you are neither
miserable nor ashamed

not the least in the world it is of more importance for monikins
of my calibre to seem to be anything than to be it my fellow-
citizens are usually satisfied with this sacrifice and now
principle is eclipsed nothing is easier

but how happens it judge that one of your surprising dexterity
and agility should be caught tripping i had thought you
particularly expert and infallible in all the gyrations perhaps
the little affair of the cauda has leaked out

the judge laughed in my face

i see you know little of us after all sir john here have we
proscribed caudae as anti-republican both public opinions setting
their faces against them and yet a monikin may wear one abroad a
mile long with impunity if he will just submit to a new dock when he
comes home and swear that he is the most miserable wretch going if
he can throw in a favorable word too touching the leaplow cats and
dogs lord bless you sir they would pardon treason

i begin to comprehend your policy judge if not your polity
leaplow being a popular government it becomes necessary that its
public agents should be popular too now as monikins naturally
delight in their own excellences nothing so disposes them to give
credit to another as his professions that he is worse than
themselves

the judge nodded and grinned

but another word dear sir as you feel yourself constrained to
commend the cats and dogs of leaplow do you belong to that school
of philocats who take their revenge for their amenity to the
quadrupeds by berating their fellow-creatures

the judge started and glanced about him as if he dreaded a thief-
taker then earnestly imploring me to respect his situation he
added in a whisper that the subject of the people was sacred with
him that he rarely spoke of them without a reverence and that his
favorable sentiments in relation to the cats and dogs were not
dependent on any particular merits of the animals themselves but
merely because they were the people's cats and dogs fearful that i
might say something still more disagreeable the judge hastened to
take his leave and i never saw him afterward i make no doubt
however that in good time his hair grew as he grew again into
favor and that he found the means to exhibit the proper length of
tail on all suitable occasions

a crowd in the street now caught my attention on approaching it a
colleague who was there was kind enough to explain its cause

it would seem that certain leaphighers had been travelling in
leaplow and not satisfied with this liberty they had actually
written books concerning things that they had seen and things that
they had not seen as respects the latter neither of the public
opinions was very sensitive although many of them reflected on the
great national allegory and the sacred rights of monikins but as
respects the former there was a very lively excitement these
writers had the audacity to say that the leaplowers had cut off all
their caudae and the whole community was convulsed at an outrage so
unprecedented it was one thing to take such a step and another to
have it proclaimed to the world in books if the leaplowers had no
tails it was clearly their own fault nature had formed them with
tails they had bobbed themselves on a republican principle and no
one's principles ought to be thrown into his face in this rude
manner more especially during a moral eclipse

the dispensers of the essence of lopped tails threatened vengeance
caricaturists were put in requisition some grinned some menaced
some swore and all read

i left the crowd taking the direction of my door again pondering
on this singular state of society in which a peculiarity that had
been deliberately and publicly adopted should give rise to a
sensitiveness of a character so unusual i very well knew that men
are commonly more ashamed of natural imperfections than those which
in a great measure depend on themselves but then men are in their
own estimation at least placed by nature at the head of creation
and in that capacity it is reasonable to suppose they will be
jealous of their natural privileges the present case was rather
leaplow than generic and i could only account for it by supposing
that nature had placed certain nerves in the wrong part of the
leaplow anatomy

on entering the house a strong smell of roasted meat saluted my
nostrils causing a very unphilosophical pleasure to the olfactory
nerves a pleasure which acted very directly too on the gastric
juices of the stomach in plain english i had very sensible
evidence that it was not enough to transport a man to the monikin
region send him to parliament and keep him on nuts for a week to
render him exclusively ethereal i found it was vain to kick
against the pricks the odor of roasted meat was stronger than all
the facts just named and i was fain to abandon philosophy and
surrender to the belly i descended incontinently to the kitchen
guided by a sense no more spiritual than that which directs the
hound in the chase

on opening the door of our refectory such a delicious perfume
greeted the nose that i melted like a romantic girl at the murmur
of a waterfall and losing sight of all the sublime truths so
lately acquired i was guilty of the particular human weakness which
is usually described as having the mouth water

the sealer had quite taken leave of his monikin forbearance and was
enjoying himself in a peculiarly human manner a dish of roasted
meat was lying before him and his eyes fairly glared as he turned
them from me to the viand in a way to render it a little doubtful
whether i was a welcome visitor but that honest old principle of
seamen which never refuses to share equally with an ancient mess-
mate got the better even of his voracity

sit down sir john the captain cried without ceasing to
masticate and make no bones of it to own the fact the latter are
almost as good as the flesh i never tasted a sweeter morsel

i did not wait for a second invitation the reader may be sure and
in less than ten minutes the dish was as clear as a table that had
been swept by harpies as this work is intended for one in which
truth is rigidly respected i shall avow that i do not remember any
cultivation of sentiment which gave me half so much satisfaction as
that short and hurried repast i look back to it even now as to
the very beau ideal of a dinner its fault was in the quantity and
not in quality

i gazed greedily about for more just then i caught a glimpse of a
face that seemed looking at me with melancholy reproach the truth
flashed upon me in a flood of horrible remorse rushing upon noah
like a tiger i seized him by the throat and cried in a voice of
despair

cannibal what hast thou done

loosen your grip sir john we do not relish these hugs at
stunin'tun

wretch thou hast made me the participator of thy crime we have
eaten brigadier downright

loosen sir john or human natur will rebel

monster give up thy unholy repast dost not see a million
reproaches in the eyes of the innocent victim of thy insatiable
appetites

cast off sir john cast off while we are friends i care not if i
have swallowed all the brigadiers in leaplow off hands

never monster until thou disgorgest thy unholy meal

noah could endure no more but seizing me by the throat on the
retaliating principle i soon had some such sensations as one would
be apt to feel if his gullet were in a vice i shall not attempt to
describe very minutely the miracle that followed hanging ought to
be an effectual remedy for many delusions for in my case the
bowstring i was under certainly did wonders in a very short time
gradually the whole scene changed first came a mist then a
vertigo and finally as the captain relaxed his hold objects
appeared in new forms and instead of being in our lodgings in
bivouac i found myself in my old apartment in the rue de rivoli
paris

king exclaimed noah who stood before me red in the face with
exertion this is no boy's play and if it's to be repeated i
shall use a lashing where would be the harm sir john if a man had
eaten a monkey

astonishment kept me mute every object just as i had left it the
morning we started for london on our way to leaphigh was there a
table in the centre of the room was covered with sheets of paper
closely written over which on examination i found contained this
manuscript as far as the last chapter both the captain and myself
were attired as usual i a la parisien and he a la stunin'tun a
small ship very ingeniously made and very accurately rigged lay
on the floor with walrus written on her stern as my bewildered
eye caught a glimpse of this vessel noah informed me that having
nothing to do except to look after my welfare a polite way of
characterizing his ward over my person as i afterward found he
had employed his leisure in constructing the toy

all was inexplicable there was really the smell of meat i had also
that peculiar sensation of fulness which is apt to succeed a dinner
and a dish well filled with bones was in plain view i took up one
of the latter in order to ascertain its genus the captain kindly
informed me that it was the remains of a pig which had cost him a
great deal of trouble to obtain as the french viewed the act of
eating a pig as very little less heinous than the act of eating a
child suspicions began to trouble me and i now turned to look for
the head and reproachful eye of the brigadier

the head was where i had just before seen it visible over the top
of a trunk but it was so far raised as to enable me to see that it
was still planted on its shoulders a second look enabled me to
distinguish the meditative philosophical countenance of dr
reasono who was still in the hussar-jacket and petticoat though
being in the house he had very properly laid aside the spanish hat
with bedraggled feathers

a movement followed in the antechamber and a hurried conversation
in a low earnest tone succeeded the captain disappeared and
joined the speakers i listened intently but could not catch any of
the intonations of a dialect founded on the decimal principle
presently the door opened and dr etherington stood before me

the good divine regarded me long and earnestly tears filled his
eyes and stretching out both hands towards me he asked

do you know me jack

know you dear sir why should i not

and do you forgive me dear boy

for what sir i am sure i have most reason to demand your pardon
for a thousand follies

ah the letter the unkind the inconsiderate letter

i have not had a letter from you sir in a twelvemonth the last
was anything but unkind

though anna wrote it was at my dictation

i passed a hand over my brow and had dawnings of the truth

anna

is here in paris and miserable most miserable on your
account

every particle of monikinity that was left in my system instantly
gave way to a flood of human sensations

let me fly to her dear sir a moment is an age

not just yet my boy we have much to say to each other nor is she
in this hotel to-morrow when both are better prepared you shall
meet

add never to separate sir and i will be patient as a lamb

never to separate i believe it will be better to say

i hugged my venerable guardian and found a delicious relief from a
most oppressive burden of sensations in a flow of tears

dr etherington soon led me into a calmer tone of mind in the
course of the day many matters were discussed and settled i was
told that captain poke had been a good nurse though in a sealing
fashion and that the least i could do was to send him back to
stunin'tun free of cost this was agreed to and the worthy but
dogmatical mariner was promised the means of fitting out a new
debby and dolly

these philosophers had better be presented to some academy
observed the doctor smiling as he pointed to the family of amiable
strangers being already f u d g es and h o a xs mr
reasono in particular is unfit for ordinary society

do with them as you please my more than father let the poor
animals however be kept from physical suffering

attention shall be paid to all their wants both physical and
moral

and in a day or two we shall proceed to the rectory

the day after to-morrow if you have strength

and to-morrow

anna will see you

and the next day

nay not quite so soon jack but the moment we think you perfectly
restored she shall share your fortunes for the remainder of your
common probation




chapter xxx

explanations a leave-taking love confessions but no penitence


a night of sweet repose left me refreshed and with a pulse that
denoted less agitation than on the preceding day i awoke early had
a bath and sent for captain poke to take his coffee with me before
we parted for it had been settled the previous evening that he
was to proceed towards stunin'tun forthwith my old messmate
colleague co-adventurer and fellow-traveller was not slow in
obeying the summons i confess his presence was a comfort to me for
i did not like looking at objects that had been so inexplicably
replaced before my eyes unsupported by the countenance of one who
had gone through so many grave scenes in my company

this has been a very extraordinary voyage of ours captain poke i
remarked after the worthy sealer had swallowed sixteen eggs an
omelet seven cotelettes and divers accessories do you think of
publishing your private journal

why in my opinion sir john the less that either of us says of
the v'y'ge the better

and why so we have had the discoveries of columbus cook
vancouver and hudson why not those of captain poke

to own the truth we sealers do not like to speak of our cruising
grounds and as for these monikins after all what are they good
for a thousand of them wouldn't make a quart of ile and by all
accounts their fur is worth next to nothin

do you account their philosophy for nothing and their
jurisprudence you who were so near losing your head and who did
actually lose your tail by the axe of the executioner

noah placed a hand behind him fumbling about the seat of reason
with evident uneasiness satisfied that no harm had been done he
very coolly placed half a muffin in what he called his provision
hatchway

you will give me this pretty model of our good old walrus
captain

take it o heaven's sake sir john and good luck to you with it
you who give me a full-grown schooner will be but poorly paid with
a toy

it's as like the dear old craft as one pea is like another

i dare say it may be i never knew a model that hadn't suthin of
the original in it

well my good shipmate we must part you know i am to go and see
the lady who is soon to be my wife and the diligence will be ready
to take you to havre before i return

god bless you sir john god bless you noah blew his nose till it
rung like a french horn i thought his little coals of eyes were
glittering too more than common most probably with moisture
you're a droll navigator and make no more of the ice than a colt
makes of a rail but though the man at the wheel is not always awake
the heart seldom sleeps

when the debby and dolly is fairly in the water you will do me
the pleasure of letting me know it

count on me sir john before we part i have however a small
favor to ask

name it

here noah drew out of his pocket a sort of basso relievo carved in
pine it represented neptune armed with a harpoon instead of a
trident the captain always contending that the god of the seas
should never carry the latter but that in its place he should be
armed either with the weapon he had given him or with a boat-hook
on the right of neptune was an english gentleman holding out a bag
of guineas on the other was a female who i was told represented
the goddess of liberty while it was secretly a rather flattering
likeness of miss poke the face of neptune was supposed to have some
similitude to that of her husband the captain with that modesty
which is invariably the companion of merit in the arts asked
permission to have a copy of this design placed on the schooner's
stern it would have been churlish to refuse such a compliment and
i now offered noah my hand as the time for parting had arrived the
sealer grasped me rather tightly and seemed disposed to say more
than adieu

you are going to see an angel sir john

how do you know anything of miss etherington

i should be as blind as an old bumboat else during our late
v'y'ge i saw her often

this is strange but there is evidently something on your mind my
friend speak freely

well then sir john talk of anything but of our v'y'ge to the
dear crittur i do not think she is quite prepared yet to hear of
all the wonders we saw

i promised to be prudent and the captain shaking me cordially by
the hand finally wished me farewell there were some rude touches
of feeling in his manner which reacted on certain chords in my own
system and he had been gone several minutes before i recollected
that it was time to go to the hotel de castile too impatient to
wait for a carriage i flew along the streets on foot believing
that my own fiery speed would outstrip the zigzag movement of a
fiacre or a cabriolet tie flace

dr etherington met me at the door of his appartement and led me to
an inner room without speaking here he stood gazing for some time
in my face with paternal concern

she expects you jack and believes that you rang the bell

so much the better dear sir let us not lose a moment let me fly
and throw myself at her feet and implore her pardon

for what my good boy

for believing that any social stake can equal that which a man
feels in the nearest dearest ties of earth

the excellent rector smiled but he wished to curb my impatience

you have already every stake in society sir john goldencalf he
answered assuming the air which human beings have by a general
convention settled shall be dignified that any reasonable man can
desire the large fortune left by your late father raises you in
this respect to the height of the richest in the land and now that
you are a baronet no one will dispute your claim to participate in
the councils of the nation it would perhaps be better did your
creation date a century or two nearer the commencement of the
monarchy but in this age of innovations we must take things as
they are and not as we might wish to have them

i rubbed my forehead for the doctor had incidentally thrown out an
embarrassing idea

on your principle my dear sir society would be obliged to begin
with its great-grandfathers to qualify itself for its own
government

pardon me jack if i have said anything disagreeable no doubt all
will come right in heaven anna will be uneasy at our delay

this suggestion drove all recollection of the good rector's social-
stake system which was exactly the converse of the social-stake
system of my late ancestor quite out of my head springing forward
i gave him reason to see that he would have no farther trouble in
changing the subject when we had passed an antechamber he pointed
to a door and admonishing me to be prudent withdrew

my hand trembled as it touched the door-knob but the lock yielded
anna was standing in the middle of the room she had heard my
footsteps an image of womanly loveliness womanly faith and
womanly feeling by a desperate effort she was however mistress
of her emotions though her pure soul seemed willing to fly to meet
me she obviously restrained the impulse in order to spare my
nerves

dear jack and both her soft white pretty little hands met me
as i eagerly approached

anna dearest anna i covered the rosy fingers with kisses

let us be tranquil jack and if possible endeavor to be
reasonable too

if i thought this could really cost one habitually discreet as you
an effort anna

one habitually discreet as i is as likely to feel strongly on
meeting an old friend as another

i think it would make me perfectly happy could i see thee weep

as if waiting only for this hint anna burst into a flood of tears
i was frightened for her sobs became hysterical and convulsed
those precious sentiments which had been so long imprisoned in her
gentle bosom obtained the mastery and i was well paid for my
selfishness by experiencing an alarm little less violent than her
own outpouring of feeling

touching the incidents emotions and language of the next half
hour it is not my intention to be very communicative anna was
ingenuous unreserved and if i might judge by the rosy blushes
that suffused her sweet face and the manner in which she extricated
herself from my protecting arms i believe i must add she deemed
herself indiscreet in that she had been so unreserved and ingenuous

we can now converse more calmly jack the dear creature resumed
after she had erased the signs of emotion from her cheeks more
calmly if not more sensibly

the wisdom of solomon is not half so precious as the words i have
just heard and as for the music of spheres 

it is a melody that angels only enjoy

and art not thou an angel

no jack only a poor confiding girl one instinct with the
affections and weaknesses of her sex and one whom it must be your
part to sustain and direct if we begin by calling each other by
these superhuman epithets we may awake from the delusion sooner
than if we commence with believing ourselves to be no other than
what we really are i love you for your kind excellent and
generous heart jack and as for these poetical beings they are
rather proverbial i believe for having no hearts at all

as anna mildly checked my exaggeration of language after ten years
of marriage i am unwilling to admit there was any exaggeration of
idea she placed her little velvet hand in mine again smiling away
all the severity of the reproof

of one thing i think you may rest perfectly assured dear girl i
resumed after a moment's reflection all my old opinions
concerning expansion and contraction are radically changed i have
carried out the principle of the social-stake system in the extreme
and cannot say that i have been at all satisfied with its success
at this moment i am the proprietor of vested interests which are
scattered over half the world so far from finding that i love my
kind any more for all these social stakes i am compelled to see
that the wish to protect one is constantly driving me into acts of
injustice against all the others there is something wrong depend
on it anna in the old dogmas of political economists

i know little of these things sir john but to one ignorant as
myself it would appear that the most certain security for the
righteous exercise of power is to be found in just principles

if available beyond a question they who contend that the debased
and ignorant are unfit to express their opinions concerning the
public weal are obliged to own that they can only be restrained by
force now as knowledge is power their first precaution is to keep
them ignorant and then they quote this very ignorance with all its
debasing consequences as an argument against their participating in
authority with themselves i believe there can be no safe medium
between a frank admission of the whole principle 

you should remember dear goldencalf that this is a subject on
which i know but little it ought to be sufficient for us that we
find things as they are if change is actually necessary we should
endeavor to effect it with prudence and a proper regard to justice

anna while kindly leading me back from my speculations looked both
anxious and pained

true true i hurriedly rejoined for a world would not tempt me
to prolong her suffering for a moment i am foolish and forgetful
to be talking thus at such a moment but i have endured too much to
be altogether unmindful of ancient theories i thought it might be
grateful to you at least to know anna that i have ceased to look
for happiness in my affections for all and am only so much the
better disposed to turn in search of it to one

to love our neighbor as ourself is the latest and highest of the
divine commands the dear girl answered looking a thousand times
more lovely than ever for my conclusion was very far from being
displeasing to her i do not know that this object is to be
attained by centring in our persons as many of the goods of life as
possible but i do think jack that the heart which loves one
truly will be so much the better disposed to entertain kind
feelings towards all others

i kissed the hand she had given me and we now began to talk a
little more like people of the world concerning our movements the
interview lasted an hour longer when the heaven you never yet
were so unkind to one who was offensive much less could you
willingly have plotted this cruelty to one you regard

anna could no longer control herself but her cheeks were wetted
with the usual signs of feeling in her sex then smiling in the
midst of this little outbreaking of womanly sensibility her
countenance became playful and radiant

that letter ought not to be altogether proscribed neither jack
had it not been written you would never have visited leaphigh nor
leaplow nor have seen any of those wonderful spectacles which are
here recorded

the dear creature laid her hand on a roll of manuscript which she
had just returned to me after its perusal at the same time her
face flushed as vivid and transient feelings are reflected from the
features of the innocent and ingenuous and she made a faint effort
to laugh

i passed a hand over my brow for whenever this subject is alluded
to between us i invariably feel that there is a species of
mistiness in and about the region of thought i was not displeased
however for i knew that a heart which loved so truly would not
willingly cause me pain nor would one habitually so gentle and
considerate utter a syllable that she might have reason to think
would seriously displease

hadst thou been with me love that journey would always be
remembered as one of the pleasantest events of my life for while
it had its perils and its disagreeables it had also its moments of
extreme satisfaction

you will never be an adept in political saltation john

perhaps not but here is a document that will render it less
necessary than formerly

i threw her a packet which had been received that morning from town
by a special messenger but of whose contents i had not yet spoken
anna was too young a wife to open it without an approving look from
my fond eye on glancing over its contents she perceived that i was
raised to the house of peers by the title of viscount householder
the purchase of three more boroughs and the influence of my old
friend lord pledge had done it all

the sweet girl looked pleased for i believe it is in female nature
to like to be a viscountess but throwing herself into my arms she
protested that her joy was at my elevation and not at her own

i owed you this effort anna as some acknowledgment for your faith
and disinterestedness in the affair of lord m'dee

and yet jack he had neither high cheek-bones nor red hair and
his accent was such as might please a girl less capricious than
myself

this was said playfully and coquettishly but in a way to make me
feel how near folly would have been to depriving me of a treasure
had the heart i so much prized been less ingenuous and pure i drew
the dear creature to my bosom as if afraid my rival might yet rob
me of her possession anna looked up smiling through her tears
and making an effort to be calm she said in a voice so smothered
as to prove how delicate she felt the subject to be 

we will speak seldom of this journey dear john and try to think
of the long and dark journey which is yet before us we will speak
of it however for there should be nothing totally concealed
between us

i kissed her serene and humid eyes and repeated what she had just
said syllable for syllable anna has not been unmindful of her
words for rarely indeed has she touched on the past and then
oftener in allusion to her own sorrows than in reference to my
impressions

but while the subject of my voyage to the monikin region is in a
measure forbidden between me and my wife there exists no such
restraint as between me and other people the reader may like to
know therefore what effect this extraordinary adventure has left
on my mind after an interval of ten years

there have been moments when the whole has appeared a dream but on
looking back and comparing it with other scenes in which i have
been an actor i cannot perceive that this is not quite as indelibly
stamped on my memory as those the facts themselves moreover are
so very like what i see daily in the course of occurrence around me
that i have come to the conclusion i did go to leaphigh in the way
related and that i must have been brought back during the temporary
insanity of a fever i believe therefore that there are such
countries as leaphigh and leaplow and after much thought i am of
opinion that great justice has here been done to the monikin
character in general

the result of much meditation on what i witnessed has been to
produce sundry material changes in my former opinions and to
unsettle even many of the notions in which i may be said to have
been born and bred in order to consume as little of the reader's
time as possible i shall set down a summary of my conclusions and
then take my leave of him with many thanks for his politeness in
reading what i have written before completing my task in this way
however it will be well to add a word on the subject of one or two
of my fellow-travellers

i never could make up my mind relating to the fact whether we did or
did not actually eat brigadier downright the flesh was so savory
and it tasted so delicious after a week of philosophical meditation
on nuts and the recollection of its pleasures is so very vivid
that i am inclined to think nothing but a good material dinner could
have left behind it impressions so lively i have had many
melancholy thoughts on this subject especially in november but
observing that men are constantly devouring each other in one shape
or another i endeavor to make the best of it and to persuade
myself that a slight difference in species may exonerate me from the
imputation of cannibalism

i often get letters from captain poke he is not very explicit on
the subject of our voyage it is true but on the whole i have
decided that the little ship he constructed was built on the model
of and named after our own walrus instead of our own walrus being
built on the model of and named after the little ship constructed
by captain poke i keep the latter therefore to show my friends as
a proof of what i tell them knowing the importance of visible
testimony with ordinary minds

as for bob and the mates i never heard any more of them the former
most probably continued a kickee until years and experience
enabled him to turn the tables on humanity when as is usually the
case with christians he would be very likely to take up the
business of a kicker with so much the greater zeal on account of
his early sufferings

to conclude my own adventures and observations lead to the
following inferences viz

that every man loves liberty for his own sake and very few for the
sake of other people

that moral saltation is very necessary to political success at
leaplow and quite probably in many other places

that civilization is very arbitrary meaning one thing in france
another thing at leaphigh and still a third in dorsetshire

that there is no sensible difference between motives in the polar
region and motives anywhere else

that truth is a comparative and local property being much
influenced by circumstances particularly by climate and by
different public opinions

that there is no portion of human wisdom so select and faultless
that it does not contain the seeds of its own refutation

that of all the ocracies aristocracy and democracy included
hypocrisy is the most flourishing

that he who is in the clutches of the law may think himself lucky if
he escape with the loss of his tail

that liberty is a convertible term which means exclusive privileges
in one country no privileges in another and inclusive privileges
in all

that religion is a paradox in which self-denial and humility are
proposed as tenets in direct contradiction to every man's senses

that phrenology and caudology are sister sciences one being quite
as demonstrable as the other and more too

that philosophy sound principles and virtue are really delightful
but after all that they are no more than so many slaves of the
belly a man usually preferring to eat his best friend to starving

that a little wheel and a great wheel are as necessary to the motion
of a commonweath as to the motion of a stage-coach and that what
this gains in periphery that makes up in activity on the rotatory
principle

that it is one thing to have a king another to have a throne and
another to have neither

that the reasoning which is drawn from particular abuses is no
reasoning for general uses

that in england if we did not use blinkers our cattle would break
our necks whereas in germany we travel at a good pace allowing
the horse the use of his eyes and in naples we fly without even a
bit

that the converse of what has just been said of horses is true of
men in the three countries named

that occultations of truth are just as certain as the aurora boreal
is and quite as easily accounted for

that men who will not shrink from the danger and toil of penetrating
the polar basin will shrink from the trouble of doing their own
thinking and put themselves like captain poke under the convoy of
a god-like

that all our wisdom is insufficient to protect us from frauds one
outwitting us by gyrations and flapjacks and another by adding new
joints to the cauda

that men are not very scrupulous touching the humility due to god
but are so tenacious of their own privileges in this particular
they will confide in plausible rogues rather than in plain-dealing
honesty

that they who rightly appreciate the foregoing facts are people's
friends and become the salt of the earth yea even the most
patriotic patriots

that it is fortunate all will come right in heaven for it is
certain too much goes wrong on earth

that the social-stake system has one distinctive merit that of
causing the owners of vested rights to set their own interests in
motion while those of their fellow-citizens must follow as a
matter of course though perhaps a little clouded by the dust raised
by their leaders

that he who has an anna has the best investment in humanity and
that if he has any repetition of his treasure it is better still

that money commonly purifies the spirit as wine quenches thirst and
therefore it is wise to commit all our concerns to the keeping of
those who have most of it

that others seldom regard us in the same light we regard ourselves
witness the manner in which dr reasono converted me from a
benefactor into the travelling tutor of prince bob

that honors are sweet even to the most humble as is shown by the
satisfaction of noah in being made a lord high admiral

that there is no such stimulant of humanity as a good moneyed stake
in its advancement

that though the mind may be set on a very improper and base object
it will not fail to seek a good motive for its justification few
men being so hardened in any grovelling passion that they will not
endeavor to deceive themselves as well as their neighbors

that academies promote good fellowship in knowledge and good
fellowship in knowledge promotes f u d g es and h o a
xs

that a political rolling-pin though a very good thing to level
rights and privileges is a very bad thing to level houses temples
and other matters that might be named

that the system of governing by proxy is more extended than is
commonly supposed in one country a king resorting to its use and
in another the people

that there is no method by which a man can be made to covet a tail
so sure as by supplying all his neighbors and excluding him by an
especial edict

that the perfection of consistency in a nation is to dock itself at
home while its foreign agents furiously cultivate caudae abroad

that names are far more useful than things being more generally
understood less liable to objections of greater circulation
besides occupying much less room

that ambassadors turn the back of the throne outward aristocrats
draw a crimson curtain before it and a king sits on it

that nature has created inequalities in men and things and as
human institutions are intended to prevent the strong from
oppressing the weak ergo the laws should encourage natural
inequalities as a legitimate consequence

that moreover the laws of nature having made one man wise and
another man foolish this strong and that weak human laws should
reverse it all by making another man wise and one man foolish that
strong and this weak on this conclusion i obtained a peerage

that god-likes are commonly riddles and riddles with many people
are as a matter of course god-likes that the expediency of
establishing the base of society on a principle of the most sordid
character one that is denounced by the revelations of god and
proved to be insufficient by the experience of man may at least be
questioned without properly subjecting the dissenter to the
imputation of being a sheep-stealer

that we seldom learn moderation under any political excitement
until forty thousand square miles of territory are blown from
beneath our feet

that it is not an infallible sign of great mental refinement to
bespatter our fellow-creatures while every nerve is writhing in
honor of our pigs our cats our stocks and our stones

that select political wisdom like select schools propagates much
questionable knowledge

that the whole people is not infallible neither is a part of the
people infallible

that love for the species is a godlike and pure sentiment but the
philanthropy which is dependent on buying land by the square mile
and selling it by the square foot is stench in the nostrils of the
just

that one thoroughly imbued with republican simplicity invariably
squeezes himself into a little wheel in order to show how small he
can become at need

that habit is invincible an esquimaux preferring whale's blubber to
beefsteak a native of the gold coast cherishing his tom-tom before
a band of music and certain travelled countrymen of our own saying
commend me to the english skies

that arranging a fact by reason is embarrassing and admits of
cavilling while adapting a reason to a fact is a very natural
easy every-day and sometimes necessary process

that what men affirm for their own particular interests they will
swear to in the end although it should be a proposition as much
beyond the necessity of an oath as that black is white

that national allegories exist everywhere the only difference
between them arising from gradations in the richness of
imaginations

and finally 

that men have more of the habits propensities dispositions
cravings antics gratitude flapjacks and honesty of monikins
than is generally known

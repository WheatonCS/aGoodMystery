nick of the woods




chapter i


the sun of an august afternoon was yet blazing upon the rude
palisades and equally rude cabins of one of the principal stations in
lincoln county when a long train of emigrants issuing from the
southern forest wound its way over the clearings and among the waving
maize-fields that surrounded the settlement and approached the chief
gate of its enclosure

the party was numerous consisting perhaps of seven or eight score
individuals in all men women and children the last bearing that
proportion to the others in point of numbers usually found in a
borderer's family and thus with the help of pack-horses cattle and a
few negroes the property of the more wealthy emigrants scattered here
and there throughout the assemblage giving to the whole train the
appearance of an army or moving village of vandals in quest of some new
home to be won with the edge of the sword of the whole number there were
at least fifty well-armed some of these however being striplings of
fourteen and in one or two instances even of twelve who balanced the
big rifle on their shoulders or sustained it over their saddle-bows
with all the gravity and dignity of grown warriors while some few of
the negroes were provided with the same formidable weapons in fact the
dangers of the journey through the wilderness required that every
individual of a party should be well armed who was at all capable of
bearing arms and this was a kind of capacity which necessity instilled
into the american frontiersman in the earliest infancy

of this armed force such as it was the two principal divisions all
well mounted or at least provided with horses which they rode or not
as the humour seized them were distributed in military order on the
front and in the rear while scouts leading in the van and flanking
parties beating the woods on either side where the nature of the
country permitted indicated still further the presence of a martial
spirit on the part of the leaders the women and children stowed
carefully away for the most part with other valuable chattels on the
backs of pack-horses were mingled with droves of cattle in the centre
many of which were made to bear burdens as well as the horses of wheeled
carriages there was not a single one in the whole train the difficulties
of the road which was a mere bridle-path being such that they were
never at that early day attempted to be brought into the country
unless when wafted in boats down the ohio

thus marshalled and stealing from the depth of the forest into the
clearings around the station there was something in the appearance of
the train wild singular and striking the tall and robust frames of
the men wrapped in blanket coats and hunting-frocks some of which
where the wearers were young and of gallant tempers were profusely
decked with fringes of yellow green and scarlet the gleam of their
weapons and the tramp of their horses gave a warlike air to the whole
typical it might be supposed of the sanguinary struggle by which alone
the desert was to be wrung from the wandering barbarian while the
appearance of their families with their domestic beasts and the
implements of husbandry was in harmony with what might be supposed the
future destinies of the land when peaceful labour should succeed to the
strife of conquest

the exiles were already in the heart of their land of promise and many
within view of the haven where they were to end their wanderings smiles
of pleasure lighted their wayworn countenances as they beheld the waving
fields of maize and the gleam of the distant cabins and their
satisfaction was still further increased when the people of the station
catching sight of them rushed out some mounted and others on foot to
meet them uttering loud shouts of welcome such as in that day greeted
every band of new comers and adding to the clamour of the reception a
feu-de-joie which they fired in honour of the numbers and martial
appearance of the present company the salutation was requited and the
stirring hurrahs returned by the travellers most of whom pressed
forward to the van in disorder eager to take part in the merry-making
ere it was over or perhaps to seek for friends who had preceded them in
the journey through the wilderness such friends were in many instances
found and their loud and affectionate greetings were mingled with the
scarce less cordial welcomes extended by the colonists even to the
unknown stranger such was the reception of the emigrants at that period
and in that country where men were united together by a sense of common
danger and where every armed visitor besides being an accession to the
strength of the colonists brought with him such news of absent friends
and still remembered homes as was sure to recommend him to favour

the only individual who on this occasion of rejoicing preserved a
melancholy countenance and who instead of riding forward like the
others to shake hands with the people of the station betrayed an
inclination to avoid their greetings altogether was a young man who
from the position he occupied in the band and from other causes was
entitled to superior attention with the rank and nominal title of
second-captain a dignity conferred upon him by his companions he was
in reality the commander of the party the ostensible leader being
although a man of good repute on the virginia border entirely wanting in
the military reputation and skill which the other had acquired in the
armies of the republics and of which the value was fully appreciated
when danger first seemed to threaten the exiles on their march he was a
youth of scarce twenty-three years of age but five of those years had
been passed in camps and battles and the labours passions and
privations of his profession had antedated the period of manhood a frame
tall and athletic a countenance which although retaining the smoothness
and freshness of youth was yet marked with the manly gravity and
decision of mature life added in appearance at least six years to his
age he wore a hunting-frock of the plainest green colour with cap and
leggings of leather such as were worn by many of the poorest or least
pretending exiles like whom also he bore a rifle on his shoulder with
the horn and other equipments of a hunter there was little therefore
to distinguish him at the first view from among his companions although
his erect military bearing and the fine blooded bay horse which he rode
would have won him more than a passing look the holsters at his
saddle-bow and the sabre at his side were weapons not indeed very
generally worn by frontiersmen but still common enough to prevent their
being regarded as badges of rank

with this youthful officer the rear-guard which he commanded having
deserted him to press forward to the van there remained only three
persons two of whom were negro slaves both mounted and armed that
followed at a little distance behind leading thrice their number of
pack-horses the third was a female who rode closely at his side the
rein of her pony being in fact grasped in his hand though he looked as
if scarce conscious that he held it a degree of insensibility that
would have spoken little in his favour to an observer for his companion
was both young and beautiful and watched his moody countenance on her
part with looks of the most anxious and affectionate interest her
riding-habit chosen like his own garments with more regard to
usefulness than beauty and perhaps somewhat the worse for its encounters
with the wind and forest could not conceal the graceful figure it
defended nor had the sunbeam though it had darkened the bright
complexion exposed to its summer fury during a journey of more than six
weeks robbed her fair visage of a single charm there was in the
general cast of features a sufficient resemblance between the two to
indicate near relationship although it was plain that the gloom seated
upon the brow of her kinsmen as if a permanent characteristic was an
unwelcome and unnatural visitant on her own the clear blue eye the
golden locks floating over her temples the ruddy cheek and look of
seventeen and generally the frank and open character of her
expression betokened a spirit too joyous and elastic to indulge in those
dark anticipations of the future or mournful recollections of the past
which clouded the bosom of her relative and well for her that such was
the cheerful temper of her mind for it was manifest from her whole
appearance that her lot as originally cast must have been among the
gentle the refined and the luxurious and that she was now for the
first time exposed to discomfort hardship and suffering among
companions who however kind and courteous of conduct were unpolished
in their habits conversation and feelings and in every other respect
unfitted to be her associates

she looked upon the face of her kinsman and seeing that it grew the
darker and gloomier the nearer they approached the scene of rejoicing
she laid her hand upon his arm and murmured softly and affectionately 

roland cousin brother what is it that disturbs you will you not
ride forward and salute the good people that are making us welcome

us muttered the young man with a bitter voice who is there on
earth edith to welcome us where shall we look for the friends and
kinsfolk that the meanest of the company are finding among yonder noisy
barbarians

you do them injustice roland said the maiden yesternight we had
experience at the station we left that these wild people of the woods do
not confine their welcomes to kinsmen kinder and more hospitable people
do not exist in the world

it is not that edith said the young man i were but a brute to doubt
their hospitality but look edith we are in kentucky almost at our
place of refuge yonder hovels lowly mean and wretched are they the
mansions that should shelter the child of my father's brother yonder
people the outcasts of our borders the poor the rude the savage but
one degree elevated above the indians with whom they contend are they
the society from whom edith forrester should choose her friends

they are said edith firmly and edith forrester asks none better
in such a cabin as these and if need be in one still more humble
she is content to pass her life and dream that she is still in the
house of her fathers from such people too she will choose her friends
knowing that even among the humblest of them there are many worthy of
her regard and affection what have we to mourn in the world we have
left behind us we are the last of our name and race fortune has left
us nothing to regret my only relative on earth saving yourself
roland saving yourself my cousin my brother her lip quivered and
for a moment her eyes were filled with tears my only other living
relation resides in this wilderness-land and she tenderly nurtured as
myself finds in it enough to engage her thoughts and secure her
happiness why then should not i why should not you trust me dear
roland i should myself be as happy as the day is long could i only know
that you did not grieve for me

i cannot but choose it said roland it is to me you owe the loss of
fortune and your present banishment from the world

say not so roland for it is not true no i never can believe that our
poor uncle would have carried his resentment for such a cause so far
but supposing that he could and granting that all were as you say i am
prouder to be the poor cousin of roland forrester who has bled in the
battles of his country than if i were the rich and courted kinswoman of
one who had betrayed the memory of his father

you are at least an angel said the youth and i am but a villain to
say or do anything to give you pain farewell then to fell-hallow to old
james river and all if you can forget these things edith so will i
at all events i will try

now said edith you talk like my true cousin

well edith the world is before us and shame be upon me if i who
have health strength and youth to back my ambition cannot provide you
a refuge and a home i will leave you for a while in the hands of this
good aunt at the falls and then with old emperor there for my adjutant
and sam for my rank and file i will plunge into the forest and scatter
it as i have seen a band of tories scattered by my old major who by the
bye is only three years older than myself henry lee not many years
back then when i have built me a house furrowed my acres with my
martial plough-share for to that it appears my sword must come and
reaped my harvest with my own hands it will be hard work to beat my
horse-pistols into a sickle then edith 

then roland said the maiden with a smile and a tear if you should
still remember your poor cousin it will not be hard to persuade her to
follow you to your retreat to share your fortunes of good and of evil
and to love you better in your adversity than she ever expected to love
you in your prosperity

spoken like my true edith said the young officer whose melancholy
fled before her soft accents as the evil spirit of saul before the
tinklings of the jewish harp spoken like my true edith for whom i
promise if fate smile upon my exertions to rear a new fell-hallow on
the banks of the ohio in which i will be myself the first to forget
that on james river and now edith let us ride forward and meet yon gay
looking giant whom from his bustling demeanour and fresh jerkin i
judge to be the commander of the station the redoubtable colonel bruce
himself

as he spoke the individual thus alluded to separating himself from the
throng galloped up to the speaker and displayed a person which excited
the envy even of the manly looking forrester he was a man of at least
fifty years but as hale as one of thirty without a single gray hair to
deform the beauty of his raven locks which fell down in masses nearly to
his shoulders his stature was colossal and the proportions of his frame
as just as they were gigantic so that there was much in his appearance
of real native majesty nothing in fact could be well imagined more
truly striking and grand than his appearance as seen at the first
glance though the second revealed a lounging indifference of carriage
amounting at times to something like awkwardness and uncouthness which
a little detracted from the effect such men were oft-times in those
days sent from among the mountain counties of virginia to amaze the
lesser mortals of the plains who regarded them as the genii of the
forest and almost looked as was said of the victor of the kenhawa
himself of the race to see the earth tremble beneath their footsteps
with a spirit corresponding to his frame he would have been the nimrod
that he seemed but nature had long before extinguished the race of
demigods and the worthy commander of the station was not of them he was
a mortal man distinguished by little save his exterior from other
mortal men and from the crowd of settlers who had followed him from the
fortress he wore it is true a new and jaunty hunting-shirt of dressed
deer-skin as yellow as gold and fringed and furbelowed with shreds of
the same substance dyed as red as blood-root could make them but was
otherwise to the view a plain yeoman endowed with those gifts of mind
only which were necessary to his station but with the virtues which are
alike common to forest and city courage and hospitality however were
then hardly accounted virtues being too universal to be distinguished as
such and courtesy was equally native to the independent borderer

footnote gen andrew lewis

he shook the young officer heartily by the hand a ceremony which he
instantly repeated with the fair edith and giving them to understand
that he claimed them as his own especial guests insisted with much
honest warmth that old companionship in arms with one of their late
nearest and dearest kinsmen had given him a double right to do so 

you must know said he the good old major your uncle the brave
old major roly as we called him major roland forrester well
k-yaptin well young lady my first battle war fought under his
command and an excellent commander he war it war on the bloody
monongahela whar the frenchmen and injuns trounced us so promiskous
perhaps you've h'ard him tell of big tom bruce for so they called me
then i war a copporal in the first company of rangers that crossed the
river lord how the world is turning upside down i war a copporal
then and now i'm a k-yunnel a greater man in commission than war ever
my old major and the lord he nows i thought my old major forrester
war the greatest man in all virginnee next to the g-yovernor and
k-yunnel george washington well you must know we marched up the
g'yully that runs from the river and bang went the savages g-yuns
and smash went their hatchets and it came to close quarters a regular
rough-and-tumble hard scratch and so i war a-head of the major and the
major war behind and the fight had made him as vicious as a wild cat
and he war hungry for a shot and so says he to me for i war right afore
him git out of my way you damned big rascal till i git a crack at
em and so i got out of his way for i war mad at being called a damned
big rascal especially as i war doing my best and covering him from
mischief besides well as soon as i jumped out of his way bang went his
piece and bang went another let fly by an injun down went the major
shot right through the hips slam-bang and so said i major for i
warn't well over my passion if you'd a taken things easy i'd a a
stopped that slug for you and so says he bang away you big fool and
don't stand talking and so he swounded away and that made me vicious
too and i killed two of the red niggurs before you could say jack
robinson just by way of satisfaction for the major and then i helped to
carry him off to the tumbrels i never see'd my old major from that day
to this and it war only a month ago that i h'ard of his death i honour
his memory and so k-yaptin you see thar's a sort of claim to old
friendship between us

to this characteristic speech which was delivered with great
earnestness captain forrester made a suitable response and intimating
his willingness to accept the proffered hospitality of his uncle's
companion in arms he rode forward with his host and kinswoman towards
the station of which when once fairly relieved of the forest he had a
clear view

it seemed unusually populous as indeed it was but roland as he
rode by remarked on the skirts of the village a dozen or more
shooting-targets set up on the green and perceived it was a gala-day
which had drawn the young men from a distance to the fort this in fact
he was speedily told by a youth whom the worthy bruce introduced to him
as his eldest son and namesake big tom bruce the third of that name
the other two toms for two others he had had having been killed by
the injuns and he having changed the boy's name that he might have a
tom in the family the youth was worthy of his father being full six
feet high though scarcely yet out of his teens and presented a visage
of such serene gravity and good-humoured simplicity as won the affections
of the soldier in a moment

thar's a boy now the brute said colonel bruce sending him off to
assist in the distribution of the guests among the settlers that comes
of the best stock for loving women and fighting injuns in all kentucky
and so captain if young madam your sister h'yar is for picking a
husband out of kentuck i'll say it and stand to it thar's not a better
lad to be found than tom bruce if you hunt the district all over you'd
scarce believe it mom he continued addressing edith herself but the
young brute did actually take the scalp of a full-grown shawnee before he
war fourteen y'ar old and that in fa'r fight whar thar war none to help
him the way of it war this tom war out in the range looking for a
neighbour's horse when what should he see but two great big shawnees
astride of the identicular beast he war hunting away went tom and away
went the bloody villians hard after one of em afoot the other on the
horse now said tom this won't do no how and so he let fly at the
mounted feller but being a little skeary as how could he help it the
young brute being the first time he ever banged at an injun he hit the
horse which dropped down in a flurry and away comes the red devil over
his head like a rocket end on to a sapling up jumps tom and picks up
the injun's gun and bang goes the other shawnee at him and jumps to a
tree a bird in the hand said tom is worth two in a bush and with
that he blows out the first feller's brains just as he is gitting up
and runs into the fort hard chased by the other and then to see the
fellers when i asked him why he didn't shoot the injun that had fired at
him and so make sure of both the other being in a sort of swound-like
from the tumble and ready to be knocked on the head at any moment
lord said tom i never thought of it i war such a fool and with
that he blubbered all night to think he had not killed them both
howsomever i war always of opinion that what he had done war good work
for a boy of fourteen but come now my lovely young mom we are
entering the station may you never enter a house where you are less
welcome




chapter ii


men and boys had rushed from the fortress together to greet the new
comers and few remained save the women of whom not a few particularly
of the younger individuals were as eager to satisfy their curiosity as
their fathers and brothers the disorderly spirit had spread even among
the daughters of the commandant to the great concern of his spouse who
although originally of a degree somewhat humbler even than his own had a
much more elevated sense of the dignity of his commission as a colonel of
militia and a due consciousness of the necessity of adapting her manners
to her rank she stood on the porch of her cabin which had the merit of
being larger than any other in the fort maintaining order among some
half dozen or more lasses the eldest scarce exceeding seventeen whom
she endeavoured to range in a row to receive the expected guests in
state though every moment some one or other might be seen edging away
from her side as if in the act of deserting her altogether

out on you you flirting critturs said she her indignation provoked
and her sense of propriety shocked by such unworthy behaviour stop
thar you nell whar you going you sally you phoebe you jane and
the rest of you ha'nt you no better idea of what's manners for a
cunnel's daughters i'm ashamed of you to run ramping and tearing
after the strange men thar like tom-boys or any common person's
daughters laws do remember your father's a cunnel in the milishy
and set down in the porch here on the bench like genteel young ladies
or stand up if you like that better and wait till your father cunnel
bruce that is brings up the captains one of em's a rale army captain
with epaulets and broad-sword with a chance of money and an uncommon
handsome sister rale genteel people from old virginnee and i'm glad of
it it's so seldom you sees any body but common persons come to
kentucky do behave yourselves thar's telie doe thar at the loom don't
think so much as turning her eyes around she's a pattern for you

law mother said the eldest of the daughters bridling with disdain
i reckon i know how to behave myself as well as telie doe or any other
girl in the settlement a declaration echoed and re-echoed by her
sisters all of whom bent their eyes towards a corner of the ample porch
where busied with a rude loom fashioned perhaps by the axe and knife of
the militia colonel himself on which she was weaving a coarse cloth from
the fibres of the flax-nettle sat a female somewhat younger than the
eldest of the sisters and doubtless of a more humble degree as was
shown by the labour in which she was engaged while the others seemed to
enjoy a holiday and by her coarse brown garments worn at a moment when
the fair bruces were flaunting in their best bibs and tuckers the same
having been put on not more in honour of the exiles whose coming had
been announced the day before than out of compliment to the young men of
the settlement who were wont to assemble on such occasions to gather the
latest news from the states

the pattern of good manners thus referred to was as unconscious of the
compliment bestowed upon her by the worthy mrs bruce as of the glances
of disdain it drew from the daughters being apparently at that moment
too much occupied with her work to think of anything else nor did she
lift up her eyes until the conversation having been resumed between the
mother and daughters one of the latter demanded what was the name of
that army captain that was so rich and great of whom her mother had
been talking

captain roland forrester replied the latter at the sound of which
name the maiden at the loom started and looked up with an air of fright
that caused exceeding diversion among the others look at telie doe
they cried laughing you can't speak above your breath but she thinks
you are speaking to her and sure you can't speak to her but she looks
as if she would jump out of her skin and run away for her dear life

and so indeed the girl did appear for a moment looking as wild and
terrified as the animal whose name she bore when the first bay of the
deer-hound startles her in the deep woodland pastures rolling her eyes
catching her breath convulsively shivering and in short betraying a
degree of agitation that would have appeared unaccountable to a
stranger though as it caused more amusement than surprise among the
merry bruces it was but fair to suppose that it sprung from
constitutional nervousness or the sudden interruption of her
meditations as she started up in her confusion rolling her eyes from
one laughing maiden to another her very trepidation imparted an interest
to her features which were in themselves pretty enough though not so
much as to attract observation when in a state of rest then it was that
the observer might see or fancy he saw a world of latent expression in
her wild dark eyes and trace the workings of a quick and sensitive
spirit whose existence would have been otherwise unsuspected in the
tremulous movement of her lips and then too one might have been struck
with the exquisite contour of a slight figure which even the coarse
garments spun and perhaps shaped by her own hands could not entirely
conceal at such times of excitement there was something in her
appearance both striking and singular indian-like one might almost have
said such an epithet might have been borne out by the wildness of her
looks the darkness of her eyes the simple arrangement of her coal-black
hair which instead of being confined by comb or fillet was twisted
round a thorn cut from the nearest locust-tree and by the smallness of
her stature though the lightness and european tinge of her complexion
must have instantly disproved the idea

her discomposure dispelled from the bosoms of her companions all the
little resentment produced by the matron's invidious comparison and each
now did her best to increase it by cries of jump telie the indians
will catch you take care telie tom bruce will kiss you run
telie the dog will bite you and other expressions of a like alarming
nature which if they did not augment her terror divided and distracted
her attention till quite bewildered she stared now on one now on the
other and at each mischievous assault started and trembled and gasped
for breath in inexpressible confusion it was fortunate for her that
this species of baiting which from the spirit and skill with which her
youthful tormentors pursued it seemed no uncommon infliction the
reforming mother considered to be at least at that particular moment
unworthy the daughters of a colonel in the militia

do behave yourselves you ungenteel critturs said she phoebe bruce
you're old enough to know better don't expose yourself before
stranngers thar they come now thar's cunnel bruce that is talking to
captain forrester that is and a right-down soldier-looking captain he
is too i wonder whar's his cocked hat and feather and goold epaulets
thar's his big broad-sword and but lord above us ar'nt his sister a
beauty any man in kentucky will be proud of her but i warrant me
she'll take to nothing under a cunnel

the young misses ceased their sport to stare at the strangers and even
telie doe pattern of propriety as she was had no sooner recovered her
equanimity than she turned her eyes from the loom and bent them eagerly
upon the train now entering through the main gate gazing long and
earnestly upon the young captain and the fair edith who with the colonel
of militia and a fourth individual parted from it and rode up to the
porch the fourth person a sober and substantial-looking borderer in a
huge blanket-coat and slouched hat the latter stuck round with buck's
tails was the nominal captain of the party he conversed a moment with
forrester and the commandant and then being given in charge by the
latter to his son tom who was hallooed from the crowd for this purpose
he rode away leaving the colonel to do the honours to his second in
command these the colonel executed with much courtesy and gallantry if
not with grace leaping from his horse with unexpected activity and
assisting edith to dismount which he effected by taking her in his arms
and whisking her from the saddle with as little apparent effort as though
he were handling an infant

welcome my beautiful young lady said he giving her another hearty
shake of the hand h'yar's a house that shall shelter you though thar's
not much can be said of it except that it is safe and wholesome h'yar's
my old lady too and my daughters that will make much of you and as for
my sons thar's not a brute of em that won't fight for you but th ar
all busy stowing away the stranngers and i reckon they think it ar'nt
manners to show themselves to a young lady while she's making
acquaintance with the women

with that the gallant colonel presented the fair stranger to his wife and
daughters the latter of whom a little daunted at first by her
appearance as a being superior in degree to the ordinary race of
mortals but quickly re-assured by her frank and easy deportment loaded
her with caresses and carried her into the house to improve the few
hours allowed to make her acquaintance and to assist her in changing her
apparel for which the means were furnished from sundry bags and
packages that the elder of the two negromen the only immediate
followers of her kinsmen took from the back of a pack-horse the mother
of the bruces thought it advisable to follow them to see perhaps in
person that they conducted themselves towards their guest as a colonel's
daughter should

none of the females remained on the porch save telie the girl of the
loom who too humble or too timid to seek the acquaintance of the
stranger lady like the others had been overlooked in the bustle and
now pursued her labour with but little notice from those who remained

and now colonel said the young officer declining the offer of
refreshments made by his host allow me like a true soldier to proceed
to the business with which you heard our commander major johnson charge
me to-morrow we resume our journey to the falls i should gladly myself
for miss forrester's sake consent to remain with you a few days to
recruit our strength a little but that cannot be our men are resolved
to push on without delay and as i have no authority to restrain them i
must e'en accompany them

well said colonel bruce if it must be it must and i'm not the
brute to say no to you but lord captain i should be glad to have you
stay a month or two war it only to have a long talk about my old friend
the brave old major and thar's your sister captain lord sir she
would be the pet of the family and would help my wife teach the girls
manners lord he continued laughing you've no idea what grand
notions have got into the old woman's head about the way of behaving
ever since it war that the governor of virginnie sent me a cunnel's
commission she thinks i ought to w'ar a cocked hat and goold swabs
and put on a blue coat instead of a leather shirt but i wonder how soon
i'd see the end of it out h'yar in the bushes and then as for the
girls why thar's no end of the lessons she gives them and thar's
my jenny that's the youngest came blubbering up the other day
saying she believed mother intended even to stop their licking at
the sugar-troughs she was getting so great and so proud howsomever
women will be women and thar's the end of it

to this philosophic remark the officer of inferior degree bowed
acquiescence and recalling his host's attention to the subject of most
interest to himself requested to be informed what difficulties or
dangers might be apprehended on the further route to the falls of ohio

why none on arth that i know of said bruce you've as cl'ar
and broad a trace before you as man and beast could make a
buffalo-street through the canes and when thar's open woods blazes
as thick as stars and horse-tracks still thicker thar war more than a
thousand settlers have travelled it this year already as for danngers
captain why i reckon thar's none to think on thar war a good chance of
whooping and howling about bear's grass last year and some hard
fighting but i h'ar nothing of injuns thar this y'ar but you leave
some of your people h'yar what force do you tote down to the falls
to-morrow

footnote the bison-paths when very broad were often thus called

twenty-seven guns in all but several quite too young to face an enemy

thar's no trusting to years in a matter of fighting said the
kentuckian thar's my son tom that killed his brute at fourteen but i
remember i told you that story howsomever i hold thar's no injuns on
the road and if you should meet any why it will be down about bear's
grass or the forks of salt whar you can keep your eyes open and whar
the settlements are so thick it is easy taking cover no no captain
the fighting this year is all on the north side of kentucky

yet i believe said roland there have been no troubles there since
the defeat of captain estill on little mountain and of holder at that
place what do you call it

upper blue licks of licking said bruce and war'nt they troubles
enough for a season two kentucky captains and one of them a south-side
man too whipped in fa'r fight and by nothing better than brutish
injuns

they were sad affairs indeed and the numbers of white men murdered
made them still more shocking

the murdering said the gallant colonel bruce is nothing sir it is
the shame of the thumping that makes one feel vicious thar's the thing
no kentuckian can stand sir to be murdered whar thar's ten injuns to
one white man is nothing but whar it comes to being trounced by equal
numbers why thar's the thing not to be tolerated howsomever captain
we're no worse off in kentucky than our neighbours thar's them five
hundred pennsylvanians that went out in june under old cunnel crawford
from pittsburg agin the brutes of sandusky war more ridiculously
whipped by old captain pipe the delaware thar's no denying

what said roland was crawford's company beaten

beaten said the kentuckian opening his eyes cut off the b and
say the savages made a dinner of em and you'll be nearer the true
history of the matter it's but two months ago and so i suppose the news
of the affa'r hadn't got into east virginnie when you started well
captain the long and short of it is the cunnel war beaten and
exterminated and that on a hard run from the fight he had hunted hard
after how many ever got back safe agin to pittsburg i never could
rightly h'ar but what i know is that thar war dozens of prisoners
beaten to death by the squaws and children and that old cunnel crawford
himself war put to the double torture and roasted alive and i reckon
if he war'nt eaten it war only because he war too old to be tender

horrible said the young soldier muttering half to himself though not
in tones so low but that the kentuckian caught their import and i must
expose my poor edith to fall into the power of such fiends and monsters

ay captain said bruce thar's the thing that sticks most in
the heart of them that live in the wilderness and have wives and
daughters to think of their falling into the hands of the brutes who
murder and scalp a woman just as readily as a man as to their torturing
them that's not so certain but the brutes arn't a bit too good for it
and i did h'ar of their burning one poor woman at sandusky but now
captain if you are anxious to have the young lady your sister in
safety h'yar's the place to stick up your tent-poles h'yar in this
very settlement whar the injuns never trouble us never coming within
ten miles of us thar's as good land here as on bear's grass and we
shall be glad of your company it is not often we have a rich man to take
luck among us howsomever i won't deceive you if you will go to the
ohio i hold thar's no danger on the trace for either man or woman

my good friend said roland you seem to labour under two errors in
respect to me which it is fitting i should correct in the first place
the lady whom you have several times called i know not why my sister
claims no such near relationship being only my cousin

why sure said the colonel someone told me so and thar's a strong
family likeness

there should be said the youth since our fathers were twin brothers
and resembled each other in all particulars in body in mind and as i
may say in fortune they were alike in their lives alike also in their
deaths they fell together struck down by the same cannon-ball at the
bombardment of norfolk seven years ago

may i never see a scalp said the kentuckian warmly grasping the young
man's hand if i don't honour you the more for boasting such a father
and such uncles you come of the true stock captain thar's no denying
and my brave old major's estates have fallen into the right hands for
if thar's any believing the news the last band of emigrants brought of
you h'yar thar war no braver officer in lee's corps nor in the whole
virginnee line than young captain forrester

here said roland looking as if what he said cost him a painful
effort lies the second error your considering me as you manifestly
do the heir of your old major my uncle roland which i am not

lord said the worthy bruce he was the richest man in
prince-george and he had thousands of fat acres in the valley the
best in all fincastle as i know very well for i war a fincastle man
myself and thar war my old friend braxley he war a lieutenant under
the major at braddock's and afterwards his steward and manager and
lawyer-like who used to come over the ridge to see after them but i
see how it is he left all to the young lady

not an acre said roland

what said the kentuckian he left no children of his own who then is
the heir

your old friend as you call him richard braxley and hence you see
continued the youth as if desirous to change the conversation that i
come to kentucky an adventurer and fortune-hunter like other emigrants
to locate lands under proclamation-warrants and bounty-grants to fell
trees raise corn shoot bisons and indians and in general do any
thing else that can be required of a good virginian or good kentuckian

it was evidently the captain's wish now to leave altogether the subject
on which he had thought it incumbent to acquaint his host with so much
but the worthy bruce was not so easily satisfied and not conceiving
there was any peculiar impropriety in indulging curiosity in matters
relating to his old major however distasteful that curiosity might prove
to his guest he succeeded in drawing from the reluctant young man many
more particulars of his story which as they have an important
connection with the events it is our object to narrate we must be
pardoned for briefly noticing

major roland forrester the uncle and godfather of the young soldier and
the representative of one of the most ancient and affluent families on
james river for by this trivial name virginians are content to designate
the noble powhatan was the eldest of three brothers of whom the two
younger as was often the case under the ancien regime in virginia
were left at the death of their parent to shift for themselves
while the eldest son inherited the undivided princely estate of his
ancestors this was at the period when that contest of principle with
power which finally resulted in the separation of the american colonies
from the parent state first began to agitate the minds of the good
planters of virginia in common with the people of all the other
colonies men had already begun to take sides in feeling as in argument
and as usual interest had no doubt its full share in directing and
confirming the predilections of individuals these circumstances the
regular succession of the eldest-born to the paternal estate and the
necessity imposed on the others of carving out their own fortunes had
perhaps their influence in determining the political bias of the
brothers and preparing them for contention when the increase of party
feeling and the clash of interests between the government abroad and the
colonies at home called upon all men to avow their principles and take
their stands it was as natural that the one should retain affection and
reverence for the institutions which had made him rich and distinguished
as that the younger brothers who had suffered under them a deprivation
of their natural rights should declare for a system of government and
laws more liberal and equitable in their character and operation at all
events and be the cause of difference what it might when the storm of
the revolution burst over the land the brothers were found arrayed on
opposite sides the two younger the fathers of roland and edith
instantly taking up arms in the popular cause while nothing perhaps
but helpless feebleness and bodily infirmities the results of wounds
received in braddock's war throughout which he had fought at the head of
a battalion of buckskins or virginia rangers prevented the elder
brother from arming as zealously in the cause of his king fierce
uncompromising and vindictive however in his temper he never forgave
his brothers the bold and active part they both took in the contest and
it was his resentment perhaps more than natural affection for his
neglected offspring that caused him to defeat his brothers hopes of
succession to his estates he being himself unmarried by executing a
will in favour of an illegitimate child an infant daughter whom he drew
from concealment and acknowledged as his offspring this child however
was soon removed having being burned to death in the house of its
foster-mother but its decease effected little or no change in his
feelings towards his brothers who pursuing the principles they had so
early avowed were among the first to take arms among the patriots of
virginia and fell as roland had said at norfolk leaving each an
orphan child roland then a youth of fifteen and edith a child of ten
to the mercy of the elder brother their death effected what perhaps
their prayers never would have done the stern loyalist took the orphans
to his bosom cherished and loved them or at least appeared to do so
and often avowed his intention to make them his heirs but it was
roland's ill fate to provoke his ire as roland's father had done before
him the death of that father one of the earliest martyrs to liberty
had created in his youthful mind a strong abhorrence of everything
british and loyal and after presuming a dozen times or more to disclose
and defend his hatred he put the coping-stone to his audacity by
suddenly leaving his uncle's house two years after he had been received
into it and galloping away a cornet in one of the companies of the
first regiment of horse which virginia sent to the armies of congress
he never more saw his uncle he cared little for his wrath or its
effects if disinherited himself it pleased his imagination to think he
had enriched his gentle cousin but his uncle carried his resentment
further than he had dreamed or indeed any one else who had beheld the
show of affection he continued to the orphan edith up to the last moment
of his existence he died in october of the preceding year a week before
the capitulation at york-town and almost within the sound of the guns
that proclaimed the fall of the cause he had so loyally espoused from
this place of victory roland departed to seek his kinswoman he found her
in the house not of his fathers but of a stranger herself a destitute
and homeless orphan no will appeared to pronounce her the mistress of
the wealth he had himself rejected but in place of it the original
testament in favour of major forrester's own child was produced by
braxley his confidential friend and attorney who by it was appointed
both executor of the estate and trustee to the individual in whose favour
it was constructed

the production of such a testament so many years after the death of the
girl caused no little astonishment but this was still further increased
by what followed the aforesaid braxley instantly taking possession of
the whole estate in the name of the heiress who he made formal
deposition was to the best of his belief yet alive and would appear
to claim her inheritance in support of this extraordinary averment he
produced or professed himself ready to produce evidence to show that
forrester's child instead of being burned to death as was believed had
actually been trepanned and carried away by persons to him unknown the
burning of the house of her foster-mother having been devised and
executed merely to give colour to the story of her death who were the
perpetrators of such an outrage and for what purpose it had been
devised he affected to be ignorant though he threw out many hints and
surmises of a character more painful to edith and roland than even the
loss of the property these hints roland could not persuade himself to
repeat to the curious kentuckian since they went in fact to charge his
own father and edith's with the crime of having themselves concealed
the child for the purpose of removing the only bar to their expectations
of succession

whatever might be thought of this singular story it gained some
believers and was enough in the hands of braxley a man of great address
and resolution and withal a lawyer to enable him to laugh to scorn the
feeble efforts made by the impoverished roland to bring it to the test of
legal arbitrament despairing in fact of his cause after a few trials
had convinced him of his impotence and perhaps himself almost believing
the tale to be true the young man gave up the contest and directed his
thoughts to the condition of his cousin edith who upon the above
circumstances being made known had received a warm invitation to the
house and protection of her only female relative a married lady whose
husband had two years before emigrated to the falls of ohio where he
was now a person of considerable importance this invitation determined
the course to be pursued the young man instantly resigned his
commission and converting the little property that remained into
articles necessary to the emigrant turned his face to the boundless
west and with his helpless kinswoman at his side plunged at once into
the forest a home for edith in the house of a relative was the first
object of his desires his second as he had already mentioned was to
lay the foundation for the fortunes of both

there was something in the condition of the young and almost friendless
adventurers to interest the feelings of the hardy kentuckian but they
were affected still more strongly by the generous self-sacrifice as it
might be called which the young soldier was evidently making for his
kinswoman for whom he had given up an honourable profession and his
hopes of fame and distinction to live a life of inglorious toil in the
desert he gave the youth another energetic grasp of hand and said with
uncommon emphasis 

hark'ee captain my lad i love and honour ye and i could say no more
if you war my own natteral born father as to that ar richard braxley
whom i call'd my old friend you must know it war an old custom i have
of calling a man a friend who war only an acquaintance for i am for
being friendly to all men that ar white and honest and no injuns now
i do hold that braxley to be a rascal a precocious rascal sir and i
rather reckon thar war lying and villiany at the bottom of that will
and i hope you'll live to see the truth of it

the sympathy felt by the kentuckian in the story was experienced in a
still stronger degree by telie doe the girl of the loom who little
noticed if at all by the two sat apparently occupied with her work
yet drinking in every word uttered by the young soldier with a deep and
eager interest until roland by chance looking round beheld her large
eyes fastened upon him with a wild sorrowful look of which however
she herself seemed quite unconscious that greatly surprised him the
kentuckian observing her at the same time called to her what telie
my girl are you working upon a holiday you should be dressed like the
others and making friends with the stranger lady and so git away with
you now and make yourself handsome and don't stand thar looking as if
the gentleman would eat you

a qu'ar crittur she poor thing said bruce looking after her
commiseratingly and a stranger might think her no more nor half-witted
but she has sense enough poor crittur and i reckon is just as smart
if she war not so humble and skittish as any of my own daughters

what said roland is she not then your child

no no replied bruce shaking his head a poor crittur of no manner
of kin whatever her father war an old friend or acquaintance-like for
rat it i won't own friendship for any such apostatised villians no
how but the man war taken by the shawnees and so as thar war none to
befriend her and she war but a little chit no bigger nor my hand i took
to her myself and raised her but the worst of it is and that's what
makes her so wild and skeary her father abel doe turned injun himself
like girty elliot and the rest of them refugee scoundrels you've h'ard
of now that's enough you see to make the poor thing sad and
frightful for abel doe is a rogue thar's no denying and everybody
hates and cusses him as is but his due and it's natteral now she's
growing old enough to be ashamed of him she should be ashamed of herself
too though thar's nothing but her father to charge against her poor
creatur a bad thing for her to have an injunised father for if it
war'nt for him i reckon my son tom the brute would take to her and
marry her

poor creature indeed muttered roland to himself contrasting in
thought the condition of this helpless and deserted girl with that of his
own unfortunate kinswoman and sighing to acknowledge that it was still
more forlorn and pitiable

his sympathy was however but short-lived being interrupted on the
instant by a loud uproar of voices from the gate of the stockade
sounding half in mirth half in triumph while the junior bruce was seen
approaching the porch looking the very messenger of good news




chapter iii


what's the matter tom bruce said the father eyeing him with
surprise

matter enough responded the young giant with a grin of mingled awe
and delight the jibbenainosay is up again

whar cried the senior eagerly not in our limits

no by jehoshaphat replied tom but nigh enough to be
neighbourly on the north bank of kentuck whar he has left his
mark right in the middle of the road as fresh as though it war but
the work of the morning

and a clear mark tom no mistake in it

right to an iota said the young man a reggelar cross on the breast
and a good tomahawk dig right through the skull and a long-legg'd
fellow too that looked as though he might have fou't old sattan
himself

it's the jibbenainosay sure enough and so good luck to him cried the
commander thar's a harricane coming

who is the jibbenainosay demanded forrester

who cried tom bruce why nick nick of the woods

and who if you please is nick of the woods

thar replied the junior with another grin thar strannger you're
too hard for me some think one thing and some another but thar's many
reckon he's the devil

and his mark that you were talking of in such mysterious terms what
is that

why a dead injun to be sure with nick's mark on him a knife-cut or
a brace of em over the ribs in the shape of a cross that's the way the
jibbenainosay marks all the meat of his killing it has been a whole year
now since we h'ard of him

captain said the elder bruce you don't seem to understand the afta'r
altogether but if you were to ask tom about the jibbenainosay till
doomsday he could tell you no more than he has told already you must
know thar's a creatur of some sort or other that ranges the woods round
about our station h'yar keeping a sort of guard over us like and
killing all the brute injuns that ar onlucky enough to come in his way
besides scalping them and marking them with his mark the injuns call him
jibbenainosay or a word of that natur which them that know more
about the injun gabble than i do say means the spirit-that-walks and
if we can believe any such lying devils as injuns which i am loath to
do for the truth ar'nt in em he is neither man nor beast but a great
ghost or devil that knife cannot harm nor bullet touch and they have
always had an idea that our fort h'yar in partickelar and the country
round about war under his friendly protection many thanks to him
whether he be a devil or not for that whar the reason the savages so
soon left off a worrying of us

is it possible said roland that any one can believe such an absurd
story

why not said bruce stoutly thar's the injuns themselves shawnees
hurons delawares and all but partickelarly the shawnees for he beats
all creation a-killing of shawnees that believe in him and hold him in
such eternal dread that thar's scarce a brute of em has come within ten
miles of the station h'yar this three y'ar because as how he haunts
about our woods h'yar in partickelar and kills em wheresomever he
catches em especially the shawnees as i said afore against which the
creatur has a most butchering spite and there's them among the other
tribes that call him shawneewannaween or the howl of the shawnees
because of his keeping them ever a-howling and thar's his marks
captain what do you make of that when you find an injun lying
scalped and tomahawked it stands to reason thar war something to kill
him

ay truly said forrester but i think you have human beings enough to
give the credit to without referring it to a supernatural one

strannger said big tom bruce the younger with a sagacious nod when
you kill an injun yourself i reckon meaning no offence you will be
willing to take all the honour that can come of it without leaving it to
be scrambled after by others thar's no man arns a scalp in kentucky
without taking great pains to show it to his neighbours

and besides captain said the father very gravely thar are men
among us who have seen the creatur

that said roland who perceived his new friends were not well
pleased with his incredulity is an argument i can resist no longer

thar war ben jones and samuel sharp and peter small-eye and a dozen
more who all had a glimpse of him stalking through the woods at
different times and they agree he looks more like a devil nor a
mortal man a great tall fellow with horns and a hairy head like a
buffalo-bull and a little devil that looks like a black b'ar that
walks before him to point out the way he war always found in the
deepest forests and that's the reason we call him nick of the woods
wharby we mean old nick of the woods for we hold him to be the devil
though a friendly one to all but injuns now captain i war never
superstitious in my life but i go my death on the jibbenainosay i
never seed the creatur himself but i have seen in my time two
different savages of his killing it's a sure sign if you see him in the
woods that thar's injuns at hand and it's a good sign when you find his
mark without seeing himself for then you may be sure the brutes are
off for they can't stand old nick of the woods no how at first he war
never h'ard of afar from our station but he has begun to widen his
range last year he left his marks down salt river in jefferson and now
you see he is striking game north of the kentucky and i've h'ard of
them that say he kills shawnees even in their own country though
consarning that i'll not be so partickelar no no captain thar's no
mistake in nick of the woods and if you are so minded we will go and
h'ar the whole news of him but i say tom continued the kentuckian
as the three left the porch together who brought the news

captain ralph roaring ralph stackpole replied tom bruce with a
knowing and humorous look

what cried the father in sudden alarm look to the horses tom

i will said the youth laughing it war no sooner known that captain
ralph war among us than it was resolved to have six regulators in the
range all night thar's some of these new colts not to speak of our own
creaturs and especially that blooded brown beast of the captain's
which the nigger calls brown briery or some such name would set a
better man than roaring ralph stackpole's mouth watering

and who said roland is roaring ralph stackpole and what has he to
do with brown briarens

a proper fellow as ever you saw replied tom approvingly killed
two injuns once single-handed on bear-grass and has stolen more horses
from them than ar another man in kentucky a prime creatur but he has
his fault poor fellow and sometimes mistakes a christian's horse for an
injun's thar's the truth of it

and such scoundrels you make officers of demanded the soldier
indignantly

oh said the elder bruce thar's no reggelar commission in the case
but whar thar's a knot of our poor folks out of horses and inclined to
steal a lot from the shawnees which is all fa'r plundering you see for
thar's not a horse among them the brutes that they did not steal from
kentucky they send for roaring ralph and make him their captain and a
capital one he is too being all fight from top to bottom and as for
the stealing part thar's no one can equal him but as tom says he
sometimes does make mistakes having stolen horses so often from the
injuns he can scarce keep his hands off a christian's and that makes us
wrathy

by this time the speakers had reached the gate of the fort and passed
among the cabins outside where they found a throng of the villagers
surrounding the captain of horse-thieves and listening with great
edification to and deriving no little amusement from his account of the
last achievement of the jibbenainosay of this as it related no more
than the young bruce had already repeated namely that while riding
that morning from the north side he had stumbled upon the corse of an
indian which bore all the marks of having been a late victim to the
wandering demon of the woods we shall say nothing but the appearance
and conduct of the narrator one of the first and perhaps the parent
of the race of men who have made salt river so renowned in story were
such as to demand a less summary notice he was stout bandy-legged
broad-shouldered and bull-headed ugly and villanous of look yet with
an impudent swaggering joyous self-esteem traced in every feature and
expressed in every action of body that rather disposed the beholder to
laugh than to be displeased at his appearance an old blanket-coat or
wrap-rascal once white but now of the same muddy brown hue that stained
his visage and once also of sufficient length to defend his legs though
the skirts had long since been transferred to the cuffs and elbows where
they appeared in huge patches covered the upper part of his body while
the lower boasted a pair of buckskin breeches and leather wrappers
somewhat its junior in age but its rival in mud and maculation an old
round fur hat intended originally for a boy and only made to fit his
head by being slit in sundry places at the bottom thus leaving a dozen
yawning gaps through which as through the chinks of a lattice stole
out as many stiff bunches of black hair gave to the capital excrescence
an air as ridiculous as it was truly uncouth which was not a little
increased by the absence on one side of the brim and by a loose fragment
of it hanging down on the other to give something martial to an
appearance in other respects so outlandish and ludicrous he had his
rifle and other usual equipments of a woodsman including the knife and
tomahawk the first of which he carried in his hand swinging it about at
every moment with a vigour and apparent carelessness well fitted to
discompose a nervous person had any such happened among his auditors as
if there was not enough in his figure visage and attire to move the
mirth of beholders he added to his other attractions a variety of
gestures and antics of the most extravagant kinds dancing leaping
and dodging about clapping his hands and cracking his heels together
with the activity restlessness and we may add the grace of a
jumping-jack such was the worthy or unworthy son of salt river a man
wholly unknown to history though not to local and traditionary fame and
much less to the then inhabitants of bruce's station to whom he related
his news of the jibbenainosay with that emphasis and importance of tone
and manner which are most significantly expressed in the phrase of
laying down the law

as soon as he saw the commander of the station approaching he cleared
the throng around him by a skip and a hop seized the colonel by the
hand and doing the same with the soldier before boland could repel him
as he would have done exclaimed glad to see you cunnel same to you
strannger what's the news from virginnie strannger my name's ralph
stackpole and i'm a ring-tailed squealer

then mr ralph stackpole the ring-tailed squealer said roland
disengaging his hand be so good as to pursue your business without
regarding or taking any notice of me

tarnal death to me cried the captain of horse-thieves indignant at
the rebuff i'm a gentleman and my name's fight foot and hand tooth
and nail claw and mudscraper knife gun and tomahawk or any other way
you choose to take me i'm your man cock-a-doodle-doo and with that
the gentleman jumped into the air and flapped his wings as much to the
amusement of the provoker of his wrath as of any other person present

come ralph said the commander of the station whar'd you steal that
brown mar thar a question whose abruptness somewhat quelled the
ferment of the man's fury while it drew a roar of laughter from the
lookers-on

thar it is said he striking an attitude and clapping a hand on his
breast like a man who felt his honour unjustly assailed steal i
steal any horse but an injun's whar's the man dar's insinivate that
blood and massacree-ation whar's the man

h'yar said bruce very composedly i know that old mar belongs to
peter harper on the north side

you're right by hooky cried roaring ralph at which seeming admission
of his knavery the merriment of the spectators was greatly increased nor
was it much lessened when the fellow proceeded to aver that he had
borrowed it and that with the express stipulation that it should be left
at bruce's station subject to the orders of its owner thar cunnel
said he thar's the beast take it and just tell me whar's the one you
mean to lend me for i must be oft afore sunset

and whar are you going demanded bruce

to st asaphis which was a station some twenty or thirty miles
off replied captain stackpole

too far for the regulators to follow ralph said colonel bruce at
which the young men present laughed louder than ever and eyed the
visitor in a way that seemed both to disconcert and offend him

cunnel said he you're a man in authority and my superior officer
wharfo thar can be no scalping between us but my name's tom dowdle
the ragman he screamed suddenly skipping into the thickest of the
throng and sounding a note of defiance my name's tom dowdle the
ragman and i'm for any man that insults me log-leg or leather-breeches
green-shirt or blanket-coat land-trotter or river-roller i'm the man
for a massacree then giving himself a twirl upon his foot that would
have done credit to a dancing-master he proceeded to other antic
demonstrations of hostility which when performed in after years on the
banks of the lower mississippi by himself and his worthy imitators
were we suspect the cause of their receiving the name of the mighty
alligator it is said by naturalists of this monstrous reptile that he
delights when the returning warmth of spring has brought his fellows
from their holes and placed them basking along the banks of a swampy
lagoon to dart into the centre of the expanse and challenge the whole
field to combat he roars he blows the water from his nostrils he
lashes it with his tail he whirls round and round churning the water
into foam until having worked himself into a proper fury he darts back
again to the shore to seek an antagonist had the gallant captain of
horse-thieves boasted the blood as he afterwards did the name of an
alligator half-breed he could have scarce conducted himself in a way
more worthy of his parentage he leaped into the centre of the throng
where having found elbow-room for his purpose he performed the gyration
mentioned before following it up by other feats expressive of his
hostile humour he flapped his wings and crowed until every chanticleer
in the settlement replied to the note of battle he snorted and neighed
like a horse he bellowed like a bull he barked like a dog he yelled
like an indian he whined like a panther he howled like a wolf until
one would have thought he was a living managerie comprising within his
single body the spirit of every animal noted for its love of conflict
then not content with such a display of readiness to fight the field
he darted from the centre of the area allowed him for his exercise
and invited the lookers-on individually to battle whar's your
buffalo-bull he cried to cross horns with the roarer of salt river
whar's your full-blood colt that can shake a saddle off h'yar's an old
nag can kick off the top of a buck-eye whar's your cat of the knobs
your wolf of the rolling prairies h'yar's the old brown b'ar can claw
the bark off a gum tree h'yar's a man for you tom bruce same to you
sim roberts to you jimmy big-nose to you and to you and to you
ar'n't i a ring-tailed squealer can go down salt on my back and swim up
the ohio whar's the man to fight roaring ralph stackpole

now whether it happened that there were none present inclined to a
contest with such a champion or whether it was that the young men looked
upon the exhibition as a mere bravado meant rather to amuse them than
irritate it so occurred that not one of them accepted the challenge
though each when personally called on did his best to add to the
roarer's fury if fury it really were by letting off sundry jests in
relation to borrowed horses and regulators that the fellow's rage was
in great part assumed roland who was at first somewhat amused at his
extravagance became soon convinced and growing at last weary of it he
was about to signify to his host his inclination to return into the fort
when the appearance of another individual on the ground suddenly gave
promise of new entertainment

footnote it is scarce necessary to inform the reader that by
this term must be understood those public-spirited citizens amateur
jack-ketches who administer lynch-law in districts where regular law
is but inefficiently or not at all established




chapter iv


if you're ralely ripe for a fight roaring ralph cried tom bruce the
younger who had shown like the others a greater disposition to jest
than to do battle with the champion here comes the very man for you
look boys thar comes bloody nathan at which formidable name there was
a loud shout set up with an infinite deal of laughing and clapping of
hands

whar's the fellow cried captain stackpole springing six feet into the
air and uttering a whoop of anticipated triumph i've heerd of the
brute and tarnal death to me but i'm his super-superior show me tho
critter and let me fly cock-a-doodle-doo

hurrah for roaring ralph stackpole cried the young men some of whom
proceeded to pat him on the back in compliment to his courage while
others ran forward to hasten the approach of the expected antagonist

the appearance of the comer at a distance promised an equal match to
tho captain of horse-thieves but roland perceived from the increase of
merriment among the kentuckians and especially from his host joining
heartily in it that there was more in bloody nathan than met the eye
and yet there was enough in his appearance to attract attention and to
convince the soldier that if kentucky had shown him in captain
stackpole one extraordinary specimen of her inhabitants she had others
to exhibit not a whit less remarkable it is on the frontiers indeed
where adventurers from every corner of the world and from every circle
of society are thrown together that we behold the strongest contrasts
and the strangest varieties of human character

casting his eyes down the road or street for it was flanked by the
outer cabins of the settlement and perhaps deserved the latter name
which led among stumps and gullies from the gate of the stockade to the
bottom of the hill forrester beheld a tall man approaching leading an
old lame white horse at the heels of which followed a little silky
haired black or brown dog dragging its tail betwixt its legs in
compliment to the curs of the station which seemed as hospitably
inclined to spread a field of battle for the submissive brute as their
owners were to make ready another for its master the first thing that
surprised the soldier in the appearance of the person bearing so
formidable a name was an incongruity which struck others as well as
himself even the colonel of militia exclaiming as he pointed it out
with his finger it's old nathan slaughter to the backbone thar he
comes the brute leading a horse in his hand and carrying his pack on
his own back but he's a marciful man old nathan and the horse thar
old white dobbin war foundered and good for nothing ever since the boys
made a race with him against sammy parker's jackass

as he approached yet higher roland perceived that his tall gaunt figure
was arrayed in garments of leather from top to toe even his cap or hat
for such it seemed having several broad flaps suspended by strings so
as to serve the purpose of a brim being composed of fragments of tanned
skins rudely sewed together his upper garment differed from a hunting
shirt only in wanting the fringes usually appended to it and in being
fashioned without any regard to the body it encompassed so that in
looseness and shapelessness it looked more like a sack than a human
vestment and like his breeches and leggings it bore the marks of the
most reverend antiquity being covered with patches and stains of all
ages sizes and colours

thus far bloody nathan's appearance was not inconsistent with his name
being uncommonly wild and savage and to assist in maintaining his claims
to the title he had a long rifle on his shoulder and a knife in his
belt both of which were in a state of dilapidation worthy of his other
equipments the knife from long use and age being worn so thin that it
seemed scarce worthy the carrying while the rifle boasted a stock so
rude shapeless and as one would have judged from its magnitude and
weight so unserviceable that it was easy to believe it had been
constructed by the unskilful hands of nathan himself his visage seeming
to belong to a man of at least forty-five or fifty years of age was
hollow and almost as weather-worn as his apparel with a long hooked
nose prominent chin a wide mouth exceedingly straight and pinched with
a melancholy or contemplative twist at the corners and a pair of black
staring eyes that beamed a good-natured humble and perhaps submissive
simplicity of disposition his gait too as he stumbled along up the
hill with a shuffling awkward hesitating step was like that of a man
who apprehended injury and insult and who did not possess the spirit
to resist them the fact moreover of his sustaining on his own
shoulders a heavy pack of deer and other skins to relieve the miserable
horse which he led betokened a merciful temper scarce compatible with
the qualities of a man of war and contention another test and criterion
by which roland judged his claims to the character of a roarer he found
in the little black dog for the virginian was a devout believer as we
are ourselves in that maxim of practical philosophers namely that by
the dog you shall know the master the one being fierce magnanimous and
cowardly just as his master is a bully a gentleman or a dastard the
little dog of nathan was evidently a coward creeping along at white
dobbin's heels and seeming to supplicate with his tail which now
draggled in the mud and now attempted a timid wag that his fellow-curs
of the station should not be rude and inhospitable to a peaceful
stranger

on the whole the appearance of the man was anything in the world but
that of the ferocious ruffian whom the nick-name had led roland to
anticipate and he scarce knew whether to pity him or to join in the
laugh with which the young men of the settlement greeted his approach
perhaps his sense of the ridiculous would have disposed the young soldier
to merriment but the wistful look with which while advancing nathan
seemed to deprecate the insults he evidently expected spoke volumes of
reproach to his spirit and the half-formed smile faded from his
countenance

thar exclaimed tom bruce slapping stackpole on the shoulder with
great glee thar's the man that calls himself dannger at him for the
honour of salt river but take care of his forelegs for i tell you
he's the pennsylvany war-horse

and arn't i the ramping tiger of the rolling fork cried captain ralph
and can't i eat him hoss dog dirty jacket and all hold me by the
tail while i devour him

with that he executed two or three escapades demivoltes curvets and
other antics of a truly equine character an galloping up to the amazed
nathan saluted him with a neigh so shrill and hostile that even white
dobbin pricked up his ears and betrayed other symptoms of alarm

surely colonel said roland you will not allow that mad ruffian to
assail the poor man

oh said bruce ralph won't hurt him he's never vicious except among
injuns and horses he's only for skearing the old feller

and who said forrester may the old fellow be and why do you call
him bloody nathan

we call him bloody nathan replied the commander because he's the
only man in all kentucky that won't fight and thar's the way he beats
us all hollow lord captain you'd hardly believe it but he's nothing
more than a poor pennsylvany quaker and what brought him out to
kentucky whar thar's nar another creatur of his tribe thar's no
knowing some say he war dishonest and so had to cut loose from
pennsylvany but i never heerd of his stealing anything in kentucky i
reckon thar's too much of the chicken about him for that some say he is
hunting rich lands which war like enough for anybody that war not so
poor and lazy and some say his wits are unsettled and i hold that
that's the truth of the creatur for he does nothing but go wandering up
and down the country now h'yar and now thar hunting for meat and skins
and that's pretty much the way he makes a living and once i see'd the
creatur have a fit a right up-and-down touch of the falling-sickness
with his mouth all of a foam thar's them that's good-natur'd that calls
him wandering nathan because of his being h'yar and thar and every
whar he don't seem much afear'd of the injuns but they say the red
brutes never disturbs the pennsylvany quakers howsomever he makes
himself useful for sometimes he finds injun sign whar thar's no injuns
thought of and so he gives information but he always does it as he
says to save bloodshed not to bring on a fight he comes to me once
thar's more than three years ago and instead of saying cunnel thar's
twenty injuns lying on the road at the lower ford of salt whar you may
nab them says he says he friend thomas thee must keep the people
from going nigh the ford for thar's injuns thar that will hurt them
and then he takes himself off whilst i rides down thar with twenty-five
men and exterminates them killing six and driving the others the lord
knows whar he has had but a hard time of it amongst us poor creatur
for it used to make us wrathy to find thar war so little fight in him
that he wouldn't so much as kill a murdering injun i took his gun from
him once for why he wouldn't attend muster when i had enrolled him but
i pitied the brute for he war poor and thar war but little corn in his
cabin and nothing to shoot meat with and so i gave it back and told
him to take his own ways for an old fool

while colonel bruce was thus delineating the character of nathan
slaughter the latter found himself surrounded by the young men of the
station the butt of a thousand jests and the victim of the insolence of
the captain of horse-thieves it is not to be supposed that roaring ralph
was really the bully and madman that his extravagant freaks and
expressions seemed to proclaim him these like any other actions that a
man might play were assumed partly because it suited his humour to be
fantastic and partly because the putting of his antic disposition on
was the only means which he like many of his betters possessed of
attracting attention and avoiding the neglect and contempt to which his
low habits and appearance would have otherwise justly consigned him
there was therefore little really hostile in the feelings with which he
approached the non-combatant though it was more than probable the
disgust he in common with the other warlike personages entertained
toward the peaceable nathan might have rendered him a little more
malicious than usual

nathan said he as soon as he had concluded his neighing and
curvetting if you ever said your prayers now's the time down with
your pack for i can't stand deer's ha'r sticking in my swallow no how

friend said nathan meekly i beg thee will not disturb me i am a
man of peace and quiet

and so saying he endeavoured to pass onwards but was prevented by
ralph who seizing his heavy bundle with one hand applied his right
foot to it with a dexterity that not only removed it from the poor man's
back but sent the dried skins scattering over the road this feat was
rewarded by the spectators with loud shouts all which as well as the
insult itself nathan bore with exemplary patience

friend he said what does thee seek of me that thee treats me thus

a fight replied captain stackpole uttering a war-whoop a fight
strannger for the love of heaven

thee seeks it of the wrong person said nathan and i beg thee will
get thee away

what said stackpole arn't thee the pennsylvanny war-horse the
screamer of the meeting-house the ba'r of yea-nay-and-verily

i am a man of peace said the submissive slaughter

yea verily verily and yea cried ralph snuffling through the
nostrils but assuming an air of extreme indignation strannger i've
heerd of you you're the man that holds it agin duty and conscience to
kill injuns the redskin screamers that refuses to defend the women the
splendiferous creatur's and the little children the squall-a-baby
d'avs and wharfo bec'ause as how you're a man of peace and no fight
you superiferous long-legged no-souled crittur but i'm the gentleman
to make a man of you so down with your gun and tarnal death to me
i'll whip the cowardly devil out of you

friend said nathan his humility yielding to a feeling of contempt
thee is theeself a cowardly person or thee wouldn't seek a quarrel with
one thee knows can't fight thee thee would not be so ready with thee
match

with that he stooped to gather up his skins a proceeding that
stackpole against whom the laugh was turned by this sally of nathan's
resisted by catching him by the nape of the neck twirling him round and
making as if he really would have beaten him

even this the peaceful nathan bore without anger or murmuring but his
patience fled when stackpole turning to the little dog which was
bristling its back and growling expressed a half inclination to take up
its master's quarrel applied his foot to its ribs with a violence that
sent it rolling some five or six yards down the hill where it lay for a
time yelping and whining with pain

friend said nathan sternly thee is but a dog theeself to harm the
creature what will thee have with me

a fight a fight i tell thee replied captain ralph till i teach thy
leatherified conscience the new doctrines of kentucky

fight thee i cannot and dare not said nathan and then added much to
the surprise of forrester who sharing his indignation at the brutality
of his tormentor had approached to drive the fellow off but if thee
must have thee deserts thee shall have them thee prides theeself
upon thee courage and strength will thee adventure with me a friendly
fall

hurrah for nathan cried the young men vastly delighted at his
unwonted spirit while captain ralph himself expressed his pleasure by
leaping into the air crowing and dashing off his hat which he kicked
down the hill with as much good will as he had previously bestowed upon
the little dog

off with your leather night-cap and down with your rifle he cried
giving his own weapon into the hands of a looker-on and scrape some of
the grease off your jacket for tarnal death to me i shall give you
the virginny lock fling you head-fo'most and you'll find yourself in a
twinkling sticking fast right in the centre of the arth

thee may find theeself mistaken said nathan giving up his gun to one
of the young men but instead of rejecting his hat pulling it down tight
over his brows there is locks taught among the mountains of bedford
that may be as good as them learned on the hills of virginia i am ready
for thee

cock-a-doodle-doo cried ralph stackpole springing towards his man
and clapping his hands one on nathan's left shoulder the other on his
right hip are you ready

i am replied nathan

down then you go war you a buffalo and with that the captain of the
horse-thieves put forth his strength which was very great in an effort
that appeared to roland quite irresistible though as it happened it
scarce moved nathan from his position

thee is mistaken friend he cried exerting his strength in return
and with an effect that no one had anticipated by magic as it seemed
the heels of the captain of the horse-thieves were suddenly seen flying
in the air his head aiming at the earth upon which it as suddenly
descended with the violence of a bomb-shell and there it would doubtless
have burrowed like the aforesaid implement of destruction had the soil
been soft enough for the purpose or exploded into a thousand fragments
had not the shell been double the thickness of an ordinary skull

huzza bloody nathan for ever shouted the delighted villagers

he has killed the man said forrester but bear witness all the
fellow provoked his fate

thanks to you strannger but not so dead as you reckon said ralph
rising to his feet and scratching his poll with a stare of comical
confusion i say strannger here's my shoulders but whar's my
head do you reckon i had the worst of it

huzza for nathan slaughter he has whipped the ramping tiger of salt
river cried the young men of the station

well i reckon he has said the magnanimous captain ralph picking
up his hat then walking up to nathan who had taken his dog into his
arms to examine into the little animal's hurts he cried with much
good-humoured energy thar's my fo'paw in token i've had enough of you
and want no mo but i say nathan slaughter he added as he grasped
the victor's hand it's no thing you can boast of to be the strongest
man in kentucky and the most sevagarous at a tussel h'yar among
murdering injuns and scalping runnegades and keep your fists off their
top-knots thar's my idear for i go for the doctrine that every
able-bodied man should sarve his country and his neighbours and fight
their foes and them that does is men and gentlemen and them that don't
is cowards and rascals that's my idear and so fawwell

then executing another demivolte or two but with much less spirit than
he had previously displayed he returned to colonel bruce saying
whar's that horse you promised me cunnel i'm a licked man and i can't
stay here no longer no way no how lend me a hoss cunnel and trust to
my honour

you shall have a beast said bruce coolly but as to trusting your
honour i shall do no such thing having something much better to rely
on tom will show you a horse and remember you are to leave him at
logan's if you carry him a step further captain you'll never carry
another judge lynch is looking at you and so bewar

having uttered this hint he left the captian of horse-thieves to digest
it as he might and stepped up to nathan who had seated himself on a
stump where with his skins at his side his little dog and his rifle
betwixt his legs he sat enduring a thousand sarcastic encomiums on his
strength and spirit with as many sharp denunciations of the peaceful
principles that robbed the community of the services he had shown himself
so well able to render the doctrine so eloquently avowed by captain
ralph that it was incumbent upon every able-bodied man to fight the
enemies of their little state the murderers of their wives and children
was a canon of belief imprinted on the heart of every man in the
district and nathan's failure to do so however caused by his
conscientious aversion to bloodshed no more excused him from contempt
and persecution in the wilderness than it did others of his persuasion
in the eastern republics during the war of the revolution his
appearance accordingly at any station was usually the signal for
reproach and abuse the fear of which had driven him almost altogether
from the society of his fellowmen so that he was seldom seen among them
except when impelled by necessity or when his wanderings in the woods
had acquainted him with the proximity of the foes of his persecutors his
victory over the captain of horse-thieves exposed him on this occasion
to ruder and angrier remonstrances than usual which having sought in
vain to avert he sat down in despair enduring all in silence staring
from one to another of his tormentors with lack-lustre eyes and playing
with the silken hair of his dog the approach of the captain of the
station procured him an interval of peace which he however employed
only to communicate his troubles to the little cur that in his
perplexity he had addressed pretty much as he would have addressed a
human friend and adviser well peter said he abstractedly and with
a heavy sigh what does thee think of matters and things to which
question the ridiculousness of which somewhat mollified the anger of the
young men peter replied by rubbing his nose against his master's hand
and by walking a step or two down the hill as if advising an instant
retreat from the inhospitable station

ay peter muttered nathan the sooner we go the better for there are
none that makes us welcome but nevertheless peter we must have our
lead and our powder and we must tell these poor people the news

and pray nathan said colonel bruce rousing him from his meditations
what may your news for the poor people be i reckon it will be much
wiser to tell it to me than that ar brute dog you have seen the
jibbenainosay perhaps or his mark thar-away on the kentucky

nay said nathan but there is news from the injun towns of a great
gathering of injuns with their men of war in the miami villages who
design the evil creatures marching into the district of kentucky with a
greater army than was ever seen in the land before

let them come the brutes said the kentuckian with a laugh of scorn
it will save us the trouble of hunting them up in their own towns

nay said nathan but perhaps they have come for the prisoner who
escaped and who is bearing the news to friend clark the general at the
falls says they were to march two days after he fled from them

and whar did you learn this precious news

at the lower fort of kentucky and from the man himself said nathan
he had warned the settlers at lexington 

that's piper's news interrupted one of the young men captain ralph
told us all about that but he said thar war nobody at lexington believed
the story

then said nathan meekly it may be that the man was mistaken yet
persons should have a care for there is injun sign all along the
kentucky but that is my story and now friend thomas if thee will give
me lead and powder for my skins i will be gone and trouble thee no
longer

it's a sin and a shame to waste them on a man who only employs them to
kill deer b'ar and turkey said bruce yet a man musn't starve even
whar he's a quaker so go you along with my son dick thar to the store
and he'll give you the value of your plunder a poor miserable brute
thar's no denying he continued contemptuously as nathan obeying the
direction followed bruce's second son into the fortress the man has
some spirit now and then but whar's the use of it while he's nothing
but a no-fight quaker i tried to reason him out of his notions but thar
war no use in trying no how i could work it i have an idea about these
quakers 

but here luckily the worthy colonel's idea was suddenly put to flight
by the appearance of telie doe who came stealing through the throng to
summon him to his evening meal a call which neither he nor his guest
was indisposed to obey and taking telie by the hand in a paternal
manner he ushered the young soldier back into the fort

the girl roland observed had changed her attire at the bidding of her
protector and now though dressed with the greatest simplicity appeared
to more advantage than before he thought her indeed quite handsome
and pitying her more than orphan condition he endeavoured to show her
such kindness as was in his power by addressing to her some
complimentary remarks as he walked along at her side his words
however only revived the terror she seemed really to experience
whenever any one accosted her seeing which he desisted doubting if she
deserved the compliment the benevolent bruce had so recently paid to her
good sense




chapter v

the evening meal being concluded and a few brief moments devoted to
conversation with her new friends edith was glad when at a hint from
her kinsman as to the early hour appointed for setting out on the morrow
she was permitted to seek the rest of which she stood in need her
chamber and by a rare exercise of hospitality the merit of which she
appreciated since she was sensible it could not have been made without
sacrifice she occupied it alone boasted few of the luxuries few even
of the comforts to which she had been accustomed in her native land and
her father's house but misfortune had taught her spirit humility and
the recollection of nights passed in the desert with only a thin
mattress betwixt her and the naked earth and a little tent-cloth and
the boughs of trees to protect her from inclement skies caused her to
regard her present retreat with such feelings of satisfaction as she
might have indulged if in the chamber of a palace

she was followed to the apartment by a bevy of the fair bruces all
solicitous to render her such assistance as they could and all perhaps
equally anxious to indulge their admiration for the second or third
time over the slender store of finery which edith good-naturedly opened
to their inspection in this way the time fled amain until mrs bruce
more considerate than her daughters and somewhat scandalised by the loud
commendations which they passed on sundry articles of dress such as were
never before seen in kentucky rushed into the chamber and drove them
manfully away

poor ignorant critturs said she by way of apology they knows no
better thar's the mischief of being raised in the back-woods they'll
never l'arn to be genteel thar's so many common persons comes out here
with their daughters i'm sure i do my best to l'arn em

with these words she tendered her own good offices to edith which the
young lady declining with many thanks she bade her good-night and to
edith's great relief left her to herself a few moments then sufficed to
complete her preparations for slumber which being effected she threw
herself on her knees to implore the further favour of the orphan's
friend who had conducted her so far in safety on her journey

whilst thus engaged her mind absorbed in the solemn duty she failed to
note that another visitor had softly stolen into the apartment and
accordingly when she rose from her devotions and beheld a female figure
standing in the distance though regarding her with both reverence and
timidity she could not suppress an exclamation of alarm

do not be afraid it is only telie doe said the visitor with a low
and trembling voice i thought you would want some one to to take the
candle

you are very good replied edith who having scarcely before observed
the humble and retiring maid and supposing her to be one of her host's
children had little doubt she had stolen in to indulge her curiosity
like the others although at so late a moment as to authorise a little
cruelty on the part of the guest i am very tired and sleepy she said
creeping into bed hoping that the confession would be understood and
accepted as an apology she then seeing that telie did not act upon the
hint intimated that she had no further occasion for the light and bade
her good-night but telie instead of departing maintained her stand at
the little rude table where besides the candle were several articles
of apparel that edith had laid out in readiness for the morning and upon
which she thought the girl's eyes were fixed

if you had come a little earlier said edith with unfailing
good-nature i should have been glad to show you anything i have
but now indeed it is too late and all my packages are made up 

it is not that interrupted the maiden hastily but with trepidation
no i did not want to trouble you but 

but what demanded edith with surprise yet with kindness for she
observed the agitation of the speaker

lady said telie mustering resolution and stepping to the bed-side
if you will not be angry with me i would i would 

you would ask a favour perhaps said edith encouraging her with a
smile

yes that is it replied the girl dropping on her knees not so much
however as it appeared from abasement of spirit as to bring her lips
nearer to edith's ear that she might speak in a lower voice i know
from what they say you are a great lady and that you once had many
people to wait upon you and now you are in the wild woods among
strangers and none about you but men edith replied with a sigh and
telie timorously grasping at the hand lying nearest her own murmured
eagerly if you would but take me with you i am used to the woods
and i would be your servant

you exclaimed edith her surprise getting the better of her sadness
your mother would surely never consent to your being a servant

my mother muttered telie i have no mother no relations

what mr bruce is not then your father

no i have no father yes that is i have a father but he has he
has turned indian

these words were whispered rather than spoken yet whispered with a tone
of grief and shame that touched edith's feelings her pity was expressed
in her countenance and telie reading the gentle sympathy infused into
every lovely feature bent over the hand she had clasped and touched it
with her lips

i have told you the truth she said mournfully one like me should
not be ashamed to be a servant and so lady if you will take me i will
go with you and serve you and poor and ignorant as i am i can serve
you yes ma'am she added eagerly i can serve you more and better
than you think indeed indeed i can

alas poor child said edith i am one who must learn to do without
attendance and service i have no home to give you

i have heard it all said telie but i can live in the woods with you
till you have a house and then i can work for you and you'll never
regret taking me no indeed for i know all that's to be done by a
woman in a new land and you don't and indeed if you have none to help
you it would kill you it would indeed for it is a hard hard time in
the woods for a woman that has been brought up tenderly

alas child said edith perhaps a little pettishly for she liked not
to dwell upon such gloomy anticipations why should you be discontented
with the home you have already surely there are none here unkind to
you

no replied the maiden they are very good to me and mr bruce has
been a father to me but then i am not his child and it is wrong of me
to live upon him who has so many children of his own and then my
father all talk of my father all the people here hate him though he
has never done them harm and i know yes i know it well enough though
they won't believe it that he keeps the indians from hurting them but
they hate him and curse him and oh i wish i was away where i should
never hear them speak of him more perhaps they don't know anything about
him at the falls and then there will be nobody to call me the white
indian's daughter

and does mr bruce or his wife know of your desire to leave him

no said telie her terrors reviving but if you should ask them for
me then they would agree to let me go he told the captain that's
captain forrester he would do any thing for him and indeed he would
for he is a good man and he will do what he says

how strange how improper nay how ungrateful then if he be a good
man said edith that you should wish to leave him and his kind
family to live among persons entirely unknown be content my poor maid
you have little save imaginary evils to affect you you are happier here
than you can be among strangers

telie clasped her hands in despair i shall never be happy here
nor anywhere but take me she added eagerly take me for your own
sake for it will be good for you to have me with you in the woods it
will indeed it will

it cannot be said edith gently but the maiden would scarce take a
refusal her terrors had been dissipated by her having ventured so far on
speech and she now pursued her object with an imploring and passionate
earnestness that both surprised and embarrassed edith while it increased
her sympathy for the poor bereaved pleader she endeavoured to convince
her if not of the utter folly of her desires at least of the
impossibility there was on her part of granting them she succeeded
however in producing conviction only on one point telie perceived that
her suit was not to be granted of when as soon as she was satisfied
she left off entreaty and rose to her feet with a saddened and humbled
visage and then taking up the candle she left the fair stranger to her
repose

in the meanwhile roland also was preparing for slumber and finding as
indeed he could not avoid seeing that the hospitality of his host had
placed the males of the family under the necessity of taking their rest
in the open air on the porch he insisted upon passing the night in the
same place in their company in fact the original habitation of the
back-woodsman seldom boasted more than two rooms in all and these none
of the largest and when emigrants arrived at a station there was little
attempt made to find shelter for any save their women and children to
whom the men of the settlement readily gave up their own quarters to
share those of their male visitors under the blanket-tents which were
spread before the doors this to men who had thus passed the nights for
several weeks in succession was anything but hardship and when the
weather was warm and dry they could congratulate themselves on sleeping
in greater comfort than their sheltered companions of this forrester
was well aware and he took an early period to communicate his resolution
of rejecting the unmanly luxury of a bed and sleeping like a soldier
wrapped in his cloak with his saddle for a pillow in this way the
night proving unexpectedly sultry he succeeded in enjoying more
delightful and refreshing slumbers than blessed his kinswoman in her
bed of down the song of the katydid and the cry of the whippoorwill
came more sweetly to his ears from the adjacent woods and the breeze
that had stirred a thousand leagues of forest in its flight whispered
over his cheek with a more enchanting music than it made among the
chinks and crannies of the wall by edith's bed-side a few idle
dreams recollections of home mingled with the anticipated scenes
of the future the deep forest the wild beast and the lurking
indian amused without harassing his sleeping mind and it was not
until the first gray of dawn that he experienced any interruption he
started up suddenly his ears still tingling with the soft tones of an
unknown voice which had whispered in them cross the river by the lower
ford there is danger at the upper he stared around but saw nothing
all was silent around him save the deep breathing of the sleepers at his
side who spoke he demanded in a whisper but received no reply
river upper and lower ford danger  he muttered now i would have
sworn some one spoke to me and yet i must have dreamed it strange
things dreams thoughts in freedom loosed from the chains of
association temporary mad-fits undoubtedly marvellous impressions
they produce on the organs of sense see hear smell taste touch more
exquisitely without the organs than with them what's the use of
organs there's the poser i think i  but here he ceased thinking
altogether his philosophy having served the purpose such philosophy
usually does and wrapped him a second time in the arms of morpheus he
opened his eyes almost immediately as he thought but his morning nap
had lasted half an hour the dawn was already purple and violet in the
sky his companions had left his side and the hum of voices and the
sound of footsteps in and around the station told him that his
fellow-exiles were already preparing to resume their journey

a brave morrow to you captain said the commander of the fortress the
thunder of whose footsteps as he approached the house with uncommonly
fierce strides had perhaps broken his slumbers a frown was on his brow
and the grasp of his hand in which every finger seemed doing the duty of
a boa-constrictor spoke of a spirit up in arms and wrestling with
passion

what is the matter asked roland

matter that consarns you and me more than any other two persons in the
etarnal world said bruce with such energy of utterance as nothing-but
rage could supply thar has been a black wolf in the pin-fold alias
as they used to say at the court-house captain ralph stackpole and
the end of it is war i never to tell another truth in my life that your
blooded brown horse has absquatulated

absquatulated echoed forrester amazed as much at the word as at the
fierce visage of his friend what is that is the horse hurt

stolen away sir by the etarnal old scratch carried off by roaring
ralph stackpole while i like a brute war sound a-sleeping and h'yar's
the knavery of the thing sir the unpronounceable rascality sir i
loaned the brute one of my own critturs just to be rid of him and have
him out of harm's way for i had a forewarning the brute that his mouth
war a-watering after the dew beasts in the pinfold and after the brown
horse in partickelar and so i loaned him a horse and sent him off to
logan's well sir and what does the brute do but ride off for a
make-believe to set us easy for he knew the brute if he war in sight
of us we should have had guards over the cattle all night long well
sir down he sot in ambush till all were quiet and then he stole back
and turning my own horse among the others as if to say thar's the
beast that i borrowed it war a wonder the brute war so honest picked
the best of the gathering your blooded brown horse sir and all the
while i war sleeping like a brute and leaving the guest in my own house
to be robbed by captain ralph stackpole the villian

if it be possible to follow the rascal said roland giving way to
wrath himself i must do so and without a moment's delay i would to
heaven i had known this earlier

whar war the use said bruce whar was the use of disturbing a tired
man in his nap and he a guest of mine too

the advantage would have been said roland a little testily that the
pursuit could have been instantly begun

and war it not said the colonel thar war not two minutes lost
after the horse war missing afore my son tom and a dozen more of the
best woodsmen war mounted on the fleetest horses in the settlement and
galloping after right on the brute's trail

thanks my friend said roland with a cordial grasp of the hand the
horse will be recovered

thar's no denying it said bruce if a fresh leg can outrun a weary
one and besides the brute war not content with the best horse but he
must have the second best too that's major smalleye's two-y'ar-old pony
he has an eye for a horse the etarnal skirmudgeon but the pony will be
the death of him for he's skeary and will keep ralph slow in the path
no sir we'll have your brown horse before you can say jack robinson
but the intolerability of the thing sir is that ralph stackpole should
steal my guest's horse sir but it's the end of his thieving the brute
or thar's no snakes i told him lynch war out the brute and i told the
boys to take car i war not found lying and i reckon they won't forget
me i like the crittur thar's no denying for he's a screamer among the
injuns but thar's no standing a horse-thief no sir thar's no standing
a horse-thief

the only consequence of this accident which was apprehended was that the
march of the exiles must be delayed until the soldier's horse was
recovered or roland himself left behind until the animal was brought in
unless indeed he chose to accept another freely offered him by his
gallant host and trust to having his own charger restored on some future
occasion he was himself unwilling that the progress of more than a
hundred human beings towards the long sighed for land of promise should
be delayed a moment on his account and for this reason he exhorted his
nominal superior to hasten the preparations for departure without
thinking of him his first resolution in relation to his own course
was to proceed with the company leaving his horse to be sent after him
when recovered he was loath however to leave the highly-prized and
long-tried charger behind and colonel bruce taking advantage of the
feeling and representing the openness and safety of the road the
shortness of the day's journey for the next station at which the exiles
intended lodging was scarce twenty miles distant and above all
promising if he remained to escort him thither with a band of his young
men to whom the excursion would be but an agreeable frolic the soldier
changed his mind and in an evil hour as it afterwards appeared
consented to remain until brown briareus was brought in provided this
should happen before mid-day at which time if the horse did not appear
it was agreed he should set out trusting to his good fortune and the
friendly zeal of his host for the future recovery and restoration of his
charger later than mid-day he was resolved not to remain for however
secure the road it was wiser to pursue it in company than alone nor
would he have consented to remain a moment had there appeared the least
impediment to his joining the companions of his exile before nightfall

his measures were taken accordingly his baggage-horses under the charge
of the younger of the two negroes were sent on with the band the other
an old and faithful slave of his father being retained as a useful
appendage to a party containing his kinswoman from whom he of course
saw no reason to be separated to edith herself the delay was far from
being disagreable it promised a gay and cheerful gallop through the
forest instead of the dull plodding funeral-like march to which she
had been day after day monotonously accustomed she assented therefore
to the arrangement and like her kinsman beheld in the fresh light of
sun-rise without a sigh without even a single foreboding of evil the
departure of the train of emigrants with whom she had journeyed in
safety so many long and weary leagues through the desert

they set out in high spirits after shaking hands with their hosts at the
gates and saluting them with cheers which they repeated in honour of
their young captain and in a few moments the whole train had vanished
as if swallowed up by the dark forest




chapter vi


within an hour after the emigrants had set out the sky which had
previously been clear and radiant began to be overcast with clouds
dropping occasional rains which roland scarcely observed with regret
their effect on the sultry atmosphere being highly agreeable and
refreshing they continued thus to fall at intervals until nine o'clock
when roland as he sat on the porch debating with bruce the probabilities
of their continuance was roused by a shout from the outer village and
looking up he beheld to his great delight richard bruce the second
son of his host a lad of sixteen ride into the enclosure leading in
triumph his recovered charger

thar's the brute strannger said he with uncommon glee he war too
hard a horse for ralph's riding and i reckon if he hadn't been you
wouldn't have had him so easy for he's a peeler at a run trot or
gallop he is i tell you it's bad luck for stackpole to be flung by man
and beast two days hand-running first by bloody nathan then by a
stolen crittur

and whar is the brute stackpole and what have you done with him
demanded bruce

thar father you're too hard for me replied the youth but i'll tell
you all i know on it you needn't look at his legs captain for they're
all as sound as hickory the crittur's a bit worried with his morning's
work but that's nothing to speak on

the lad's story was soon told the track of the horse-thief had been
followed through the woods and it was soon seen from its irregularity
that he had made an unlucky selection of beasts both being so restive
and rebellious that it was obvious he had found it no easy matter to
urge them along a place was found where he appeared to have been thrown
by the turbulent briareus which he seemed afterwards to have pursued
mounted on the pony in the vain hope of retaking the mettlesome charger
until persuaded of his inability or afraid from the direction in which
the animal had fled of being led back again to the settlement his
track after abandoning the chase was as plain as that left by the
war-horse and was followed by the main body of pursuers while richard
and two or three others taking the latter had the good fortune to find
and recover the animal as he was solacing himself after his morning
adventures in a grassy wood scarce two miles from the station what had
become of stackpole the lad knew not but had no doubt as he added with
a knowing look that lynch's boys would soon give a good account of him
for major smalleye war as mad as a beaten b'ar about the two-y'ar-old
pony

well said the father i reckon the brute will deserve all he may come
by and thar's no use in mourning him thar's as good injun-fighters as
he left in kentucky thar's the comfort and thar's no denying men will
be much easier about their horses

with this consoling assurance in which roland saw implied the visitation
of the deadliest vengeance on the head of the offender bruce proceeded
to congratulate him on the recovery of brown briareus and to intimate
his readiness after the animal had been allowed a little rest which it
evidently needed to marshal his band of young men and conduct him on
his way after the exiles but fate willed that the friendly intention
should never be put into execution and that the young soldier should go
forth on his pilgrimage unattended and unprotected

within the space of half an hour the clouds which seemed previously to
have discharged all their moisture collected into a dense canopy
darkening the whole heaven and rumbling with thunder that became every
moment louder and heavier then came gusts of wind groaning through the
forest rattling among the dead limbs of the girdled trees and whistling
over the palisades of the fort these were succeeded by louder peals of
thunder and vivid flashes of lightning which continued and increased
until the tempest for such it was burst in fury discharging deluges of
rain that fell with unintermitting violence until an hour or more after
mid-day

this was a circumstance which as it necessarily deferred the moment of
his setting out caused forrester a little uneasiness but he soon came
to believe he had reason to congratulate himself on its occurrence since
it was scarce possible the band would continue their journey in such a
storm and indeed bruce was of opinion that the day's march would be
ended on the banks of the river one of the principal forks of the
salt but little more than ten miles from his station where if the
exiles were wise they would pitch their camp waiting for the subsidence
of the waters this was a point that roland might be expected to reach in
a ride of three or four hours at most which consideration not only
satisfied him under the delay but almost made him resolve to defer his
setting-out until the following morning that his kinswoman might have
the advantage of sleeping a second time under the shelter of a roof
rather than be compelled to exchange it for the chill and humid forest

it was while he was balancing this thought in his mind and watching with
a gladdened eye the first flash of sunshine breaking through the parted
clouds that a shout louder than that which had proclaimed the recovery
of his steed but of a wild and mournful character arose from the outer
village and a horseman covered with mud reeking with rain and reeling
in the saddle with fatigue and exhaustion rode into the fort followed
by a crowd of men women and children all testifying by their looks
and exclamations that he was the bearer of alarming news and such
indeed he was as was shown by the first words he answered in reply to
bruce's demand what was the matter

there are a thousand indians he said shawnees delawares wyandots
miamies all the tribes of the north laying siege to bryant's station
and perhaps at this moment they are burning and murdering at lexington
men colonel bruce send us all your men without a moment's delay and
send off for logan and his forces despatch some one who can ride for i
can sit a horse no longer

whar's dick bruce cried the kentuckian and the son answering he
continued mount the roan long-legs you brute and ride to st asaph's
in no time tell cunnel logan what you h'ar and add that before he can
draw girth i shall be with every fighting-man in my fort on the north
side of kentucky ride you brute ride for your life and do you take
car you come along with the cunnel for it's time you war trying your
hand at an injun top-knot ride you brute ride

wah wah wah wah whooped the boy like a young indian flying to
obey the order and exulting in the expectation of combat

sound horn you samuel sharp cried the father you ben jones and
some more of you ride out and rouse the settlement and some of you
hunt up tom bruce and the regulators it war a pity they hanged ralph
stackpole for he fights injuns like a wolverine tell all them that
ar'n't ready to start to follow at a hard gallop and join me at the ford
of kentucky and them that can't join me thar let them follow to
lexington and them that don't find me thar let them follow to bryant's
or to any-whar whar thar's injuns hurrah you brutes whar's your guns
and your horses your knives and your tomahawks if thar's a thousand
injuns or the half of em thar's meat for all of you whar's ikey
jones the fifer let's have yankee-doodle and the rogue's march for by
the etarnal old scratch all them white men that ar'n't a-horse-back in
twenty-five minutes are rogues worse than red injuns hurrah for
kentucky

the spirit of the worthy officer of militia infused animation into
all bosoms and in an instant the settlement late so peaceful
resounded with the hum and uproar of warlike preparation horses were
caught and saddled rifles pulled from their perches knives sharpened
ammunition-pouches and provender-bags filled and every other step taken
necessary to the simple equipment of a border army called to action in
an emergency so sudden and urgent

in the meanwhile the intelligence was not without its effects on
roland forrester who seeing himself so unexpectedly deprived of the
promised escort for he could scarce think under such circumstances
of withdrawing a single man from the force called to a duty so
important perceived the necessity of employing his own resources to
effect escape from a position which he now felt to be embarrassing he
regretted for the first time his separation from the band of emigrants
and became doubly anxious to follow them for if it were true that so
large a force of indians was really in the district there was every
reason to suppose they would according to their known system of warfare
divide into small parties and scatter over the whole country infesting
every road and path and he knew not how soon some of them might be found
following on the heels of the messenger he took advantage of the first
symptom of returning serenity on the part of his host to acquaint him
with his resolution to set out immediately the rains having ceased and
the clouds broken up and almost vanished

lord captain said the kentuckian i hoped you would have been for
taking a brush with us and it war my idea to send a messenger after your
party in hopes your men would join us in the rusty whar will they have
such another chance a thousand injuns ready cut and dried for killing
lord what a fool i war for not setting more store by that tale of nathan
slaughter's i never knowed the brute to lie in such a case for as he
is always ramping about the woods he's as good as a paid scout
howsomever the crittur did'nt speak on his own knowledge and that
infarnal stackpole was just ripe from the north side but i say
captain if your men will fight just tote em back stow away the women
behind the logs here and march your guns after me and if thar's half
the number of red niggurs they speak of to be found you shall see an
affa'r of a skrimmage that will be good for your wholesome you will by
the etarnal

if the men are of that mind said roland gallantly i am not the one
to balk them i will at least see whither their inclinations tend and
that the matter may the sooner be decided i will set out without delay

and we who war to escort you captain said the kentuckian with some
embarrassment you're a soldier captain and you see the case

i do i have no desire to weaken your force and i trust no protection
is needed

not an iota the road is as safe as the furrow of a virginnee
corn-field at least till you strike the lower forks and thar i've
heard of no rampaging since last summer i'll indamnify you against all
loss and mischief i will if it war on my salvation

if you could but spare me a single guide said forrester

whar's the use captain the road is as broad and el'ar as a turnpike in
the old dominion it leads you chock up right on the upper ford whar
thar's safe passage at any moment but i reckon the rains will make it
look a little wrathy a while and so fetch your people to a stand-still
but it's a pot soon full and soon empty and it will be low enough in the
morning

the upper ford said roland his dream for so he esteemed it
recurring to his mind is there then a lower ford

ay replied bruce but thar's no passing it in the freshes and
besides the place has a bad name it war thar old john ashburn pitched
his station in but the savages made murdering work of him taking
every scalp in the company and so it makes one sad-like to pass thar
and the more partickelarly that it's all natteral fine ground for an
ambush you'll see the road when you're six mile deep in the forest
turning off to the right under a shivered beech-tree you are then four
miles from the river or tharabouts and just that distance i reckon
from your company no captain he repeated the road is wide and open
and a guide war mere lumber on your hands

this was a point however on which the young soldier doubly
solicitous on his kinswoman's account to avoid mistake was not so
easily satisfied seeing which the kentuckian yielded to his
importunity perhaps somewhat ashamed of suffering his guests to depart
entirely alone and began to cast about him for some suitable person who
could be prevailed upon to exchange the privilege of fighting indians for
the inglorious duty of conducting wayfarers through the forest this was
no easy task and it was not until he assumed his military authority as
commander of all the enrolled militia-men in his district empowered to
make such disposition of his forces as he thought fit that he succeeded
in compelling the service of one of his reluctant followers under whose
guidance roland and his little party soon after set out their farewells
were briefly said the urgent nature of his duties leaving the hospitable
bruce little opportunity for superfluous speech he followed them
however to the bottom of the hill grasped roland by the hand and doing
the same thing by edith as if his conscience smote him for dismissing
her with so little ceremony and such insufficient attendance he swore
that if any evil happened to her on the road he would rest neither night
nor day until he had repaired it or lost his scalp in the effort

with this characteristic and somewhat ominous farewell he took his
leave and the cousins with their guide and faithful servant spurred
onwards at a brisk pace until the open fields of the settlement were
exchanged for the deep and gloomy woodlands




chapter vii


the sun shone out clearly and brilliantly and the tree-tops from which
the winds had already shaken the rain rustled freshly to the more
moderate breezes that had succeeded them and roland animated by the
change by the brisk pace at which he was riding and by the hope of soon
overtaking his fellow-exiles met the joyous look of his kinswoman with a
countenance no longer disturbed by care

and yet there was a solemnity in the scene around them that might have
called for other and more sombre feelings the forest into which they had
plunged was of the grand and gloomy character which the fertility of the
soil and the absence of the axe for a thousand years imprint on the
western woodlands especially in the vicinity of rivers oaks elms and
walnuts tulip-trees and beeches with other monarchs of the wilderness
lifted their trunks like so many pillars green with mosses and ivies
and swung their majestic arms tufted with mistletoe far over head
supporting a canopy a series of domes and arches without end that had
for ages overshadowed the soil their roots often concealed by a billowy
undergrowth of shrubs and bushes oftener by brakes of the gigantic and
evergreen cane forming fences as singular as they were for the most
part impenetrable were yet at times visible where open glades
stretched through the woods broken only by buttressed trunks and by the
stems of colossal vines hanging from the boughs like cables or the arms
of an oriental banyan while their luxuriant tops rolled in union with
the leafy roofs that supported them the vague and shadowy prospects
opened by these occasional glades stirred the imagination and produced a
feeling of solitude in the mind greater perhaps than would have been
felt had the view been continually bounded by a green wall of canes

the road if such it could be called through this noble forest was like
that the emigrants had so long pursued through the wilderness a mere
path designated where the wood was open by blazes or axe-marks on the
trees and where the undergrowth was dense a narrow track cut through
the canes and shrubs scarce sufficient in many places to allow the
passage of two horsemen abreast though when as was frequently the case
it followed the ancient routes of the bisons to fords and salt-licks it
presented as bruce had described a wide and commodious highway
practicable even to wheeled carriages

the gait of the little party over this road was at first rapid and cheery
enough but by and by having penetrated deeper into the wood where
breezes and sunbeams were alike unknown they found their progress
impeded by a thousand pools and sloughs the consequences of the storm
that stretched from brake to brake these interruptions promised to make
the evening journey longer than roland had anticipated but he caught at
intervals the fresh foot-prints of his comrades in the soil where it was
not exposed to the rains and reflected with pleasure that travelling
even at the slowest pace he must reach the ford where he expected to
find them encamped long before dark he felt therefore no uneasiness
at the delay nor did he think any of those obstacles to rapid progress a
cause for regret that gave him the better opportunity to interchange
ideas with his fair kinswoman

his only concern arose from the conduct of his guide a rough
dark-visaged man who had betrayed from the first moment of starting a
sullen countenance indicative of his disinclination to the duty assigned
him which feeling evidently grew stronger the further he advanced
nowithstanding sundry efforts forrester made to bring him to a better
humour he displayed no desire to enter into conversation with the
soldier replying to such questions as were directed at him with a
brevity little short of rudeness and his smothered exclamations of
impatience whenever his delicate followers slackened their pace at a bog
or gully which he had himself dashed through with a manly contempt of
mud and mire somewhat stirred the choler of the young captain

they had perhaps followed him a distance of four miles into the forest
when the occurrence of a wider and deeper pool than ordinary producing a
corresponding delay on the part of roland who was somewhat averse to
plunging with edith up to the saddle-girths in mire drew from him a very
unmannerly though not the less hearty execration on the delicacy of
them thar persons who as he expressed it stumped at a mud-hole as
skearily as if every tadpole in it war a screeching injun

of this explosion of ill-temper roland took no notice until he had with
the assistance of emperor the negro effected a safe passage for edith
over the puddle in the course of which he had leisure to observe that
the path now struck into a wide buffalo-street that swept away through a
wilderness of wood and cane-brake in nearly a straight line for a
considerable distance he observed also that the road looked drier and
less broken than usual his satisfaction at which had the good effect of
materially abating the rage into which he had been thrown by the uncivil
bearing of the guide nevertheless he had no sooner brought his
kinswoman safely to land than leaving her in the charge of emperor he
galloped up to the side of his conductor and gave vent to his
indignation in the following pithy query 

my friend said he will you have the goodness to inform me whether
you have ever lived in a land where courtesy to strangers and kindness
and respect to women are ranked among the virtues of manhood

the man replied only by a fierce and angry stare and plying the ribs of
his horse with his heels he dashed onwards but roland kept at his side
not doubting that a little more wholesome reproof would be of profit to
the man as well as advantageous to his own interests

i ask that question he continued because a man from such a land
seeing strangers and one of them a female struggling in a bog would
instead of standing upon dry land making disrespectful remarks have
done his best to help them through it

strannger said the man drawing up his horse and looking
notwithstanding his anger as if he felt the rebuke to be in a measure
just i am neither hog nor dog injun nor outlandish niggur but a
man a man strannger outside and inside in flesh blood and spirit
jest as my maker made me though thar may be something of the scale-bark
and parsimmon about me i'll not deny for i've heer'd on it before i
axes the lady's pardon if i've offended and thar's the eend on't

the end of it said forrester will be much more satisfactory if you
give no further occasion for complaint but now he continued edith
drawing nigh let us ride on and as fast as you like for the road seems
both open and good

strannger said the guide without budging an inch you have axed me a
question and according to the fa'r rule of the woods it's my right to
ax you another

very well said roland assenting to the justice of the rule ask it
and he brief

what you war saying of the road is true thar it goes wide open
cl'ar and straight with as good a fence on both sides of it to keep in
stragglers as war ever made of ash oak or chestnut rails though it's
nothing but a natteral bank of cane-brake and so it runs jest as cl'ar
and wide all the way to the river

i am glad to hear it was the soldier's reply but now for your
question

hy'ar it is said the man flinging out his hand with angry energy i
wants to ax of you as a sodger for i've heer'd you're of the reggelar
sarvice whether it's a wiser and more christian affa'r when thar's
injuns in the land a murdering of your neighbours wives and children
and all the settlement's in a screech and a cry to send an able-bodied
man to fight them or to tote him off a day's journey thar and back
ag'in to track a road that a blind man on a blind horse could travel
without axing questions of anybody thar's my question he added
somewhat vehemently and now let's have a sodger's answer

my good friend said roland a little offended and yet more
embarrassed by the interrogatory none can tell better than yourself
how much or how little occasion i may have for a guide your question
therefore i leave you to answer yourself if you think your duty calls
you to abandon a woman in the wild woods to such guidance as one wholly
unacquainted with them can give you can depart as soon as you think fit
for i cannot 

the guide gave him no time to finish the sentence you're right
strannger he cried thar is your road as plain as the way up a
hickory b'aring to a camp of old friends and acquaintances and hy'ar
is mine running right slap among fighting injuns

and with that he turned his horse's head and flourishing his right hand
armed with the ever constant rifle above his own and uttering a whoop
expressive of the wild pleasure he felt at being released from his
ignoble duty he dashed across the pool and galloped in a moment out of
sight leaving roland and his party confounded at the desertion

an outlandish niggur muttered old emperor on whom this expression of
the guide had produced no very favourable effect guess the gemman white
man is a niggur himself and a rogue and a potater or whatsomever you
call em leab a lady and a gemman lost in the woods and neither take
em on nor take em back lor-a-massy

to this half-soliloquised expression of indignation the soldier felt
inclined to add a few bitter invectives of his own but edith treating
the matter lightly and affecting to be better pleased at the rude man's
absence than she had been with his company he abated his own wrath and
acknowledged that the desertion afforded the best proof of the safety of
the road since he could not believe that the fellow with all his
roughness and inhumanity would have been so base as to leave them while
really surrounded by difficulties he remembered enough of bruce's
description of the road which he had taken care should be minute and
exact to feel persuaded that the principal obstructions were now over
and that as the guide had said there was no possibility of wandering
from the path they had already travelled nearly half the distance to the
river and to accomplish the remainder they had yet four hours of
day-light he saw no reason why they should not proceed alone trusting
to their good fate for a fortunate issue to their enterprise to return
to the fort would be only to separate themselves further from their
friends without ensuring them a better guide or indeed any guide at
all since it was highly probable they would find it only occupied by
women and children in a word he satisfied himself that nothing remained
for him but to continue his journey and trust to his own sagacity to end
it to advantage

he set out accordingly followed by edith and emperor the latter
bringing up the rear in true military style and handling his rifle as
if almost desirous of finding an opportunity to use it in the service of
his young mistress

in this manner they travelled onwards with but little interruption for
more than a mile and roland was beginning anxiously to look for the path
that led to the lower ford when emperor galloped to the van and brought
the party to a halt by reporting that he heard the sound of hoofs
following at a distance behind

perhaps perhaps said edith while the gleam of her eye shining with
sudden pleasure indicated how little real satisfaction she had felt at
the desertion of their conductor perhaps it is the sour fellow the
guide coming back ashamed of his misconduct

we will soon see said roland turning his horse to reconnoitre a
proceeding that was however rendered unnecessary by the hurried speed
of the comer who dashing suddenly round a bend in the road disclosed
to his wondering eyes not the tall frame and sullen aspect of the guide
but the lighter figure and fairer visage of the girl telie doe she was
evidently arrayed for travel having donned her best attire of blue
cloth with a little cap of the same colour on her head under which her
countenance beaming with exercise and anxiety looked in both roland's
and edith's eyes extremely pretty much more so indeed than either had
deemed it to be while secured behind the cushion or pillion on which
she rode for not a jot of saddle had she was a little bundle
containing such worldly comforts as were necessary to one seriously bent
upon a journey she was mounted upon a sprightly pony which she managed
with more address and courage than would have been augured from her
former timorous demeanour and it was plain that she had put him to his
mettle through the woods with but little regard to the sloughs and
puddles which had so greatly embarrassed the fair edith indeed it
appeared that the exercise which had infused animation into her
countenance had bestowed a share also on her spirit for having checked
her horse an instant and looked a little abashed at the sudden sight of
the strangers she recovered herself in a moment and riding boldly up
she proceeded without waiting to be questioned to explain the cause of
her appearance she had met the deserter she said returning to the
station and thinking it was not right the stranger lady should be left
without a guide in the woods she had ridden after her to offer her
services

it was at least somewhat surprising roland could not avoid saying
that the fellow should have found you already equipt in the woods

at this innuendo telie was somewhat embarrassed but more so when
looking towards edith as if to address her reply to her she caught the
inquiring look of the latter made still more expressive by the
recollection which edith retained of the earnest entreaty telie had made
the preceding night to be taken into her service

i will not tell you a falsehood ma'am she said at last with a firm
voice i was not on the road by chance i came to follow you i knew the
man you had to guide you was unwilling to go and i thought he would
leave you as he has done and besides the road is not so clear as it
seems it branches off to so many of the salt-licks and the tracks are
so washed away by the rains that none but one that knows it can be sure
of keeping it long

and how inquired edith very pointedly for in her heart she
suspected the little damsel was determined to enter her service whether
she would or not and had actually run away from her friends for the
purpose how after you have led us to our party do you expect to
return again to your friends

if you will let me go with you as far as jackson's station the
settlement at which it was originally determined the emigrants should
pass the night said the maiden humbly i will find friends there who
will take me home and perhaps our own people will come for me for they
are often visiting about among the stations

this declaration made in a tone that convinced edith the girl had given
over all hopes of being received into her protection unless she could
remove opposition by the services she might render on the way pointed
out also an easy mode of getting rid of her when a separation should be
advisable and thus removed the only objection she felt to accept her
proffered guidance as for roland however he expressed much natural
reluctance to drag a young and inexperienced female so far from her home
leaving her afterwards to return as she might but he perceived that her
presence gave courage to his kinswoman he felt that her acquaintance
with the path was more to be relied upon than his own sagacity and he
knew not if he even rejected her offered services altogether how he
could with any grace communicate the refusal and leave her abandoned to
her own discretion in the forest he felt a little inclined at first to
wonder at the interest she seemed to have taken in his cousin's welfare
but by and by he reflected that perhaps after all her motive lay in
no better or deeper feeling than a mere girlish desire to make her way
to the neighbouring station twenty miles make but a neighbourly distance
in the wilderness to enjoy a frolic among her gadding acquaintance
this reflection ended the struggle in his mind and turning to her with a
smiling countenance he said if you are so sure of getting home my
pretty maid you may be as certain we will be glad of your company and
guidance but let us delay no longer

the girl starting at these words with alacrity switched her pony and
darted to the head of the little party as if addressing herself to her
duty in a business-like way and there she maintained her position with
great zeal although roland and edith endeavoured for kindness sake to
make her sensible they desired her to ride with them as a companion and
not at a distance like a pioneer the faster they spurred however the
more zealously she applied her switch and her pony being both spirited
and fresh while their own horses were both not a little the worse for
their long journey she managed to keep in front maintaining a gait that
promised in a short time to bring them to the banks of the river

they had ridden perhaps a mile in this manner when a sudden opening in
the cane-brake on the right hand at a place where stood a beech-tree
riven by a thunderbolt in former years but still spreading its shattered
ruins in the air convinced roland that he had at last reached the road
to the lower ford which bruce had so strictly cautioned him to avoid
what therefore was his surprise when telie having reached the tree
turned at once into the by-road leaving the direct path which they had
so long pursued and which still swept away before them as spacious and
uninterrupted save by occasional pools as ever

you are wrong he cried checking his steed

this is the road sir said the girl though in some trepidation

by no means said forrester that path leads to the lower ford here
is the shivered beech which the colonel described to me

yes sir said telie hurriedly it is the mark they call it the
crooked finger-post

and a crooked road it is like to lead us if we follow it said roland
it leads to the lower ford and is not therefore our road i remember
the colonel's direction

yes sir said telie anxiously to take the beech on the right
shoulder and then down four miles to the water

precisely so said the soldier with only this difference for go
which way we will the tree being on the right side of each path we must
still keep it on the right shoulder that the road to the upper ford
which i am now travelling is the one for our purposes of this i am
confident

and yet roland said edith somewhat alarmed at this difference of
opinion where unanimity was so much more desirable the young woman
should know best

yes cried telie eagerly i have lived here almost seven years and
been across the river more than as many times this is the shortest and
safest way

it may be both the shortest and safest said forrester whose respect
for the girl's knowledge of the woods and ability to guide him through
them began to be vastly diminished but this is the road mr bruce
described of this i am positive and to make the matter still more
certain if need be here are horse-tracks fresh numerous scarcely
washed by the rain and undoubtedly made by our old companions whereas
that path seems not to have been trodden for a twelve-month

i will guide you right faltered telie with anxious voice

my good girl said the soldier kindly but positively you must allow
me to doubt your ability to do that at least on that path here is our
road and we must follow it

he resumed it as he spoke and edith conquered by his arguments which
seemed decisive followed him but looking back after having proceeded a
few steps she saw the baffled guide still lingering on the rejected
path and wringing her hands with grief and disappointment

you will not remain behind us said edith riding back to her you
see my cousin is positive you must surely be mistaken

i am not mistaken said the girl earnestly and oh he will repent
that ever he took his own way through this forest

how can that be what cause have you to say so

i do not know murmured the damsel in woeful perplexity but but
sometimes that road is dangerous

sometimes all roads are so said edith her patience failing when she
found telie could give no better reason for her opposition let us
continue my kinsman is waiting us and we must lose no more time by
delay

with these words she again trotted forward and telie after hesitating
a moment thought fit to follow

but now the animation that had a few moments before beamed forth in
every look and gesture of the maiden gave place to dejection of spirits
and even as edith thought to alarm she seemed as anxious now to linger
in the rear as she had been before to preserve a bold position in front
her eyes wandered timorously from brake to tree as if in fear lest each
should conceal a lurking enemy and often as edith looked back she was
struck with the singularly mournful and distressed expression of her
countenance




chapter viii


these symptoms of anxiety and alarm affected edith's own spirits they
did more they shook her faith in the justice of her kinsman's
conclusions his arguments in relation to the road were indeed
unanswerable and telie had offered none to weaken them yet why should
she betray such distress if they were upon the right one and why in
fact should she not be supposed to know both the right and the wrong
since she had as she said so frequently travelled both

these questions edith could not refrain asking of roland who professed
himself unable to answer them unless by supposing the girl had become
confused as he thought was not improbable or had in reality been so
long absent from the forest as to have forgotten its paths altogether
which was likely enough as she seemed a very simple-minded
inexperienced creature but why need we he said trouble ourselves
to find reasons for the poor girl's opposition here are the tracks of
our friends broader and deeper than ever here they wind down into the
hollow and there you may see where they have floundered through that
vile pool that is still turbid where they crossed it a horrible
quagmire but courage my fair cousin it is only such difficulties as
these which the road can lead us into

such were the expressions with which the young soldier endeavoured to
reassure his kinswoman's courage his own confidence remaining still
unmoved although in secret he felt somewhat surprised at the coincidence
between the girl's recommendations of the by-road and the injunctions of
his morning dream but while pondering over the wonder he had arrived at
the quagmire alluded to through which the difficulties of conducting his
cousin were sufficiently great to banish other matters for a moment from
his mind having crossed it at last in safety he paused to give such
instructions or assistance as might be needed by his two followers when
edith who had halted at his side suddenly laid her hand on his arm and
exclaimed with a visage of terror hark roland do you hear what is
that

heard him massa ejaculated emperor from the middle of the bog with
voice still more quavering than the maiden's and lips rapidly changing
from spanish-brown to clayey-yellow heard him massa reckon it's an
injun lorra-massy

peace fool cried forrester bending his looks from the alarmed
countenance of his kinswoman to the quarter whence had proceeded the
sound which had so suddenly struck terror into her bosom

hark roland it rises again she exclaimed and roland now distinctly
heard a sound in the depth of the forest to the right hand as of the
yell of a human being but at a great distance off at the place which
they had reached the canes and undergrowth of other kinds had
disappeared and a wide glade stretching over hill and hollow swept
away from both sides of the road further than the eye could see the
trees standing wider apart than usual were if possible of a more
majestic stature their wide and massive tops were so thickly interlaced
that not a single sunbeam found its way among the gloomy arcades below a
wilder more solitary and more awe-inspiring spot roland had not before
seen and it was peculiarly fitted to add double effect to sights and
sounds of a melancholy or fearful character accordingly when the cry
was repeated as it soon was though at the same distance as before it
came echoing among the hollow arches of the woods with a wild and almost
unearthly cadence the utterance as it-seemed of mortal agony and
despair that breathed a secret horror through the breasts of all

it is the jibbenainosay muttered the shivering telie these are the
woods he used to range in most and they say he screams after his prey
it is not too late let us go back

an injun massa said emperor stuttering with fright and yet
proceeding both to handle his arms and to give encouragement to his young
mistress which his age and privileged character as well as the urgency
of the occasion entitled him to do don't be afraid missie edie
nebber mind ole emperor will fight and die for missie old massa john's
daughter

hist said roland as another scream rose on the air louder and more
thrilling than before

it is the cry of a human being said edith of a man in distress

it is indeed replied the soldier of a man in great peril or
suffering remain here on the road and if anything nay if you will
follow me it may be better but let it be at a distance if anything
happens to me set spurs to your horses telie here can at least lead
you back to the fort

with these words and without waiting to hear the remonstrances or
remove the terrors of his companions the young man turned his horse into
the wood and guided by the cries which were almost incessant soon
found himself in the vicinity of the place from which they proceeded it
was a thick grove of beeches of the colossal growth of the west their
stems as tall and straight as the pines of the alleghanies and their
boughs arched and pendulous like those of the elm almost sweeping the
earth below over which they cast shadows so dark that scarce anything
was visible beneath them save their hoary and spectral trunks

as roland followed by his little party approached this spot the cries
of the unknown and as yet unseen sufferer fearful even at a distance
grew into the wildest shrieks of fear mingled with groans howls broken
prayers and execrations and half-inarticulate expressions now of
fondling entreaty now of fierce and frantic command that seemed
addressed to a second person hard by

a thousand strange and appalling conceits had crept into roland's mind
when he first heard the cries one while he almost fancied he had
stumbled upon a gang of savages who were torturing a prisoner to death
another moment he thought the yells must proceed from some unlucky
hunter perishing by inches in the grasp of a wild beast perhaps a bear
or panther with which animals it was easy to believe the forest might
abound with such horrible fancies oppressing his mind his surprise
may be imagined when having cocked his rifle and thrown open his
holsters to be prepared for the worst he rushed into the grove and
beheld a spectacle no more formidable than was presented by a single
individual a man in a shaggy blanket-coat sitting on horseback under
one of the most venerable of the beeches and uttering those diabolical
outcries that had alarmed the party for no imaginable purpose as roland
was at first inclined to suspect unless for his own private diversion

a second look however convinced the soldier that the wretched being had
sufficient cause for his clamour being in truth in a situation almost
as dreadful as any roland had imagined his arms were pinioned behind his
back and his neck secured in a halter taken as it appeared from his
steed by which he was fastened to a large bough immediately above his
head with nothing betwixt him and death save the horse on which he
sat a young and terrified beast at whose slightest start or motion he
must have swung off and perished while he possessed no means of
restraining the animal whatever except such as lay in strength of leg
and virtue of voice

in this terrible situation it was plain he had remained for a
considerable period his clothes and hair for his hat had fallen to the
ground being saturated with rain while his face purple with blood his
eyes swollen and protruding from their orbits with a most ghastly look of
agony and fear showed how often the uneasiness of his horse round whose
body his legs were wrapped with the convulsive energy of despair had
brought him to the very verge of strangulation

the yells of mortal terror for such they had been with which he had so
long filled the forest were changed to shrieks of rapture as soon as he
beheld help approach in the person of the astonished soldier praised be
the etarnal he roared cut me loose strannger praised be the
etarnal and this here dumb beast cut me loose strannger for the
love of god

such was roland's intention for which purpose he had already clapped his
hand to his sabre to employ it in a service more humane than any it had
previously known when unfortunately the voice of the fellow did what
his distorted countenance had failed to do and revealed to roland's
indignant eyes the author of all his present difficulties the thief of
the pinfold the robber of brown briareus in a word the redoubtable
captain ralph stackpole

in a moment roland understood the mystery which he had been before too
excited to inquire into he remembered the hints of bruce and he had
learned enough of border customs and principles to perceive that the
justice of the woods had at last overtaken the horse-thief the pursuing
party had captured him taken him in the very manner while still in
possession of the two-year-old pony and at once adjudged him to the
penalty prescribed by the border code tied his arms noosed him with
the halter of the stolen horse and left him to swing as soon as the
animal should be tired of supporting him there was a kind of dreadful
poetical justice in thus making the stolen horse the thief's executioner
it gave the animal himself an opportunity to wreak vengeance for all
wrongs received and at the same time allowed his captor the rare
privilege of galloping on his back into eternity

such was the mode of settling such offences against the peace and dignity
of the settlements such was the way in which stackpole had been reduced
to his unenviable situation and that all passers-by might take note
that the execution had not been done without authority there was painted
upon the smooth white bark of the tree in large black letters traced by
a finger well charged with moistened gunpowder the ominous name judge
lynch the rhadamanthus of the forest whose decisions are yet respected
in the land and whose authority sometimes bids fair to supersede that of
all erring human tribunals

thus tied up his rifle knife and ammunition laid under a tree hard by
that he might have the satisfaction if satisfaction it could be of
knowing they were in safety the executioners had left him to his fate
and ridden away long since to attend to other important affairs of the
colony

the moment that roland understood in whose service he was drawing his
sword a change came over the spirit of his thoughts and feelings and he
returned it very composedly to its sheath much to the satisfaction of
the negro emperor who recognising the unfortunate ralph at the same
instant cried aloud top massa t ar captain stackpole what stole
brown briery reckon i'll touch the pony on the rib hah hanging too
good for him white niggah t'ief hah

with that the incensed negro made as if he would have driven the pony
from under the luckless ralph but was prevented by his master who
taking a second survey of the spectacle motioned to the horror-struck
females to retire and prepared himself to follow them

tarnal death to you captain you won't leave me cried ralph in
terror honour bright help him that needs help that's the rule for a
christian

villain said roland sternly i have no help to give you you are
strung up according to the laws of the settlements with which i have no
desire to interfere i am the last man you should ask for pity

i don't ax your pity tarnal death to me i ax your help roared
ralph cut me loose is the word and then sw'ar at me atter i stole
your hoss thar well whar's the harm didn't he fling me and kick me
and bite me into the bargain the cursed savage and ar'n't you got him
ag'in as good as ever and besides didn't that etarnal old bruce fob me
off with a beast good for nothing and talk big to me besides and warn't
that all fa'r provocation an didn't you yourself sw'ar ag'in shaking
paws with me and treat me as if i war no gentleman tarnal death to me
cut me loose or i'll haunt you when i'm a ghost i will tarnal death
to me

cut him down roland for heaven's sake said edith whom the
surprise and terror of the spectacle at first rendered speechless you
surely no roland you surely can't mean to leave him to perish

upon my soul said the soldier and we are sorry to record a speech
representing him in a light so unamiable i don't see what right i have
to release him and i really have not the least inclination to do so the
rascal is the cause of all our difficulties and if evil should happen
us he will be the cause of that too but for him we should be now safe
with our party and besides as i said before he is hanged according to
kentucky law a very good law as far as it regards horse-thieves for
whom hanging is too light a punishment

nevertheless release him save the poor wretch's life reiterated
edith to whom stackpole perceiving in her his only friend now
addressed the most piteous cries and supplications the law is
murderous its makers and executioners barbarians save him roland i
charge you i entreat you

he owes his life to your intercession said the soldier and drawing
his sabre again but with no apparent good will he divided the halter by
which ralph was suspended and the wretch was free

cut the tug the buffalo-tug shouted the culprit thrusting his arms
as far from his back as he could and displaying the thong of bison-skin
which his struggles had almost buried in his flesh a single touch of the
steel rewarded by such a yell of transport as was never before heard
in those savage retreats sufficed to sever the bond and stackpole
leaping on the earth began to testify his joy in modes as novel as they
were frantic his first act was to fling his arms round the neck of his
steed which he hugged and kissed with the most rapturous affection
doubtless in requital of the docility it had shown when docility was so
necessary to its rider's life his second to leap half a dozen times
into the air feeling his neck all the time and uttering the most
singular and vociferous cries as if to make double trial of the
condition of his windpipe his third to bawl aloud directing the
important question to the soldier how many days has it been since they
hanged me war it to-day or yesterday or the day before or war it a
whole year ago for may i be next hung to the horn of a buffalo instead
of the limb of a beech tree if i didn't feel as if i had been squeaking
thar ever since the beginning of creation cock-a-doodle-doo him that
ar'nt born to be hanged won't be hanged no-how then running to edith
who sat watching his proceedings with silent amazement he flung himself
on his knees seized the hem of her riding-habit which he kissed with
the fervour of an adorer exclaiming with a vehement sincerity that made
the whole action still more strangely ludicrous oh you splendiferous
creatur you angeliferous anngel here am i ralph stackpole the
screamer that can whip all kentucky white black mixed and injun and
i'm the man to go with you to the ends of the arth to fight die work
beg and steal bosses for you i am and you may make a little dog of me
you may or a niggur or a boss or a door-post or a back-log or a
dinner tarnal death to me but you may eat me i'm the man to feel a
favour partickelarly when it comes to helping me out of a halter and so
jist say the word who i shall lick to begin on for i'm your slave jist
as much as that niggur to go with you as i said afore to the ends of
the arth and the length of kentucky over

away with you you scoundrel and jackanapes said roland for to this
ardent expression of gratitude edith was herself too much frightened to
reply

strannger cried the offended horse-thief you cut the tug and you
cut the halter and so though you did it only on hard axing i'd take as
many hard words of you as you can pick out of a dictionary i will
tarnal death to me but as for madam thar the anngel she saved my
life and i go my death in her sarvice and now's the time to show
sarvice for thar's danger abroad in the forest

danger echoed roland his anxiety banishing the disgust with which he
was so much inclined to regard the worthy horse-thief what makes you
say that

strannger replied ralph with a lengthened visage and a gravity
somewhat surprising for him i seed the jibbenainosay tarnal death to
me but i seed him as plain as ever i seed old salt i war a-hanging
thar and squeaking and cussing and talking soft nonsense to the pony
to keep him out of his tantrums when what should i see but a great
crittur come tramping through the forest right off yander by the fallen
oak with a big b'ar before him 

pish said the soldier what has this to do with danger

beca'se and because said ralph when you see the jibbenainosay
thar's always abbregynes in the cover i never seed the crittur
before but i reckon it war he for thar's nothing like him in natur
and so i'm for cutting out of the forest jist on the track of a streak of
lightning now hy'yar now thar but on a full run without stopping and
so if anngeliferous madam is willing thump me round the arth with a
crab-apple if i don't holp her out of the bushes and do all her
fighting into the bargain i will tarnal death to me

footnote abbregynes aborigines

you may go about your business said roland with as much sternness as
contempt we will have none of your base company

whoop whoo whoo whoo don't rifle me for i'm danngerous yelled
the demibarbarian springing on his stolen horse and riding up to edith
say the word marm he cried for i'll fight for you or run for you
take scalp or cut stick shake fist or show leg anything in reason or
out of reason strannger thar's as brash as a new hound in a b'ar
fight or a young boss in a corn-field and no safe friend in a forest
say the word marm or if you think it ar'nt manners to speak to a
strannger jist shake your little finger and i'll follow like a dog and
do you dog's sarvice or if you don't like me say the word or shake
t'other finger and tarnal death to me but i'll be off like an elk of
the prairies

footnote to rifle to ruffle

footnote brash rash head-strong over-valiant

you may go said edith not at all solicitous to retain a follower of
mr stackpole's character and conversation we have no occasion for your
assistance

farewell said ralph and turning and giving his pony a thump with his
fist and a kick with each heel and uttering a shrill whoop he darted
away through the forest and was soon out of sight




chapter ix


the course of stackpole was through the woods in a direction immediately
opposite to that by which roland had ridden to his assistance

he is going to the lower ford said telie anxiously it is not too
late for us to follow him if there are indians in the wood it is the
only way to escape them

and why should we believe there are indians in the wood demanded
roland because that half-mad rogue made still madder by his terrors
saw something which his fancy converted into the imaginary nick of the
woods you must give me a better reason than that my good telie if you
would have me desert the road i have no faith in your jibbenainosays

but a better reason than her disinclination to travel it and her fears
lest if indians were abroad they would be found lying in ambush at the
upper and more frequented pass of the river the girl had none to give
and in consequence roland though secretly wondering at her
pertinacity and still connecting it in thought with his oft-remembered
dream expressing some impatience at the delays they had already
experienced led the way back to the buffalo-road resolved to prosecute
it with vigour but fate had prepared for him other and more serious
obstructions

he had scarce regained the path before he became sensible from the
tracks freshly printed in the damp earth that a horseman coming from
the very river towards which he was bending his way had passed by whilst
he was engaged in the wood liberating the horse-thief this was a
circumstance that both pleased and annoyed him it was so far agreeable
as it seemed to offer the best proof that the road was open with none of
those dreadful savages about it who had so long haunted the brain of
telie doe but what chiefly concerned the young soldier was the knowledge
that he had lost an opportunity of inquiring after his friends and
ascertaining whether they had really pitched their camp on the banks of
the river a circumstance which he now rather hoped than dared to be
certain of the tempest not seeming to have been so violent in that
quarter as of a necessity to bring the company to a halt if they had
not encamped in the expected place but on the contrary had continued
their course to the appointed station he saw nothing before him but the
gloomy prospect of concluding his journey over an unknown road after
night-fall or returning to the station he had left also by night for
much time had been lost by the various delays and the day was now
declining fast

these considerations threw a damp over his spirits but taught him the
necessity of activity and he was accordingly urging his little party
forward with such speed as he could when there was suddenly heard at a
distance on the rear the sound of fire-arms as if five or six pieces
were discharged together followed by cries not less wild and alarming
than those uttered by the despairing horse-thief

these bringing the party to a stand the quick ears of the soldier
detected the rattling of hoofs on the road behind and presently their
came rushing towards them with furious speed a solitary horseman his
head bare his locks streaming in the wind and his whole appearance
betraying the extremity of confusion and terror which was the more
remarkable as he was well mounted and armed with the usual rifle knife
and hatchet of the back-woodsman he looked as if flying from pursuing
foes his eyes being cast backwards and that so eagerly that he failed
to notice the party of wondering strangers drawn up before him on the
road until saluted by a halloo from roland at which he checked his
steed looking for an instant ten times more confounded and frightened
than before

you tarnation critturs he at last bawled with the accents of one
driven to desperation if there a'n't no dodging you then there
a'n't here's for you you everlasting varmints due your darndest

with that he clubbed his rifle and advanced towards the party in what
seemed a paroxysm of insane fury brandishing the weapon and rolling his
eyes with a ferocity that could have only arisen from his being in that
happy frame of mind which is properly termed frightened out of fear

how you villain said roland in amazement do you take us for wild
indians

what by the holy hokey and a'n't you cried the stranger his rage
giving way to the most lively transports christian men he exclaimed
in admiration and one of em a niggur and two of em wimming oh hokey
you're capting forrester and i've heerd on you thought there was
nothing in the wood but injuns blast their ugly picturs and blast him
sy jones as was that brought me among em and now i'm talking of em
capting don't stop to ax questions but run cut and run capting for
there's an everlasting sight of em behind me six of em capting or
my name a'n't pardon dodge six of em all except one and him i
shot the blasted crittur for you see they followed me behind and
they cut me off before and there was no dodging em dodge's my name
and dodging's my natur without getting lost in the woods and it was
either losing myself or my scalp and so that riz my ebenezer and i
banged the first of em all to smash if i didn't then it a'n't no
matter

what in heaven's name said roland overcome by the man's volubility
and alarm together what means all this are there indians behind us

five of em and the dead feller shocking long-legged crittur he
was jumped out of a bush and seized me by the bridle hokey how he
skeared me gun went off of her own accord and shot him into bits as
small as fourpence-ha'pennies then there was a squeaking and squalling
and the hull of e'm let fly at me and then i cut on the back track
and they took and took atter and i calculate if we wait here a quarter
of a minute longer they will be on us jist like devils and roaring
lions but where shall we run you can't gin us a hint how to make way
through the woods shocking bad woods to be lost in bad place here for
talking capting right twixt two fires six injuns behind and one of
em dead and an almighty passel before the ford's full on em

what said roland did you pass the ford and is not colonel johnson
with his emigrants there

not a man on em saw em streaking through the mud half way to
jackson's everlasting lying critturs them emigrants told me there was
no injuns on the road when what should i do but see a hull grist on em
dodging among the bushes at the river to surround me the tarnation
critturs but i kinder had the start on em and i whipped and i cut
and i run and i dodged and so says i i've beat you you tarnation
scalping varmints when up jumps that long-legged feller and the five
behind him and blast em that riz my corruption and i 

in a word said roland impatiently and with a stern accent assumed
perhaps to reassure his kinswoman whom the alarming communications of
the stranger uttered in an agony of terror and haste filled with an
agitation which she could not conceal you have seen indians or you say
you have if you tell the truth there is no time left for deliberation
if a falsehood 

why should we wait upon the road to question and wonder said telie
doe with a boldness and firmness that at another moment would have
excited surprise why should we wait here while the indians may be
approaching the forest is open and the lower ford is free

if you can yet lead us thither said roland eagerly all is not yet
lost we can neither advance nor return on maiden for the love of
heaven

these hasty expressions revealed to edith the deep and serious light in
which her kinsman regarded their present situation though at first
seeking to hide his anxiety under a veil of composure in fact there was
not an individual present on whom the fatal news of the vicinity of the
redman had produced a more alarming impression than on roland young
bravo acquainted with war and accustomed to scenes of blood and peril
it is not to be supposed that he entertained fear on his own account but
the presence of one whom he loved and whom he would have rescued from
danger at any moment at the sacrifice of his own life thrice over was
enough to cause and excuse a temporary fainting of spirit and a desire
to fly the scene of peril of which under any other circumstances he
would have been heartily ashamed the suddenness of the terror for up to
the present moment he had dreamed of no difficulty comprising danger or
of no danger implying the presence of savages in the forest had somewhat
shocked his mind from its propriety and left him in a manner unfitted to
exercise the decision and energy so necessary to the welfare of his
feeble and well-nigh helpless followers the vastness of his
embarrassment all disclosed at once his friends and fellow-emigrants
now far away the few miles which he had to the last hoped separated
him from them converted into leagues indian enemies at hand advance
and retreat both alike cut off and night approaching fast in which
without a guide any attempt to retreat through the wild forest would be
as likely to secure his destruction as deliverance these were
circumstances that crowded into his mind with benumbing effect
engrossing his faculties when the most active use of them was essential
to the preservation of his party

it was at this moment of weakness and confusion while uttering what was
meant to throw some little discredit over the story of dodge to abate
the terrors of edith that the words of telie doe fell on his ears
bringing both aid and hope to his embarrassed spirits she at least
was acquainted with the woods she at least could conduct him if not
to the fortified station he had left and bitterly now did he regret
having left it to the neglected ford of the river which her former
attempts to lead him thither and the memory of his dream caused him now
to regard as a city of refuge pointed out by destiny itself

you shall have your way at last fair telie he said with a laugh
but not with merriment fate speaks for you and whether i will or not
we must go to the lower ford

you will never repent it said the girl the bright looks which she had
worn for the few moments she was permitted to control the motions of the
party returning to her visage and seeming to emanate from a rejoicing
spirit they will not think of waylaying us at the lower ford

with that she darted into the wood and followed by the others
including the new-comer dodge was soon at a considerable distance from
the road

singular said roland to edith at whose rein he now rode endeavouring
to remove her terrors which though she uttered no words were
manifestly overpowering singular that the girl should look so glad and
fearless while we are i believe all horribly frightened it is
however a good omen when one so timorous as she casts aside fear there
is little reason for others to be frighted

i hope i hope so murmured edith but but i have had my omens
roland and they were evil ones i dreamed you smile at me

i do said the soldier and not more at your joyless tones my fair
cousin than at the coincidence of our thoughts i dreamed for i
also have had my visions last night that some one came to me and
whispered in my ear to cross the river at the lower ford the upper
being dangerous verily i shall hereafter treat my dreams with respect
i suppose i hope were it only to prove we have a good angel in
common that you dreamed the same thing

no it was not that said edith with a sad and anxious countenance
it was a dream that has always been followed by evil i dreamed  but
it will offend you cousin

what said roland a dream you dreamed perhaps that i forgot both
wisdom and affection when for the sake of this worthless beast
briareus i drew you into difficulty and peril

no no said edith earnestly and then added in a low voice i
dreamed of richard braxley

curse him muttered the youth with tones of bitter passion it is to
him we owe all that now afflicts us poverty and exile our distresses
and difficulties our fears and our dangers for a wooer he added with
a smile of equal bitterness methinks he has fallen on but a rough way
of proving his regard but you dreamed of him well what was it he came
to you with the look of a beaten dog fawned at your feet and displaying
that infernal will marry me quoth he fair maid and i will be a
greater rascal than before i will burn this will and consent to enjoy
roland forrester's lands and houses in right of my wife instead of
claiming them in trust for an heir no longer in the land of the living
cur and but for you edith i would have repaid his insolence as it
deserved but you ever intercede for your worst enemies there is that
confounded stackpole now i vow to heaven i am sorry i cut the rascal
down but you dreamed of braxley what said the villain

he said replied edith who had listened mournfully but in silence to
the young man's hasty expressions like one who was too well acquainted
with the impetuosity of his temper to think of opposing him in his angry
moments or perhaps because her spirits were too much subdued by her
fears to allow her to play the monitress he said and frowningly too
that soft words were with him the prelude to hard resolutions and that
where he could not win as the turtle he could take his prey like a
vulture or some such words of anger now roland i have twice before
dreamed of this man and on each occasion a heavy calamity ensued and
that on the following day i dreamed of him the night before our uncle
died i dreamed a second time and the next day he produced and recorded
the will that robbed us of our inheritance i dreamed of him again last
night and what evil is now hovering over us i know not but it is
foolish of me to say so yet my fears tell me it will be something
dreadful

your fears i hope will deceive you said roland smiling in spite of
himself at this little display of weakness on the part of edith i have
much confidence in this girl telie though i can scarce tell why a free
road and a round gallop will carry us to our journey's end by nightfall
and at the worst we shall have bright starlight to light us on be
comforted my cousin i begin heartily to suspect yon cowardly dodge or
dodger or whatever he calls himself has been imposed upon by his fears
and that he has actually seen no indians at all the springing up of a
bush from under his horse's feet and the starting away of a dozen
frighted rabbits might easily explain his conceit of the long-legged
indian and his five murderous accomplices and as for the savages seen
in ambush at the ford the shaking of the cane-brake by the breeze or by
some skulking bear would as readily account for them the idea of his
being allowed to pass a crew of indians in their lair without being
pursued or even fired upon is quite preposterous

these ideas perhaps devised to dispel his kinswoman's fears were scarce
uttered before they appeared highly reasonable to the inventor himself
and he straightway rode to dodge's side and began to question him more
closely than he had before had leisure to do in relation to those
wondrous adventures the recounting of which had produced so serious a
change in the destination of the party all his efforts however to
obtain satisfactory confirmation of his suspicion were unavailing the
man now in a great measure relieved of his terrors repeated his story
with a thousand details which convinced roland that it was in its chief
features correct that he had actually been attacked or fired upon by
some persons roland could not doubt having heard the shots himself as
to the ambush at the ford all he could say was that he had actually
seen several indians he knew not the number stealing through the wood
in the direction opposite the river as if on the outlook for some
expected party captain forrester's he supposed of which he had heard
among the emigrants and that this giving him the advantage of the
first discovery he had darted ahead with all his speed until arrested
at an unexpected moment by the six warriors whose guns and voices had
been heard by the party

besides communicating all the information which he possessed on these
points he proceeded without waiting to be asked to give an account of
his own history and a very lamentable one it was he was from the
down-east country a representative of the bay state from which he had
been seduced by the arguments of his old friend josiah jones to go a
pedlering with the latter to the new settlements in the west where the
situation of the colonists so far removed from all markets promised
uncommon advantages to the adventurous trader these had been in a
measure realised on the upper ohio but the prospect of superior gains in
kentucky had tempted the two friends to extend their speculations
further and in an evil hour they embarked their assorted notions and
their own bodies in a flatboat on the ohio in the descent of which it
was their fortune to be stripped of every thing after enduring risks
without number and daily attacks from indians lying in wait on the
banks of the river which misadventures had terminated in the capture of
their boat and the death of josiah the unlucky projector of the
expedition pardon himself barely escaping with his life these
calamities were the more distasteful to the worthy dodge whose
inclinations were of no warlike cast and whose courage never rose to the
fighting point as he freely professed until goaded into action by sheer
desperation he had got enough as he said of the everlasting injuns
and of kentucky where there was such a shocking deal of em that a
peaceable trader's scalp was in no more security than a rambling
scout's and cursing his bad luck and the memory of the friend who had
cajoled him into ruin difficulty and constant danger his sole desire
was now to return to the safer lands of the east which he expected to
effect most advantageously by advancing to some of the south-eastern
stations and throwing himself in the way of the first band of militia
whose tour of duty in the district was completed and who should be
about to return to their native state he had got enough of the ohio as
well as the indians the wilderness-road possessed fewer terrors and
therefore appeared to his imagination the more eligible route of escape




chapter x


dodge's story which was not without its interest to roland though the
rapidity of their progress through the woods and the constant necessity
of being on the alert kept him a somewhat inattentive listener was
brought to an abrupt close by the motions of telie doe who having
guided the party for several miles with great confidence began at last
to hesitate and betray symptoms of doubt and embarrassment that
attracted the soldier's attention there seemed some cause for
hesitation the glades at first broad and open through which they had
made their way were becoming smaller and more frequently interrupted by
copses the wood grew denser and darker the surface of the ground became
broken by rugged ascents and swampy hollows the one encumbered by stones
and mouldering trunks of trees the other converted by the rains into
lakes and pools through which it was difficult to find a path whilst
the constant turning and winding to right and left to avoid such
obstacles made it a still greater task to preserve the line of direction
which telie had intimated was the proper one to pursue was it
possible he asked of himself the girl could be at fault the
answer to this question when addressed to telie herself confirmed his
fears she was perplexed she was frightened she had been long expecting
to strike the neglected road with which she professed to be so well
acquainted and sure she was they had ridden far enough to find it but
the hills and swamps had confused her she was afraid to proceed she
knew not where she was

this announcement filled the young soldier's mind with alarm for upon
telie's knowledge of the woods he had placed his best reliance conscious
that his own experience in such matters was as little to be depended on
as that of any of his companions yet it was necessary he should now
assume the lead himself and do his best to rescue the party from its
difficulties and this after a little reflection he thought he could
scarce fail in effecting the portion of the forest through which he was
rambling was a kind of triangle marked by the two roads on the east
with its base bounded by the long looked for river and one of these
boundaries he must strike proceed in whatsoever direction he would if
he persevered in the course he had followed so long he must of necessity
find himself sooner or later in the path which telie had failed to
discover and failed as he supposed in consequence of wandering away to
the west so as to keep it constantly on the right hand instead of in
front to recover it then all that was necessary to be done was to
direct his course to the right and to proceed until the road was found

the reasoning was just and the probability was that a few moments would
find the party on the recovered path but a half-hour passed by and the
travellers all anxious and doubting and filled with gloom were yet
stumbling in the forest winding amid labyrinths of bog and brake hill
and hollow that every moment became wilder and more perplexing to add
to their alarm it was manifest that the day was fast approaching its
close the sun had set or was so low in the heavens that not a single
ray could be seen trembling on the tallest tree and thus was lost the
only means of deciding towards what quarter of the compass they were
directing their steps the mosses on the trees were appealed to in
vain as they will be by all who expect to find them pointing like the
mariner's needle to the pole they indicate the quarter from which blow
the prevailing humid winds of any region of country but in the moist and
dense forests of the interior they are often equally luxuriant on every
side of the tree the varying shape and robustness of boughs are thought
to offer a better means of finding the points of the compass but none
but indians and hunters grown gray in the woods can profit by their
occult lessons the attempts of roland to draw instruction from them
served only to complete his confusion and by and by giving over all
hope of succeeding through any exercise of skill or prudence he left
the matter to fortune and his good horse riding in the obstinacy of
despair withersoever the weary animal chose to bear him without knowing
whether it might be afar from danger or backwards into the vicinity of
the very enemies whom he had laboured so long to avoid

as he advanced in this manner he was once or twice inclined to suspect
that he was actually retracing his steps and approaching the path by
which he had entered the depths of the wood and on one occasion he was
almost assured that such was the fact by the peculiar appearance of a
brambly thicket containing many dead trees which he thought he had
noticed while following in confidence after the leading of telie doe a
nearer approach to the place convinced him of his error but awoke a new
hope in his mind by showing him that he was drawing nigh the haunts of
men the blazes of the axe were seen on the trees running away in lines
as if marked by the hands of the surveyor those trees that were dead he
observed had been destroyed by girdling and on the edge of the tangled
brake where they were most abundant he noticed several stalks of maize
the relics of some former harvest the copse itself having once been as
he supposed a corn-field

it is only a tomahawk-improvement said telie doe shaking her head as
he turned towards her a look of joyous inquiry and she pointed towards
what seemed to have been once a cabin of logs of the smallest size too
small indeed for habitation but which more than half fallen down was
rotting away half hidden under the weeds and brambles that grew and
seemed to have grown for years within its little area there are many
of them in the woods that were never settled

roland did not require to be informed that a tomahawk-improvement
as it was often called in those days meant nothing more than the box of
logs in form of a cabin which the hunter or land-speculator could build
with his hatchet in a few hours a few girdled trees a dozen or more
grains of corn from his pouch-thrust into the soil with perhaps a few
poles laid along the earth to indicate an enclosed field and that such
improvements as they gave pre-emption rights to the maker were often
established by adventurers to secure a claim in the event of their not
lighting on lands more to their liking years had evidently passed by
since the maker of this neglected improvement had visited his territory
and roland no longer hoped to discover such signs about it as might
enable him to recover his lost way his spirits sunk as rapidly as they
had risen and he was preparing to make one more effort to escape from
the forest while the daylight yet lasted or to find some stronghold in
which to pass the night when his attention was drawn to telie doe who
had ridden a little in advance eagerly scanning the trees and soil
around in the hope that some ancient mark or footstep might point out a
mode of escape as she thus looked about her moving slowly in advance
her pony on a sudden began to snort and prance and betray other
indications of terror and telie herself was seen to become agitated and
alarmed retreating back upon the party but keeping her eyes wildly
rolling from bush to bush as if in instant expectation of seeing an
enemy

what is the matter cried roland riding to her assistance are we in
enchanted land that our horses must be frightened as well as
ourselves

he smells the war-paint said telie with a trembling voice there
are indians near us

nonsense said roland looking around and seeing with the exception
of the copse just passed nothing but an open forest without shelter or
harbour for an ambushed foe but at that moment edith caught him by the
arm and turned upon him a countenance more wan with fear than that she
had exhibited upon first hearing the cries of stackpole it expressed
indeed more than alarm it was the highest degree of terror and the
feeling was so overpowering that her lips though moving as in the act of
speech gave forth no sound whatever but what her lips refused to tell
her finger though shaking in the ague that convulsed every fibre of her
frame pointed out and roland following it with his eyes beheld the
object that had excited so much emotion he started himself as his gaze
fell upon a naked indian stretched under a tree hard by and sheltered
from view only by a dead bough lately fallen from its trunk yet lying so
still and motionless that he might easily have been passed by without
observation in the growing dusk and twilight of the woods had it not
been for the instinctive terrors of the pony which like other horses
and indeed all other domestic beasts in the settlements often thus
pointed out to their masters the presence of an enemy

the rifle of the soldier was in an instant cocked and at his shoulder
while the pedler and emperor as it happened were too much discomposed
at the spectacle to make any such show of battle they gazed blankly upon
the leader whose piece settling down into an aim that must have been
fatal suddenly wavered and then to their surprise was withdrawn

the slayer has been here before us he exclaimed the man is dead and
scalped already

with these words he advanced to the tree and the others following they
beheld with horror the body of a savage of vast and noble proportions
lying on its face across the roots of the tree and glued it might
almost be said to the earth by a mass of coagulated blood that had
issued from the scalp and axe-cloven skull the fragments of a rifle
shattered as it seemed by a violent blow against the tree under which
he jay were scattered at his side with a broken powder-horn a
splintered knife the helve of a tomahawk and other equipments of a
warrior all in like manner shivered to pieces by the unknown assassin
the warrior seemed to have perished only after a fearful struggle the
earth was torn where he lay and his hands yet grasping the soil were
dyed a double red in the blood of his antagonist or perhaps in his own

while roland gazed upon the spectacle amazed and wondering in what
manner the wretched being had met his death which must have happened
very recently and whilst his party was within the sound of a rifle-shot
he observed a shudder to creep over the apparently lifeless frame the
fingers relaxed their grasp of the earth and then clutched it again with
violence a broken strangling rattle came from the throat and a spasm
of convulsion seizing upon every limb it was suddenly raised a little
upon one arm so as to display the countenance covered with blood the
eyes retroverted into their orbits and glaring with the sightless
whites it was a horrible spectacle the last convulsion of many that
had shaken the wretched and insensible yet still suffering clay since
it had received the death-stroke the spasm was the last and but
momentary yet it sufficed to raise the body of the mangled barbarian so
far that when the pang that excited it suddenly ceased and with it
the life of the sufferer the body rolled over on the back and thus lay
exposing to the eyes of the lookers-on two gashes wide and gory on the
breast traced by a sharp knife and a powerful hand and as it seemed
in the mere wantonness of a malice and lust of blood which even death
could not satisfy the sight of these gashes answered the question roland
had asked of his own imagination they were in the form of a cross and
as the legend so long derided of the forest-fiend recurred to his
memory he responded almost with a feeling of superstitious awe to the
trembling cry of telie doe 

it is the jibbenainosay she exclaimed staring upon the corse with
mingled horror and wonder nick of the woods is up again in the
forest




chapter xi


there was little really superstitious in the temper of captain forrester
and however his mind might be at first stirred by the discovery of a
victim of the redoubted fiend so devoutly believed in by his host of the
preceding evening it is certain that his credulity was not so much
excited as his surprise he sprang from his horse and examined the body
but looked in vain for the mark of the bullet that had robbed it of life
no gun-shot wound at least none of importance appeared in any part
there was indeed a bullet-hole in the left shoulder and as it seemed
very recently inflicted but it was bound up with leaves and vulnerary
herbs in the usual indian way showing that it must have been received
at some period anterior to the attack which had robbed the warrior of
life the gashes across the ribs were the only other wounds on the body
that on the head made by a hatchet was evidently the one that had
caused the warrior's death

if this circumstance abated the wonder the soldier had at first felt on
the score of a man being killed at so short a distance from his own
party without any one hearing the shot he was still more at a loss to
know how one of the dead man's race proverbial for wariness and
vigilance should have been approached by any merely human enemy so nigh
as to render fire-arms unnecessary to his destruction but that a human
enemy had effected the slaughter inexplicable as it seemed he had no
doubt and he began straightway to search among the leaves strewn over
the ground for the marks of his foot-steps not questioning that if he
could find and follow them for a little distance he should discover the
author of the deed and which was of more moment to himself a friend
and guide to conduct his party from the forest

his search was however fruitless for whether it was that the shadows
of the evening lay too dark on the ground or that eyes more accustomed
than his own to such duties were required to detect a trail among dried
forest leaves it was certain that he failed to discover a single
foot-step or other vestige of the slayer nor were pardon dodge and
emperor whom he summoned to his assistance a whit more successful a
circumstance however that rather proved their inexperience than the
supernatural character of the jibbenainosay whose foot-prints as it
appeared were not more difficult to find than those of the dead indian
for which they sought equally in vain

while they were thus fruitlessly engaged an exclamation from telie doe
drew their attention to a spectacle suddenly observed which to her
awe-struck eyes presented the appearance of the very being so truculent
yet supernatural whose traces it seemed were to be discovered only on
the breasts of his lifeless victims and roland looking up beheld with
surprise perhaps even for a moment with the stronger feeling of awe a
figure stalking through the woods at a distance looking as tall and
gigantic in the growing twilight as the airy demon of the brocken or
the equally colossal spectres seen on the wild summits of the peruvian
andes distance and the darkness together rendered the vision indistinct
but roland could see that the form was human that it moved onwards with
rapid strides and with its countenance bent upon the earth or upon
another moving object dusky and of lesser size that rolled before it
guiding the way like the bowl of the dervise in the arabian story and
finally that it held in its hands as if on the watch for an enemy an
implement wondrously like the fire-lock of a human fighting-man at
first it appeared as if the figure was approaching the party and that
in a direct line but presently roland perceived it was gradually bending
its course away to the left its eyes still so closely fixed on its dusky
guide the very bear as roland supposed which was said so often to
direct the steps of the jibbenainosay that it seemed as if about to
pass the party entirely without observation

but this it made no part of the young soldier's resolutions to permit
and accordingly he sprang upon his horse determined to ride forwards
and bring the apparition to a stand while it was yet at a distance

man or devil jibbenainosay or rambling settler he cried it is at
least no indian and therefore no enemy holla friend he exclaimed
aloud and dashed forward followed though not without hesitation by
his companions

at the sound of his voice the spectre started and looked up and then
without betraying either surprise or a disposition to beat a mysterious
retreat advanced to meet the soldier walking rapidly and waving his
hand all the while with an impatient gesture as if commanding the party
to halt a command which was immediately obeyed by roland and all

and now it was that as it drew nigh its stature appeared to grow less
and less colossal and the wild lineaments with which fancy had invested
it faded from sight leaving the phantom a mere man of tall frame
indeed but without a single characteristic of dress or person to delight
the soul of wonder the black bear dwindled into a little dog the
meekest and most insignificant of his tribe being nothing less or more
in fact than the identical peter which had fared so roughly in the
hands or rather under the feet of roaring ralph stackpole at the
station the day before while the human spectre the supposed fiend of
the woods sinking from its dignity in equal proportion of abasement
suddenly presented to roland's eyes the person of peter's master the
humble peaceful harmless nathan slaughter

the transformation was so great and unexpected for even roland looked to
find in the wanderer if not a destroying angel at least some formidable
champion of the forest that he could scarce forbear a laugh as nathan
came stalking up followed by little peter who stole to the rear as
soon as strangers were perceived as if to avoid the kicks and cuffs
which his experience had doubtless taught him were to be expected on
all such occasions the young man felt the more inclined to indulge his
mirth as the character which bruce had given him of wandering nathan as
one perfectly acquainted with the woods convinced him that he could not
have fallen upon a better person to extricate him from his dangerous
dilemma and thus relieved his breast of a mountain of anxiety and
distress but the laugh with which he greeted his approach found no
response from nathan himself who having looked with amazement upon
edith and telie as if marvelling what madness had brought females at
that hour into that wild desert turned at last to the soldier
demanding with inauspicious gravity 

friend does thee think thee is in thee own parlour with thee women at
home that thee shouts so loud and laughs so merrily or does thee know
thee is in a wild kentucky forest with murdering injuns all around
thee

i trust not said roland much more seriously but in truth we all
took you for nick of the woods the redoubtable nick himself and you
must allow that our terrors were ridiculous enough when they could
convert a peaceful man like you into such a blood-thirsty creature that
there are indians in the wood i can well believe having the evidence
of dodge here who professes to have seen six and killed one and of my
own eyes into the bargain yonder lies one dead at this moment under
the walnut-tree killed by some unknown hand telie doe says by nick of
the woods himself 

friend said nathan interrupting the young man without ceremony
thee had better think of living injuns than talk of dead ones for of a
truth thee is like to have trouble with them

not now i hope with such a man as you to help me out of the woods in
the name of heaven where am i and whither am i going

whither thee is going replied nathan it might be hard to say seeing
that thee way of travelling is none of the straightest nevertheless if
thee continues thee present course it is my idea thee is travelling to
the upper ford of the river and will fetch it in twelve minutes or
thereabouts and in the same space find theeself in the midst of thirty
ambushed injuns

good heavens cried roland have we then been labouring only to
approach the cut-throats there is not a moment then to lose and your
finding us is even more providential than i thought put yourself at our
head lead us out of this den of thieves conduct us to the lower
ford to our companions the emigrants or if that may not be take us
back to the station or any where at all where i may find safety for
these females for myself i am incapable of guiding them longer

truly said nathan looking embarrassed i would do what i could for
thee but 

but do you hesitate cried the virginian in extreme indignation
will you leave us to perish when you and you alone can guide us from
the forest

friend said nathan in a submissive deprecating tone i am a man of
peace and paradventure the party being so numerous the injuns will
fall upon us and truly they will not spare me any more than another
for they kill the non-fighting men as well as them that fight truly i
am in much fear for myself but a single man might escape

if you are such a knave such a mean-spirited unfeeling dastard as to
think of leaving these women to their fate said roland giving way to
rage be assured that the first step will be your last i will blow
your brains out the moment you attempt to leave us

at these ireful words nathan's eyes began to widen

truly said he i don't think thee would be so wicked but thee takes
by force that which i would have given with good will it was not my
purpose to refuse thee assistance though it is unseemly that one of my
peaceful faith should go with fighting-men among men of war as if to do
battle but friend if we should fall upon the angry red-men truly
there will bloodshed come of it and thee will say to me nathan lift
up thee gun and shoot and peradventure if i say nay thee will call
me hard names as thee did before saying if thee don't i will blow
thee brains out friend i am a man of peace and if 

trouble yourself no longer on that score said the soldier who began
to understand how the land lay and how much the meek nathan's reluctance
to become his guide was engendered by his fears of being called on to
take a share in such fighting as might occur trouble yourself no
longer we will take care to avoid a contest

truly said nathan that may not be as thee chooses the injuns being
all around thee

if a rencontre should be inevitable said roland with a smile
mingling grim contempt of nathan's pusillanimity with secret satisfaction
at the thought of being thus able to secure the safety of his kinswoman
all that i shall expect of you will be to decamp with the females
whilst we three emperor pardon dodge and myself cover your retreat
we can at least check the assailants if we die for it

this resolute speech was echoed by each of the other combatants the
negro exclaiming though with no very valiant utterance yes massa no
mistake in ole emperor will die for missie and massa while pardon
who was fast relapsing into the desperation that had given him courage on
a former occasion cried out with direful emphasis if there's no
dodging the critturs then there a'n't and if i must fight then i
must and them that takes my scalp must gin the worth on't or it a'n't
no matter

truly said nathan who listened to these several outpourings of spirit
with much complacency i am a man of peace and amity according to my
conscience but if others are men of wrath and battle according to
theirs i will not take it upon me to censure them nay not even if
they should feel themselves called upon by hard necessity to shed the
blood of their injun fellow-creatures who it must be confessed if we
should stumble on the same will do their best to make that necessity as
strong as possible but now let us away and see what help there is for
us though whither to go and what to do there being injuns before and
injuns behind and injuns all around truly truly it doth perplex me

and so indeed it seemed for nathan straightway fell into a fit of
musing shaking his head and tapping his finger contemplatively on the
stock of that rifle terrible only to the animals that furnished him
subsistence and all the while in such apparent abstraction that he took
no notice of a suggestion made by roland namely that he should lead
the way to the deserted ford where as the soldier said there was every
reason to believe there were no indians but continued to argue the
difficulty in his own mind interrupting the debate only to ask counsel
where there seemed the least probability of obtaining it 

peter said he addressing himself to the little dog and that with as
much gravity as if addressing himself to a human adviser i have my
thoughts on the matter what does thee think of matters and things

my friend cried roland impatiently this is no affair to be
entrusted to the wisdom of a brute dog

if there is any one here whose wisdom can serve us better said nathan
meekly let him speak thee don't know peter friend or thee would use
him with respect many a long day has he followed me through the forest
and many a time has he helped me out of harm and peril from man and
beast when i was at sore shifts to help myself for truly friend as i
told thee before the injuns have no regard for men whether men of peace
or war and an honest quiet peace-loving man can no more roam the wood
hunting for the food that sustains life without the fear of being
murdered than a fighting-man in search of his prey thee sees now
what little dog peter is doing he runs to the tracks and he wags his
tail truly i am of the same way of thinking

what tracks are they demanded roland as he followed nathan to the
path which the latter had been pursuing when arrested by the soldier
and where the little cur was now smelling about occasionally lifting his
head and wagging his tail as if to call his master's attention

what tracks echoed nathan looking on the youth first with wonder
and then with commiseration and adding it was a tempting of
providence friend for thee to lead poor helpless women into a wild
forest does thee not know the tracks of thee own horses

sdeath said roland looking on the marks as nathan pointed them out
in the soft earth and reflecting with chagrin how wildly he had been
rambling for more than an hour since they had been impressed on the
soil

thee knows the hoof-marks said nathan now pointing with a grin at
other tracks of a different appearance among them perhaps thee knows
these foot-prints also

they are the marks of footmen said the soldier in surprise but how
came they there i know not no footmen being of our party

the grin that marked the visage of the man of peace widened almost into a
laugh as roland spoke verily he cried thee is in the wrong place
friend in the forest if thee had no footmen with thee could thee have
none after thee look friend here are tracks not of one man but of
five each stepping on tiptoe as if to tread lightly and look well
before him each with a moccasin on each with a toe turned in each 

enough they were indians said roland with a shudder and they must
have been close behind us

now friend said nathan thee will have more respect for peter for
truly it was peter told me of these things when i was peaceably hunting
my game in the forest he showed me the track of five ignorant persons
rambling through the wood as the hawk flies in the air round round
round all the time or like an ox that has been browsing on the leaves
of the buck-eye and he showed me that five evil-minded shawnees were
pursuing in their trail so thinks i to myself these poor creatures
will come to mischief if no one gives them warning of their danger and
therefore i started to follow peter showing me the way and truly if
there can any good come of me finding thee in this hard ease thee must
give all the thanks and all the praise to poor peter

footnote the buck-eye or american horse-chestnut seems to be
universally considered in the west a mortal poison both fruit and
leaves cattle affected by it are said to play many remarkable antics as
if intoxicated turning twisting and rolling about and around until
death closes their agonies

i will never more speak ill of a dog as long as i live said roland
but let us away i thought our best course was to the lower ford but i
find i am mistaken we must away in the opposite direction

not so said nathan coolly peter is of opinion that we must run the
track over again and truly so am i we must follow these same five
injuns it is as much as our lives are worth

you are mad said roland this will be to bring us right upon the
skulking cut-throats let us fly in another direction the forest is open
before us

and how long does thee think it will keep open friend i tell thee
thee is surrounded by injuns on the south they lie at the ford on the
west is the river rolling along in a flood and at the east are the
roads full of shawnees on the scout verily friend there is but little
comfort to think of proceeding in any direction even to the north where
there are five murdering creatures full before us but this is my
thought and i rather think it is peter's if we go to the north we
know pretty much all the evil that lies before us and how to avoid it
whereas by turning in either of the other quarters we go into danger
blindfold

and how shall we avoid these five villains before us asked roland
anxiously

by keeping them before us replied nathan that is friend by
following them until such time as they turn where thee turned before
them and i warrant me the evil creatures will turn wheresoever thee
trail does when we if we have good luck may slip quietly forward and
leave them to follow us after first taking the full swing of all thee
roundabout vagaries

take your own course said roland it may be the best we can at the
worst but stumble upon these five and then granting that you can in
the meanwhile bear the females off i will answer for keeping two or
three of the villains busy take your own course he repeated the
night is darkening around us we must do something

thee says the truth cried nathan as for stumbling unawares on the
five evil persons thee is in dread of trust peter for that thee shall
soon see what a friend thee has in little dog peter truly for a
peaceful man like me it is needful i should have some one to tell me
when dangerous persons are nigh

with these words which were uttered with a good countenance showing how
much his confidence in the apparently insignificant peter preserved him
from the fears natural to his character and situation the man of peace
proceeded to marshal the company in a line directing them to follow him
in that order and earnestly impressing upon all the necessity of
preserving strict silence upon the march this being done he boldly
strode forwards taking a post at least two hundred paces in advance of
the others at which distance as he gave roland to understand he
desired the party to follow as was the more necessary since their being
mounted rendered them the more liable to be observed by distant enemies
if thee sees me wave my hand above my head were his last instructions
to the young soldier who began to be well pleased with his readiness and
forecast bring thee people to a halt if thee sees me drop upon the
ground lead them under the nearest cover and keep them quiet for thee
may then be certain there is mischief or mischievous people nigh at
hand but verily friend with peter's help we will circumvent them
all

with this cheering assurance lie now strode forward to his station and
coming to a halt with his dog peter roland immediately beheld the latter
run to a post forty or fifty paces further in advance when he paused to
receive the final orders of his master which were given with a motion of
the same hand that a moment after beckoned the party to follow had
roland been sufficiently nigh to take note of proceedings he would have
admired the conduct of the little brute the unerring accuracy with which
he pursued the trail the soft and noiseless motion with which he stepped
from leaf to leaf casting his eyes ever and anon to the right and left
and winding the air before him as if in reality conscious of peril and
sensible that the welfare of the six mortals at his heels depended upon
the faithful exercise of all his sagacity these things however from
the distance roland was unable to observe but he saw enough to convince
him that the animal addressed itself to its task with as much zeal and
prudence as its master a sense of security the first felt for several
hours now began to disperse the gloom that had oppressed his spirits
and edith's countenance throughout the whole of the adventure a
faithful though doubtless somewhat exaggerated reflection of his own
also lost much of its melancholy and terror though without at any moment
regaining the cheerful smiles that had decked it at the setting out it
was left for roland alone as his mind regained its elasticity to marvel
at the motley additions by which his party had increased in so short a
time to twice its original numbers and to speculate on the prospects of
an expedition committed to the guidance of such a conductor as little
peter




chapter xii


the distance at which roland with his party followed the guides and the
gloom of the woods prevented his making any close observations upon
their motions unless when some swelling ridge nearly destitute of
trees brought them nearer to the light of the upper air at other times
he could do little more than follow with his eye the tall figure of
nathan plunging from shadow to shadow and knoll to knoll with a pace
both free and rapid and little resembling the shambling hesitating step
with which he moved among the haunts of his contemners and oppressors as
for the dog little peter he was only with difficulty seen when
ascending some such illuminated knoll as has been mentioned when he
might be traced creeping along with unabated vigilance and caution

it was while ascending one of these low and almost bare swells of
ground that the little animal gave the first proof of that sagacity or
wisdom as nathan called it on which the latter seemed to rely for
safety so much more than on his own experience and address he had no
sooner reached the summit of the knoll than he abruptly came to a stand
and by and by cowered to the earth as if to escape the observation of
enemies in front whose presence he indicated in no other way unless by
a few twitches and flourishes of his tail which a moment after became
as rigid and motionless as if with his body it had been suddenly
converted into stone the whole action as far as roland could notice it
was similar to that of a well-trained spaniel marking game and such was
the interpretation the soldier put upon it until nathan suddenly
stopping waved his hand as a signal to the party to halt which was
immediately obeyed the next moment nathan was seen creeping up the hill
to investigate the cause of alarm which he proceeded to do with great
caution as if well persuaded there was danger at hand indeed he had
not yet reached the brow of the eminence when roland beheld him suddenly
drop upon his face thereby giving the best evidence of the existence of
peril of an extreme and urgent character

the young virginian remembered the instructions of his guide to seek
shelter for his party the moment this signal was given and accordingly
he led his followers without delay into a little tangled brake hard by
where he charged them to remain in quiet until the cause of the
interruption should be ascertained and removed from the edge of the
brake he could see the guide still maintaining his position on his face
yet dragging himself upward like a snake until he had reached the top of
the hill and looked over into the maze of forest beyond in this
situation he lay for several moments apparently deeply engaged with the
scene before him when forrester impatient of his silence and delay
anxiously interested in every turn of events and perhaps unwilling at a
season of difficulty to rely altogether on nathan's unaided
observations gave his horse in charge of emperor and ascended the
eminence himself taking care however to do as nathan had done and
throw himself upon the ground when near its summit in this way he
succeeded in creeping to nathan's side when the cause of alarm was soon
made manifest

the forest beyond the ridge was for a considerable distance open and
free from undergrowth the trees standing wide apart and thus admitting
a broad extent of vision though now contracted by the increasing dusk of
evening through this expanse and in its darkest corner flitting dimly
along roland's eyes fell upon certain shadows at first vague and
indistinct but which soon assumed the human form marching one after the
other in a line and apparently approaching the very ridge on which he
lay each with the stealthy yet rapid pace of a wild cat they were but
five in number but the order of their march the appearance of their
bodies seemingly half naked and the busy intentness with which they
pursued the trail left so broad and open by the inexperienced wanderers
would have convinced roland of their savage character had he possessed
no other evidence than that of his own senses

they are indians he muttered in nathan's ear

shawnee creatures said the latter with edifying coolness and
will think no more of taking the scalps of thee two poor women than of
digging off thee own

there are but five of them and  the young man paused and the gloom
that a spirit so long harassed by fears though fears for another had
spread over his countenance was exchanged for a look of fierce decision
that better became his features harkee man he abruptly resumed we
cannot pass the ridge without being seen by them our horses are
exhausted and we cannot hope to escape them by open flight

verily said nathan thee speaks the truth

nor can we leave the path we are now pursuing without fear of falling
into the hands of a party more numerous and powerful our only path of
escape you said was over this ridge and towards yonder lower ford

truly said nathan with a lugubrious look of assent what thee says
is true but how we are to fly these evil-minded creatures with poor
frightened women hanging to our legs 

we will not fly them said roland the frown of battle gathering
on his brows yonder crawling reptiles reptiles in spirit as in
movement have been dogging our steps for hours waiting for the
moment when to strike with advantage at my defenceless followers and
they will dog us still if permitted until there is no escape from their
knives and hatchets for either man or woman there is a way of stopping
them there is a way of requiting them

truly said nathan there is no such way unless we were wicked men of
the world and fighting men and would wage battle with them

why not meet the villains in their own way there are but five of
them and footmen too by heavens man we will charge them cut them
to pieces and so rid the wood of them four strong men like us
fighting too in defence of women

four echoed nathan looking wonder and alarm together does thee
think to have me do the wicked thing of shedding blood thee should
remember friend that i am a follower of peaceful doctrines a man of
peace and amity

what said roland warmly would you not defend your life from the
villains would you suffer yourself to be tomahawked unresisting when a
touch of the trigger under your finger a blow of the knife at your belt
would preserve the existence nature and heaven alike call on you to
protect would you lie still like a fettered ox to be butchered

truly said nathan i would take myself away or if that might
not be why then friend verily friend if i could do nothing
else truly i must then give myself up to be murdered

spiritless mad or hypocritical cried roland with mingled wonder
and contempt then grasping his strange companion by the arm he cried
harkee man if you would not strike a blow for yourself would you
not strike it for another what if you had a wife a parent a child
lying beneath the uplifted hatchet and you with these arms in your
hands what do you tell me you would stand by and see them murdered i
say a wife or child the wife of your bosom the child of your heart
would you see them murdered

at this stirring appeal uttered with indescribable energy and passion
though only in a whisper nathan's countenance changed from dark to pale
and his arm trembled in the soldier's grasp he turned upon him also a
look of extraordinary wildness and muttered betwixt his teeth an answer
that betokened as much confusion of mind as agitation of spirits
friend he said whoever thee is it matters nothing to thee what
might happen or has happened in such case made and provided i am a
man thee is another thee has thee conscience and i have mine if thee
will fight fight settle it with thee conscience if thee don't like to
see thee kinswoman murdered and thee thinks thee has a call to battle
do thee best with sword and pistol gun and tomahawk kill and slay to
thee liking if thee conscience finds no fault with thee neither will i
but as for me let the old adam of the flesh stir me as it may i have no
one to fight for wife or child parent or kinsman i have none if thee
will hunt the world over thee will not find one in it that is my kinsman
or relative

but i ask you said roland somewhat surprised at the turn of nathan's
answer i ask you if you had a wife or child 

but i have not cried nathan interrupting him vehemently and
therefore friend why should thee speak of them them that are dead let
them rest they can never cry to me more think of thee own blood and
do what seems best to thee for the good thereof

assuredly i would said roland who however much his curiosity was
roused by the unexpected agitation of his guide had little time to think
of any affairs but his own assuredly i would could i only count upon
your hearty assistance i tell you man my blood boils to look at yonder
crawling serpents and to think of the ferocious object with which they
are dogging at my heels and i would give a year of my life ay if the
whole number of years were but ten one whole year of all for the
privilege of paying them for their villany beforehand

thee has thee two men to back thee said nathan who had now recovered
his composure and with these two men if thee is warlike enough thee
might do as much mischief as thee conscience calls for but truly it
becomes not a man of peace like me to speak of strife and bloodshed yet
truly he added hastily i think there must mischief come of this
meeting for verily the evil creatures are leaving thee tracks and
coming towards us

they stop said forrester eagerly they look about them they have
lost the track they are coming this way you will not fight yet you
may counsel what shall i do shall i attack them what can i do

friend replied nathan briskly i can't tell what thee can do but i
can tell thee what a man of kentucky a wicked fighter of injuns would
do in such a case made and provided he would betake him to the thicket
where he had hidden his women and horses and he would lie down with his
fighting men behind a log and truly if these ill-disposed injun-men
were foolish enough to approach he would fire upon them with his three
guns taking them by surprise and perhaps wicked man killing the
better half of them on the spot and then 

and then interrupted roland taking fire at the idea he would spring
on his horse and make sure of the rest with sword and pistol

truly said nathan he would do no such thing seeing that the moment
he lifted up his head above the log he would be liker to have an injun
bullet through it than to see the wicked creature that shot it verily
a man of kentucky would be wiser he would take the pistols thee speaks
of supposing it were his good luck to have them and let fly at the
evil-minded creatures with them also not hoping indeed to do any
execution with such small ware but to make the injuns believe there were
as many enemies as fire-arms and truly if they did not take to their
heels after such a second volley they would be foolisher injuns than
were ever before heard of in kentucky

by heaven said forrester it is good advice and i will take it

advice friend i don't advise thee said nathan hastily truly i
advise to nothing but peace and amity i only tell thee what a wicked
kentucky fighting-man would do a man that might think it as many of
them do as lawful to shoot a prowling injun as a skulking bear

and i would to heaven said roland i had but two nay but one of
them with me this instant a man like bruce were worth the lives of a
dozen such scum i must do my best

truly friend said nathan who had listened to the warlike outpourings
of the young soldier with a degree of complacency and admiration one
would have scarce looked for in a man of his peaceful character thee
has a conscience of thee own and if thee will fight these injun-men from
an ambush truly i will not censure nor exhort thee to the contrary
if thee can rely upon thee two men the coloured person and the other
thee may hold the evil creatures exceeding uneasy

alas said roland the fire departing from his eyes you remind me of
my weakness my men will not fight unless from sheer desperation
emperor i know to be a coward and dodge i fear is no braver

verily said nathan bluffly it was foolish of thee to come into
the woods in such company foolisher still to think of fighting five
injun-men with such followers to back thee and truly he added it was
foolishest of all to put the safe-keeping of such helpless creatures into
the hands of one who can neither fight for them nor for himself
nevertheless thee is as a babe and suckling in the woods and peter and
i will do the best we can for thee it is lucky for thee that as thee
cannot fight thee has the power to fly and truly for the poor women's
sake it is better thee should leave the woods in peace

with that nathan directed the young man's attention to the pursuing
foes who having by some mischance lost the trail had scattered about
in search of it and at last recovered it though not before two of them
had approached so nigh the ridge on which the observers lay as to give
just occasion for fear lest they should cross it immediately in front of
the party of travellers the deadly purpose with which the barbarians
were pursuing him roland could infer from the cautious silence preserved
while they were searching for the lost tracks and even when these were
regained the discovery was communicated from one to another merely by
signs not a man uttering so much as a word in a few moments they were
seen again formed in a single file stealing through the woods with a
noiseless but rapid pace and fortunately bending their steps towards a
distant part of the ridge where roland and his companions had so lately
crossed it

get thee down to thee people said nathan lead them behind the
thicket and when thee sees me beckon thee carry them boldly over the
hill thee must pass it while the shawnee-men are behind yonder clump of
trees which is so luckily for thee on the very comb of the swell be
quick in obeying friend or the evil creatures may catch sight of thee
thee has no time to lose

the ardour of battle once driven from his mind roland was able to
perceive the folly of risking a needless contest betwixt a superior body
of wild indian warriors and his own followers but had his warlike spirit
been at its height it must have been quelled in a moment by the
appearance of his party left in the thicket during his brief absence on
the hill to feed their imaginations with terrors of every appalling
character in which occupation as he judged at a glance the gallant
dodge and emperor had been even more industrious than the females the
negro looking the very personification of mute horror and bending low on
his saddle as if expecting every instant a shower of indian bullets to be
let fly into the thicket while pardon expressed the state of his
feelings by trying aloud as soon as rowland appeared i say capting
if you seed em a'nt there no dodging of em no how

we can escape roland exclaimed edith anticipating the soldier's news
from his countenance the good man can save us

i hope i trust so replied the kinsman we are in no immediate
danger be composed and for your lives all now preserve silence

a few words served to explain the posture of affairs and a few seconds
to transfer the party from its ignoble hiding-place to the open wood
behind it when roland casting his eyes to where nathan lay motionless
on the hill awaited impatiently the expected signal fortunately it was
soon given and in a few moments more the party moving briskly but
stealthily over the eminence had plunged into the dark forest beyond
leaving the baffled pursuers to follow afterwards as they might

now said nathan taking post at roland's side and boldly directing
his course across the track of the enemy we have the evil creatures
behind us and truly there we will keep them and now friend soldier
since such thee is thee must make thee horses do duty tired or not for
if we reach not the old ford before darkness closes on us we may find
but ill fortune crossing the waters hark friend does thee hear he
exclaimed coming to a pause as a sudden and frightful yell suddenly
rose in the forest beyond the ridge obviously proceeding from the five
foes and expressing at once surprise horror and lamentation did thee
not say thee found a dead injun in the wood

we did replied the soldier the body of an indian horribly mangled
and if i am to believe the strange story i have heard of the
jibbenainosay it was some of his bloody work

it is good for thee then and the maidens that is with thee said
nathan for truly the evil creatures have found that same dead man
being doubtless one of their own scouting companions and truly they
say the injuns in such cases made and provided give over their evil
designs in terror and despair in which case as i said it will be good
for thee and thee companions but follow friends and tarry not to ask
questions thee poor women shall come to no harm if nathan slaughter or
little dog peter can help them

with these words of encouragement nathan bounding along with an
activity that kept him ever in advance of the mounted wanderers led the
way from the open forest into a labyrinth of brakes and bogs through
paths traced rather by wolves and bears than any nobler animals so wild
so difficult and sometimes in appearance so impracticable to be
pursued that roland bewildered from the first looked every moment to
find himself plunged into difficulties from which neither the zeal of
nathan nor the sagacity of the unpretending peter could extricate his
weary followers the night was coming fast and coming with clouds and
distant peals of thunder the harbingers of new tempests and how the
journey was to be continued when darkness should at last invest them
through the wild mazes of vine and brake in which they now wandered was
a question which he scarce durst answer but night came and still nathan
led the way with unabated confidence and activity professing a very
hearty contempt for all perils and difficulties of the woods except such
as proceeded from evil-minded shawnee creatures and indeed averring
that there was scarce a nook in the forest for miles around with which
he was not as well acquainted as with the patches of his own leathern
garments truly said he when i first came to this land i did make
me a little cabin in a place hard by but the injuns burned the same
and verily had it not been for little peter who gave me a hint of
their coming i should have been burned with it be of good heart
friend if thee will keep the ill-meaning injun-men out of my way i
will adventure to lead thee anywhere thee will within twenty miles of
this place on the darkest night and that through the thickest cane or
deepest swamp thee can lay eyes on that is if i have but little dog
peter to help me courage friend thee is now coming fast to the river
and if we have but good luck in crossing it thee shall peradventure
find theeself nearer thee friends than thee thinks for

this agreeable assurance was a cordial to the spirits of all and the
travellers now finding themselves though still in profound darkness
moving through the open woodlands again instead of the maze of copses
that had so long confined them roland took advantage of the change to
place himself at nathan's side and endeavour to draw from him some
account of his history and the causes that had brought him into a
position and way of life so ill suited to his faith and peaceful habits
to his questions however nathan seemed little disposed to return
satisfactory answers except in so far as they related to his adventures
since the period of his coming to the frontier of which he spoke very
freely though succinctly he had built him cabins like other lonely
settlers and planted cornfields from which he had been driven time
after time by the evil shawnees incurring frequent perils and
hardships which with the persecutions he endured from his more warlike
and intolerant neighbours gradually drove him into the forest to seek a
precarious subsistence from the spoils of the chase as to his past life
and the causes that had made him a dweller of the wilderness he betrayed
so little inclination to satisfy the young man's curiosity that roland
dropped the subject entirely not however without suspecting that the
imputations bruce had cast upon his character might have had some
foundation in truth

but while conning these things over in his mind on a sudden the soldier
stepped from the dark forest into a broad opening canopied only by the
sky sweeping like a road through the wood in which it was lost behind
him while in front it sank abruptly into a deep hollow or gulf in
which was heard the sullen rush of an impetuous river




chapter xiii


the roar of the moving flood for such by its noise it seemed as they
descended the river-bank to which nathan had so skilfully conducted
them awoke in roland's bosom a feeling of dismay

fear not said the guide to whom he imparted his doubts of the safety
of the ford there is more danger in one single skulking shawnee than
ten thousand such sputtering brooks verily the ford is good enough
though deep and rough and if the water should soil thee young women's
garments a little thee should remember it will not make so ugly a stain
as the bood-mark of a scalping-savage

lead on said pardon dodge with unexpected spirit i am not one of
them ere fellers as fears a big river and my hoss is a dreadful fine
swimmer

in that case said nathan if thee consents to the same i will
get up behind thee and so pass over dry-shod for the feel of wet
leather-breeches is quite uncomfortable

this proposal being reasonable enough was readily acceded to and
nathan was in the act of climbing to the crupper of dodge's horse when
little peter began to manifest a prudent desire to pass the ford dry-shod
also by pawing at his master's heels and beseeching his notice with
sundry low but expressive whinings such at least was the
interpretation which roland who perceived the animal's motions was
inclined to put upon them he was therefore not a little surprised when
nathan starting from the stirrup into which he had climbed leaped again
to the ground staring around him from right to left with every
appearance of alarm

right peter he at last muttered fixing his eye upon the further bank
of the river a dark mass of hill and forest that rose in dim relief
against the clouded sky overshadowing the whole stream which lay like a
pitchy abyss betwixt it and the travellers right peter thee eyes is
as good as thee nose thee is determined the poor women shall not be
murdered

what is it you see demanded forrester and why do you talk of
murdering

speak low and look across the river whispered the guide in reply
does thee see the light glimmering among the rocks by the roadside

i see neither rocks nor road all is to my eyes confused blackness and
as for a light i see nothing stay no tis the gleam of a fire-fly

the gleam of a fire-fly murmured nathan with tones that seemed to
mingle wonder and derision with feelings of a much more serious
character it is such a fire-fly as might burn a house or roast a
living captive at the stake it is a brand in the hands of a camping
shawnee look friend he is blowing it into a flame and presently thee
will see the whole bank around it in a glow

it was even as nathan said almost while he was yet speaking the light
which all now clearly beheld at first a point as small and faint as the
spark of a lampyris and then a star scarce bigger or brighter than the
torch of a jack-o-lantern suddenly grew in magnitude projecting a long
and lance-like though broken reflection over the wheeling current and
then as suddenly shot into a bright and ruddy blaze illumining hill and
river and even the anxious countenances of the travellers at the same
time a dark figure as of a man engaged feeding the flame with fresh
fuel was plainly seen twice or thrice to pass before it how many
others his comrades might be watching its increasing blaze or
preparing for their wild slumbers among the rocks and bushes where it
was kindled it was impossible to divine the sight of the fire itself in
such a solitary spot and under such circumstances even if no attendant
had been seen by it would have been enough to alarm the travellers and
compel the conviction that their enemies had not forgotten to station a
force at this neglected ford as well as at the other more frequented one
above and thus to deprive them of the last hope of escape

this unexpected incident the climax of a long series of disappointments
all of a character so painful and exciting drove the young soldier again
to despair which feeling the tantalising sense that he was now within
but a few miles of his companions in exile and separated from them only
by the single obstruction before him exasperated into a species of fury
bordering almost upon frenzy

there is but one way of escape he exclaimed without venturing even a
look towards his kinswoman or seeking by idle words to conceal the
danger of their situation we must pass the river the roar of the water
will drown the noise of our foot-steps we can cross unheard and unlooked
for and then if there be no way of avoiding them we can pour a volley
among the rascals at their fire and take advantage of their confusion to
gallop by look to the women nathan slaughter and you pardon dodge
and emperor follow me and do as you see me do

truly said wandering nathan with admirable coolness and
complacency thee is a courageous young man and a young man of sense
and spirit that is to say after thee own sense of matters and things
and truly if it were not for the poor women and for the blazing fire
thee might greatly confound and harmfully vanquish the evil creatures
there placed so unluckily on the bank in the way and manner which thee
thinks of but friend thee plan will not do thee might pass unheard
indeed but not unseen does thee not see how brightly the fire blazes on
the water truly we should all be seen and fired at before we reached
the middle of the stream and truly i should not be surprised if the
gleam of the fire on the pale faces of thee poor women should bring a
shot upon us where we stand and therefore friend the sooner we get us
out of the way the better

and where shall we betake us demanded roland the sternness of whose
accents but ill-disguised the gloom and hopelessness of his feelings

to a place of safety and of rest replied the guide and to one that
is nigh at hand where we may lodge us with little fear of injuns until
such time as the waters shall bate a little or the stars give us light
to cross them at a place where are no evil shawnees to oppose us and
then friend as to slipping by these foolish creatures who make such
bright fires on the public highway truly with little peter's
assistance we can do it with great ease

let us not delay said roland and added sullenly though where a
place of rest and safety can be found in these detestable woods i can no
longer imagine

it is a place of rest at least for the dead said nathan in a low
voice at the same time leading the party back again up the bank and
taking care to shelter them as he ascended as much as possible from the
light of the fire which was now blazing with great brilliancy nine
human corpses father and mother grandam and children sleep under the
threshold at the door and there are not many white men or injuns that
will of their free will step over the bosoms of the poor murdered
creatures after nightfall and the more especially because there are
them that believe they rise at midnight and roam round the house and the
clearings mourning yet it is a good hiding-place for them that are in
trouble and many a night have little peter and i sheltered us beneath
the ruined roof with little fear of either ghosts or injuns though
truly we have sometimes heard strange and mournful noises among the
trees around us it is but a poor place and a sad one but it will afford
thee weary women a safe resting-place till such time as we can cross the
river

these words of nathan brought to roland's recollection the story of the
ashburns whom bruce had alluded to as having been all destroyed at
their station in a single night by the indians and whose tragical fate
perhaps more than any other circumstance had diverted the course of
travel from the ford near to which they had seated themselves to the
upper and originally less frequented one

it was not without reluctance that roland prepared to lead his
little party to this scene of butchery and sorrow for though little
inclined himself to superstitious feelings of any kind he could easily
imagine what would be the effect of such a scene with its gloomy and
blood-stained associations on the harassed mind of his cousin but
suffering and terror even on the part of edith were not to be thought
of where they could purchase escape from evils far more real and
appalling and he therefore avoided all remonstrance and opposition and
even sought to hasten the steps of his conductor towards the ruined and
solitary pile

the bank was soon re-ascended and the party stealing along in silence
presently took their last view of the ford and the yet blazing-fire that
had warned them so opportunely from its dangerous vicinity in another
moment they had crept a second time into the forest though in the
opposite quarter from that whence they had come making their way through
what had once been a broad path evidently cut by the hands of man
through a thick cane-brake though long disused and now almost choked by
brambles and shrubs and by and by having followed it for somewhat less
than half a mile they found themselves on a kind of clearing which it
was equally manifest had been once a cultivated field of several acres
in extent throughout the whole of this space the trunks of the old
forest-trees dimly seen in the light of a clouded sky were yet
standing but entirely leafless and dead and presenting such an aspect
of desolation as is painful to the mind even when sunshine and the
flourishing maize at their roots invest them with a milder and more
cheerful character such prospects are common enough in all new american
clearings where the husbandman is content to deprive the trees of life
by girdling and then leave them to the assaults of the elements and
the natural course of decay and where a thousand trunks of the gigantic
growth of the west are thus seen rising together in the air naked and
hoary with age they impress the imagination with such gloom as is
engendered by the sight of ruined colonnades

such was the case with the present prospect years had passed since the
axe had sapped the strength of the mighty oaks and beeches bough after
bough and limb after limb had fallen to the earth with here and there
some huge trunk itself overthrown by the blast and now rotting among
weeds on the soil which it cumbered at the present hour the spectacle
was peculiarly mournful and dreary the deep solitude of the spot the
hour itself the gloomy aspect of the sky veiled in clouds the
occasional rush of the wind sweeping like a tempest through the woods to
be succeeded by a dead and dismal calm the roll of distant thunder
reverberating among-the hills but more than all the remembrance of
the tragical event that had consigned the ill-fated settlement to neglect
and desolation gave the deepest character of gloom to the scene

as the travellers entered upon the clearing there occurred one of those
casualties which so often increase the awe of the looker-on in such
places in one of the deepest lulls and hushes of the wind when there
was no apparent cause in operation to produce such an effect a tall and
majestic trunk was seen to decline from the perpendicular topple slowly
through the air and then fall to the earth with a crash like the shock
of an earthquake

the poet and the moralising philosopher may find food for contemplation
in such a scene and such a catastrophe he may see in the lofty and
decaying trunks the hoary relics and representatives of a generation of
better and greater spirits than those who lead the destinies of his
own spirits left not more as monuments of the past than as models for
the imitation of the present he may contrast their majestic serenity and
rest their silence and immovableness with the turmoil of the greener
growth around the uproar and collision produced by every gust and trace
the resemblance to the scene where the storms of party rising among the
sons hurtle so indecently around the gray fathers of the republic whose
presence should stay them and finally he may behold in the trunks as
they yield at last to decay and sink one by one to the earth the fall
of each aged parent of his country a fall indeed as of an oak of a
thousand generations shocking the earth around and producing for a
moment wonder awe grief and then a long forgetfulness

but men in the situation of the travellers have neither time nor
inclination for moralising the fall of the tree only served to alarm the
weaker members of the party to some of whom perhaps it appeared as an
inauspicious omen apparently however it woke certain mournful
recollections in the brains of both little peter and his master the
former of whom as he passed it by began to snuffle and whine in a low
and peculiar manner while nathan immediately responded as if in reply
to his counsellor's address ay truly peter thee has a good memory
of the matter though five long years is a marvellous time for thee
little noddle to hold things it was under this very tree they murdered
the poor old granny and brained the innocent helpless babe of a truth
it was a sight that made my heart sink within me

what asked roland who followed close at his heels and over heard the
half-soliloquised expressions were you present at the massacre

alas friend replied nathan it was neither the first nor last
massacre that i have seen with these eyes i dwelt in them days in a
cabin a little distance down the river and these poor people the
ashburns were my near neighbours though truly they were not to me as
neighbours should be but held me in dis-favour because of my faith and
ever repelled me from their doors with scorn and ill-will yet was i
sorry for them because of the little children they had in the house the
same being far from succour and when i found the tracks of the injun
party in the wood as it was often my fate to do while rambling in
search of food and saw that they were bending their way towards my own
little wigwam i said to myself whilst they are burning the same i
will get me to friend ashburn that he may be warned and escape to friend
brace's station in time with his people and cattle but verily they
held my story light and laughed and derided me for in them days the
people hardened their hearts and closed their ears against me because i
held it not according to conscience to kill injuns as they did and so
refused and so friend they drove me from their doors seeing which
and perceiving the poor creatures were in a manner besotted and bent
upon their own destruction and the night coming on fast i turned my
steps and ran with what speed i could to friend bruce's telling him the
whole story and advising that he should despatch a strong body of
horsemen to the place so as to frighten the evil creatures away for
truly i did not hold it right that there should be bloodshed but
truly and alas friend i fared no better and perhaps a little worse at
the station than i had fared before at ashburn's wherefore being left
in despair i said to myself i will go into the woods and hide me away
not returning to the river lest i should be compelled to look upon the
shedding-of the blood of the women and little babes which i had no power
to prevent but it came into my mind that perhaps the injuns not
finding me in the wigwam might lie in wait round about it expecting my
return and so delay the attack upon friend ashburn's house whereby i
might have time to reach him and warn him of his danger again and this
idea prevailed with me so that i rose me up again and with little
peter at my side i ran back again until i had reached this very field
when peter gave me to know the injuns were hard by thee don't know
little peter friend truly he has the strongest nose for an injun thee
ever saw does thee not fear how he whines and snuffs along the grass
now friend were it not that this is a bloody spot that peter
remembers well because of the wicked deeds he saw performed i would
know by his whining as truly as if he were to open his mouth and say as
much in words that there were evil injuns nigh at hand and that it
behooved me to be up and a-doing well friend as i was saying it was
with such words as these that little peter told me that mischief was
nigh and truly i had scarce time to hide me in the corn which was
then in the ear before i heard the direful yells with which the
bloodthirsty creatures who were then round about the house woke up its
frighted inmates verily friend i will not shock thee by telling thee
what i heard and saw there was a fate on the family and even on the
animals that looked to it for protection neither horse nor cow gave them
the alarm and even the house-dog slept so soundly that the enemies
dragged loose brush into the porch and fired it before any one but
themselves dreamed of danger it was when the flames burst out that the
warwhoop was sounded and when the eyes of the sleepers opened it was
only to see themselves surrounded by flames and raging shawnees then
friend continued nathan speaking with a faltering and low voice
graduated for the ears of roland for whom alone the story was intended
though others caught here and there some of its dismal revealments
then thee may think there was rushing out of men women and children
with the cracking of rifles the crashing of hatchets the plunge of
knives with yells and shrieks such as would turn thee spirit into ice
and water to hear it was a fearful massacre but friend fearful as it
was these eyes of mine had looked on one more dreadful before thee
would not believe it friend but thee knows not what them see who have
spent their lives on the injun border well friend continued the
narrator after this brief digression while they were murdering the
stronger i saw the weakest of all the old grandam with the youngest
babe in her arms come flying into the corn and she had reached this
very tree that has fallen but now as if to remind me of the story when
the pursuer for it was but a single man they sent in chase of the poor
feeble old woman caught up with her and struck her down with his
tomahawk then friend for truly i saw it all in the light of the
fire being scarce two rods off he snatched the poor babe from the
dying woman's arms and struck it with the same bloody hatchet 

and you exclaimed roland leaning from his horse and clutching the
speaker by the collar for he was seized with ungovernable indignation
or rather fury at what he esteemed the cold-blooded cowardice of nathan
you he cried grasping him as if he would have torn him to pieces
you wretch stood by and saw the child murdered

friend said nathan with some surprise at the unexpected assault but
still with great submissiveness thee is as unjust to me as others had
i been as free to shed blood as thee theeself yet could i not have saved
the babe in that way seeing that my gun was taken from me and i was
unarmed thee forgets or rather i forgot to inform thee how when i
told friend bruce my story he took my gun from me saying that as i was
not man enough to use it i should not be allowed to carry it and so
turned me out naked from the fort truly it was an ill thing of him to
take from me that which gave me my meat and truly too it was doubly
ill of him as it concerned the child for i tell thee friend when i
stood in the corn and saw the great brutal injun raise the hatchet to
strike the little child had there been a gun in my hand i should i
can't tell thee friend what i might have done but truly i should not
have permitted the evil creature to do the bloody deed

i thought so by heaven said roland who had relaxed his grasp the
moment nathan mentioned the seizure of the gun which story was
corroborated by the account bruce had himself given of that stretch of
authority i thought so no human creature not an indian unless the
veriest dastard and dog that ever lived could have had arms in his hand
and on such an occasion failed to use them but you had humanity you
did something

friend said nathan meekly i did what i could but truly what
could i nevertheless friend i did being set beside myself by the
sight snatch the little babe out of the man's hands and fly to the
woods hoping though it was sore wounded that it might yet live but
alas before i had run a mile it died in my arms and i was covered from
head to foot with its blood it was a sore sight for friend bruce whom i
found with his people galloping to the ford to see what there might be
in my story for it seems as he told me himself that after he had
driven me away he could not sleep for thinking that perhaps i had told
the truth and truth enough he soon found i had spoken for galloping
immediately to ashburn's house he found nothing there but the corses of
the people and the house partly consumed for being of green timber
it could not all burn there was not one of the poor family that
escaped

but they were avenged muttered the soldier

if thee calls killing the killers avenging replied nathan the poor
deceased people had vengeance enough of the fourteen murderers for that
was the number eleven were killed before day-dawn the pursuers having
discovered where they had built their fire and so taken them by
surprise and of the three that escaped it was afterwards said by
returning captives that only one made his way home the other two having
perished in the woods in some way unknown but truly continued
nathan suddenly diverting his attention from the tragic theme to the
motions of his dog little peter is more disturbed than is his wont
truly he has never had a liking to the spot i have heard them that said
a dog could scent the presence of spirits

to my mind said roland who had not forgotten nathan's eulogium on the
excellence of the animal's nose for scenting indians and who was
somewhat alarmed at what appeared to him the evident uneasiness of little
peter he is more like to wind another party of cursed shawnees than
any harmless disembodied spirits

friend said nathan it may be that injuns have trodden upon this
field this day seeing that the wood is full of them and it is like
enough that those very evil creatures at the ford hard by have stolen
hither before taking their post to glut their eyes with the sight of
the ruins where the blood of nine poor white persons was shed by their
brothers in a single night though truly in that case they must have
also thought of the thirteen murderers that bled for the victims which
would prove somewhat a drawback to their satisfaction no friend peter
has his likes and his dislikes like a human being and this is a spot he
ever approaches with abhorrence as truly i do myself never coming
hither unless when driven as now by necessity but friend if thee is
in fear thee shall be satisfied there is no danger before thee it shall
never be said that i undertook to lead thee poor women out of mischief
only to plunge them into peril i will go before thee to the ruin which
thee sees there by the hollow and reconnoitre

it needs not said roland who now seeing the cabin of which they were
in search close at hand and perceiving that peter's uneasiness had
subsided dismissed his own as being groundless but notwithstanding he
thought proper as nathan advanced to ride forward himself and inspect
the condition of the building in which he was about to commit the safety
of the being he held most dear and on whose account only he felt the
thousand anxieties and terrors he never could have otherwise experienced

the building was a low cabin of logs standing as it seemed on the
verge of an abyss in which the river could be heard rushing
tumultuously as if among rocks and other obstructions it was one of
those double cabins so frequently found in the west that is to say it
consisted of two separate cots or wings standing a little distance
apart but united by a common roof which thus afforded shelter to the
open hall or passage between them while the roof being continued also
from the eaves both before and behind in pent-house fashion it allowed
space for wide porches in which and in the open passage the summer
traveller resting in such a cabin will almost always find the most
agreeable quarters

how little soever of common wisdom and discretion the fate of the
builders might have shown them to possess they had not forgotten to
provide their solitary dwelling with such defences as were common to all
others in the land at that period a line of palisades carelessly and
feebly constructed indeed but perhaps sufficient for the purpose
intended enclosed the ground on which the cabin stood and this being
placed directly in the centre and joining the palisades at the sides
thus divided the enclosure into two little yards one in front the other
in the rear in which was space sufficient for horses and cattle as well
as for the garrison when called to repel assailants the space behind
extended to the verge of the river-bank which falling down a sheer
precipice of forty or fifty feet required no defence of stakes and
seemed never to have been provided with them while that in front
circumscribed a portion of a cleared field entirely destitute of trees
and almost of bushes

such had been the original plan and condition of a fortified
private-dwelling a favourable specimen perhaps of the family-forts
of the day and which manned by five or six active and courageous
defenders might have bidden defiance to thrice the number of barbarians
that had actually succeeded in storming it its present appearance was
ruinous and melancholy in the extreme the stockade was in great part
destroyed especially in front where the stakes seemed to have been
rooted up by the winds or to have fallen from sheer decay and the right
wing or cot that had suffered most from the flames lay a black and
mouldering-pile of logs confusedly heaped on its floor or on the earth
beneath the only part of the building yet standing was the cot on the
left hand which consisted of but a single room and that as roland
perceived at a glance almost roofless and ready to fall

nothing could be more truly cheerless and forbidding than the appearance
of the ruined pile and the hoarse and dismal rush of the river below
heard the more readily by reason of a deep rocky fissure or ravine
running from the rear yard to the water's edge through which the sound
ascended in hollow echoes added double horror to its appearance it was
moreover obviously insecure and untenable against any resolute enemy to
whom the ruins of the fallen wing and stockade and the rugged depths of
the ravine offered much more effectual shelter as well as the best place
of annoyance the repugnance however that roland felt to occupy it even
for a few hours was combatted by nathan who represented that the ford
at which he designed crossing the river several miles farther down
could not be safely attempted until the rise of the waning moon or
until the clouds should disperse affording them the benefit of the dim
star-light that the road to it ran through swamps and hollows now
submerged in which could be found no place of rest for the females
exhausted by fatigue and mental suffering and that the ruin might be
made as secure as the station the travellers had left for truly said
he it is not according to my ways or conscience to leave anything to
chance or good luck when there is injun scent in the forest though it
be in the forest ten miles off truly friend i design when thee poor
tired women is sleeping to keep watch round the ruin with peter to help
me and if theeself and thee two male persons have strength to do the
same it will be all the better for the same

it shall be done said roland as much relieved by the suggestion as he
was pleased by the humane spirit that prompted it my two soldiers can
watch if they cannot fight and i shall take care they watch well

thus composing the difficulty preparations were immediately made to
occupy the ruin into which roland having previously entered with the
emperor and struck a light introduced his weary kinswoman with her
companion telie while nathan and pardon dodge led the horses into the
ravine where they could be easily confined and allowed to browse and
drink at will being at the same time beyond the reach of observation
from any foe that might yet be prowling through the forest




chapter xiv


the light struck by the negro was soon succeeded by a fire for which
ample materials lay ready at hand among the ruins and as it blazed up
from the broken and long deserted hearth the travellers could better
view the dismal aspect of the cabin it consisted as has been mentioned
of but a single remaining apartment with walls of logs from whose
chinks the clay with which they had been originally plastered had long
since vanished with here and there a fragment of a log itself leaving a
thousand gaps for the admission of wind and rain the ceiling of poles
for it had once possessed a kind of garret had fallen down under the
weight of the rotting roof of which but a small portion remained and
that in the craziest condition and the floor of puncheons or planks
of split logs was in a state of equal dilapidation more than half of it
having rotted away and mingled with the earth on which it reposed doors
and windows there were none but two mouldering gaps in the front and the
rear walls and another of greater magnitude opening from the side into
what had once been the hall or passage though now a platform heaped with
fragments of charred timber showed where the narrow entrance and
loop-hole windows had once existed the former was without leaf or
defence of any kind unless such might have been found in three or four
logs standing against the wall hard by whence they could be easily
removed and piled against the opening for which purpose roland did not
doubt they had been used and by the houseless nathan himself but a
better protection was offered by the ruins of the other apartment which
had fallen down in such a way as almost to block up the door leaving a
passage in and out only towards the rear of the building and in case
of sudden attack and seizure of this sole entrance there were several
gaps at the bottom of the wall through one of which in particular it
would be easy enough to effect a retreat at this place the floor was
entirely wanting and the earth below washed into a gully communicating
with the rocky ravine of which it might be considered the head

but the looks of the soldier did not dwell long upon the dreary spectacle
of ruin they were soon cast upon the countenance of edith concealed so
long by darkness it was even wanner and paler than he feared to find it
and her eye shone with an unnatural lustre as it met his own she
extended her hands and placed them in his gazed upon him piercingly but
without speaking or indeed seeming able to utter a single word

be of good heart he said replying to the look of inquiry we are
unfortunate edith but we are safe

thank heaven she exclaimed but more wildly than fervently i have
been looking every moment to see you shot dead at my feet would i had
died roland my brother before i brought you to this fatal land but i
distress you well i will not be frightened more but is not this an
adventure for a woman that never before looked upon a cut finger without
fainting truly roland truly as friend nathan says it is as
ridiculous as frightful and then this cabin where they killed so many
poor women and children is it not a ridiculous lodging place for edith
forrester a canopy of clouds a couch of clay with owls and snakes for
my bed-fellows truly truly truly it is very ridiculous

it seemed for a moment as if the maiden's effort to exchange her
melancholy and terror for a more joyous feeling would have resulted in
producing even greater agitation than before but the soothing words of
roland and the encouraging countenance maintained by telie doe who
seemed little affected by their forlorn situation gradually tranquilised
her mind and enabled her the better to preserve the air of levity and
mirthfulness which she so vainly attempted at first to assume this
moment of calm roland took advantage of to apprise her of the necessity
of recruiting her spirits with a few hours asleep for which purpose he
began to look about him for some suitable place in which to strew her a
bed of fern and leaves

why here is one strewn for me already she cried with an affected
laugh pointing to a corner in which lay a mass of leaves so green and
fresh that they looked as if plucked but a day or two before truly
nathan has not invited me to his hiding-place to lodge me meanly heaven
forgive me for laughing at the poor man for we owe him our lives nay
nor to send me supperless to bed see she added pointing to a small
brazen kettle which her quick eye detected among the leaves and which
was soon followed by a second that emperor stirred up from its
concealment and both of them as was soon perceived still retaining the
odour of a recent savoury stew look well emperor where the kitchen
is the larder cannot be far distant i warrant we shall find that nathan
has provided us a good supper

such perhaps as a woodman only can eat said roland who somewhat
surprised at the superfluous number of nathan's valuables for to nathan
he doubted not they belonged had begun stirring the leaves and
succeeded in raking up with his rifle which he had not laid aside a
little earthen pouch well stored with parched corn a strange fellow
this nathan he muttered he really spoke as if he had not visited the
ruin for a considerable period whereas it is evident he must have slept
here last night but he seems to affect mystery in all that concerns his
own private movements it is the character of his persuasion

while roland with the females was thus laying hands and speculating
upon the supposed chattels of their conductor nathan himself entered the
apartment betraying some degree of agitation in his countenance whilst
the faithful peter who followed at his side manifested equal
uneasiness by snuffing the air whining and rubbing himself frequently
against his master's legs

friends he cried abruptly peter talks too plainly to be mistaken
there is mischief nigh at hand though where or how it can be sinner
and weak foolish man that i am i know not we must leave warm fires and
soft beds and take refuge again in the woods

this unexpected announcement again banished the blood from edith's
cheeks she had on his entrance caught the pouch of corn from roland's
hands intending to present it to the guide with some such light
expressions as should convince her kinsman of her recovered spirits but
the visage and words of nathan struck her dumb and she stood holding
it in her hand without speaking a word until it caught nathan's eye he
snatched it from her grasp surveying it with astonishment and even
alarm and only ceased to look at it when little peter who had run into
the corner and among the bed of leaves uttered a whine louder than
before the pouch dropped from nathan's hand as his eye fell upon the
shining-kettles on which he gazed as if petrified

what in heaven's name is the matter demanded roland himself taking
the alarm are you frighted at your own kettles

mine cried nathan clasping his hands and looking terror and remorse
together if thee will kill me friend thee will scarce do amiss for
miserable blind sinner that i am i have led thee poor luckless women
into the very lion's den into the hiding-place and head-quarters of the
very cut-throats that is seeking to destroy thee up and away does thee
not hear peter howling at the door hist peter hist truly this is a
pretty piece of business for thee nathan slaughter does thee not hear
them close at hand

i hear the hooting of an owl and the answer of his fellow replied
roland but his words were cut short by a second howl from peter and the
cry of his master up if thee be not besotted drag thee women by the
hands and follow me

with these words nathan was leaping towards the door when a cry from
roland arrested him he looked round and perceived edith had fainted in
the soldier's arms i will save the poor thing for thee help thou the
other he cried and snatching her up as if she had been but a feather
he was again in the act of springing to the door when brought to a stand
by a far more exciting impediment a shriek from telie doe uttered in
sudden terror was echoed by a laugh strangely wild harsh guttural
and expressive of equal triumph and derision coming from the door
looking to which the eyes of nathan and the soldier fell upon a tall and
naked indian shorn and painted who rifle in hand the grim smile yet
writhing on his features and exclaiming with a mockery of friendly
accost bo-zhoo brudders injun good friend was stepping that
moment into the hovel and as if that spectacle and those sounds were not
enough to chill the heart's blood of the spectators there were seen over
his shoulders the gleaming eyes and heard behind his back the malign
laughter of three or four equally wild and ferocious companions

footnote bo-zhoo a corruption of the french bon jour a word of
salutation adopted by western indians from the voyageurs of canada and
used by them with great zeal by night as well as by day

to the door if thee is a man rush cried nathan with a voice
more like the blast of a bugle than the tone of a frighted man of peace
and casting edith from his arms he set the example of attack or
flight roland scarcely knew which by leaping against the breast of the
daring intruder both fell together across the threshold and roland
obeying the call with desperate and frantic ardour stumbled over their
bodies pitching headlong into the passage whereby he escaped the
certain death that otherwise awaited him three several rifle-shots
having been that instant poured upon him from a distance of scarce as
many feet

strike if thee conscience permits thee he heard the voice of
nathan cry in his ears and the next moment a shot from the interior
of the hovel heralded by a quavering cry from the faithful
emperor lorra-gor nebber harm an injun in my life struck the
hatchet from the shattered hand of a foeman who had taken advantage of
his downfall to aim a fatal blow at him while rising a yell of pain came
from the maimed and baffled warrior who springing over the blackened
ruins before the door escaped the stroke of the clubbed rifle which the
soldier aimed at him in return the piece having been discharged by the
fall the cry of the flying assailant was echoed by what seemed in
roland's ears the yells of fifty supporters two of whom he saw within
six feet of him brandishing their hatchets as if in the act of flinging
them at his almost defenceless person it was at this moment that he
experienced aid from a quarter whence it was almost least expected a
rifle was discharged from the ravine and as one of the fierce foes
suddenly dropped mortally wounded upon the floor he heard the voice of
pardon the yankee crying in tones of desperation when there is no
dodging em then i'm the man for em or it a'n't no matter

bravo bravely done emperor and dodge both cried roland to whom this
happy and quite unexpected display of courage from his followers and its
successful results imparted a degree of assurance and hope not before
felt for indeed up to this moment his feeling had been the mere
frenzy of despair courage and rush on and with these words he did
not hesitate to dash against the remaining foe striking up the uplifted
hatchet with his rifle and endeavouring with the same effort to dash his
weapon into the warrior's face but the former part only of the manoeuvre
succeeded the tomahawk was indeed dashed aside but the rifle was torn
from his own grasp and the next moment he was clutched as in the embrace
of a bear and pressed with suffocating force upon the breast of his
undaunted adversary

brudder growled the savage and the foam flew from his grinning
lips advanced until they were almost in contact with the soldier's
face brudder he cried as he felt his triumph and twined his arms
still more tightly around roland's frame long-knife nothing hab a
scalp shawnee

with these words he sprang from the broken floor of the passage on
which the encounter began and dragging the soldier along made as if he
would have carried him off alive but although in the grasp of a man of
much superior strength the resolution and activity of roland preserved
him from a destiny at once so fearful and ignoble he exerted the
strength he possessed at the instant when the bulky captor was springing
from the floor to the broken ground beneath and with such effect that
though it did not entirely release him from his grasp it carried them
headlong to the earth together whence after a brief and blind struggle
both rose together each clutching at the weapon that promised soonest to
terminate the contest the pistols of the soldier which as well as
emperor's the peaceful nathan had taken the precaution to carry with him
into the ruin had been forgotten in the suddenness and hurry of the
assault his rifle had been wrested from his hands and thrown he knew
not where the knife which like a true adventurer of the forest he had
buckled in his belt was ready to be grasped but the instinct of long
habits carried his hand to the broad-sword which was yet strapped to his
thigh and this as he rose he attempted to draw not doubting that a
single blow of the trusty steel would rid him of his brown enemy but the
shawnee as bold as alert and far more discreet better acquainted
too with those savage personal rencontres which make up so large a
portion of indian warfare had drawn his knife before he had yet regained
his footing and before the virginian's sword was half unsheathed the
hand that tugged at it was again seized and held as in a vice while the
warrior elevating his own free weapon above his head prepared with a
laugh and whoop of triumph to plunge it into the soldier's throat his
countenance grim with warpaint grimmer with ferocious exultation was
distinctly perceived the bright blaze of the fire shining through the
gaps of the hovel so as to illuminate every feature and roland as he
strove in vain to clutch at the uplifted arm so as to avert the
threatened blow could distinguish every motion of the weapon and every
change of his foeman's visage but he did not even then despair for he
was in all circumstances affecting only himself a man of true
intrepidity and it was only when on a sudden the light wholly vanished
from the cabin as if the brands had been scattered and trodden out that
he began to anticipate a fatal result from the advantage possessed by his
opponent but at that very instant and while blinded by the sudden
darkness he was expecting the blow which he no longer knew how to avoid
the laugh of the warrior now louder and more exultant than before was
suddenly changed to a yell of agony a jet of warm blood at the same
moment gushed over roland's right arm and the savage struck by an
unknown hand or by a random ball fell a dead man at his feet
overwhelming the soldier in his fall

up and do according to thee conscience cried nathan slaughter whose
friendly arm more nervous than that of his late foe at this conjuncture
jerked roland from beneath the body for truly thee fights like unto a
young lion or an old bear and truly i will not censure thee if thee
kills a whole dozen of the wicked cut-throats here is thee gun and thee
pistols fire and shout aloud with thee voice for of a verity thee
enemies is confounded by thee resolution do thee make them believe thee
has been reinforced by numbers

and with that the peaceful nathan uplifting his voice and springing
among the ruins from log to log began to utter a series of shouts all
designed to appear as if coming from different throats and all
expressing such manly courage and defiance that even pardon dodge who
yet lay ensconced among the rocks of the ravine and emperor the negro
who it seems had taken post behind the ruins at the door felt their
spirits wax resolute and valiant and added their voices to the din the
one roaring come on ye tarnal critturs if you must come while
the other bellowed with equal spirit don't care for niggah injun no
way will fight and die for massa and missie

all these several details from the moment of the appearance of the
warrior at the door until the loud shouts of the besieged travellers took
the place of the savage whoops previously sounded passed in fewer
moments than we have taken pages to record them the rush of nathan
against the leader the discomfiture of one and the death of his two
comrades were indeed the work of but an instant as it seemed to roland
and he was scarce aware of the assault before he perceived that it was
over the successful and doubtless the wholly unexpected resistance of
the little party resulting in a manner so fatal to the advanced guard of
assailants had struck terror and confusion into the main body whose
presence had been only made known by their yells not a single shot
having yet been fired by them

it was in this moment of confusion that nathan sprang to the side of
roland who was hastily recharging his piece and catching him by the
hand said with a voice that betrayed the deepest agitation though his
countenance was veiled in night friend i have betrayed thee poor
women into danger so that the axe and scalping-knife is now near their
innocent poor heads

it needs not to speak of it said roland adding hastily the
miscreant that entered the cabin did you kill him

kill friend i kill echoed nathan with accents more disturbed
than ever would thee have me a murderer truly i did creep over him
and leave the cabin

and left him in it alive cried roland who was about to rush into the
hovel when nathan detained him saying don't thee be alarmed friend
truly thee may think it was ill of me to fall upon him so violently
but truly be must have split his head upon a log or wounded himself
with a splinter or perhaps the coloured person stuck him with a knife
but truly as it happened his blood spouted on my hand by reason of the
hurt he got so that i left him clean dead

good said roland but by heaven i hoped and believed you had
yourself finished him like a man but time presses we must retreat again
to the woods they are yet open behind us

thee is mistaken said nathan and as if to confirm his words there
arose at that moment a loud whooping with the crack of a dozen or more
rifles let fly with impotent rage by the enemy showing plainly enough
that the ruin was already actually environed

the ravine the river cried forrester we can swim it with the
horses if it be not fordable

it is a torrent that would sweep thee with thee strongest war-horse to
perdition muttered nathan does thee not hear how it roars among the
rocks and cliffs it is here deep narrow and rocky and though in the
season of drought a child might step across it from rock to rock it is
a cataract in the time of floods no friend i have brought thee into a
trap whence thee has no escape unless thee would desert these poor
helpless women

put but them in safety said roland and care not for the rest and
yet i do not despair we have shown what we can do by resolution we can
keep the cut-throats at bay till the morning

and what will that advantage thee except to see thee poor females
murdered in the light of the sun instead of having them killed out of
thee sight in darkness truly the first glimmer of dawn will be the
signal of death to all for then the shawnees will find thee weakness if
indeed they do not find it before

man said roland why should you drive me to despair give me better
comfort give me counsel or say no more you have brought us to this
pass do your best to save us or our blood be upon your head

to these words of unjust reproach wrung from the young soldier by the
bitterness of his feelings nathan at first made no reply preserving
silence for awhile he said at last

well friend i counsel thee to be of good heart and to do what thee
can making thee enemies since thee cannot increase thee friends as few
in numbers as possible to do which friend he added suddenly if
thee will shoot that evil creature that lies like a log on the earth
creeping towards the ruin i will have no objection

with these words which were uttered in a low voice nathan pulling the
young man behind a screen of fallen timbers near to which they stood
endeavoured to point him out the enemy whom his eye had that moment
detected crawling towards the hovel with the subtle motion of a serpent
but the vision of roland not yet accustomed to trace objects in the
darkness of a wood failed to discover the approaching foe

truly said nathan somewhat impatiently if thee will not consider it
as an evil thing of me and a blood-guiltiness i will hold thee gun for
thee and thee shall pull the trigger which piece of service the man of
peace having doubtless satisfied his conscience of its lawfulness was
actually about to render the soldier when the good intention was set at
naught by the savage suddenly leaping to his feet followed by a dozen
others all springing as it seemed out of the earth and rushing with
wild yells against the ruin the suddenness and fury of the attack struck
dismay to the bosom of the soldier who discharging his rifle and
snatching up his pistols already in imagination beheld the bloody
fingers of a barbarian grasped among the bright locks of his edith when
nathan crying blood upon my hands but not upon my head give it to
them murdering dogs let fly his own piece upon the throng the effect
of which together with the discharge of roland's pistols immediately
after was such as to stagger the assailants of whom but a single one
preserved resolution enough to advance upon the defenders whooping to
his companions in vain to follow thee will remember i fight to save the
lives of thee helpless women muttered nathan in roland's ear and then
as if the first act of warfare had released him for ever from all
peaceful obligations awakened a courage and appetite for blood superior
even to the soldier's and in other words set him entirely beside
himself he rushed against the advancing shawnee dealing him a blow with
the butt of his heavy stocked rifle that crushed through skull and brain
as through a gourd killing the man on the spot then leaping like a buck
to avoid the shot of the others he rushed back to the ruin and grasping
the hand of the admiring soldier and wringing it with all his might he
cried thee sees what thee has brought me to friend thee has seen me
shed a man's blood but nevertheless friend the villains shall not
kill thee poor women nor harm a hair of their heads

the valour of the man of peace was fortunately seconded on this occasion
by dodge and the negro the former from his hiding place in the ravine
the latter from among the ruins and the enemy thus seriously warned of
the danger of approaching too nigh a fortress manned by what very
naturally appeared to them eight different persons for such including
the pistols was the number of fire-arms retired precipitately to the
woods where they expressed their hostility only by occasional whoops
and now and then by a shot fired impotently against the ruins

the success of this second defence the spirited behaviour of dodge and
emperor but more than all the happy change in the principles and
practice of nathan who seemed as if about to prove that he could deserve
the nickname of tiger so long bestowed upon him in derision greatly
relieved the spirits of the soldier who was not without hopes of being
able to maintain the contest until the enemy should be discouraged and
driven off or some providential accident bring him succour he took
advantage of the cessation of hostilities to creep into the hovel and
whisper words of assurance to his feebler dependents of whom indeed
telie doe now betrayed the greatest distress and agitation while edith
on the contrary maintained as he judged for the fire was extinguished
and he saw not her countenance a degree of tranquillity he had not dared
to hope it was a tranquillity however resulting from despair and
stupor a lethargy of spirit resulting from overwrought feelings in
which she happily remained more than half unconscious of what was
passing around her




chapter xv


the enemy twice repulsed and on both occasions with severe loss had
been taught the folly of exposing themselves too freely to the fire of
the travellers but although driven back they manifested little
inclination to fly further than was necessary to obtain shelter and as
little to give over their fierce purposes concealing themselves
severally behind logs rocks and bushes and so disposing their force as
to form a line around the ruin open only towards the river where escape
was obviously impracticable they employed themselves keeping a strict
watch upon the hovel firing repeated volleys and as often uttering
yells with which they sought to strike terror into the hearts of the
besieged occasionally some single warrior bolder than the rest would
creep near the ruins and obtaining such shelter as he could discharge
his piece at any mouldering beam or other object which his fancy
converted into the exposed body of a defender but the travellers had
taken good care to establish themselves in such positions among the ruins
as offered the best protection and although the bullets whistled sharp
and nigh not a single one had yet received a wound nor was there much
reason to apprehend injury so long as the darkness of night befriended
them

yet it was obvious to all that this state of security could not last
long and that it existed only because the enemy was not yet aware of his
advantage the condition of the ruins was such that a dozen men of
sufficient spirit dividing themselves and creeping along the earth
might at any moment make their way to any and every part of the hovel
without being seen when a single rush must put it in their power an
open assault indeed from the whole body of besiegers whose number was
reckoned by nathan at full fifteen or twenty must have produced the same
success though with the loss of several lives a random shot might at
any moment destroy or disable one of the little garrison and thus rob
one important corner of the hovel which from its dilapidated state was
wholly indefensible from within of defence it was indeed as roland
felt more than folly to hope that all should escape unharmed for many
hours longer but the worst fear of all was that previously suggested by
nathan all might survive the perils of the night but what fate was to
be expected when the coming of day should expose the party in all its
true weakness to the eyes of the enemy if relief came not before
morning roland's heart whispered him it must come in vain but the
probabilities of relief what were they the question was asked of
nathan and the answer went like iron through roland's soul they were in
the deepest and most solitary part of the forest twelve miles from
bruce's station and at least eight from that at which the emigrants were
to lodge with no other places within twice the distance from which help
could be obtained they had left three or four miles behind the main
and only road on which volunteers summoned from the western stations to
repel the invasion of which the news had arrived before roland's
departure from bruce's village could be expected to pass if indeed the
strong force of the enemy posted at the upper ford had not cut off all
communication between the two districts from bruce's station little or
no assistance could be hoped the entire strength of its garrison as
roland well knew having long since departed to share in the struggle on
the north side of kentucky assistance could be looked for only from his
late companions the emigrants from whom he had parted in an evil hour
but how were they to be made acquainted with his situation

the discussion of these questions almost distracted the young man help
could only come from themselves would it not be possible to cut their
way through the besiegers he proposed a thousand wild schemes of escape
now he would mount his trusty steed and dashing among the enemy receive
their fire distract their attention and perhaps draw them in pursuit
while nathan and the others galloped off with the women in another
quarter and again he would plunge with them into the boiling torrent
below trusting to the strength of the horses to carry them through in
safety

to these and other frantic proposals uttered in the intervals of combat
which was still maintained with occasional demonstrations on the part of
the enemy of advancing to a third assault nathan replied only by
representing the certain death they would bring upon all especially the
poor helpless women whose condition with the reflection that he had
brought them into it seemed ever to dwell upon his mind producing
feelings of remorseful excitement not inferior even to the compunctions
which he expressed at every shot discharged by him at the foe indeed his
conscience seemed sorely distressed and perplexed now he upbraided
himself with being the murderer of the two poor women and now of his
shawnee fellow-creatures now he wrung the soldier by the hand begging
him to bear witness that he was shedding blood not out of malice or
wantonness or even self-defence but purely to save the innocent scalps
of poor women whose blood would be otherwise on his head and now
beseeching the young man with equal fervour to let the world know of his
doings that the blame might fall not upon the faith of which he was an
unworthy professor but upon him the evil-doer and backslider but with
all his remorse and contrition he manifested no inclination to give over
the work of fighting but on the contrary fired away with extreme
good-will at every evil shawnee creature that showed himself encouraging
roland to do the same and exhibiting throughout the whole contest the
most exemplary courage and good conduct

but courage and good conduct although so unexpectedly manifested in the
time of need by all his companions roland felt could only serve to defer
for a few hours the fate of his party the night wore away fast the
assailants grew bolder and from the louder yells and more frequent shots
coming from them it seemed as if their numbers instead of diminishing
under his own fire were gradually increasing by the dropping in of their
scouts from the forest at the same time he became sensible that his
stores of ammunition were fast decreasing

friend said nathan wringing the soldier's hand for the twentieth
time when made acquainted with the deficiency it is written that thee
women shall be murdered before thee eyes nevertheless i will do my best
to save them friend i must leave thee thee shall have assistance can
thee hold out the hovel till morning but it is foolish to ask thee thee
must hold it out and with none save the coloured person and the man
dodge to help thee for i say to thee it has come to this at last as i
thought it would i must break through the lines of thee injun foes and
find thee assistance

it is impossible said roland in despair you will only provoke your
destruction

it may be friend as thee says responded nathan nevertheless
friend for thee women's sake i will adventure it for it is i
miserable sinner that i am that have brought them to this pass and that
must bring them out of it again if man can do it

at a moment of less grief and desperation roland would have better
appreciated the magnitude of the service which nathan thus offered to
attempt and even hesitated to permit what must have manifestly seemed
the throwing away of a human life but the emergency was too great to
allow the operation of any but selfish feelings the existence of his
companions the life of his edith depended upon procuring relief and
this could be obtained in no other way if the undertaking was dangerous
in the extreme he saw it with the eyes of a soldier as well as a lover
it was a feat he would himself have dared without hesitation could it
have promised in his hands any relief to his followers

go then and god be with you he muttered eagerly you have our lives
in your hand but it will be long long before you can reach the band on
foot yet do not weary or pause by the way i have but little wealth but
with what i have i will reward you

friend said nathan proudly what i do i do for no lucre of reward
but for pity of thee poor women for truly i have seen the murdering and
scalping of poor women before and the seeing of the same has left blood
upon my head which is a mournful thing to think of

well be not offended do what you can our lives may rest on a single
minute

i will do what i can friend replied nathan and if i can but pass
safely through thee foes there is scarce a horse in thee company were
it even thee war-horse that shall run to thee friends more fleetly but
friend do thee hold out the house use thee powder charily keep up the
spirits of thee two men and be of good heart theeself fighting
valiantly and slaying according to thee conscience and then friend if
it be heaven's will i will return to thee and help thee out of thee
troubles

with these words nathan turned from the soldier setting out upon his
dangerous duty with a courage and self-devotion of which roland did not
yet know all the merit he threw himself upon the earth and muttering to
little peter now peter as thee ever served thee master well and
truly serve him well and truly now began to glide away amongst the
ruins making his way from log to log and bush to bush close behind the
animal who seemed to determine the period and direction of every
movement his course was down the river the opposite of that by which
the party had reached the ruin in which quarter the woods were highest
and promised the most accessible as well as the best shelter though
that could be reached only in the event of his successfully avoiding the
different barbarians hidden among the bushes on its border he soon
vanished with his dog from the eyes of the soldier who now in
pursuance of instructions previously given him by nathan caused his two
followers to let fly a volley among the trees which had the expected
effect of drawing another in return from the foes accompanied by their
loudest whoops of menace and defiance in this manner nathan as he drew
nigh the wood was enabled to form correct opinions as to the different
positions of the besiegers and to select that point in the line which
seemed the weakest while the attention of the foe was in a measure drawn
off so as to give him the better opportunity of advancing on them
unobserved with this object in view a second and third volley were
fired by the little garrison after which they ceased making such feints
of hostility and left him as he had directed to his fate

it was then that with a beating heart roland awaited the event and as
he began to figure to his imagination the perils which nathan must
necessarily encounter in the undertaking he listened for the shout of
triumph that he feared would each moment proclaim the capture or death
of his messenger but he listened in vain at least in vain for such
sounds as his skill might interpret into evidences of nathan's fate he
heard nothing but the occasional crack of a rifle aimed at the ruin
with the yell of the savage that fired it the rush of the breeze the
rumbling of the thunder and the deep-toned echoes from the river below
there was nothing whatever occurred at least for a quarter of an hour
by which he might judge what was the issue of the enterprise and he was
beginning to indulge the hope that nathan had passed safely through the
besiegers when a sudden yell of a peculiarly wild and thrilling
character was uttered in the wood in the quarter in which nathan had
fled and this exciting as it seemed to do a prodigious sensation
among his foes filled him with anxiety and dread to his ears the shout
expressed fury and exultation such as might well be felt at the sudden
discovery and capture of the luckless messenger and his fear that such
had been the end of nathan's undertaking was greatly increased by what
followed the shots and whoops suddenly ceased and for ten minutes or
more all was silent save the roar of the river and the whispering of
the fitful breeze they have taken him alive poor wretch muttered the
soldier and now they are forcing from him a confession of our
weakness

it seemed as if there might be some foundation for the suspicion for
presently a great shout burst from the enemy and the next moment a rush
was made against the ruin as if by the whole force of the enemy fire
shouted roland to his companions if we must die let it be like men
and no sooner did he behold the dark figures of the assailants leaping
among the ruins than he discharged his rifle and a pair of pistols which
he had reserved in his own hands the other pair having been divided
between dodge and the negro who used them with equal resolution and
with an effect that roland had not anticipated the assailants
apparently daunted by the weight of the volley seven pieces having been
discharged in rapid succession instantly beat a retreat resuming their
former positions from these however they now maintained an almost
incessant fire and by and by several of them stealing cautiously up
effected a lodgment in a distant part of the ruins whence without
betraying any especial desire to come to closer quarters they began to
carry on the war in a manner that greatly increased roland's alarm their
bullets flying about and into the hovel so thickly that he became afraid
lest some of them should reach its hapless inhabitants he was already
debating within himself the propriety of transferring edith and her
companion from this ruinous and now dangerous abode to the ravine where
they might be sheltered from all danger at least for a time when a bolt
of lightning as he at first thought it shot from the nearest group of
foes flashed over his head and striking what remained of the roof
stood trembling in it an arrow of blazing fire the appearance of this
missile followed as it immediately was by several others discharged
from the same tow confirmed the soldier's resolution to remove the
females while it greatly increased his anxiety for although there was
little fear that the flames could be communicated from the arrows to the
roof so deeply saturated by the late rains yet each while burning
served like a flambeau to illuminate the ruins below and must be
expected before long to reveal the helplessness of the party and to
light the besiegers to their prey

with such fears on his mind he hesitated no longer to remove his cousin
and her companion to the ravine which was effected with but little risk
or difficulty the ravine heading as was mentioned before under the
floor of the hovel itself and its borders being so strewn with broken
timbers and planks as to screen the party from observation he concealed
them both among the rocks and brambles with which the hollow abounded
listened a moment to the rush of the flood as it swept the precipitous
bank and the roar with which it seemed struggling among rocky
obstructions above and smiling with the grim thought that when
resistance was no longer availing there was yet a refuge for his
kinswoman within the dark bosom of those troubled waters to which he
felt with the stern resolution of a roman father rather than of a
christian lover that he could when nothing else remained consign her
with his own hands he returned to the ruins to keep up the appearance
of still defending it and to preserve the entrance of the ravine




chapter xvi


the flaming arrows were still shot in vain at the water-soaked roof and
the combustibles with which they were armed burning out very rapidly
produced hut little of that effect in illuminating the ruins which roland
had apprehended and for which they had been perhaps in part designed
and in consequence the savages soon ceased to shoot them a more useful
ally to the besiegers was promised in the moon which was now rising over
the woods and occasionally revealing her wan and wasted crescent through
gaps in the clouds waning in her last quarter and struggling amid banks
of vapour she yet retained sufficient magnitude and lustre when risen
a few more degrees to dispel the almost sepulchral darkness that had
hitherto invested the ruins and thus proved a more effectual protection
to the travellers than their own courage of this roland was well aware
and he watched the increasing light with sullen and gloomy forebodings
though still exhorting his two supporters to hope and courage and
setting them a constant example of vigilance and resolution but neither
hope nor courage neither vigilance nor resolution availed to deprive
the foe of the advantage he had gained in effecting a lodgment among the
ruins where four or five different warriors still maintained a hot fire
upon the hovel doing of course little harm as it was entirely
deserted but threatening mischief enough when it should fall into their
hands a catastrophe that was deferred only in consequence of the
extreme cautiousness with which they now conducted hostilities the
travellers making only a show of defending it though sensible that it
almost entirely commanded the ravine

it was now more than an hour and a half since nathan had departed
and roland was beginning himself to feel the hope he encouraged in
the others that the man of peace had actually succeeded in effecting
his escape and that the wild whoop which he at first esteemed the
evidence of his capture or death and the assault that followed it
had been caused by some circumstance having no relation to nathan
whatever perhaps by the arrival of a reinforcement whose coming had
infused new spirit into the breasts of the so long baffled assailants
if he have escaped he muttered he must already be near the
camp a strong man and fleet runner might reach it in an hour in
another hour nay perhaps in half an hour for there are good horses
and bold hearts in the band i shall hear the rattle of their hoofs in
the wood and the yells of these cursed bandits scattered like dust
under their footsteps if i can but hold the ravine for an hour thank
heaven the moon is a second time lost in clouds the thunder is again
rolling through the sky a tempest now were better than gales of
araby a thunder-gust were our salvation

the wishes of the soldier seemed about to be fulfilled the clouds
which for half an hour had been breaking up again gathered producing
thicker darkness than before and heavy peals of thunder heralded by
pale sheets of lightning that threw a ghastly but insufficient light over
objects were again heard rattling at a distance over the woods the fire
of the savages began to slacken and by and by entirely ceased they
waited perhaps for the moment when the increasing glare of the lightning
should enable them better to distinguish between the broken timbers the
objects of so many wasted volleys and the crouching bodies of the
defenders

the soldier took advantage of this moment of tranquillity to descend to
the river to quench his thirst and to bear back some of the liquid
element to his fainting followers while engaged in this duty he cast his
eyes upon the scene surveying with sullen interest the flood that cut
off his escape from the fatal hovel the mouth of the ravine was wide and
scattered over with rocks and bushes that even projected for some little
space into the water the latter vibrating up and down in a manner that
proved the strength and irregularity of the current the river was here
bounded by frowning cliffs from which a furlong or two above had
fallen huge blocks of stone that greatly contracted its narrow channel
and among these the swollen waters surged and foamed with the greatest
violence producing that hollow roar which was so much in keeping with
the solitude of the ruin and so proper an accompaniment to the growling
thunder and the wild yells of the warriors below these massive
obstructions and opposite the mouth of the ravine the channel had
expanded into a pool in which the waters might have regained their
tranquillity and rolled along in peace but for the presence of an
island which growing up in the centre of the expanse consolidated by
the roots of a thousand willows and other trees that delight in such
humid soils and in times of flood covered by a raft of drift timber
entangled among its trees presented a barrier on either side of which
the current swept with speed and fury though as it seemed entirely
unopposed by rocks in such a current as roland thought there was
nothing unusually formidable a daring swimmer might easily make his way
to the island opposite where if difficulties were presented by the
second channel he might as easily find shelter from enemies firing on
him from the banks he gazed again on the island which viewed in the
gloom revealed to his eyes only a mass of shadowy boughs resting in
peace and security his heart beat high with hope and he was beginning
to debate the chances of success in an attempt to swim his party across
the channel on the horses when a flash of lightning brighter than
usual disclosed the fancied island a cluster of shaking tree-tops whose
trunks as well as the soil that supported them were buried fathoms deep
in the flood at the same moment he heard coming on a gust that repelled
and deadened for a time the louder tumult from the rocks above other
roaring sounds indicating the existence of other rocky obstructions at
the foot of the island among which as he could now see the same flash
having shown him the strength of the current in the centre of the
channel the swimmer must be dashed who failed to find footing on the
island

we are imprisoned indeed he muttered bitterly heaven itself has
deserted us

as he uttered these repining words stooping to dip the canteen with
which he was provided in the water a little canoe darting forward with
a velocity that seemed produced by the combined strength of the current
and the rower shot suddenly among the rocks and bushes at the entrance
of the ravine wedging itself fast among them and a human figure leaped
from it to the shore the soldier started back aghast as if from a
dweller of another world but recovering his courage in an instant and
not doubting that he beheld in the unexpected visitor a shawnee and foe
who had thus found means of assailing his party on the rear he rushed
upon the stranger with drawn sword for he had laid his rifle aside and
taking him at a disadvantage while stooping to drag the boat further
ashore he smote him such a blow over the head as brought him instantly
to the ground a dead man to all appearance since while his body fell
upon the earth his head or at least a goodly portion of it sliced
away by the blow went skimming into the water

die dog said roland as he struck the blow and not content
with that he clapped his foot on the victim's breast to give him the
coup-de-grace when wonder of wonders the supposed shawnee and dead
man opened his lips and cried aloud in good choice salt-river
english tarnal death to you white man what are you after

it was the voice the never-to-be-forgotten voice of the captain of
horse-thieves and as roland's sword dropped from his hand in the
surprise up rose roaring ralph himself his eyes rolling as roland saw
by a second flash of lightning with thrice their usual obliquity his
left hand scratching among the locks of hair exposed by the blow of the
sabre which had carried off a huge slice of his hat without doing other
mischief while his right brandished a rifle which he handled as if
about to repay the favour with interest but the same flash that revealed
his visage to the astonished soldier disclosed also roland's features to
him and he fairly yelled with joy at the sight tarnal death to me
he roared first leaping into the air and cracking his heels together
then snatching at roland's hand which he clutched and twisted with the
gripe of a bear and then cracking his heels together again tarnal
death to me sodger but i know'd it war you war in a squabblification
i heard the cracking and the squeaking tarnal death to me says i
thar's injuns and then i thought and says i tarnal death to me
who are they after and then tarnal death to me it came over me like
a strick of lightning and says i tarnal death to me but its
anngelliferous madam that helped me out of the halter strannger he
roared executing another demivolte h'yar am i come to do
anngelliferous madam's fighting ag'in all critturs human and inhuman
christian and injun white red black and party-coloured show me
anngelliferous madam and then show me the abbregynes and if you ever
seed fighting tarnal death to me but you'll say it war only the
squabbling of seed-ticks and blue-bottle flies i say sodger show me
anngelliferous madam you cut the halter and you cut the tug but it war
madam the anngel that set you on wharfo i'm her dog and her niggur
from now to etarnity and i'm come to fight for her and lick her enemies
till you shall see nothing left of em but ha'rs and nails

of these expressions uttered with extreme volubility and the most
extravagant gestures roland took no notice his astonishment at the
horse-thief's appearance was giving way to new thoughts and hopes and he
eagerly demanded of ralph how he had got there

in the dug-out said ralph found her floating among the bushes
ax'd me out a flopper with my tom-axe in no time jumped in
thought of anngelliferous madam and came down the falls like a cob in a
corn-van ar'n't i the leaping trout of the waters strannger i don't
want to sw'ar but i reckon if there ar'n't hell up thar among the big
stones thar's hell no other whar all about salt river but i say
sodger i came here not to talk nor cavort but to show that i'm the
man ralph stackpole to die dog for them that pats me so whar's
anngelliferous madam let me see her sodger that i may feel wolfish
when i jumps among the redskins for i'm all for a fight and thar ar'n't
no run in me

footnote dug-out a canoe because dug out or hollowed with the
axe

footnote flopper a flapper a paddle

footnote cavort to play pranks to gasconade

it is well indeed if it shall prove so said roland not without
bitterness for it is to you alone we owe all our misfortunes

with these words he led the way to the place where among the horses
concealed among brambles and stones lay the unfortunate females
cowering on the bare earth the pale sheets of lightning flashing now
with greater frequency revealed them to ralph's eyes a ghastly and
melancholy pair whose situation and appearance were well fitted to move
the feelings of a manly bosom edith lying almost insensible across
telie's knees while the latter weeping bitterly yet seemed striving to
forget her own distresses while ministering to those of her companion

tarnal death to me cried stackpole looking upon edith's pallid
visage and rayless eyes with more emotion than would have been expected
from his rude character or than was expressed in his uncouth phrases
if that don't make me eat a niggur may i be tetotaciously chawed up
myself oh you anngelliferous madam jist look up and say the word for
i'm now ready to mount a wild-cat jist look up and don't make a die of
it for thar's no occasion for ar'n't i your niggur-slave ralph
stackpole and ar'n't i come to lick all that's agin you mingo shawnee
delaware and all oh you anngelliferous crittur don't swound away but
look up and see how i'll wallop em

and here the worthy horse-thief seeing that his exhortations produced no
effect upon the apparently dying edith dropped upon his knees and began
to blubber and lament over her as if overcome by his feelings promising
her a world of indian scalps and a whole salt river full of shawnee
blood if she would only look up and see how he went about it

show your gratitude by actions not by words said roland who
whatever his cause for disliking the zealous ralph was not unrejoiced at
his presence as that of a valuable auxiliary rise up and tell me in
the name of heaven how you succeeded in reaching this place and what
hope there is of leaving it

but ralph was too much afflicted by the wretched condition of edith whom
his gratitude for the life she had bestowed had made the mistress
paramount of his soul to give much heed to any one but herself and it
was only by dint of hard questioning that roland drew from him little by
little an account of the causes which had kept him in the vicinity of
the travellers and finally brought him to the scene of combat

it had been it appeared an eventful and unlucky day with the
horse-thief as well as the soldier aside from his adventure on the
beech-tree enough in all truth to mark the day for him with a black
stone he had been peculiarly unfortunate with the horses to which he had
so unceremoniously helped himself the gallant briareus after sundry
trials of strength with his new master had at last succeeded in throwing
him from his back and the two-year-old pony after obeying him the whole
day with the docility of a dog even when the halter was round his neck
and carrying him in safety until within a few miles of jackson's station
had attempted the same exploit and succeeded galloping off on the back
track towards his home this second loss was the more intolerable since
stackpole having endured the penalty for stealing him considered
himself as having a legal lynch-like right to the animal which no one
could now dispute he therefore returned in pursuit of the pony until
night arrested his footsteps on the banks of the river which the waters
still rising he did not care to cross in the dark he had therefore
built a fire by the road-side intending to camp-out till morning

and it was your fire then that checked us cried roland at this part
of the story it was your light we took for the watch-fire of
indians

injuns you may say quoth stackpole innocently for thar war a knot
of em i seed sneaking over the ford and jist as i was squinting a long
aim at em hoping i might smash two of em at alick slam-bang goes a
feller that had got behind me tarnal death to him and roused me out of
my snuggery well sodger then i jumps into the cane and next into the
timber for i reckoned all injun creation war atter me and so i sticks
fast in a lick and then to sumtotalise i wallops down a rock eend
foremost like a bull-toad and tarnal death to me while i war
scratching my head and wondering whar i came from i heerd the crack of
the guns across the river and thought of anngelliferous madam tarnal
death to me sodger it turned me wrong side out and while i war axing
all natur how i war to get over what should i do but see the old
sugar-trough floating in the bushes i seed her in a strick of
lightning so pops i in and paddles i down till i comes to the
rocks and ar'n't they beauties h'yar goes for grim death and
massacreation says i and tuck the shoot and if i didn't fetch old
dug-out through slicker than snakes and faster than a well-greased
thunderbolt niggurs ar'n't niggurs nor injuns injuns and strannger
if you axes me why h'yar's the wharfo twar because i thought of
anngelliferous madam strannger i am the gentleman to see her out of a
fight and so jist tell her thar's no occasion for being uneasy for
tarnal death to me i'll mount shawnees and die for her jist like
nothing

wretch that you are cried roland whose detestation of the unlucky
cause of his troubles revived by the discovery that it was to his
presence at the ford they owed their last and most fatal disappointment
rendered him somewhat insensible to the good feelings and courage which
had brought the grateful fellow to his assistance you were born for
our destruction every way you have proved our ruin but for you my poor
kinswoman would have been now in safety among her friends had she left
you hanging on the beech you would not have been on the river to cut
off her only escape when pursued close at hand by murderous savages

the reproach now for the first time acquainting stackpole with the
injury he had though so unintentionally and innocently inflicted upon
his benefactress and the sight of her lying apparently half-dead at his
feet wrought up the feelings of the worthy horse-thief to a pitch of
desperate compunction mingled with fury

if i'm the crittur that holped her into the fix i'm the crittur to holp
her out of it tarnal death to me whar's the injuns h'yar goes to eat
em

with that he uttered a yell the first human cry that had been uttered
for some time for the assailants were still resting on their arms and
rushing up the ravine as if well acquainted with the localities of the
station he ran to the ruin repeating his cries at every step with a
loudness and vigour of tone that soon drew a response from the lurking
enemy

h'yar you tarnal-temporal long-legged tater-headed paint-faces
he roared leaping from the passage floor to the pile of ruins before
the door of the hovel where emperor yet lay ensconced and whither
roland followed him as if in utter defiance of the foemen whom he
hailed with such opprobrious epithets h'yar you bald head
smoke-dried punkin-eating red-skins you half-niggurs you coon-whelps
you snakes you varmints you raggamuffins what goes about licking
women and children and scar'ring-anngelliferous madam git up and
show your scalp-locks for tarnal death to me i'm the man to take
em cock-a-doodle-doo

and the valiant horse-thief concluded his warlike defiance with such a
crow as might have struck consternation to the heart not merely of the
best game-cock in kentucky but of the bird of jove itself great was the
excitement it produced among the warriors a furious hubbub was heard
to arise among them followed by many wrathful voices exclaiming in
broken english with eager haste know him dah cuss rascal cappin
stackpole steal injun hoss and the steal injun hoss iterated and
reiterated by a dozen voices and always with the most iracund emphasis
enabled roland to form a proper conception of the sense in which his
enemies held that offence as well as of the great merits and wide-spread
fame of his new ally whose mere voice had thrown the red-men into such a
ferment

but it was not with words alone they vented their displeasure
rifle-shots and execrations were discharged together against the
notorious enemy of their pinfolds who nothing daunted and nothing
loath let fly his own speechifier as he denominated his rifle in
return accompanying the salute with divers yells and maledictions in
which latter he showed himself to say the truth infinitely superior
to his antagonists he would even so great and fervent was his desire to
fight the battles of his benefactress to advantage have retained his
exposed stand on the pile of ruins daring every bullet had not roland
dragged him down by main force and compelled him to seek a shelter like
the rest from which however he carried on the war loading and firing
his piece with wonderful rapidity and yelling and roaring all the time
with triumphant fury as if reckoning upon every shot to bring down an
enemy

it was not many minutes however before roland began to fear that
the fatality which had marked all his relations with the intrepid
horse-thief had not yet lost its influence and that stackpole's present
assistance was anything but advantageous to his cause it seemed indeed
as if the savages had been driven to increased rage by the discovery of
his presence and that the hope of capturing him the most daring and
inveterate of all the hungerers after indian horseflesh and requiting
his manifold transgressions on the spot had infused into them new spirit
and fiercer determination their fire became more vigorous their shouts
more wild and ferocious those who had effected a lodgment among the
ruins crept higher while others appeared dealing their shots from other
quarters close at hand and in fine the situation of his little party
became so precarious that roland apprehending every moment a general
assault and despairing of being again able to repel it drew them
secretly off from the ruin which he abandoned entirely and took refuge
among the rocks at the head of the ravine

it was then while unconscious of the sudden evacuation of the hovel
but not doubting they had driven the defenders into its interior tho
enemy poured in half a dozen or more volleys as preliminaries to the
assault which the soldier apprehended that he turned to the unlucky
ralph and arresting him as he was about to fire upon the foe from his
new cover demanded with much agitation if it were not possible to
transport the hapless females in the little canoe which his mind had
often reverted to as a probable means of escape to a place of safety

tarnal death to me said ralph thar's a boiling-pot above and a
boiling pot below but ar'n't i the crittur to shake old salt by the
fo-paw can take anngelliferous down ar a shoot that war ever seed

and why in heaven's name cried the virginian did you not say so
before and relieve her from this horrible situation

tarnal death to me ar'nt i to do her fighting first demanded the
honest ralph jist let's have another crack at the villians jist for
madam's satisfaction and then sodger if you're for taking the shoot
i'm jist the salmon to show you the way but i say sodger i won't lie
he continued finding roland was bent upon instant escape while the
savages were yet unaware of their flight from the hovel i wont lie
sodger thar's rather a small trough to hold madam and the gal and me
and you and the nigger and the white man for stackpole was already
acquainted with the number of the party and as for the hosses twill
be all crucifixion to get em through old salt's fingers

think not of horses nor of us said roland save but the women and
it will be enough for the rest of us we will do our best we can keep
the hollow till we are relieved for if nathan be alive relief must be
now on the way and in a few hurried words he acquainted stackpole with
his having despatched the man of peace to seek assistance

thar's no trusting the crittur tiger nathan said ralph though at a
close hug a squeeze on the small ribs or a kick up of heels he's all
splendiferous afore you see his ugly pictur ag'in tarnal death to me
strannger you'll be devoured the red niggurs thar won't make two bites
at you no sodger if we run we run thar's the principle we takes
the water the whole herd together niggurs hosses and all
particularly the hosses for tarnal death to me it's ag'in my
conscience to leave so much as a hoof and so sodger if you
conscientiously thinks thar has been walloping enough done on both sides
i'm jist the man to help you all out of the bobbery though cuss me
you might as well have cut me out of the beech without so much hard
axing

these words of the worthy horse-thief uttered as hurriedly as his own
but far more coolly animated the spirits of the young soldier with
double hope and taking advantage of the busy intentness with which the
enemy still poured their fire into the ruin he despatched ralph down the
ravine to prepare the canoe for the women while he himself summoned
dodge and emperor to make an effort for their own deliverance




chapter xvii


the roar of the river alternating with peals of thunder which were now
loud and frequent awake many an anxious pang in roland's bosom as he
lifted his half-unconscious kinswoman from the earth and bore her to the
canoe but his anxiety was much more increased when he came to survey
the little vessel itself which was scarce twelve feet in length and
seemed ill-fitted to sustain the weight of even half the party it was
besides of the clumsiest and worst possible figure a mere log in fact
roughly hollowed out without any attempt having been made to point its
extremities so that it looked less like a canoe than an ox-trough which
latter purpose it was perhaps designed chiefly to serve and intended to
be used for the former only when an occasional rise of the waters might
make a canoe necessary to the convenience of the maker such a vessel
managed by a skilful hand might indeed bear the two females with honest
ralph through the foaming rapids below but roland felt that to burden
it with others would be to insure the destruction of all he resolved
therefore that no other should enter it and having deposited telie doe
in it by the side of edith he directed dodge and emperor to mount their
horses and trust to their strength and courage for a safe escape to
emperor whatever distaste he might have for the adventure this was an
order like all others to be obeyed without murmuring and fortunately
pardon dodge's humanity or his discretion was so strongly fortified by
his confidence in the swimming virtues of his steed that he very readily
agreed to try his fortune on horseback

anything to git round them everlasting varmint though it a'n't no sich
great circumstance to fight em neither where one's a kinder got one's
hand in he cried with quite a joyous voice and added as if to
encourage the others it's my idea that if such an old crazy boat can
swim the river a hoss can do it a mortal heap better

tarnal death to me said ralph stackpole them's got the grit that'll
go down old salt on horseback but it's all for the good of
anngelliferous madam and so if thar's any hard rubbing or drowning or
anything-of that synommous natur to happen it ar'n't a thing to be
holped no how but hand in the guns and speechifiers and make ready for
a go for tarnal death to me the abbrygynes ar making a rush for
the cabin

there was indeed little time left for deliberation while ralph was yet
speaking a dozen or more flaming brands were suddenly seen flung into
the air as if against the broken roof of the cabin through which they
fell into the interior and with a tremendous whoop the savages thus
lighting the way to the assault rushed against their fancied prey the
next moment there was heard a yell of disappointed rage and wonder
followed by a rush of men into the ravine

now sodger cried ralph stick close to the trough and if you ever
seed etarnity at midnight you'll see a small sample now

with that he pushed the canoe into the stream and roland urging his
terrified steed with voice and spur and leading his cousin's equally
alarmed palfrey leaped in after him calling to dodge and emperor to
follow but how they followed or whether they followed at all it was
not easy at that moment to determine for a bright flash of lightning
glaring over the river vanished suddenly leaving all in double
darkness and the impetuous rush of the current whirled him he knew not
whither while the crash of the thunder that followed prevented his
hearing any other noise save the increasing and never absent roar of the
waters another flash illuminated the scene and during its short-lived
radiance he perceived himself flying as it almost seemed through the
water borne along by a furious current betwixt what appeared to him two
lofty walls of crag and forest towards those obstructions in the
channel which in times of flood converted the whole river into a
boiling caldron they were masses of rock among which had lodged rafts
of drift timber forming a dam or barrier on either side of the river
from which the descending floods were whirled into a central channel
ample enough in the dry season to discharge the waters in quiet but
through which they were now driven with all the hurry and rage of a
torrent the scene viewed in the momentary glare of the lightning was
indeed terrific the dark and rugged walls on either side the ramparts
of timber of every shape and size from the little willow sapling to the
full-grown sycamore piled high above the rocks and the rushing gulf
betwixt them made up a spectacle sufficient to appal the stoutest heart
and roland gasped for breath as he beheld the little canoe whirl into
the narrow chasm and then vanish even before the light was over as if
swallowed up in its boiling vortex

but there was little time for fear or conjecture he cast the rein of the
palfrey from his hand directed briareus's head towards the abyss and
the next moment sweeping in darkness and with the speed of an arrow
betwixt the barriers he felt his charger swimming beneath him in
comparatively tranquil waters another flash illumined hill and river
and he beheld the little canoe dancing along in safety scarce fifty
yards in advance with stackpole waving the tattered fragments of his hat
aloft and yelling out a note of triumph but the lusty hurrah was
unheard by the soldier a more dreadful sound came to his ears from
behind in a shriek that seemed uttered by the combined voices of men and
horses and was heard even above the din of the torrent but it was as
momentary as dreadful and if a cry of agony it was of agony that was
soon over its fatal cause was soon exhibited when roland awakened by
the sound from the trance which during the brief moment of his passage
through the abyss had chained his faculties turned by a violent jerk
the head of his charger up the stream in the instinctive effort to
render assistance to his less fortunate followers a fainter flash than
before played upon the waters and he beheld two or three dark masses
like the bodies of horses hurried by among the waves whilst another of
lesser bulk and human form suddenly rose from the depth of the stream at
his side this he instantly grasped in his hand and dragged half across
his saddle-bow when a broken strangling exclamation lorra-g-g-gor
made him aware that he had saved the life of the faithful emperor
clutch fast to the saddle he cried and the negro obeying with another
ejaculation the soldier turned briareus again down the stream to look
for the canoe but almost immediately his charger struck the ground and
roland to his inexpressible joy found himself landed upon a projecting
bank on which the current had already swept the canoe with its precious
freight unharmed

if that ar'n't equal to coming down a strick of lightning cried
roaring ralph as he helped the soldier from the water thar's no legs
to a jumping bull-frog smash away old bait he continued
apostrophising with great exultation and self-admiration the river whose
terrors he had thus so successfully defied ar'n't i the gentleman for
you roar as much as you please when it comes to fighting for
anngelliferous madam i can lick you old salt tarnal death to me and
so anngelliferous madam don't you car a copper for the old crittur
for thar's more in his bark than his bite and as for the abbregynes if
i've fout em enough for your satisfaction we'll just say good-bye to
em and leave em to take the scalp off old salt

the consolation thus offered by the worthy captain of horse-thieves was
lost upon edith who locked in the arms of her kinsman and sensible of
her escape from the horrid danger that had so long surrounded her
sensible also of the peril from which he had just been released wept her
terrors away upon his breast and for a moment almost forgot that her
sufferings were not yet over

it was only for an instant that the young soldier indulged his joy he
breathed a few words of comfort and encouragement and then turned to
inquire after dodge whose gallant hearing in the hour of danger had
conquered the disgust he at first felt at his cowardice and won upon his
gratitude and respect but the yankee appeared not and the loud calls
roland made for him were echoed only by the hoarse roar from the
barriers now left far behind and the thunder that yet pealed through
the sky nor could emperor when restored a little to his wits which had
been greatly disturbed by his own perils in the river give any
satisfactory account of his fate he could only remember that the current
had borne himself against the logs under which he had been swept and
whirled he knew not whither until he found himself in the arms of his
master and dodge who had rushed before him into the flood he supposed
had met a similar fate but without the happy termination that marked his
own

that the yankee had indeed found his death among the roaring waters
roland could well believe the wonder only being how the rest had escaped
in safety of the five horses three only had reached the bank briareus
and the palfrey which had fortunately followed roland down the middle of
the chasm and the horse of the unlucky pardon the others had been
either drowned among the logs or swept down the stream

a few moments sufficed to acquaint roland with several losses but he
took little time to lament them the deliverance of his party was not yet
wholly effected and every moment was to be improved to put it before
daylight beyond the reach of pursuit the captain of horse-thieves
avouched himself able to lead the way from the wilderness to conduct the
travellers to a safe ford below and thence through the woods to the
rendezvous of the emigrants

let it be anywhere said roland where there is safety and let us not
delay a moment longer our remaining here can avail nothing to poor
dodge

with these words he assisted his kinswoman upon her palfrey placed
telie doe upon the horse of the unfortunate yankee and giving up his own
briareus to the exhausted negro prepared to resume his ill-starred
journey on foot then taking post on the rear he gave the signal to his
new guide and once more the travellers were buried in the intricacies of
the forest




chapter xviii


it was at a critical period when the travellers effected their escape
from the scene of their late sufferings the morning was already drawing
nigh and might but for the heavy clouds that prolonged the night of
terror have been seen shooting its first streaks through the eastern
skies another half hour if for that half hour they could have
maintained their position in the ravine would have seen them exposed in
all their helplessness to the gaze and to the fire of the determined
foe it became them to improve the few remaining moments of darkness and
to make such exertions as might get them before dawn beyond the reach
of discovery or pursuit

exertions were accordingly made and although man and horse were alike
exhausted and the thick brakes and oozy swamps through which roaring
ralph led the way opposed a thousand obstructions to rapid motion they
had left the fatal ruin at least two miles behind them or so honest
stackpole averred when the day at last broke over the forest to add to
the satisfaction of the fugitives it broke in unexpected splendour the
clouds parted and as the floating masses rolled lazily away before a
pleasant morning breeze they were seen lighted up and tinted with a
thousand glorious dyes of sunshine

the appearance of the great luminary was hailed with joy as the omen of
a happier fate than had been heralded by the clouds and storms of
evening smiles began to beam from the haggard and care-worn visages of
the travellers the very horses seemed to feel the inspiring influence of
the change and as for roaring ralph the sight of his beautiful
benefactress recovering her good looks and the exulting consciousness
that it was his hand which had snatched her from misery and death
produced such a fever of delight in his brain as was only to be allayed
by the most extravagant expressions and actions he assured her a dozen
times over he was her dog and her slave and vowed he would hunt her
so many injun scalps and steal her such a tarnal chance of shawnee
hosses thar shorld'nt be a gal in all kentucky should come up to her for
stock and glory and finally not content with making a thousand other
promises of an equally extravagant character and swearing that if she
axed it he would go down on his knees and say his prayers to her he
offered as soon as he had carried her safely across the river to take
the backtrack and lick single-handed all the injun abbregynes that
might be following indeed to such a pitch did his enthusiasm run
that not knowing how otherwise to give vent to his over-charged
feelings he suddenly turned upon his heel and shaking his fist in the
direction whence he had come as if against the enemy who had caused his
benefactress so much distress he pronounced a formal and emphatic curse
upon their whole race from the head-chief to the commoner from the
whisky-soaking warrior down to the pan-licking squall-a-baby all of
whom he anathematised with as much originality as fervour of expression
after which he proceeded with more sedateness to resume his post at
the head of the travellers and conduct them onwards on their way

another hour was now consumed in diving amid cane-brakes and swamps to
which roaring ralph evinced a decidedly greater partiality than to the
open forest in which the travellers had found themselves at the dawn
and in this he seemed to show somewhat more of judgment and discretion
than would have been argued from his hair-brained conversation for the
danger of stumbling upon scouting indians of which the country now
seemed so full was manifestly greater in the open woods than in the dark
and almost unfrequented cane-brakes and the worthy horse-thief with all
his apparent love of fight was not at all anxious that the angel of his
worship should be alarmed or endangered while entrusted to his zealous
safe-keeping

but it happened in this case as it has happened with better and wiser
men that stackpole's cunning over-reached itself as was fully shown in
the event and it would have been happier for himself and all if his
discretion instead of plunging him among difficult and almost impassable
bogs where a precious hour was wasted in effecting a mere temporary
security and concealment from observation had taught him the necessity
of pushing onwards with all possible speed so as to leave pursuers if
pursuit should be attempted far behind at the expiration of that hour
so injudiciously wasted the fugitives issued from the brake and
stepping into a narrow path worn by the feet of bisons among stunted
shrubs and parched grasses along the face of a lime-stone bed sparingly
scattered over with a similar barren growth began to wind their way
downward into a hollow vale in which they could hear the murmurs and
perceive the glimmering waters of the river over which they seemed never
destined to pass

thar tarnal death to me roared ralph pointing downwards with
triumph arn't that old salt now looking as sweet and liquorish as a
whole trough-full of sugar-tree we'll just take a dip at him
anngelliferous madam jist to wash the mud off our shoes and then
tarnal death to me farewell to old salt and the abbregynes
together cock-a-doodle-doo

with this comfortable assurance and such encouragement as he could
convey in the lustiest gallicantation ever fetched from lungs of man or
fowl the worthy stackpole who had slackened his steps but without
stopping while he spoke turned his face again to the descent when as
if that war-cry had conjured up enemies from the very air a rifle
bullet shot from a bush not six yards off suddenly whizzed through
his hair scattering a handful of it to the winds and while a dozen or
more were at the same instant poured upon other members of the
unfortunate party fourteen or fifteen savages rushed out from their
concealment among the grass and bushes three of whom seized upon the
rein of the unhappy edith while twice as many sprang upon captain
forrester and before he could raise an arm in defence bore him to the
earth a victim or a prisoner

so much the astounded horse-thief saw with his own eyes but before he
could make good any of the numberless promises he had volunteered during
the morning journey of killing and eating the whole family of north
american indians or exemplify the unutterable gratitude and devotion he
had as often professed to the fair virginian four brawny barbarians one
of them rising at his side and from the very bush whence the bullet had
been discharged at his head rushed against him flourishing their guns
and knives and yelling with transport got you now cappin stackpole
steal-hoss no go steal no hoss no more roast on great big fire

tarnal death to me roared stackpole forgetting everything else in
the instinct of self-preservation and firing his piece at the nearest
enemy he suddenly leaped from the path into the bushes on its lower
side where was a precipitous descent down which he went rolling and
crashing with a velocity almost equal to that of the bullets that were
sent after him three of the four assailants immediately darted after in
pursuit and their shouts growing fainter and fainter as they descended
were mingled with the loud yell of victory now uttered by a dozen savage
voices from the hill-side

it was a victory indeed in every sense complete almost bloodless as
it seemed to the assailants and effected at a moment when the hopes of
the travellers were at the highest and so sudden was the attack so
instantaneous the change from freedom to captivity so like the juggling
transition of a dream the whole catastrophe that forrester although
overthrown and bleeding from two several wounds received at the first
fire and wholly in the power of his enemies who flourished their knives
and axes in his face yelling with exultation could scarce appreciate
his situation or understand what dreadful misadventure had happened
until his eye wandering among the dusky arms that grappled him fell
first upon the body of the negro emperor hard by gored by numberless
wounds and trampled by the feet of his slayers and then upon the
apparition a thousand times more dismal to his eyes of his kinswoman
snatched from her horse and struggling in the arms of her savage captors
the frenzy with which he was seized at this lamentable sight endowed him
with a giant's strength but it was exerted in vain to free himself from
his enemies all of whom seemed to experience a barbarous delight at his
struggles some encouraging him with loud laughter and in broken
english to continue them while others taunted and scolded at him more
like shrewish squaws than valiant warriors assuring him that they were
great shawnee fighting-men and he a little long-knife dog entirely
beneath their notice which expressions though at variance with all his
preconceived notions of the stern gravity of the indian character and
rather indicative of a roughly jocose than a darkly ferocious spirit did
not prevent their taking the surest means to quiet his exertions and
secure their prize by tying his hands behind him with a thong of buffalo
hide drawn so tight as to inflict the most excruciating pain but pain
of body was then and for many moments after lost in agony of mind
which could he conceived only by him who like the young soldier has
been doomed once in his life to see a tender female the nearest and
dearest object of his affections in the hands of enemies the most
heartless merciless and brutal of all the races of men he saw her pale
visage convulsed with terror and despair he beheld her arms stretched
towards him as if beseeching the help he no longer had the power to
render and expected every instant the fall of the hatchet or the
flash of the knife that was to pour her blood upon the earth before him
he would have called upon the wretches around for pity but his tongue
clove to his mouth his brain spun round and such became the intensity
of his feelings that he was suddenly bereft of sense and fell like a
dead man to the earth where he lay for a time ignorant of all events
passing around ignorant also of the duration of his insensibility




chapter xix


when the soldier recovered his senses it was to wonder again at the
change that had come over the scene the loud yells the bitter taunts
the mocking laughs were heard no more and nothing broke the silence of
the wilderness save the stir of the leaf in the breeze and the ripple of
the river against its pebbly banks below he glanced a moment from the
bush in which he was lying in search of the barbarians who had lately
covered the slope of the hill but all had vanished captor and captive
had alike fled and the sparrow twittering among the stunted bushes and
the grasshopper singing in the grass were the only living objects to be
seen the thong was still upon his wrists and as he felt it rankling in
his flesh he almost believed that his savage captors with a refinement
in cruelty the more remarkable as it must have robbed them of the sight
of his dying agonies had left him thus bound and wounded to perish
miserably in the wilderness alone

this suspicion was however soon driven from his mind for making an
effort to rise to his feet he found himself suddenly withheld by a
powerful grasp while a guttural voice muttered in his ear from behind
with accents half angry half exultant long-knife no move see how
piankeshaw kill long-knife's brudders piankeshaw great fighting-man
he turned his face with difficulty and saw crouching among the leaves
behind him a grim old warrior plentifully bedaubed over head and breast
with the scarlet clay of his native wabash his dark shining eyes bent
now upon his rifle which he held extended over roland's body now turned
upon roland himself whom he seemed to watch over with a miser's or a
wild-cat's affection and now wandering away up the stony path along the
hill-side as if in expectation of the coming of an object dearer even
than rifle or captive to his imagination

in the confused and distracted state of his mind roland was as little
able to understand the expressions of the warrior as to account for the
disappearance of his murderous associates and he would have marvelled
for what purpose he was thus concealed among the bushes with his grim
companion had not his whole soul been too busily and painfully occupied
with the thoughts of his vanished edith he strove to ask the wild
barbarian of her fate but the latter motioned him fiercely to keep
silence and the motion and the savage look that accompanied it being
disregarded the indian drew a long knife from his belt and pressing the
point on roland's throat muttered too sternly and emphatically to be
misconceived long-knife speak long-knife die piankeshaw fight
long-knife's brudders piankeshaw great fighting-man from which all
that roland could understand was that there was mischief of some kind
still in the wind and that he was commanded to preserve silence on the
peril of his life what that mischief could be he was unable to divine
but he was not kept long in ignorance

as he lay upon the ground his cheek pillowed upon it stone which
accident or perhaps the humanity of the old warrior had placed under
his head he could distinguish a hollow pattering distant sound in
which at first mistaken for the murmuring of the river over some rocky
ledge and then for the clatter of wild beasts approaching over the rocky
hill his practised ear soon detected the trampling of a body of horse
evidently winding their way along the stony road which had conducted him
to captivity and from which he was but a few paces removed his heart
thrilled within him was it could it be a band of gallant kentuckians
in pursuit of the bold marauders whose presence in the neighbourhood
of the settlements had been already made known or could they be the
thrill of expectation grew to transport as he thought it his fellow
emigrants summoned by the faithful nathan to his assistance and now
straining every nerve to overtake the savages whom they had tracked from
the deserted ruin he could now account for the disappearance of his
captors and the deathlike silence that surrounded him too vigilant to
be taken at unawares and perhaps long since apprised of the coming of
the band the indians had resumed their hiding-places in the grass and
among the bushes preparing for the new-comers an ambuscade similar to
that they had so successfully practised against roland's unfortunate
party let them hide as they will detestable miscreants he uttered to
himself with feelings of vindictive triumph they will not this time
have frightened women and a handful of dispirited fugitives to deal
with

with these feelings burning in his bosom he made an effort to turn his
face towards the top of the hill that he might catch the first sight of
the friendly band and glut his eyes with the view of the anticipated
speedy discomfiture and destruction of his enemies in this effort he
received unexpected aid from the old warrior who perceiving his
intention pulled him round with his own hands telling him with the
grim complacency of one who desired a witness to his bravery now you
hold still you see you see piankeshaw old injun you see piankeshaw
kill man take scalp kill all long-knife debbil great fighting-man
old piankeshaw which self-admiring assurance repeated for the third
time the warrior pronounced with extreme earnestness and emphasis

it was now that roland could distinctly perceive the nature of the ground
on which his captors had formed their ambush the hill along whose side
the bison path went winding down to the river with an easy descent was
nearly bare of trees its barren soil affording nourishment only for a
coarse grass enamelled with asters and other brilliant flowers and for
a few stunted cedar-bushes scattered here and there while in many
places the naked rock broken into ledges and gullies the beds of
occasional brooks was seen gleaming gray and desolate in the sunshine
its surface being thus broken was unfit for the operations of cavalry
and the savages being posted as roland judged from the position of the
old piankeshaw midway along the descent where were but few trees of
sufficient magnitude to serve as a cover to assailants while they
themselves were concealed behind rocks and bushes there was little doubt
they could inflict loss upon an advancing body of footmen of equal
numbers and perhaps repel them altogether but roland now impressed
with the belief that the approaching horsemen whose trampling grew
heavier each moment as if they were advancing at a full trot composed
the flower of his own band had but little fear of the result of a
contest he did not doubt they would outnumber the savages who he
thought could not muster more than fifteen or sixteen guns and coming
from a station which he had been taught to believe was of no mean
strength it was more than probable their numbers had been reinforced by a
detachment from its garrison

such were his thoughts such were his hopes as the party drew yet
nigher the sound of their hoofs clattering at last on the ridge of the
hill but his disappointment may be imagined when as they burst at last
on his sight emerging from the woods above the gallant party dwindled
suddenly into a troop of young men only eleven in number who rattled
along the path in greater haste than order as if dreaming of anything in
the world but the proximity of an enemy the leader he recognised at a
glance by his tall figure as tom bruce the younger whose feats of
regulation the previous day had produced a strong though indirect
influence on his own fortunes and the ten lusty youths who followed his
heels he doubted not made up the limbs and body of that inquisitorial
court which under him as its head had dispensed so liberal an allowance
of border law to honest ralph stackpole that they were now travelling on
duty of a similar kind he was strongly inclined to believe but the
appearance of their horses covered with foam as if they had ridden far
and fast their rifles held in readiness in both hands as if in
momentary expectation of being called on to use them with an occasional
gesture from their youthful leader who seemed to encourage them to
greater speed convinced him they were bent upon more serious business
perhaps in pursuit of the indians with whose marauding visitation some
accident had made them acquainted

the smallness of the force and its almost entire incompetence to yield
him any relief filled the soldier's breast with despair but hopeless
as he was he could not see the gallant young men rushing blindly among
the savages each of whose rifles was already selecting its victim
without making an effort to apprize them of their danger forgetting
therefore his own situation or generously disregarding it he summoned
all his strength and as they began to descend the hill shouted aloud
beware the ambush halt but before the words were all uttered he was
grasped by the throat with strangling violence and the old warrior
whose left hand thus choked his utterance drew his knife a second time
with the other and seemed for an instant as if he would have plunged it
into the soldier's bosom

but the cry had not been made in vain and although from the distance
the words had not been distinguished by the young kentuckians enough was
heard to convince them the enemy was nigh at hand they came to an
immediate halt and roland whose throat was still held by the warrior
and his bosom threatened by the vengeful knife but whose eyes neither
the anguish of suffocation nor the fear of instant death could draw from
the little band saw them leap from their horses which were given in
charge of one of the number who immediately retired beyond the brow of
the hill while tom bruce a worthy scion of a warlike stock brandishing
his rifle in one hand and with the other pointing his nine remaining
followers down the road cried in tones so manly that they came to
roland's ear now boys the women's down thar and the red skins
with them show fight for the honour of kentuck and the love of woman
every man to his bush and every bullet to its injun bring the brutes
out of their cover

this speech short and homely as it was was answered by a loud shout
from the nine young men who began to divide with the intention of
obeying its simple final instructions when the indians seeing the
design unwilling to forego the advantage of the first open shot and
perhaps hoping by a weak fire to mask their strength and decoy the young
kentuckians into closer quarters let fly a volley of six or seven guns
from the bushes near to where roland lay but without doing much
mischief or even deceiving the young men as was expected

thar they go the brutes roared tom bruce adding as he sprang with
his followers among the bushes show em your noses and keep a good
squint over your elbows

long-knife big fool piankeshaw eat him up cried the old warrior
now releasing the soldier's throat from durance but speaking with tones
of ire and indignation shall see how great injun fighting-man eat up
white man

with these words leaving roland to endure his bonds and solace himself
as he might he crept away into the long grass and was soon entirely
lost to sight

the combat that now ensued was one so different in most of its
characteristics from all that roland had ever before witnessed that he
watched its progress notwithstanding the tortures of his bonds and the
fever of his mind with an interest even apart from that which he
necessarily felt in it as one whose all of happiness or misery depended
upon the issue in all conflicts in which he had been engaged the
adverse ranks were arrayed face to face looking upon each other as they
fought but here no man saw his enemy both parties concealing themselves
so effectually in the grass and among the rocks and shrubs that there
was nothing to indicate even their existence save the occasional
discharge of a rifle and the wreath of white smoke curling up from it
into the air in the battles of regular soldiers too men fought in
masses the chief strength of either party arising from the support which
individuals thus gave to one another each deriving additional courage
and confidence from the presence of his fellows here on the contrary
it seemed the first object of each individual whether american or
indian to separate himself as far from his friends as possible seeking
his own enemies trusting to his own resources carrying on the war on
his own foundation in short like the enthusiastic jerseyman who
without belonging to either side was found at the battle of monmouth
peppering away from a fence at whatever he fancied a foeman fighting
on his own hook entirely

it did not seem to roland as if a battle fought upon such principles
could result in any great injury to either party but he forget or
rather he was ignorant that the separation of the combatants while
effecting the best protection not merely to any one individual but to
all his comrades who must have been endangered if near him by every
bullet aimed at himself did not imply either fear or hesitation on his
part whose object next to that mentioned was to avoid the shots of the
many while seeking out and approaching a single antagonist whom he was
ever ready singly to encounter

and thus it happened that while roland deemed the antagonists were
manoeuvring over the hill side dragging themselves from bush to bush and
rock to rock to no profitable purpose they were actually creeping
nigher and nigher to each other every moment the savages crawling
onwards with the exultation of men who felt their superior strength
and the kentuckians advancing with equal alacrity as if ignorant of or
bravely indifferent to their inferiority

it was not a long time indeed before the virginian began to have a
better opinion of the intentions of the respective parties for by and
by the shots which were at first fired very irregularly and at long
intervals became more frequent and as it seemed more serious and an
occasional whoop from an indian or a wild shout from a kentuckian
showed that the excitement of actual conflict was beginning to be felt on
either side at the same time he became sensible from the direction of
the firing that both parties had gradually extended themselves in a
line reaching notwithstanding the smallness of their numbers from the
crest of the hill on the one hand to the borders of the river on the
other and thus perceived that the gallant regulators however
ignorant of the science of war and borne by impetuous tempers into a
contest with a more numerous foe were not in the mood to be taken either
on the flank or rear but were resolved in true military style to keep
their antagonists before them

in this manner the conflict continued for many minutes the combatants
approaching nearer and nearer the excitement waxing fiercer every
instant until shots were incessantly exchanged and as it seemed with
occasional effect for the yells which grew louder and more frequent on
both sides were sometimes mingled with cries of pain on the one hand
and shouts of triumph on the other during all which time nothing
whatever was seen of the combatants at least by roland whose mental
agonies were not a little increased by his being a compelled spectator
if such he could be called of a battle in which he was so deeply
interested without possessing the power to mingle in it or strike a
single blow on his own behalf his fears of the event had been from the
first much stronger than his hopes aware of the greatly superior
strength of the savages he did not doubt that the moment would come when
he should see them rush in a body upon the kentuckians and overwhelm
them with numbers but that was a measure into which nothing but an
uncommon pitch of fury could have driven the barbarians for with
marksmen like those opposed to them who needed but a glance of an enemy
to insure his instant destruction the first spring from the grass would
have been the signal of death to all who attempted it leaving the
survivors no longer superior in numbers to decide the contest with men
who were individually in courage strength and skill at least their
equals indeed a proof of the extreme folly of such a course on the part
of the indians was soon shown when the regulators fighting their way
onwards as if wholly regardless of the superior numbers of the foe had
advanced so nigh the latter as to command which from occupying the
highest ground they were better able to do the hiding-places of some of
their opponents three young warriors yielding to their fury ashamed
perhaps of being thus bearded by a weaker foe or inflamed with the hope
of securing a scalp of one young kentuckian who had crept dangerously
nigh suddenly sprung from their lairs and guided by the smoke of the
rifle which he had just discharged rushed towards the spot yelling with
vindictive exultation they were the first combatants roland had yet seen
actually engaged in the conflict and he noted their appearance and act
of daring with a sinking heart as the prelude to a charge from the whole
body of indians upon the devoted kentuckians but scarce were their brown
bodies seen to rise from the grass before three rifles were fired from
as many points on the hill-side following each other in such rapid
succession that the ear could scarce distinguish the different
explosions each of them telling with fatal effect upon the rash
warriors two of whom fell dead on the spot while the third and
foremost uttering a faint whoop of defiance and making an effort to
throw the hatchet he held in his hand suddenly staggered and fell in
like manner to the earth

loud and bold was the shout of the kentuckians at this happy stroke of
success and laughs of scorn were mingled with their warlike hurrahs as
they prepared to improve the advantage so fortunately gained loudest of
all in both laugh and hurrah was the young tom bruce whose voice was
heard scarce sixty yards off roaring hurrah for old kentuck try em
agin boys give it to em handsome once more and then boys a rush for
the women

the sound of a friendly voice at so short a distance fired roland's heart
with hope and he shouted aloud himself no indian seeming nigh for
assistance but his voice was lost in a tempest of yells the utterance
of grief and fury with which the fall of their three companions had
filled the breasts of the savages the effect of this fatal loss
stirring up their passions to a sudden frenzy was to goad them into the
very step which they had hitherto so wisely avoided all sprang from the
ground as with one consent and regardless of the exposure and danger
dashed with hideous shouts against the kentuckians but the volley with
which they were received each kentuckian selecting his man and firing
with unerring and merciless aim damped their short-lived ardour and
quickly dropping again among the grass and bushes they were fain to
continue the combat as they had begun it in a way which if it produced
less injury to their antagonists was conducive of greater safety to
themselves

the firing was now hot and incessant on both sides but particularly on
the part of the regulators who inspired by success but still prudently
avoiding all unnecessary exposure of their persons pressed their enemies
with a spirit from which roland now for the first time drew the happiest
auguries their stirring hurrahs bespoke a confidence in the result of
the fray infinitely cheering to his spirits and he forgot his tortures
which from the many frantic struggles he had made to force the thong from
his wrists drawing it at each still further into his flesh were now
almost insupportable when amid the din of firing and yelling he heard
tom bruce cry aloud to his companions now boys one more crack and
then for rifle-butt knife and hatchet it seemed indeed as if the
heavy losses the indians had sustained had turned the scale of battle
entirely in favour of the kentuckians it was evident even to roland
that the former although yelling and shouting with as much apparent
vigour as ever were gradually giving ground before the latter and
retreating towards their former lairs while he could as clearly
perceive from bruce's expressions that the intrepid kentuckian was
actually preparing to execute the very measure that had caused such loss
to his enemies and which being thus resolved on showed his confidence
of victory ready boys he heard him shout again and even nigher than
before take the shoot with full pieces and let the skirmudgeons have
it handsome

at that conjuncture and just when forrester caught his breath with
intense and devouring expectation an incident occurred which entirely
changed the face of affairs and snatched the victory from the hands of
the kentuckians the gallant bruce thus calling upon his followers to
prepare for the charge had scarce uttered the words recorded before
a voice lustier even than his own bellowed from a bush immediately on
his rear take it like a butcher's bull-dog tooth and nail knife
and skull-splitter foot and finger give it to em every
way cock-a-doodle-doo

at these words coming from a quarter and from an ally entirely
unexpected young bruce looked behind him and beheld emerging from a
hazel bush through which it had just forced its way the visage of
roaring ralph stackpole its natural ugliness greatly increased by
countless scratches and spots of blood the result of his leap down the
ledge of rocks when first set upon by the indians and his eyes
squinting daggers and ratsbane especially while he was giving utterance
to that gallinaceous slogan with which he was wont to express his
appetite for conflict and with which he now concluded his unceremonious
salutation

the voice and visage were alike familiar to bruce's senses and neither
was so well fitted to excite alarm as merriment but on the present
occasion they produced an effect upon the young regulator's spirits and
through them upon his actions the most unfortunate in the world to
understand which it must be recollected that the worthy kentuckian had
twenty-four hours before with his own hands assisted in gibbeting
honest ralph on the beech tree where he had every reason to suppose
his lifeless body was hanging at that very moment his astonishment and
horror may therefore be conceived when turning in some purturbation at
the well known voice he beheld that identical body the corse of the
executed horse-thief crawling after him in the grass winking and
blinking and squinting as he was used afterwards to say as if the
devil had him by the pastern it was a spectacle which the nerves of
even tom bruce could not stand it did what armed indians could not
do it frightened him out of his propriety forgetting his situation
his comrades the savages forgetting everything but the fact of his
having administered the last correction of lynch-law to the object of his
terror he sprang on his feet and roaring by the etarnal devil here's
ralph stackpole he took to his heels running in his confusion right
in the direction of the enemy among whom he would have presently found
himself but for a shot by which before he had run six yards the
unfortunate youth was struck to the earth

the exclamation and the sight of ralph himself who also rose to follow
the young leader upon what he deemed a rush against the foe electrified
the whole body of the regulators who were immediately thrown into
confusion of which the savages took the same advantage they had taken of
bruce's agitation firing upon them as they rose and then rushing upon
them to end the fray before they could recover their wits or spirits it
needed but this and the fall of their leader to render the disorder of
the young men irretrievable and accordingly in less than a moment they
were seen all at least who were not already disabled flying in a
panic from the field of battle it was in vain that the captain of
horse-thieves divining at last the cause of their extraordinary flight
roared out that he was a living man with nothing of a ghost about him
whatever the panic was universal and irremediable and nothing remained
for him to do but to save his own life as quickly as possible

tarnal death to me he bellowed turning to fly but a groan from
bruce fell on his ear he ran to the side of the fallen youth and
catching him by the hand exclaimed now for the best leg tom and a
rush up hill to the bosses

you ar'n't hanged then after all muttered the junior and then
fell back as if unable to rise adding faintly go rat it i'm done
for as for the l savages what i have to say l l  but i reckon
scalping's not much l l one soon gets used to it 

and thus the young kentuckian his blood oozing-fast his mind wandering
his utterance failing muttered resigning himself to his fate ignorant
that even stackpole was no longer at his side to hear him his fate did
indeed seem to be inevitable for while stackpole had him by the hand
vainly tugging to get him on his feet three different indians were seen
running with might and main to quench the last spark of his existence
and to finish stackpole at the same time but in that very emergency the
ill-luck which seemed to pursue the horse-thief and all with whom he was
associated found a change and destiny sent them doth assistance in a
way and by means as unexpected as they were unhoped for the approach of
the savages was noticed by roaring ralph who not knowing how to save
his young executioner against whom he seemed to entertain no feelings of
anger whatever and whose approaching fate he appeared well disposed to
revenge beforehand clapped his rifle to his shoulder to make sure of
one of the number when his eye was attracted by the spectacle of a horse
rushing up the stony road neighing furiously and scattering the indians
from before him it was the charger briareus who had broken from the
tree where he had been fastened below and now came dashing up the hill
distracted with terror or perhaps burning to mingle in the battle which
he had heard and snuffed from afar he galloped by the three indians who
leaped aside in alarm while stackpole taking advantage of the moment
ran up and seized him by the bridle in another moment he had assisted
the fainting kentuckian upon the animal's back leaped up behind him
and was dashing with wild speed up the hill yelling with triumph and
laughing to scorn the bullets that were shot vainly after

all this the unhappy roland beheld and with a revulsion of feelings
that can only be imagined he saw without indeed entirely
comprehending the cause the sudden confusion and final flight of the
little band at the moment of anticipated victory he saw them flying
wildly up the hill in irretrievable rout followed by the whooping
victors who with the fugitives soon vanished entirely from view
leaving the field of battle to the dead and to the thrice miserable
captives




chapter xx


the conflict though sharp and hot considering the insignificant number
of combatants on either side was of no very long duration the whole
time from the appearance of the kentuckians until the flight scarce
exceeding half an hour but the pursuit which the victors immediately
commenced lasted a much longer space and it was more than an hour an
age of suspense and suffering to the soldier before the sound of
whooping on the hill apprised him of their return they brought with
them as trophies of success two horses on each of which sat three or
four different indians as many indeed as could get upon the animal's
back where they clung together shouting laughing and otherwise
diverting themselves more like joyous schoolboys than stern warriors who
had just fought and won a bloody battle

but this semblance of mirth and good humour lasted no longer than while
the savages were riding from the hill-top to the battle-ground which
having reached they sprang upon the ground and running wildly about
uttered several cries of the most mournful character laments as roland
supposed over the bodies of their fallen companions

but if such was their sorrow while looking-upon their own dead the sight
of their lifeless foemen of whom two besides the negro emperor who had
been tomahawked the moment after he fell had been unhappily left lying
on the field soon changed it into a fiercer passion the wail became
a yell of fury loud and frightful and roland could see them gathering
around each corpse striking the senseless clay repeatedly with their
knives and hatchets each seeking to surpass his fellow in the savage
work of mutilation such is the red man of america whom courage an
attribute of all lovers of blood whether man or animal misfortune the
destiny in every quarter of the globe of every barbarous race which
contact with a civilised one cannot civilise and the dreams of poets
and sentimentalists have invested with a character wholly incompatible
with his condition individual virtues may be and indeed frequently are
found among men in a natural state but honour justice and generosity
as characteristics of the mass are refinements belonging only to an
advanced stage of civilisation

in the midst of this barbarous display of unsatisfied rage several of
the savages approached the unfortunate roland and among them the old
piankeshaw who flourishing his hatchet already clotted with blood and
looking more like a demon than a human being made an effort to dash out
the soldier's brains in which however he was restrained by two younger
savages who caught him in their arms and muttered somewhat in their own
tongue which mollified his wrath in a moment causing him to burst into a
roar of obstreperous laughter ees good he cried grinning with
apparent benevolence and friendship over the helpless youth no hurt
long-knife take him piankeshaw nation make good friend squaw
papoose all brudders long-knife with these expressions of the
purport of which roland could understand but little he left him
retiring with the rest as roland soon saw to conceal or bury the bodies
of his slain comrades which were borne in the arms of the survivors to
the bottom of the hill and there carefully and in silence deposited
among thickets or in crannies of the rock

this ceremony completed roland was again visited by his piankeshaw
friend and the two young warriors who had saved his life before and
were perhaps still fearful of trusting it entirely to the tender mercies
of the senior it was fortunate for roland that he was thus attended for
the old warrior had no sooner approached him than he began to weep and
groan uttering an harangue which although addressed as it seemed
entirely to the prostrate captive was in the indian tongue and
therefore wholly wasted upon his ears nevertheless he could perceive
that the indian was relating something that weighed very heavily upon his
mind that he was warming with the subject and even working himself up
into a passion and indeed he had not spoken very long before his
visage changed from grief to wrath and from wrath to the extreme of
fury in which he began to handle his hatchet as on the previous
occasion making every demonstration of the best disposition in the world
to bury it in the prisoner's brain he was again arrested by the young
savages who muttered something in his ear as before and again the
effect was to convert his anger into merriment the change being effected
with a facility that might well have amazed the prisoner had his despair
permitted him to feel any lighter emotion good cried the old warrior
as if in reply to what the others had said long-knife go piankeshaw
nation make great sight for piankeshaw and so saying he began to
dance about with many grimaces of visage and contortions of body that
seemed to have a meaning for his comrades who fetched a whoop of
admiration though entirely inexplicable to the soldier then seizing the
latter by the arm and setting him on his feet the warrior led or
dragged him a little way down the hill to a place on the road-side
where the victors were assembled deliberating doubtless upon the fate of
their prisoners

they seemed to have suffered a considerable loss in the battle twelve
being the whole number now to be seen and most of these judging from
the fillets of rags and bundles of green leaves tied about their limbs
had been wounded two of them to all appearance very severely if not
mortally for they lay upon the earth a little apart from the rest in
whose motions they seemed to take no interest

as roland approached he looked in vain amid the throng for his
kinswoman neither she nor telie doe was to be seen but casting his eye
wildly around it fell upon a little grove of trees not many yards off
in which he could perceive the figures of horses as well as of a tall
barbarian who stood on its edge as if keeping guard wrapped
notwithstanding the sultriness of the weather in a blanket from chin to
foot while his head was as warmly invested in the ample folds of a huge
scarlet handkerchief he stood like a statue his arms folded on his
breast and lost under the heavy festoons of the blanket while his eyes
were fastened upon the group of indians on the road-side from which they
wandered only to glare a moment upon the haggard and despairing visage of
the soldier in that copse roland doubted not the savages had concealed
a hopeless and helpless captive the being for whom he had struggled and
suffered so long and so vainly the maid whose forebodings of evil had
been so soon and so dreadfully realised

in the meanwhile the indians on the road-side began the business for
which they had assembled that seemed to be in the first place the
division of spoils consisting of the guns horses and clothes of the
dead with sundry other articles which but for his unhappy condition
roland would have wondered to behold for there were among them rolls of
cloth and calico heaps of hawks-bells and other indian trinkets
knives pipes powder and ball and other such articles even to a keg or
two of the fire-water enough to stock an indian trading-house these
wherever and however obtained were distributed equally among the indians
by a man of lighter skin than themselves a half-breed as roland
supposed who seemed to exercise some authority among them though ever
deferring in all things to an old indian of exceedingly fierce and malign
aspect though wasted and withered into the semblance of a consumptive
wolf who sat upon a stone buried in gloomy abstraction from which
time by time he awoke to direct the dispersion of the valuables
through the hands of his deputy with exceeding great gravity and state

the distribution being effected and evidently to the satisfaction of all
present the savages turned their looks upon the prisoner eyeing him
with mingled triumph and exultation and the old presiding officer or
chief as he seemed to be shaking off his abstraction got upon his feet
and made him a harangue imitating therein the ancient piankeshaw though
with this difference that whereas the latter spoke entirely in his own
tongue the former thought fit among abundance of indian phrases to
introduce some that were sufficiently english to enable the soldier to
guess at least a part of his meaning his oration however as far as
roland could understand it consisted chiefly in informing him that he
was a very great chief who had killed abundance of white people men
women and children whose scalps had for thirty years and more been
hanging in the smoke of his shawnee lodge that he was very brave and
loved a white man's blood better than whisky and that he never spared it
out of pity adding as the cause and seeming well pleased that he could
boast a deficiency so well befitting a warrior that he had no
heart his interior being framed of stone as hard as the flinty rock
under his feet this exordium finished he proceeded to bestow sundry
abusive epithets upon the prisoner charging him with having put his
young men to a great deal of needless trouble besides having killed
several for which he added the longknife ought to expect nothing
better than to have his face blacked and be burnt alive a hint that
produced a universal grunt of assent on the part of the auditors having
received this testimony of approbation he resumed his discourse
pursuing it for the space of ten minutes or more with considerable vigour
and eloquence but as the whole speech consisted like most other indian
speeches of the same things said over and over again those same things
being scarce worth the trouble of utterance we think it needless to say
anything further of it except that first as it seemed to roland as
far as he could understand the broken expressions of the chief he
delivered a furious tirade against the demon enemy of his race the
bloody jibbenainosay the white man's war-manito whom he declared it was
his purpose to fight and kill as soon as that destroyer should have the
courage to face him the old shawnee chief like a human warrior and
that it inspired several others to get up and make speeches likewise of
all these the burden seemed to be the unpardonable crime of killing their
comrades of which the young soldier had been guilty and he judged by
the fury of their countenances that they were only debating whether they
should put him to death on the spot or carry him to their country to be
tortured

the last speaker of all was the old piankeshaw whose meaning could be
only guessed at from his countenance and gestures the one being as angry
and wo-begone as the latter were active and expressive he pointed at
least a dozen times over to two fresh and gory scalps the most highly
valued trophies of victory that lay at the feet of the shawnee chief
as many times to the horses and thrice as often at the person of roland
who stood now surveying his dark visage with a look of sullen despair
now casting his eyes with a gaze of inexpressible emotion towards the
little copse in which he still sought in vain a glimpse of his edith
but if the old warrior's finger was often bent towards these three
attractive objects innumerable were the times it was pointed at the two
or three little whisky-kegs which not having been yet distributed lay
untouched upon the grass the words with which he accompanied these
expressive gestures seemed to produce a considerable effect upon all his
hearers even upon the ancient chief who at the close of the oration
giving a sign to one of his young men the latter ran to the copse and in
an instant returned bringing with him one of the horses which the chief
immediately handed over through his deputy to the orator and the
orator to one of the two young warriors who seemed to be of his own
tribe the chief then pointed to a keg of the fire-water and this was
also given to the piankeshaw who received it with a grin of ecstacy
embraced it snuffed at its odoriferous contents and then passed it in
like manner to his second follower the chief made yet another signal
and the deputy taking roland by the arm and giving him a piercing
perhaps even a pitying look delivered him likewise into the hands of
the piankeshaw who as if his happiness were now complete received him
with a yell of joy that was caught up by his two companions and finally
joined in by all the savages present

this shout seemed to be the signal for the breaking up of the convention
all rose to their feet iterating and reiterating the savage cry while
the piankeshaw clutching his prize and slipping a noose around the
thong that bound his arms endeavoured to drag him to the horse on which
the young men had already secured the keg of liquor and which they were
holding in readiness for the elder barbarian to mount

at that conjecture and while roland was beginning to suspect that even
the wretched consolation of remaining in captivity by his kinswoman's
side was about to be denied him and while the main body of savages were
obviously bidding farewell to the little band of piankeshaws some
shaking them by the hands while others made game of the prisoner's
distress in sundry indian ways and all uttering yells expressive of
their different feelings there appeared rushing from the copse and
running among the barbarians the damsel telie doe who not a little to
the surprise even of the ill-fated roland himself ran to his side
caught the rope by which he was held and endeavoured frantically to
snatch it from the hands of the piankeshaw

the act for one of her peculiarly timorous spirit was surprising
enough but a great transformation seemed to have suddenly taken place in
her character and even her appearance which was less that of a feeble
woman engaged in a work of humanity than of a tigress infuriated by the
approach of hunters against the lair of her sleeping young she grasped
the cord with unexpected strength and her eyes flashed fire as they
wandered around until they met those of the supposed half-breed to whom
she called with tones of the most vehement indignation oh father
father what are you doing you won't give him up to the murderers you
promised you promised 

peace fool interrupted the man thus addressed taking her by the arm
and endeavouring to jerk her from the prisoner away with you to your
place and be silent

i will not father i will not be silent i will not away cried the
girl resisting his efforts and speaking with a voice that mingled the
bitterest reproach with imploring entreaty you are a white man father
and not an indian yes father you are no indian and you promised no
harm should be done you did father you did promise

away gal i tell you thundered the renegade parent and he again
strove to drag her from the prisoner but telie as if driven frantic by
the act flung her arms round roland's body from which she was drawn
only by an effort of strength which her weak powers were unable to
resist but even then she did not give over her purpose but starting
from her father's arms she ran screaming back to roland and would have
again clasped him in her own when the renegade driven to fury by her
opposition arrested her with one hand and with the other catching up a
knife that lay in the grass he made as if in his fit of passion he
would have actually plunged it into her breast his malevolent visage
and brutal threat awoke the terrors of the woman in her heart and she
sank on her knees crying-with a piercing voice oh father don't kill
me don't kill your own daughter

kill you indeed muttered the outlaw with a laugh of scorn even
injuns don't kill their own children and taking advantage of her
terror he beckoned to the piankeshaw who as well as all the other
indians seemed greatly astounded and scandalised at the indecorous
interference of a female in the affairs of warriors to remove the
prisoner which he did by immediately beginning to drag him down the
hill the action was not unobserved by the girl whose struggles to
escape from her father's arms to pursue as it seemed after the
soldier roland could long see while her wild and piteous cries were
still longer brought to his ears

as for roland himself the words and actions of the girl though they
might have awakened suspicions not before-experienced of her good
faith and even appeared to show that it was less to unlucky accident
than to foul conspiracy he owed his misfortunes did not and could not
banish the despair that absorbed his mind to the exclusion of every
other feeling he seemed even to himself to be in a dream the sport of an
incubus that oppressed every faculty and energy of spirit while yet
presenting the most dreadful phantasms to his imagination his tongue had
lost its function he strove several times to speak but tongue and
spirit were alike paralysed the nightmare oppressed mind and body
together

it was in this unhappy condition the result of overwrought feelings and
intolerable bodily suffering that he was led by his piankeshaw masters
down the hill to the river which they appeared to be about to pass
whilst the chief body of marauders were left to seek another road from
the field of battle here the old warrior descended from his horse and
leaving roland in charge of the two juniors stepped a little aside to a
place where was a ledge of rocks in the face of which seemed to be the
entrance to a cavern although carefully blocked up by masses of stone
that had been but recently removed from its foot the piankeshaw taking
post directly in front of the hole began to utter many mournful
ejaculations which were addressed to the insensate rock or perhaps to
the equally insensate corpse of a comrade concealed within he drew also
from a little pouch his medicine-bag divers bits of bone wood and
feathers the most valued idols of his fetich which he scattered about
the rock singing the while in a highly lugubrious tone the praises of
the dead and shedding tears that might have been supposed the
outpourings of genuine sorrow but if sorrow it was that thus affected
the spirits of the warrior as it seemed to have done on several previous
occasions it proved to be as easily consolable as before as the event
showed for having finished his lamentations and left the rock he
advanced towards roland whom he threatened for the third time with his
knife when one of the younger indians muttering a few words of
remonstrance and pointing at the same time to the keg of fire-water on
the horse's back his grief and rage expired together in a haw-haw ten
times more obstreperous and joyous than any he had indulged before then
mounting the horse seemingly in the best humour in the world and taking
the end of the cord by which roland was bound he rode into the water
dragging the unfortunate prisoner along at his horse's heels while the
younger piankeshaws brought up the rear ready to prevent resistance on
the soldier's part should he prove in any degree refractory

in this ignominious manner the unhappy forrester passed the river to do
which had for twenty-four hours been the chief object of his wishes
the ford was wide deep and rocky and the current strong so that he
was several times swept from his feet and being unable to rise would
have perished happy could he have thus escaped his tormentors had not
the young warriors been nigh to give him assistance assistance in such
cases was indeed always rendered but his embarrassments and perils only
afforded food for mirth to his savage attendants who at every fall and
dip in the tide made the hills resound with their vociferous laughter
it is only among children we mean of course bad ones and savages
who are but grown children after all that we find malice and mirth go
hand in hand the will to create misery and the power to see it invested
in ludicrous colours

the river was at last crossed and the bank being ascended the three
warriors paused a moment to send their last greeting across to their
allies who were seen climbing the hill taking their own departure
from the battle-ground even roland was stirred from his stupefaction
as he beheld the train some on foot some on the captured horses
winding up the narrow road to the hill-top he looked among them for his
edith and saw her or fancied he saw her for the distance was
considerable supported on one of the animals grasped in the arms of a
tall savage the guard of the grove whose scarlet turban glittering in
the sunshine and his ample white blanket flowing over the flanks of the
horse made the most conspicuous objects in the train but while he
looked barbarian and captive vanished together behind the hill for
they were at the head of the train there remained a throng of footmen
who paused an instant on the crest of the ridge to return the farewell
whoop of the three piankeshaws this being done they likewise
disappeared and the piankeshaws turning their faces towards the west
dragging the prisoner after them resumed their journey




chapter xxi


the agony which roland suffered from the thong so tightly secured upon
his wrists was so far advantageous as it distracted his mind from the
subject which had been at first the chief source of his distress for it
was impossible to think long even of his kinswoman while enduring
tortures that were aggravated by every jerk of the rope by which he
was dragged along these growing more insupportable every moment his
sufferings however seemed to engage little of the thoughts of his
conductors who leaving the buffalo road and striking into the pathless
forest pushed onward at a rapid pace compelling him to keep up with
them and it was not until he had twice fainted from pain and exhaustion
that after some discussion they thought fit to loosen the thong which
they afterwards removed altogether then whether it was that they were
touched at last with compassion or afraid that death might snatch the
prisoner from their hands if too severely treated they proceeded even
to take other measures of a seemingly friendly kind to allay his pangs
washing his lacerated wrists in a little brook on whose banks they
paused to give him rest and then binding them up as well as the two or
three painful though not dangerous wounds he had received with green
leaves which one of the juniors plucked bruised and applied with every
appearance of the most brotherly interest while the other to equal or
surpass him in benevolence took the keg of whisky from the horse's back
and filling a little wooden bowl that he drew from a pack insisted that
the prisoner should swallow it in this recommendation the old piankeshaw
also concurred but finding that roland recoiled with disgust after an
attempt to taste the fiery liquid he took the bowl into his own hands
and despatched its contents at a draught good great good he
muttered smacking his lips with high gusto white man make good
drink piankeshaw great friend white-man's liquor

having thus opened their hearts nothing could be to appearance more
friendly and affectionate than the bearing of the savages at least so
long as they remained at the brook and even when the journey was
resumed which it soon was their deportment was but little less loving
it is true that the senior before mounting his horse proceeded very
coolly to clap the noose which had previously been placed on roland's
arms around his neck where it bade fair to strangle him at the first
false step of the horse but the young indians walked at his side
chattering in high good humour though as their stock of english
extended only to the single phrase bozhoo brudder which was not in
itself very comprehensible though repeated at least twice every minute
it may be supposed their conversation had no very enlivening effect on
the prisoner

nor was the old piankeshaw much behind the juniors in good humour
though it must be confessed his feelings were far more capricious and
evanescent one while he would stop his horse and dragging roland to his
side pat him affectionately on the shoulder and tell him as well as
his broken language could express his intentions that he would take him
to the springs of the wabash one of the principal seats of his nation
and make him his son and a great warrior while at other times having
indulged in a fit of sighing groaning and crying he would turn in a
towering rage and express a resolution to kill him on the spot from
which bloody disposition however he was always easily turned by the
interference of the young men

these capricious changes were perhaps owing in a great measure to the
presence of the whisky-keg which the old warrior ever and anon took from
its perch among the packs behind him and applied to his lips sorely as
it appeared against the will of his companion who seemed to remonstrate
with him against a practice so unbecoming a warrior while in the heart
of a foeman's country and not a little also against his own sense of
propriety for his whole course in relation to the keg was like that of a
fish that dallies around the angler's worm uncertain whether to bite
now looking and longing now suspecting the hook and retreating now
returning to look and long again until finally unable to resist the
temptation it resolves upon a little nibble which ends even against
its own will in a furious bite

it was in this manner the piankeshaw addressed himself to his treasure
the effect of which was to render each returning paroxysm of affection
and sorrow more energetic than before while it gradually robbed of their
malignity those fits of anger with which he was still occasionally
seized but it added double fluency to his tongue and not content with
muttering his griefs in his own language addressing them to his own
people he finally began to pronounce them in english directing them at
roland whereby the latter was made acquainted with the cause of his
sorrow this it appeared was nothing less than the loss of a son killed
in battle with the kentuckians and left to moulder with two or three
shawnee corses in the cave by the river-side which loss he commemorated
a dozen times over and with a most piteous voice in a lament that
celebrated the young warrior's virtues lost son he ejaculated good
huntaw kill bear kill buffalo catch fish feed old squaw and young
squaw and little papoose good son mighty good son good fighting-man
kill man virginnee kill man kentucky kill man injun-man take scalp
squaw scalp papoose scalp man scalp all kind scalp debbil good
fighting man no go home no more piankeshaw nation no more kill bear no
more kill buffalo no more catch fish no more feed old squaw and young
squaw and little papoose no more kill man no more take scalp lose own
scalp take it long-knife man kentucky no more see old piankeshaw
son leave dead big hole kentucky no more see no more piankeshaw son
piankeshaw nation

with such lamentations running at times into rage against his prisoner
as the representative of those who had shed the young warrior's blood
the old piankeshaw whiled away the hours of travel ceasing them only
when seized with a fit of affection or when some mis-step of the horse
sent a louder gurgle with a more delicious odour from the cask at his
back which music and perfume together were a kind of magic not to be
resisted by one who stood so greatly in need of consolation

the effect of such constant and liberal visitations to the comforter and
enemy of his race continued for several hours together was soon made
manifest in the old warrior who grew more loquacious more lachrymose
and more foolish every moment until by and by having travelled till
towards sunset a period of six or seven hours from the time of setting
out he began to betray the most incontestable evidences of intoxication
he reeled on the horse's back and finally becoming tired of the weight
of his gun he extended it to roland with a very magisterial yet
friendly nod as if bidding him take and carry it it was snatched from
him however by one of the younger warriors who was too wise to intrust
a loaded carbine in the arms of a prisoner and who had perhaps noted the
sudden gleam of fire the first which had visited them since the moment
of his capture that shot into roland's eyes as he stretched forth his
hands to take the weapon

the old piankeshaw did not seem to notice who had relieved him of the
burden he settled himself again on the saddle as well as he could and
jogged onwards prattling and weeping according to the mood of the
moment now droning out an indian song and now nodding with drowsiness
until at last slumber or stupefaction settled so heavily upon his senses
that he became incapable of guiding his horse and the weary animal
checked by the unconscious rider or stopping of his own accord to browse
the green cane-leaves along the path the piankeshaw suddenly took a
lurch wider than usual and fell like a log to the ground

the younger savages had watched the course of proceedings on the part of
the senior with ill-concealed dissatisfaction the catastrophe completed
their rage which however was fortunately expended upon the legitimate
cause of displeasure they tumbled the unlucky cask from its perch and
assailing it with horrible yells and as much apparent military zeal as
could have been exercised upon a human enemy lying in like manner at
their feet they dashed it to pieces with their tomahawks scattering its
precious contents upon the grass

while they were thus engaged the senior rose from the earth staring
about him for a moment with looks of stupid inquiry until beginning at
last to comprehend the accident that had happened to him and perhaps
moved by the late of his treasure he also burst into a fury and
snatching up the nearest gun he clapped it to his horse's head and shot
it dead on the spot roaring out cuss white-man hoss throw old
piankeshaw no good nothing cuss debbil hoss

this act of drunken and misdirected ferocity seemed vastly to incense the
young warriors and the senior waxing as wrathful at the wanton
destruction of his liquor there immediately ensued a battle of tongues
betwixt the two parties who scolded and berated one another for the
space of ten minutes or more with prodigious volubility and energy the
juniors expatiating upon the murder of the horse as an act of the most
unpardonable folly while the senior seemed to insist that the wasting of
so much good liquor was a felony of equally culpable dye and it is
probable he had the better side of the argument since he continued to
grumble for a long time even after he had silenced the others

but peace was at last restored and the savages prepared to resume their
journey but not until they had unanimously resolved that the
consequences of the quarrel should be visited upon the head of the
captive their apparent good-humour vanished and the old piankeshaw
staggering up gave roland to understand in an oration full of all the
opprobrious epithets he could muster either in english or indian that
he piankeshaw being a very great warrior intended to carry him to his
country to run the gauntlet through every village of the nation and
then to burn him alive for the satisfaction of the women and children
and while pouring this agreeable intelligence into the soldier's ears
the juniors took the opportunity to tie his arms a second time heaping
on his shoulders their three packs to which the old man afterwards
insisted on adding the saddle and bridle of the horse though for no very
ostensible object together with a huge mass of the flesh dug with his
knife from the still quivering carcass which was perhaps designed for
their supper

under this heavy load the unhappy and degraded soldier was compelled to
stagger along with his masters but fortunately for no long-period the
night was fast approaching and having-soon arrived at a little glade in
the forest where a spring of sweet water bubbled from the grass they
signified their intention to make it their camping ground for the night
a fire was struck the horse flesh stuck upon a fork and roasted and a
share of it tendered to the prisoner who sick at heart and feverish in
body refused it with as much disgust as he had shown at the whisky
expressing his desire only to drink of the spring which he was allowed
to do to his liking

the savages then collected grass and leaves with which they spread a
couch under a tree beside their fire and here having compelled the
soldier to lie down they proceeded to secure him for the night with a
cruel care that showed what value the loss of the horse and fire-water
the only other trophies of victory led them to attach to him a stake
was cut and laid across his breast and to the ends of this his
outstretched arms were bound at both wrist and elbow a pole was then
laid upon his body to the extremities of which his feet and neck were
also bound so that he was secured as upon or rather under a cross
without the power of moving hand or foot as if even this were not enough
to satisfy his barbarous companions they attached an additional cord
to his neck and this when they lay down beside him to sleep one of the
young warriors wrapped several times round his own arm so that the
slightest movement of the prisoner were such a thing possible must
instantly rouse the jealous savage from his slumbers

these preparations being completed the young men lay down one on each
side of the prisoner and were soon fast asleep

the old piankeshaw meanwhile sat by the fire now musing in drunken
revery in cogibundity of cogitation now grumbling a lament for his
perished son which by a natural licence of affliction he managed to
intermingle with regrets for his lost liquor and occasionally heaping
maledictions upon the heads of his wasteful companions or soliciting
the prisoner's attention to an account that he gave him at least six
times over of the peculiar ceremonies which would be observed in burning
him when once safely bestowed in the piankeshaw nation in this manner
the old savage often nodding but always rousing again succeeded in
amusing himself nearly half the night long and it was not until near
midnight that he thought fit after stirring up the fire and adding a
fresh log to it to stretch himself beside one of the juniors and
grumble himself to sleep a few explosive and convulsive snorts such as
might have done honour to the nostrils of a war-horse marked the
gradations by which he sank to repose then came the deep long-drawn
breath of mental annihilation such as distinguished the slumber of
his companions

to the prisoner alone sleep was wholly denied for which the renewed
agonies of his bonds tied with the supreme contempt for suffering which
usually marks the conduct of savages to their captives would have been
sufficient cause had there even been no superior pangs of spirit to
banish the comforter from his eyelids of his feelings during the journey
from the river which in consequence of numberless delays caused by the
old piankeshaw's drunkenness could scarce have been left more than eight
or ten miles behind we have said but little since imagination can only
picture them properly to the reader grief anguish despair and the
sense of degradation natural to a man of proud spirit a slave in the
hands of coarse barbarians kept his spirit for a long time wholly
subdued and torpid and it was not until he perceived the old
piankeshaw's repeated potations and their effects that he began to wake
from his lethargy and question himself whether he might not yet escape
and flying to the nearest settlements for assistance strike a blow for
the recovery of his kinswoman weak from exhaustion and wounds entirely
unarmed and closely watched as he perceived he was by the young
warriors notwithstanding their affected friendship it was plain that
nothing could be hoped for except from caution on his part and the most
besotted folly on that of his captors this folly was already made
perceptible in at least one of the party and as he watched the
oft-repeated visitations of the senior to the little keg he began to
anticipate the period when the young men should also betake themselves to
the stupefying draught and give him the opportunity he longed for with
frantic though concealed impatience this hope fell when the cask was
dashed to pieces but hope once excited did not easily forsake him he
had heard and read of escapes made by captives like himself from
indians when encamped by night in the woods nay of escapes made when
the number of captors and the feebleness of the captive for even women
and boys had thus obtained their deliverance rendered the condition of
the latter still more wretched than his own why might not he a man
and soldier guarded by only three foemen succeed as others had
succeeded in freeing himself

this question asked over and over again and each time answered with
greater hope and animation than before employed his mind until his wary
captors had tied him to the stakes as has been mentioned leaving him as
incapable of motion as if every limb had been solidified into stone had
the barbarians been able to look into his soul at the moment when he
first strove to test the strength of the ligatures and found them
resisting his efforts like bands of brass they would have beheld deeper
and wilder tortures than any they could hope to inflict ever at the
stake the effort was repeated once twice thrice a thousand
times but always in vain the cords were too securely tied the stakes
too carefully placed to yield to his puny struggles he was a prisoner
in reality without resource without help without hope

and thus he passed the whole of the bitter night watching the slow
progress of moments counted only by the throbbings of his fevered
temples the deep breathings of the indians and the motion of the
stars creeping over the vista opened to the skies from the little glade
a prey to despair made so much more poignant by disappointment and
self-reproach why had he not taken advantage of his temporary release
from the cords to attempt escape by open flight when the drunkenness of
the old piankeshaw would have increased the chances of success he had
lost his best ally in the cask of liquor but he resolved if the
delirious plans of a mind tossed by the most frenzied passions could be
called resolutions a second day should not pass by without an effort
better becoming a soldier better becoming the only friend and natural
protector of the hapless edith

in the meanwhile the night passed slowly away the moon diminished to a
ghastly crescent rose over the woods looking down with a sickly smile
upon the prisoner an emblem of his decayed fortunes and waning hopes
and a pale streak the first dull glimmer of dawn was seen stealing up
the skies but neither moon nor streak of dawn yet threw light upon the
little glade the watch-fire had burned nearly away and its flames no
longer illuminated the scene the crackling of the embers with an
occasional echo from the wood hard by as of the rustling of a rabbit or
other small animal drawn by the unusual appearance of fire near his
favourite fountain to satisfy a timorous curiosity was the only sound
to be heard for the indians were in the dead sleep of morning and their
breathing was no longer audible

the silence and darkness together were doubly painful to roland who had
marked the streak of dawn and longed with fierce impatience for the
moment when he should be again freed from his bonds and left to attempt
some of those desperate expedients which he had been planning all the
night long in such a frame of mind even the accidental falling of a
half-consumed brand upon the embers and its sudden kindling into flame
were circumstances of an agreeable nature and the ruddy glare thrown
over the boughs above his head was welcomed as the return of a friend
bringing with it hope and even a share of his long lost tranquillity

but tranquillity was not fated to dwell long in his bosom at that very
moment and while the blaze of the brand was brightest his ears were
stunned by an explosion bursting like a thunderbolt at his very head but
whether coming from earth or air from the hands of heaven or the
firelock of a human being he knew not and immediately after there
sprang a huge dark shadow over his body and there was heard the crash as
of an axe falling upon the flesh of the young indian who slept on his
right side a dismal shriek the utterance of agony and terror rose from
the barbarian's lips and then came the sound of his footsteps as he
darted with a cry still wilder into the forest pursued by the sound
of other steps and then all again was silent all save groans and the
rustling in the grass of limbs convulsed in the death-throe at the
soldier's side

astounded bewildered and even horror-struck by these incomprehensible
events the work of but an instant and all unseen by roland who from
his position could look only upwards towards the boughs and skies he
would have thought himself in a dream but for the agonised struggles
of the young indian at his side which he could plainly feel as well as
hear until by and by they subsided as if in sudden death was it a
rescue was that shot fired by a friend that axe wielded by a human
auxiliary those sounds of feet dying away in the distance were they the
steps of a deliverer the thought was ecstacy and he shouted aloud
return friend and loose me return

no voice replied to the shout but it roused from the earth a dark and
bloody figure which staggering and falling over the body of the young
warrior crawled like a scotched reptile upon roland's breast when the
light of the fire shining upon it revealed to his eyes the horrible
spectacle of the old piankeshaw warrior the lower part of his face shot
entirely away and his eyes rolling hideously and as it seemed
sightlessly in the pangs of death his hand clutching the knife with
which he had so often threatened and with which he yet seemed destined
to take though in the last gasp of his own the soldier's life with one
hand he felt along the prisoner's body as if seeking a vital part and
sustained his own weight while with the other he made repeated though
feeble and ineffectual strokes with the knife all the time rolling and
staggering and shaking his gory head in a manner most horrible to
behold but vengeance was denied the dying warrior his blows were
offered impotently and without aim and becoming weaker at every effort
his left arm at last failed to support him and he fell across roland's
body in which position he immediately after expired

in this frightful condition roland was left shocked although relieved
from fear by the savage's death crying in vain to his unknown auxiliary
for assistance he exerted his voice until the woods rang with his
shouts but hollow echoes were the only replies neither voice nor
returning footstep was to be heard and it seemed as if he had been
rescued from the indians hands only to be left bound and helpless to
perish piecemeal among their bodies the fear of a fate so dreadful with
the weight of the old piankeshaw a man of almost gigantic proportions
lying upon his bosom was more than his agonised spirits and exhausted
strength could endure and his wounds suddenly bursting out afresh he
lapsed into a state of insensibility in which however it was happily
his fate not long to remain




chapter xxii


when roland recovered his consciousness he was no longer a prisoner
extended beneath the indian cross his limbs were unbound and he himself
lying across the knees of a man who was busily engaged sprinkling his
head and breast with water from the little well to which he had been
borne while still insensible he stared around him with eyes yet filmy
and vacant the first objects they fell on were two lifeless figures the
bodies of his late savage masters stretched near the half-extinguished
fire he looked up to the face of his deliverer which could be readily
seen for it was now broad day and beheld with such a thrill of
pleasure as had not visited his bosom for many weary days the features
of his trusty guide and emissary honest nathan slaughter who was
pursuing the work of resuscitation with great apparent zeal while little
dog peter stood by wagging his tail as if encouraging him to
perseverance

what nathan he cried grasping at his hand and endeavouring though
vainly to rise from his knee do i dream is it you

verily thee speaks the truth replied nathan it is me me and
little peter and truly it is nobody else

and i am free again free free and the savages the vile murdering
piankeshaws dead surprised killed every dog of them

thee speaks the truth a second time said nathan slaughter snuffling
and hesitating in his speech thee wicked enemies and captivators will
never trouble thee more

and who who was it that rescued me hah there is blood on your face
your hands are red with it it was you then that saved me you that
killed the accursed cut-throats noble nathan brave nathan true nathan
how shall i ever requite the act how shall i ever forget it and as he
spoke the soldier yet lying across nathan's knees for his limbs
refused to support him grasped his preserver's hands with a fervour of
gratitude that gave new life and vigour to his exhausted spirits

and thee does not think then muttered nathan snuffling twice as much
as before but growing bolder as roland's gratitude reassured him thee
does not think that is thee is not of opinion that is to say thee
does not altogether hold it to be as a blood-guiltiness and a
wickedness and a shedding of blood that i did take to me the weapon of
war and shoot upon thee wicked oppressors to the saving of thee life
truly friend it was to save thee life thee must remember that it
was a thing that was necessary and not to be helped truly friend it
was my desire to help thee in peace and with a peaceful hand but of a
truth there was thee enemies at thee side with their guns and their
knives ready to start up and knock out thee unfortunate brains truly
friend thee sees it couldn't be helped and truly i don't think thee
conscience can condemn me

condemn you indeed cried the young man it was an act to bind my
gratitude for ever an act to win you the admiration and respect of the
whole world which i shall take care to make acquainted with it

nay friend said nathan hastily the less thee says of it the
better if thee is theeself satisfied in thee conscience of its
lawfulness it is enough do thee therefore hold thee tongue on this
and all other matters wherein thee has seen me do evil for truly i am a
man of a peaceful faith and what i have done would be but as a grief and
a scandal to the same

but my friends my poor edith wretch that i am to think of myself or
of others while she is still a captive cried roland again
endeavouring to rise but his limbs yet paralysed from the tightness
with which thongs had been bound around them tottered beneath him and
but for nathan he must have fallen to the earth the emigrants he
continued with incoherent haste you brought them they are pursuing
the savages they have rescued her speak nathan tell me all tell me
that my cousin is free

truly friend muttered nathan his countenance losing much of the
equanimity that had begun to cover it and assuming a darker and
disturbed expression thee doth confuse both theeself and me with many
questions do thee be content for awhile till i chafe thee poor legs
which is like the legs of a dead man and tie up thee wounds when thee
can stand up and walk thee shall know all i have to tell thee both good
and bad it is enough thee is theeself safe

alas i read it all from your looks cried the soldier edith is still
a prisoner and i lie here a miserable crushed worm incapable of
aiding unable even to die for her but the emigrants my friends they
are at least urging the pursuit there is a hope they will retake her

truly friend said nathan thee shall know all if thee will have
patience and hold thee tongue truly the many things thee says doth
perplex me if thee loves thee poor kinswoman and would save her from
cruel bondage and sorrow thee must be quiet till i have put thee again
upon thee legs which is the first thing to be thought about and after
that thee shall have my counsel and help to do what is good and proper
for the maiden's redeeming

with these words nathan again addressed himself to the task of chafing
roland's half-lifeless limbs and binding up the several light though
painful wounds which he had received in the conflict and the soldier
submitting in despair though still entreating nathan to tell him the
worst the latter began at last to relate his story

the bold attempt of nathan to pass the line of besiegers at the ruin it
seemed he bad accomplished without difficulty though not without risk
but this part of the narrative he hurried over as well as his passage of
the river at a solitary and dangerous ford in the wildest recesses of the
forest then striking through the woods and aiming for the distant
station he had arrived within but a few miles of it when it was his
fortune to stumble upon the band of regulators who after their
memorable exploit at the beech-tree had joined the emigrants then on
their march through the woods and convoyed them to the station here
passing the night in mirth and frolic they were startled at an early
hour by the alarming intelligence brought by a volunteer hunter who had
obtained it none could tell how of the presence of the indian army on
the north side and leaving their friends to arm and follow as they
could the visitors immediately mounted their horses to return to bruce's
station and thence to seek the field of battle to these unexpected
friends thus opportunely met in the woods nathan imparted his story
acquainting them in the same words of the presence of enemies so much
nearer at hand than was dreamed and of the unfortunate dilemma of
forrester and his helpless party an account that fired the blood of the
hot youths as effectually as it could have done if expressed in the blast
of a bugle a council of war being called on the spot it was resolved to
gallop at once to the rescue of the travellers without wasting time in
seeking additional assistance from the emigrants or their neighbours of
the station just left which indeed as from nathan's observations it
did not seem that the numbers of the foe could be more than double their
own the heroic youths held to be entirely needless taking nathan up
therefore behind him and bearing him along to point out the position
of the indians the gallant tom bruce followed by his equally gallant
companions dashed through the woods and succeeded by daybreak in
reaching the ruin where as nathan averred so judiciously had they laid
their plans for the attack the indians if still there might have been
surprised entirely worsted and perhaps the half of them cut off upon
the spot which as he rather hastily observed would have been a
great comfort to all concerned but the ruin was deserted besiegers and
besieged had alike vanished as well as the bodies of those assailants
who had fallen in the conflict to find their graves under the ruins
among the rocks or in the whirling eddies of the river the tracks of
the horses being discovered in the ravine and at the water's edge it was
inferred that the whole party too desperate or too wise to yield
themselves prisoners had been driven into the river and there drowned
and this idea inflaming the fury of the kentuckians to the highest pitch
they sought out and easily discovered among the canes the fresh trail of
the indians which they followed resolving to exact the fullest measure
of revenge nathan the man of peace from whom for he had not thought
proper to acquaint the young men with the warlike part he had himself
taken in the battles of the night no further services were expected was
now turned adrift to follow or protect himself as he might and the
young men betook themselves to the pursuit with as much speed as the wild
character of the woods permitted

but it formed no part of honest nathan's designs to be left behind his
feelings were too deeply involved in the fate of the unhappy individuals
whose misadventures he could or thought he could so clearly trace to
his own indiscretion to suffer him to rest while it was yet wrapped in
obscurity he had accepted the charge and responsibility of extricating
them from their perils and his conscience could not be appeased until he
had determined for himself whether in truth they were yet beyond the
reach of assistance making his own observations from the appearance of
the different tracts in the ravine and satisfying himself there was
among them one more christian footprint than could be accounted for he
followed after the young men examining the indian trail in places where
it had not been effaced by the kentuckians until he became convinced
that the fugitives had in some unaccountable way escaped alive from the
river and were still struggling in retreat led by some friendly guide
although closely pursued by the foe this discovery it was also
probable had been made by the kentuckians who had in consequence urged
their horses to the utmost and arriving on the hill where the savages
lay in ambush rushed to the attack and fought and lost the battle
before nathan could reach them he met them indeed retreating in full
rout before the victors many wounded all overcome by panic and none
willing or able to throw any light on the cause of defeat one indeed
checking his horse a moment to bid the man of peace look to himself and
avoid the savages who were still urging the pursuit hastily assured him
that the defeat was all owing to captain ralph's ghost which had
suddenly got among them yelling for vengeance on his executioners for
which reason the conscience-stricken regulator called nathan to witness
his oath which he now made that he would never lynch a man again as
long as he lived and the worthy warrior having added with another
oath which he called a still superior power to attest that he had
seen stackpole fly off with tom brace's soul on the back of a devil in
shape of a big black horse breathing flames and sulphur struck spur
again into his own charger not however until he had first generously
invited nathan to get up be-him to escape the savage pursuers who were
now seen close behind declining the heroic offer and bidding the youth
effect his own escape nathan immediately dived with his inseparable
friend and adviser little peter among the canes where he lay concealed
until well assured the victors had abandoned the pursuit and returned to
the field of battle

then friend said the man of peace who may now be permitted to tell
his own story i took council of peter as to what we should do and
truly it was our opinion we should creep after the murdering shawnee
creatures though verily there was more than shawnees engaged in this
wicked business and see what had become of thee and thee poor women
seeing that we were in a manner as i may say the cause of thee
troubles in carrying thee to the very place where we should not wicked
sinners that we are that is wicked sinner that i am for truly little
peter had nothing to do with that matter having done his best to keep us
from the ruin well friend as soon as we thought it safe we crept to
the spot on the hill-side and safe enough it was the savages having
departed leaving nothing behind them save two young kentuckians and the
coloured person whom they had prevailed over and hewn to pieces with
their hatchets besides four corpses of their own which they had stuck
in a cave where peter snuffed them out truly friend thee don't know
what a nose little peter has well friend i saw then that thee enemies
had divided the main body departing one way over the hill while a
smaller party had crossed the river with a horse and prisoner truly it
was peter's opinion that this prisoner was theeself thee own very self
a thing i could not be so certain of on my part seeing that i had never
tracked thee save by thee horse-prints only and that if we followed
thee we might in some way aid thee to escape thee captivators being so
few in number and so friend we waded the river and followed thee
trail until night came when little peter undertook to nose thee on in
the dark which he did very successfully until we reached the place
where the savages had killed their horse and broken their cask of
liquor when truly the scent of the same did so prevail over peter's
nose that i was in fear he never would smell right again in all his
life which was a great grief to me for truly peter's nose is as i may
say the staff of my life my defence and my succour truly thee don't
know the value of little peter's nose and moreover the savour of
the dead horse did somewhat captivate his attention for truly little
peter is but a dog and he loves horse-flesh well friend this was a
thing that perplexed me until by and by having brought little peter to
reason in the matter of the horse and washed his nose in a brook which
it was my fortune to discover he did bethink him what he was after and
so straightway hunt for the track which being recovered we went on our
way until we lighted right on thee captivators camp-fire and truly we
lighted upon it much sooner than we expected well friend continued
the narrator having crept up as near as i durst i could see how thee
was fixed tied to the poles so thee could not help theeself and the
three savages lying beside thee with their guns in the hollows of their
arms ready to be seized in a moment truly friend the sight threw me
into another perplexity and i lay watching thee and thee cruel
oppressors for more than an hour marvelling in what way i could give
thee help

an hour cried roland a friend lying by me during that hour the most
wretched and distracted of my whole existence had you but cut the rope
and given me the knife to strike a blow for myself

truly said the man of peace i did so desire to do seeing that then
thee might have killed the injuns theeself which would have been more
seemly as being a thing thee conscience would not disapprove of whereas
mine as thee may suppose was quite averse to any such bloody doings on
my own part but truly i durst not adventure upon the thing thee speaks
of for first i saw by the stick on thee breast thee was tied so tight
and fast it would be an hour's work to cut thee loose thee captivators
lying by all the while and secondly i knew by the same reason thee
limbs would be so numb thee could neither stand upon thee legs nor hold
a weapon in thee hand for just as long a time and besides i feared
in case thee should discover there was help nigh at hand thee might cry
out in thee surprise and so alarm these sleeping captivators and so
friend i was in what thee may call a pucker not knowing what to do and
so i lay hard by thee with peter at the back of me watching and
revolving the matter for that whole hour as i told thee when suddenly
down fell a stick into the fire and the same blazing up brightly i saw
two of the savages lying beside thee their heads so close together thee
might have supposed they both grew from the same pair of shoulders and
so nigh to me withal that verily i might have poked them with the
muzzle of my gun truly friend continued nathan looking both
bewildered and animated as he arrived at this period of his story i
can't tell thee how it then happened whether it was a sort of
nervousness in my fingers ends or whether it was all an accident but
truly as it happened my gun went off in my hands as it might be of its
own accord and truly it blew the two evil creatures brains out and
then friend thee sees there was no stopping there being the third of
thee captivators to look after and truly as i had done so much i
thought i might as well do all the killing of three men being but a
little worse than the killing of two and besides the creature would
have hurt thee as thee lay at his mercy and so friend i did verily
spring upon him sinner that i am and strike him a blow with my hatchet
which i had taken from my belt to be ready whereupon he fled and i
after him being in great fear lest if he escaped he should return upon
thee and kill thee before i could get back to cut thee loose and so
friend it happened that that i killed him likewise for which i don't
think thee can in thee heart blame me seeing that it was all over and
over again on thee account and nobody else's truly friend it is
quite amazing the ill things thee has brought me to

had there been twenty of the villains and you had killed them all i
should have held it the noblest and most virtuous act you could have
performed said roland too fiercely agitated by his own contending
passions to note the strange medley of self-accusing and exculpatory
expressions the shame-faced conscience-stricken looks alternating with
gleams of military fire and self-complacency with which the man of peace
recounted his bloody exploit or the adroit attempt with which he
concluded it to shuffle the responsibility of the crime if crime it
were from his own to the young virginian's shoulders at another moment
the latter might have speculated with as much surprise as approval on
the extraordinary metamorphosis of nathan the man of amity and good
will into a slayer of indians double-dyed in gore but at that
juncture he had little inclination to dwell on anything save his own
liberation and the hapless fate of his cousin




chapter xxiii


by dint of chafing and bathing in the spring still foul and red with the
blood of the piankeshaws the limbs of the soldier soon recovered their
strength and he was able to rise to survey the scene of his late
sufferings and liberation and again recur to the harassing subject of
his kinswoman's fate again he beset nathan with questions which soon
recalled the disturbed looks which his deliverer had worn when first
assailed with interrogatories he adjured him to complete the good work
he had so bravely begun by leaving himself to his fate and making his
way to the emigrants or to the nearest inhabited station whence
assistance might be procured to pursue the savages and their captives
before it might be too late lead the party first to the battleground
he said i am now as a child in strength but i can crawl thither to
meet you and once on a horse again be assured no one shall pursue
better or faster than i

if thee thinks of rescuing the maiden said nathan 

i will do so or die exclaimed roland impetuously and would to
heaven i could die twice over so i might snatch her from the murdering
monsters alas had you but followed them instead of these three curs
and done that service to edith you have done to me

truly said nathan thee talks as if ten men were as easily knocked on
the head as ten rabbits but hearken friend and do thee have patience
for a while there is a thing in this matter that perplexes me and
verily there is two or three why did thee desert the ruin and who was
it led thee through the canes let me know what it was that happened
thee for of a truth there is more in this same matter than thee
thinks

thus called upon roland acquainted nathan with the events that had
succeeded his departure from the ruin the appearance of ralph
stackpole and the flight of the party by the river circumstances that
moved the wonder and admiration of nathan and with all the other
occurrences up to the moment of the defeat of the kentuckians and the
division of the plunder among the victorious indians the mention of
these spoils the rifles rolls of cloth beads bells and other gewgaw
trinkets produced an evident impression on nathan's mind which was
greatly increased when roland related the scene betwixt telie doe and her
reprobate father and repeated those expressions which seemed to show
that the attack upon the party was by no means accidental but the result
of a previously formed design of which she was not ignorant

where abel doe is there thee may be sure there is knavery said
nathan demanding earnestly if roland had seen no other white man in the
party

i saw no other he replied but there was a tall man in a blanket
wearing a red turban who looked at me from a distance and i thought he
was a half-breed like doe for so at first i supposed the latter to
be

well friend and he seemed to command the party did he not demanded
nathan with interest

the leader replied roland was a vile grim old rascal that they
called kenauga or kenauga or 

wenonga cried nathan with extraordinary vivacity his whole
countenance in fact lighting up with the animation of intense
interest an old man tall and raw-boned a scar on his nose and
cheek a halt in his gait his left middle-finger short of a joint
and a buzzard's beak and talons tied to his hair it is wenonga the
black-vulture truly little peter thee is but a dolt and a dog that
thee told me nothing about it

the soldier remarked with some surprise the change of nathan's visage
and with still more his angry reproaches of the trusty animal the first
he had heard him utter

and who then is the old black-vulture he asked that he should drive
from your mind even the thought of my poor wretched edith

thee is but a boy in the woods if thee never heard of wenonga the
shawnee replied nathan hastily a man that has left the mark of his
axe on many a ruined cabin along the frontier from the bloody run of
bedford to the kenhawa and the holston he is the chief that boasts he
has no heart and truly he has none being a man that has drunk the
blood of women and children friend thee kinswoman's scalp is already
hanging at his girdle

this horrible announcement uttered with a fierce earnestness that proved
the sincerity of the speaker froze roland's blood in his veins and he
stood speechless and gasping until nathan noting his agitation and
recovering in part from his own ferment of spirits exclaimed even more
hastily than before truly i have told thee what is false thee
kinswoman is safe a prisoner but alive and safe

you have told me she is dead murdered by the foul assassins said
roland and if it be so it avails not to deny it if it be so nathan
he continued with a look of desperation i call heaven and earth to
witness that i will pursue the race of the slayers with thrice the fury
of their own malice never to pause never to rest never to be
satisfied with vengeance while an indian lives with blood to be shed
and i with strength to shed it

thee speaks like a man said nathan grasping the soldier's hand and
fairly crushing it in his gripe that is to say he continued
suddenly letting go his hold and seeming somewhat abashed at the fervour
of his sympathy like a man according to thee own sense of matters and
things but do thee be content thee poor maid is alive and like to be
so and that thee may be assured of it i will soon tell thee the thing
that is on my mind friend do thee answer me a question has thee any
enemy among the injuns that is to say any reprobate white man like
this abel doe who would do thee a wrong

the soldier started with surprise and replied in the negative

has thee no foe then at home whom thee has theeself wronged to that
point that he would willingly league with murdering injuns to take thee
life

i have my enemies doubtless like all other men said roland but
none so basely so improbably malignant

verily then thee makes me in a perplexity as before said nathan
for as truly as thee stands before me so truly did i see that night
when i left thee at the ruins and crawled through the injun lines a
white man that sat at a fire with abel doe the father of the maid telie
apart from the rest and counselled with him how best to sack the cabin
without killing the two women truly friend it was a marvel to myself
there being so many of the murdering villains that they did us so little
mischief but truly it was because of the women and truly there was
foul knavery between these two men for i heard high words and chaffering
between them as concerning a price or reward which abel doe claimed of
the other for the help he was rendering him in snapping thee up with
thee kinswoman truly thee must not think i was mistaken for seeing the
man's red shawl round his head gleaming in the fire and not knowing
there was any one nigh him for abel doe lay flat upon the earth a
wicked thought came into my head for truly said i this man is the
chief and being alone a man might strike him with a knife from behind
the tree he rests against and being killed his people will fly in fear
without any more blood-shed but creeping nearer i saw that he was but
a white man in disguise and so having listened awhile to hear what i
could and hearing what i have told thee i crept away on my journey

the effect of this unexpected revelation upon the young virginian was as
if an adder had suddenly fastened upon his bosom it woke a suspicion
involving indeed an improbability such as his better reason revolted at
but full of pain and terror but wild and incredible as it seemed it
received a kind of confirmation from what nathan added

the rifle-guns the beads and the cloth he said that were
distributed after the battle does thee think they were plunder taken
from the young kentuckians they had vanquished friend these things were
a price with which the white man in the red shawl paid the assassin
villains for taking thee prisoner thee and thee kinswoman his
hirelings were vagabonds of all the neighbouring tribes shawnees
wyandots delawares and piankeshaws as i noted well when i crept among
them and old wenonga is the greatest vagabond of all having long since
been degraded by his tribe for bad luck drunkenness and other follies
natural to an injun my own idea is that that white man thirsted for
thee blood having given thee up to the piankeshaws who thee says had
lost one of their men in the battle for which thee would certainly have
been burned alive at their village but what was his design in
captivating thee poor kinswoman that thee calls edith truly i cannot
divine not knowing much of thee history

you shall hear it said roland with hoarse accents at least so much
of it as may enable you to confirm or disprove your suspicions there is
indeed one man whom i have always esteemed my enemy the enemy also of
edith a knave capable of any extremity yet never could i have dreamed
of a villany so daring so transcendent as this

so saying roland smothering his agitation as he could proceeded to
acquaint his rude friend now necessarily his confidant with so much of
his history as related to braxley his late uncle's confidential agent
and executor a man whom roland's revelations to the gallant and
inquisitive colonel bruce and still more perhaps his conversations
with edith in the wood may have introduced sufficiently to the reader's
acquaintance but of braxley burning with a hatred he no longer chose to
subdue the feeling greatly exasperated also by the suspicion nathan's
hints had infused into his mind he now spoke without restraint and
assuredly if one might have judged by the bitterness of his invectives
the darkness of the colours with which he traced the detested portrait a
baser wretch did not exist on the whole earth yet to a dispassionate and
judicious hearer it might have seemed that there was little in the
evidence to bear out an accusation so sweeping and heavy little indeed
had the soldier to charge against him save his instrumentality in
defeating hopes and expectations which had been too long indulged to be
surrendered without anger and pain that this instrumentality
considering all the circumstances was to be attributed to base and
fraudulent motives it was natural to suspect but the proofs were far
from being satisfactory as they rested chiefly on surmises and
assumptions

it will be recollected that on the death of major forrester braxley had
brought to light a testament of undoubted authenticity but of ancient
date in which the whole estate of the deceased was bequeathed to his own
infant child an unfortunate daughter who however it had never been
doubted had perished many years before among the flames of the cabin of
her foster-mother but who braxley had made oath was to the best of his
knowledge still alive his oath was founded he averred upon the
declaration of a man the husband of the foster-mother a certain
atkinson whom tory principles and practices and perhaps crimes and
outrages for such were charged against him had long since driven to
seek refuge on the frontier but who had privily returned to the major's
house a few weeks before the latter's death and made confession that
the girl was still living but being recognised by an old acquaintance
and dreading the vengeance of his countrymen he had immediately fled
again to the frontier without acquainting any one with the place of the
girl's concealment the story of atkinson's return was confirmed by
the man who had seen and recognised him but who knew nothing of the
cause of his visit and braxley declared he had already taken steps to
ferret him out and had good hopes through his means of recovering the
lost heiress

this story roland affected to believe a vile fabrication the result of a
deep-laid and unfortunately too successful design on braxloy's part to
get possession in the name of an imaginary heiress of the rich estates
of his patron the authenticity of the will which had been framed at a
period when the dissensions between major forrester and his brothers were
at the highest roland did not doubt it was the non-existence of the
individual in whose favour it had been executed a circumstance which he
devoutly believed that gave a fraudulent character to its production he
even accused braxley of having destroyed a second will by which the
former was of course annulled even supposing the heiress were still
living a testament framed a few months before his uncle's death in
which the latter had bequeathed all his possessions to edith the child
of his adoption that such a second will had been framed appeared from
the testator's own admissions at least he had so informed edith
repeating the fact on several different occasions the fact indeed even
braxley did not deny but he averred that the second instrument had been
destroyed by the deceased himself as soon as the confession of atkinson
had acquainted him with the existence of his own unfortunate daughter
this explanation roland rejected entirely insisting that during the
whole period of atkinson's visit and for some weeks before his uncle
had been in a condition of mental imbecility and unconsciousness as
incapable of receiving and understanding the supposed confession as he
was of acting on it the story was only an additional device of braxley
to remove from himself the suspicion of having destroyed the second will

but whatever might have been thought of these imputations it was evident
that the young soldier had another cause for his enmity one indeed
that seemed more operative on his mind and feelings than even the loss of
fortune the robber and plunderer for these were the softest epithets he
had for his rival had added to his crimes the enormity of aspiring to
the affections of his kinswoman whom the absence of roland and the
helpless imbecility of her uncle left exposed to his presumption and his
arts had the maiden smiled upon his suit this indeed might have seemed
a legitimate cause of hatred on the part of roland but edith had
repelled the lover with firmness perhaps even with contempt the
presumption of such a rival roland might perhaps have pardoned but he
saw in the occurrences that followed a bitter and malignant revenge of
the maiden's scorn which none but the basest of villains could have
attempted it was this consideration which gave the sharpest edge to the
young man's hatred and it was his belief that a wretch capable of such a
revenge was willing to add to it any other measure of villany however
daring and fiendish that had turned his thoughts upon braxley when
nathan's words first woke the suspicion of a foeman's design and agency
in the attack on his party how braxley a white man and virginian and
therefore the foe of every western tribe could have so suddenly and
easily thrown himself into the arms of the savages and brought them to
his own plans it might have been difficult to say but anger is
credulous and fury stops not at impossibilities it is braxley
himself he cried at the close of his narration how can it be
doubted he announced publicly his intention to proceed to the frontier
to the kenhawa settlements in search of the fabulous heiress and was
gone before our party had all assembled in fincastle thus then he
veiled his designs thus concealed a meditated villany but his
objects it was not my miserable life he sought what would that avail
him they aimed at my cousin and she is now in his power

truly then said nathan who listened to the story with great
interest and now commented on roland's agitation with equal composure
thee doth make a great fuss for nothing for truly the maid will not
be murdered truly thee has greatly relieved my mind thee should not
think the man being a white man will kill her

kill her cried roland would that twenty bullets had pierced her
heart rather than she should have fallen alive into the hands of
braxley miserable wretch that i am what can i do to save her we will
rescue her nathan we will seek assistance we will pursue the
ravisher it is not yet too late speak to me i shall go distracted
what must we do what can we do

truly said nathan i fear me we can do nothing don't thee look so
frantic friend i don't think thee has good sense thee talks of
assistance what is thee thinking about where would thee seek
assistance has thee forgot the injun army is on the north side and all
the fighting-men of the stations gone to meet them there is nobody to
help thee

but the emigrants my friends they are yet nigh at hand 

truly said nathan thee is mistaken the news of the injuns that
brought friend thomas the younger into the woods did greatly dismay
them as the young men reported and truly they did resolve to delay
their journey no longer but start again before the break of day that
they might the sooner reach the falls and be in safety with their wives
and little ones there is no help for thee thee and me is alone in the
wilderness and there is no friend with us leave wringing thee hands
for it can do thee no good

i am indeed friendless and there is no hope said roland with the
accents of despair while we seek assistance and seek it vainly edith
is lost lost for ever would that we had perished together hapless
edith wretched edith was ever wretch so miserable as i

with such expressions the young man gave a loose to his feelings and
nathan surveyed first with surprise and then with a kind of gloomy
indignation but never as it seemed with anything like sympathy the
extravagance of his grief

thee is but a madman he exclaimed at last and with a tone of severity
that arrested roland's attention does thee curse thee fate and the
providence that is above thee because the maid of thee heart is carried
into captivity unharmed is thee wretched because thee eyes did not see
the injun axe struck into her brain friend thee does not know what such
a sight is but i do yes i have looked upon such a thing and i will
tell thee what it is for it is good thee should know look friend he
continued grasping roland by the arm as if to command his attention
and surveying him with a look both wild and mournful thee sees a man
before thee who was once as young and as happy as thee yea friend
happier for i had many around me to love me the children of my body
the wife of my bosom the mother that gave me birth thee did talk of
such things to me in the wood thee did mention them one and all wife
parent and child such things had i and men spoke well of me but thee
sees what i am there is none of them remaining none only but me
and thee sees me what i am ten years ago i was another man a poor
man friend but one that was happy i dwelt upon the frontiers of
bedford thee may not know the place it is among the mountains of
pennsylvania and far away there was the house that i did build me
and in it there was all that i held dear my gray old mother that's
the way thee did call her when thee spoke of her in the wood the
wife of my bosom and the child of my heart the children
friend for there was five of them sons and daughters together little
innocent babes that had done no wrong and truly i loved them well
well friend the injuns came around us for being bold because of my
faith that made me a man of peace and the friend of all men i sat me
down far on the border but the shawnees came upon me and came as men of
war and their hands were red with the blood of my neighbours and they
raised them against my little infants thee asked me in the wood what i
would do in such case having arms in my hand friend i had arms in my
hand at that moment a gun that had shot me the beasts of the mountain
for food and a knife that had pierced the throats of bears in their
dens i gave them to the shawnee chief that he might know i was a
friend friend if thee asks me now for my children i can tell
thee with my own knife he struck down my eldest boy with my own gun
he slew the mother of my children if thee should live till thee is
gray thee will never see the sight i saw that day when thee has
children that injuns murder as thee stands by a wife that clasps thee
legs in the writhing of death her blood spouting up to thee bosom
where she has slept an old mother calling thee to help her in the
death-struggle then friend then thee may see then thee
may know then thee may feel then thee may call theeself wretched for
thee will be so here was my little boy does thee see there his two
sisters thee understands there thee may think i would have snatched a
weapon to help them then well thee is right but it was too
late all murdered friend all all all cruelly murdered

it is impossible to convey an idea of the extraordinary vehemence the
wild accents the frantic looks with which nathan ended the horrid
story into which he had been betrayed by his repining companion his
struggles to subdue the passions that the dreadful recollections of a
whole family's butchery awoke in his bosom only served to add double
distortion to his changes of countenance which a better index of the
convulsion within than were his broken incoherent half-inarticulate
words assumed at last an appearance so wild so hideous so truly
terrific that roland was seized with horror deeming himself confronted
with a raging maniac he raised his hand to remove that of nathan which
still clutched his arm and clutched it with painful force but while in
the act the fingers relaxed of themselves and nathan dropped suddenly
to the earth as if struck down by a thunderbolt his mouth foaming his
eyes distorted his hands clenched his body convulsed in short
exhibiting every proof of an epileptic fit brought on by overpowering
agitation of mind as he fell little peter sprang to his side and
throwing his paws on his unconscious master's breast stood over him as
if to protect him growling at roland who though greatly shocked at the
catastrophe did not hesitate to offer such relief as was in his power
disregarding the menace of the dog which seemed at last to understand
the purpose was friendly he raised nathan's head upon his knee loosened
the neckcloth that bound his throat and sprinkled his face with water
from the spring while thus engaged the cap of the sufferer fell from
his head and roland saw that nathan carried with him a better cause for
the affliction than could be referred to any mere temporary emotion
however overwhelming to the mind a horrible scar disfigured the top of
his head which seemed to have been many years before crushed by the
blows of a heavy weapon and it was equally manifest that the savage
scalping-knife had done its work on the mangled head

the soldier had heard that injuries to the head often resulted in
insanity of some species or other he could now speculate on better
grounds and with better reason upon some of those singular points of
character which seemed to distinguish the houseless nathan from the rest
of his fellow-men




chapter xxiv


the convulsion was but momentary and departed with almost the same
suddenness that marked its accession nathan started half up looked
wildly around him surveying the bodies of the two piankeshaws and the
visage of the sympathising soldier then snatching up and replacing his
hat with one hand and grasping roland's with the other he exclaimed as
if wholly unconscious of what had happened him 

thee has heard it and thee knows it thee knows what the shawnees have
done to me they have killed them all all that was of my blood had they
done so by thee friend he demanded with eagerness had they done so
by thee what would thee have done to them

declared eternal war upon them and their accursed race cried roland
greatly excited by the story i would have sworn undying vengeance and
i would have sought it ay sought it without ceasing day and night
summer and winter on the frontier and in their own lands and villages i
would have pursued the wretches and pursued them to the death

thee is right cried nathan wringing the hand he still held and
speaking with a grin of hideous approval by night and by day in
summer and in winter in the wood and in the wigwam thee would seek for
their blood and thee would shed it thee would think of thee wife and
thee little babes and thee heart would be as stone and fire within
thee thee would kill friend thee would kill thee would kill and the
monosyllable was breathed over and over again with a ferocity of emphasis
that showed how deep and vindictive was the passion in the speaker's
mind then with a transition of feeling as unexpected as it was abrupt
he added still wringing roland's hand as if he had found in him a
sympathizing friend whose further kindness he was resolved to deserve
and to repay thee is right i have thought about what thee has
said thee shall have assistance thee is a brave man and thee has not
mocked at me because of my faith thee enemies shall be pursued and the
maid thee loves shall be restored to thee arms

alas said roland almost fearing from the impetuosity as well as
confidence with which nathan now spoke that his wits were in a state of
distraction where shall we look for help since there are none but
ourselves in this desert of whom to ask it

from our two selves it must come and from none others said nathan
briskly we will follow the murdering thieves that have robbed thee of
thee treasure and we will recover the maid edith from their hands

what unaided alone

alone friend with little peter to be our guide and providence our
hope and our stay thee is a man of courage and thee heart will not fail
thee even if thee should find theeself led into the heart of the injun
nation i have thought of this thing friend and i perceive there is
good hope we shall prevail and prevail better than if we had an hundred
men to follow at our backs unless we had them ready with us to march
this very day does thee hear me friend the shawnee fighting-men are
now in kentucky assembled in a great army scalping and murdering as
they come their villages are left to be guarded by women and children
and old men no longer fit for war thee understands me if thee waits
till thee collects friends thee will have to cut thee way with them
through fighting-men returned to their villages before thee if thee
proceeds as thee is thee has nothing to fear that thee cannot guard
against with thee own cunning nothing to oppose thee that thee cannot
conquer with thee own strength and courage

and how cried roland too ardent of temper too ready to snatch at any
hope to refuse his approbation to the enterprise though its
difficulties immediately crowded before his eyes how shall we follow a
trail so long and cold where shall we find arms where 

friend said nathan interrupting him thee speaks without thought
for arms and ammunition thee has thee choice among the spoils of these
dead villains thee captivators for the trail thee need think nothing
of that lost or found thee may be certain it leads to the old vulture's
town on the miami there thee will find thee cousin and thither i can
lead thee

let us go then in heaven's name cried roland and without further
delay every moment is precious

thee speaks the truth and if thee feels thee limbs strong enough 

they are nerved by hope and while that remains i will neither faint
nor falter edith rescued and one blow one good blow struck at the
villain that wrongs her then let them fail me if heaven wills it and
fail me for ever

few more words were required to confirm roland's approval of the project
so boldly and indeed as it seemed so judiciously advised by his
companion to seek assistance was as nathan had justly said to cast
away the opportunity which the absence of the warriors from their towns
opened to his hopes an opportunity in which craft and stratagem might
well obtain the success not to be won at a later period and after the
return of the marauders even by a band of armed men

turning to the corses that still lay on the couch of leaves where they
expired nathan began with little ceremony and none of the compunction
that might have been expected to rob them of their knives guns and
ammunition with which roland selecting weapons to his liking was soon
well armed the pouches of the warriors containing strips of dried
venison and stores of parched corn nathan appropriated in the same way
taking care from the superabundance to reward the services of little
peter who received with modest gratitude but despatched with energetic
haste the meal which his appearance as well as his appetite showed was
not a blessing of every-day occurrence

these preparations concluded nathan signified his readiness to conduct
the young soldier on his way but as he stepped to the edge of the little
glade and turned to take a last look of the dead indians the victims of
his own warlike hand a change came over his appearance the bold and
manly look which he had for a moment assumed was exchanged for an air of
embarrassment and almost timidity such as marked his visage of old at
the station he hesitated paused looked at the bodies again and then
at roland and finally muttered aloud though with doubting accents 

thee is a man of war friend a man of war and a soldier and thee
fights injuns even as the young men of kentucky fights them and thee may
think it but right and proper as they do in such case made and
provided to take the scalps off the heads of these same dead vagabonds
truly friend if thee is of that mind truly i won't oppose thee

their scalps i scalp them cried boland with a soldier's disgust
i am no butcher i leave them to the bears and wolves which the
villains in their natures so strongly resembled i will kill indians
wherever i can but no scalping nathan no scalping from me

truly it is just as thee thinks proper nathan mumbled out and
without further remark he strode into the wood following the path which
the piankeshaws had travelled the preceding evening until with roland
he reached the spot where had happened the catastrophe of the keg a
place but a few hundred paces distant from the glade along the whole way
he had betrayed symptoms of dissatisfaction and uneasiness for which
roland could not account and now having arrived at this spot he came
to a pause and revealed the source of his trouble

do thee sit down here and rest thee weary limbs friend he said
truly i have left two injun guns lying open to the day and truly it
doth afflict me to think so for if other injuns should chance upon this
place they must needs find them and perhaps use them in killing poor
white persons truly i will hide them in a hollow tree and return to
thee in a minute

with these words he immediately retraced his path leaving roland to
wonder and speculate at leisure over the singular intermixture of humane
and ferocious elements of which his character seemed compounded but the
speculation was not long indulged in a few moments nathan's footsteps
were heard ringing along the arched path and he again made his
appearance but looking a new man his gait was fierce and confident his
countenance bold and expressive of satisfaction things should never be
done by halves he muttered but more as if speaking to his own thoughts
than to his companion

with this brief apology he again led the way through the forest but not
until roland had observed or thought he observed a drop of blood fall
from his tattered knife-sheath to the earth but the suspicion that this
little incident coupled with the change in nathan's deportment awoke in
roland's mind he had no leisure to pursue nathan now striding forward
at a pace which soon brought his companion to a painful sense of his own
enfeebled and suffering condition

thee must neither faint nor flag said nathan thee enemies have the
start of thee by a whole day and they have thee horses also truly it
is my fear that with these horses and thee kinswoman abel doe and the
man braxley thee foeman may push on for the injun town with what speed
they can leaving their injun thieves the footmen to follow on as they
may or perhaps to strike through the woods for the north side to join
the ramping villains that are there burning and murdering thee must keep
up thee strength till night-fall when thee shall have good meat to eat
and a long sleep to refresh thee and truly on the morrow thee will be
very well though a little feverish

with such encouragement repeated time by time as seemed to him needful
nathan continued to lead through wood and brake with a vigour and
freshness of step that moved the wonder and envy of roland who knew
that like himself nathan had been without sleep for two nights in
succession besides having employed the intervening days in the most
laborious exertions such an example of untiring energy and zeal and the
reflection that they were displayed in his cause in the cause of his
hapless edith supported roland's own flagging steps and he followed
without murmuring until the close of the day found him again on the
banks of the river that had witnessed so many of his sufferings he had
been long aware that nathan had deserted the path of the piankeshaws but
not doubting his superior knowledge of the woods had led him into a
shorter path he was both surprised and concerned when striking the
river at last he found himself in a place entirely unknown and
apparently many miles below the scene of conflict of the previous day

he that would follow upon the heels of wenonga said nathan must walk
wide of his footsteps for fear lest he should suddenly tread on the old
reptile's tail thee don't know the craft of an old injun that expects to
be followed as truly it is like the black-vulture may expect it now
do thee be content friend there is more paths to wenonah's town than
them that wenonga follows and truly we may gain something by taking
the shortest

thus satisfying roland he had good reasons for choosing his own
path nathan led the way to the verge of the river where leaving the
broad buffalo-trace by which he descended the banks and diving through
canes and rocks until he had left the ford to which the path led a
quarter-mile or more behind he stopped at last under a grim cliff
overgrown with trees and brambles where a cove or hollow in the rock of
a peculiarly wild solitary and defensible character invited him to
take up quarters for the night

nor did this seem the first time wandering nathan had sought shelter in
the place which possessed an additional advantage in a little spring
that trickled from the rock and collected its limpid stores in a rocky
basin hard by there were divers half-burned brands lying on its sandy
floor and a bed of fern and cane-leaves not yet dispersed by the winds
that had evidently been once pressed by a human form

thee will never see a true man of the woods said nathan with much
apparent self-approval build his camp-fire on a roadside like that
unlucky foolish man ralph stackpole by name that ferried thee down the
river truly it was a marvel he did not drown thee all as well as the
poor man dodge here friend we can sleep in peace and truly sleep
will be good for thee and me and little peter

with these words nathan set about collecting dried logs and branches
which former floods had strown in great abundance along the rocks and
dragging them into the cove he soon set them in a cheerful blaze he
then drew forth his stores of provender the corn and dried meat he had
taken from the piankeshaws pouches the latter of which after a
preliminary sop or two in the spring for the double purpose of washing
off the grains of gunpowder tobacco and what not the usual scrapings
of an indian's pocket and of restoring its long vanished juices he
spitted on twigs of cane and roasted with exceeding patience and
solicitude at the fire to these dainty viands he added certain cakes and
lumps of some nondescript substance as roland supposed it until assured
by nathan it was good maple-sugar and of his own making truly said
he it might have been better had it been better made but truly
friend i am as thee may see a man that lives in the woods having
neither cabin nor wigwam the injuns having burned down the same so that
it is tedious to rebuild them and having neither pots nor pans the same
having been all stolen i did make my sugar in the wooden troughs
boiling it down with hot stones and truly friend it doth serve the
purpose of salt and is good against hunger in long journeys

there was little in the dishes set off by nathan's cookery or in his
own feelings to dispose the sick and weary soldier to eat and having
swallowed but a few mouthfuls he threw himself upon the bed of leaves
hoping to find that refreshment in slumber which neither food nor the
conversation of his companion could supply his body being as much worn
and exhausted as his mind the latter was not doomed to be long tossed by
grief and fear and before the last hues of sunset had faded in the west
slumber had swept from his bosom the consciousness of his own sufferings
with even the memory of his edith

in the meanwhile nathan had gathered more wood to supply the fire during
the night and added a new stock of cane-leaves for his own bed having
made which to his liking disposed his arms where they could be seized at
a moment's warning and above all accommodated little peter with a
couch at his feet he also threw himself at length and was soon sound
asleep




chapter xxv


the morning-star peeping into the hollow den of the wanderers was yet
bright on the horizon when roland was roused from his slumbers by
nathan who had already risen and prepared a hasty meal resembling in all
respects that of the preceding evening to this the soldier did better
justice than to the other for although feeling sore and stiff in every
limb he experienced none of the feverish consequences nathan had
predicted from his wounds and his mind invigorated by so many hours of
rest was more tranquil and cheerful the confidence nathan seemed to
feel in the reasonableness and practicability of their enterprise
however wild and daring it might have seemed to others was his own
best assurance of its success and hope thus enkindled and growing with
his growing strength it required no laborious effort to summon the
spirits necessary to sustain him during the coming trials

this change for the better was not unnoticed by nathan who exhorted him
to eat freely as a necessary prelude to the labours of the day and the
rude meal being quickly and satisfactorily despatched and little peter
receiving his due share the companions without further delay seized
their arms and recommenced their journey crossing the river at the
buffalo-ford above and exchanging the road to which it led for wilder
and lonelier paths traced by smaller animals they made their way through
the forest travelling with considerable speed which was increased as
the warmth of exercise gradually restored their native suppleness to the
soldier's limbs

and now it was that as the opening of a glorious dawn flinging
sunshine and life over the whole wilderness infused still brighter hopes
into his spirit he began to divide his thoughts between his kinswoman
and his guide bestowing more upon the latter than he had previously
found time or inclination to do his strange appearance his stranger
character his sudden metamorphosis from a timid and somewhat
over-conscientious professor of the doctrines of peace and good-will
into a highly energetic and unremorseful not to say valiant man of war
were all subjects to provoke the soldier's curiosity which was still
further increased when he pondered over the dismal story nathan had so
imperfectly told him on the past day of those dreadful calamities which
in nathan's own language had made him what he was a houseless
wanderer of the wilderness the virginian would gladly have known more
but his first allusion to the subject produced such evident disorder in
nathan's mind as if the recollection were too harrowing to be borne
that the young man immediately repressed his inquiries and diverted his
guide's thoughts into another channel his imagination supplied the
imperfect links in the story he could well believe that the same hands
which had shed the blood of every member of the poor borderer's family
might have struck the hatchet into the head of the resisting husband and
father and that the effects of that blow with the desolation of heart
and fortune which the heavier ones struck at the same time had
entailed might have driven him to the woods an idle and perhaps
aimless wanderer

how far these causes might have operated in leading nathan into those
late acts of blood which were at such variance with his faith and
professions it remained also for roland to imagine and in truth he
imagined they had operated deeply and far though nothing in nathan's own
admissions could be found to sanction any belief save that they were the
results partly of accident and partly of sudden and irresistible
impulse

at all events it was plain that his warlike feats however they might
at first have shocked his sense of propriety now sat but lightly on
his conscience and indeed since his confession at the piankeshaw
camp he ceased even to talk of them perhaps resting upon that as an
all-sufficient explanation and apology it is certain from that moment he
bore himself more freely and boldly entered no protest whatever against
being called on to do his share of such fighting as might occur a
stipulation made with such anxious forethought when he first consented
to accompany the lost travellers nor betrayed any tenderness of
invective against the indians whom having first spoken of them only as
evil-minded poor shawnee creatures he now designated conformably
to established usage among his neighbours of the stations as thieves
and dogs bloody villains and rapscallions all which expressions he
bestowed with as much ease and emphasis as if he had been accustomed to
use them all his life

with this singular friend and companion roland pursued his way through
the wilderness committing life and the hopes that were dearer than
life to his sole guidance and protection nor did anything happen to
shake his faith in either the zeal or ability of nathan to conduct to a
prosperous issue the cause he had so freely and disinterestedly espoused

as they thridded the lonely forest-paths together nathan explained at
length the circumstances upon which he founded his hopes of success in
their project and in doing so convinced the soldier not only that his
sagacity was equal to the enterprise but that his acquaintance with the
wilderness was by no means confined to the region south of the ohio the
northern countries then wholly in the possession of the indian tribes
appearing to be just as well known to him the miami country in
particular in which lay the village of the black-vulture how this
knowledge had been obtained was not so evident for although he averred
he hunted the deer or trapped the beaver on either side the river as
appeared to him most agreeable it was hardly to be supposed he could
carry on such operations in the heart of the indian nation but it was
enough for roland that the knowledge so essential to his own present
plans was really possessed by his conductor and he cared not to
question how it had been arrived at it was an augury of success of
which he felt the full influence

the evening of that day found him upon the banks of the kentucky the
wild and beautiful river from which the wilderness around derived its
name and the next morning crossing it on a raft of logs speedily
constructed by nathan he trod upon the soil of the north side famous
even then for its beauty and for the deeds of bloodshed almost daily
enacted among its scattered settlements and destined unhappily to be
rendered still more famous for a tragedy which that very day witnessed
far off among the barren ridges of the licking where sixty of the
district's best and bravest sons fell the victims less of indian subtlety
than of their own unparalleled rashness but of that bloody field the
travellers were to hear thereafter the vultures were winging their
flight towards the fatal scene but they alone could snuff in that
silent desert the scent of the battle that vexed it

sleeping that night in the woods the next day being the fourth since
they left the piankeshaw camp beheld the travellers upon the banks of
the ohio which seen for the first time in the glory of summer its
crystal waters wheeling placidly along amid hills and forests ever
reflected in the bright mirror below and with the air of virgin solitude
which through so many leagues of its course it still presents never
fails to fill the beholder's mind with an enchanting sense of its
loveliness

here a raft was again constructed and the adventurers pushing boldly
across were soon upon the opposite shore this feat accomplished nathan
took the precaution to launch their frail float adrift in the current
that no tell-tale memorial of a white man's visit should remain to be
read by returning warriors the next moment ascending the bank of the
river he plunged with his companion into the midst of brake and forest
neither of them then dreaming that upon the very spot where they toiled
through the tangled labyrinths a few years should behold the magic
spectacle of a fair city the queen of the west uprisen with the
suddenness and almost the splendour of the fata-morgana though
happily doomed to no such evanescent existence then handling their
arms like men who felt they were in a foe-man's country and knew that
every further step was to be taken in peril they resumed their journey
travelling with such speed and vigour for roland's strength had returned
apace that at the close of the day they were according to nathan's
account scarce twenty miles distant from the black-vulture's village
which they might easily reach the following day on the following day
accordingly they resumed their march avoiding all paths and stealing
through the most unfrequented depths of the woods proceeding with a
caution which was every moment becoming more obviously necessary to the
success of their enterprise

up to this period their journey had presented nothing of interest being
a mere succession of toil privation and occasional suffering naturally
enough to be expected in such an undertaking but it was now about to be
varied by an adventure of no little interest in itself and in its
consequences destined to exercise a powerful influence on the prospects
of the travellers

laying their plans so as to reach the indian village only about
nightfall and travelling but slowly and with great circumspection
they had not at mid-day accomplished much more than half the distance
when they came to a halt in a little dell extremely wild and
sequestered where nathan proposed to rest a few hours and recruit their
strength with a warm dinner a luxury they had not enjoyed for the last
two days during which they had subsisted upon the corn and dried meat
from the indian wallets accident had a few moments before provided
them materials for a more palatable meal they had stumbled upon a deer
that had just fallen under the attack of a catamount which easily
driven from its yet warm and palpitating quarry surrendered the feast to
its unwelcome visitors an inspection of the carcass showed that the
animal had been first struck by the bullet of some wandering indian
hunter a discovery that somewhat concerned nathan until after a more
careful examination of the wound which seemed neither severe nor mortal
he was convinced the poor beast had run many long miles until in fact
wholly exhausted before the panther had finished the work of the
huntsman this circumstance removing his uneasiness he helped himself to
the choicest portion of the animal amputated a hind leg without stopping
to flay it and clapping this upon his shoulder in a very business-like
way left the remainder of the carcass to be despatched by the wild-cat
at her leisure

the little dell in which nathan proposed to cook and enjoy his savoury
treasure at ease and in safety was enclosed by hills of which the one
by which they descended into it fell down in a rolling slope densely
covered with trees while the other rocky barren and almost naked
rose precipitously up a grim picture of solitude and desolation a
scanty brook oozing along through the swampy bottom of the hollow and
supplied by a spring near its head at which the two friends halted to
prepare their meal ran meandering away among alders and other swampy
plants to find exit into a larger vale that opened below though hidden
from the travellers by the winding of the rocky ridge before them

in this lonely den nathan and roland began straightway to disencumber
themselves of arms and provisions seeming well satisfied with its
convenience but not so little peter who having faithfully accompanied
them so far now following numbly at his master's heels and now in
periods of alarm or doubt taking post in front the leader of the party
uplifted his nose and fell to snuffing about him in a way that soon
attracted his master's notice smelling first around the spring and then
giving a look both up and down the glen as if to satisfy himself there
was nothing wrong in either of those quarters he finally began to ascend
the rocky ridge snuffing as he went and ever and anon looking back to
his master and soliciting his attention by a wag of his tail

truly thee did once wag to me in vain said nathan snatching up his
gun and looking volumes of sagacious response at his brute ally but
thee won't catch me napping again though truly what thee can smell
here where is neither track of man nor print of beast truly peter i
have no idea

with these words he crept up the hill himself following in little
peter's wake and roland who also grasped his rifle as nathan had done
though without perhaps attaching the same importance to peter's note of
warning thought fit to imitate his example

in this manner cautiously crawling up the two friends reached the crest
of the hill and peering over a precipice of fifty or more feet sheer
descent with which it suddenly dipped into a wild but beautiful little
valley below beheld a scene that besides startling them somewhat out of
their tranquillity caused both to bless their good fortune they had not
neglected the warning of their brute confederate

the vale below like that they had left opened into a wider bottom-land
the bed of a creek which they could see shining among the trees that
overshadowed the rich alluvion and into this poured a rivulet that
chattered along through the glen at their feet in which it had its
sources the hill on the other side of the little vale which was of an
oval figure narrowest at its outlet was rough and precipitous like
that on which they lay but the two uniting above bounded the head of
the vale with a long bushy sweeping slope a fragment of a natural
amphitheatre which was evidently of an easy ascent though abrupt and
steep the valley thus circumscribed though broken and here and there
deeply furrowed by the water-course was nearly destitute of trees
except at its head where a few young beeches flung their silver boughs
and rich green foliage abroad over the grassy knolls and patches of
papaws drooped their loose leaves and swelling fruit over the stream it
was in this part of the valley at the distance of three or four hundred
paces from them that the eyes of the two adventurers directed by the
sound of voices which they had heard the instant they reached the crest
of the ridge fell first upon the smoke of a huge fire curling merrily
up into the air and then upon the bodies of no less than five indian
warriors all zealously and uproariously engaged in an amusement highly
characteristic of their race there was among them a white man an
unfortunate prisoner as was seen at a glance whom they had bound by the
legs to a tree around which the savages danced and leaped yelling now
with rage now in merriment but all the while belabouring the poor
wretch with rods and switches which at every turn round the tree they
laid about his head and shoulders with uncommon energy and zest this was
a species of diversion better relished as it seemed by the captors than
their captive who infuriated by his pangs and perhaps desiring in the
desperation of the moment to provoke them to end his sufferings with the
hatchet retaliated with his fists which were at liberty striking
fiercely at every opportunity and once with such effect as to tumble one
of the tormentors to the earth a catastrophe however that the others
rewarded with roars of approving laughter though without for a moment
intermitting their own cruelties

this spectacle it may be well supposed produced a strong effect upon
the minds of the travellers who not without alarm on their own account
at the discovery of such dangerous neighbours could not view without
emotion a fellow white man and countryman helpless in their hands and
enduring tortures perhaps preliminary to the more dreadful one of the
stake they looked one another in the face the virginian's eyes sparkled
with a meaning which nathan could not misunderstand and clutching his
rifle tighter in his hands and eyeing the young man with an ominous
stare he muttered speak friend thee is a man and a soldier what
does thee think in the case made and provided

we are but two men and they five replied roland firmly though in
the lowest voice and then repeated in the same energetic whisper we
are but two men nathan but there is no kinswoman now to unman me

nathan took another peep at the savages before speaking then looking
upon the young man with an uneasy countenance he said we are but two
men as thee says and they five and truly to do what thee thinks of
in open day is a thing not to be thought on by men that have soft places
in their bosoms nevertheless i think according to thee own opinion we
being strong men that have the wind of the villains and a good cause to
help us truly we might snap the poor man they have captivated out of
their hands with considerable much damage to them besides the murdering
rapscallions but friend he added seeing roland give way to his
eagerness thee spoke of the fair maid thee cousin if thee fights
this battle truly thee may never see her more

if i fall said roland but he was interrupted by nathan

it is not that thee is to think of truly friend thee may fight
these savages and thee may vanquish them but unless thee believes in
thee conscience thee can kill them every one truly friend thee can
hardly expect it

and why should we it is enough if we can rescue the prisoner

friend thee is mistaken if thee attacks the villains and but one of
them escapes alive to the village sounding the alarm thee will never
enter the same in search of the maid thee kinswoman thee sees the case
thee must choose between the captive there and thee cousin

this was a view of the case and as roland felt a just one well
calculated to stagger his resolutions if not entirely to abate his
sympathy for the unknown sufferer as his hopes of success in the
enterprise for which he had already dared and endured so much evidently
depended upon his ability to approach the indian village without
awakening suspicion it was undeniable that an attack upon the party in
the vale unless resulting in its complete destruction must cause to be
borne to the black-vulture's town and on the wings of the wind the
alarm of white men in the woods and thus not only cut him off from it
but actually bring upon himself all the fighting men who might be
remaining in the village to attack the party with the expectation of
wholly destroying it was or seemed to be an absurdity but to desert a
wretched prisoner whom he had it perhaps in his power to rescue from
captivity and from a fate still more dreadful was a dereliction of
duty of honour of common humanity of which he could scarce persuade
himself to be guilty he cast his eyes up the glen and once more looked
upon the captive who had sunk to the ground as if from exhaustion and
whom the savages after beating him awhile longer as if to force him
again on his feet that they might still enjoy their amusement now fell
to securing with thongs as roland looked he remembered his own night of
captivity and hesitated no longer turning to nathan who had been
earnestly reading the struggles of his mind as revealed in his face he
said and with unfaltering resolution you say we can rescue that
man i was a prisoner like him bound too a helpless hopeless
captive three indians to guard me and but one friend to look upon me
yet did not that friend abandon me to my fate god will protect my poor
cousin we must rescue him

thee is a man every inch of thee said nathan with a look of uncommon
satisfaction and fire thee shall have thee will in the matter of these
murdering shawnee dogs and it may be it will be none the worse for
thee kinswoman

with that he motioned roland to creep with him beyond the crest of the
hill where they straightway held a hurried consultation of war to
determine upon the plan of proceedings in the prosecution of an adventure
so wild and perilous

the soldier burning with fierce ardour proposed that they should take
post respectively the one at the head the other at the outlet of the
vale and creeping as nigh the enemy as they could deliver their fire
and then rushing on before the savages could recover from their
surprise do their best to finish the affair with their hatchets a
plan which as he justly said offered the only prospect of cutting off
the retreat of those who might survive the fire but nathan had already
schemed the matter otherwise he had remarked the impossibility of
approaching the enemy from below the valley offering no concealment
which would make an advance in that quarter practicable whereas the
bushes on the slope where the two walls of the glen united afforded the
most inviting opportunity to creep on the foe without fear of detection
truly said he we will get us as nigh the assassin thieves as we can
and truly it may be our luck each of us to get a brace of them in
range together and so bang them beautiful an idea that was manifestly
highly agreeable to his imagination from which he seemed to have utterly
banished all those disgusts and gaingivings on the subject of fighting
which had formerly afflicted it or perhaps if we can do nothing
better he continued we may catch the vagabonds wandering from their
guns to pick up sticks for their fire in which case friend truly it
may be our luck to help them to a second volley out of their own pieces
or if the worst must come truly then i do know of a device that may
help the villains into our hands even to their own undoing

with these words having first examined his own and roland's arms to see
that all were in proper battle condition and then directed little peter
to ensconce in a bush wherein little peter straightway bestowed himself
tiger nathan with an alacrity of motion and ardour of look that
indicated anything rather than distaste to the murderous work in hand
led the way along the ridge until he had reached the place where it
dipped down to the valley covered with the bushes through which he
expected to advance to a desirable position undiscovered

but a better auxiliary even than the bushes was soon discovered by the
two friends a deep gully washed in the side of the hill by the rains
was here found running obliquely from its top to the bottom affording a
covered way by which as they saw at a glance they could approach
within twenty or thirty yards of the foe entirely unseen and to add to
its advantages it was the bed of a little water-course whose murmurs
as it leaped from rock to rock assured them they could as certainly
approach unheard

truly muttered nathan with a grim chuckle as he looked first at
the friendly ravine and then at the savages below the philistine
rascals is in our hands and we will smite them hip and thigh

with this inspiring assurance he crept into the ravine and roland
following they were soon in possession of a post commanding not only
the spot occupied by the enemy but the whole valley

peeping through the fringe of shrubs that rose a verdant parapet on the
brink of the gully they looked down upon the savage party now less than
forty paces from the muzzle of their guns and wholly unaware of the fate
preparing for them the scene of diversion and torment was over the
prisoner a man of powerful frame but squallid appearance whose hat a
thing of shreds and patches adorned the shorn pate of one of the
indians while his coat equally rusty and tattered hung from the
shoulders of a second lay bound under a tree but so nigh that they
could mark the laborious heavings of his chest two of the indians sat
near him on the grass keeping watch their hatchets in their hands their
guns resting within reach against the trunk of a tree overthrown by some
hurricane of former years and now mouldering away a third was engaged
with his tomahawk lopping away the few dry boughs that remained on the
trunk squatting at the fire which the third was thus labouring to
replenish with fuel were the two remaining savages who holding their
rifles in their hands divided their attention betwixt a shoulder of
venison roasting on a stick in the fire and the captive whom they
seemed to regard as destined to be sooner or later disposed of in a
similar manner

the position of the parties precluded the hope nathan had ventured to
entertain of getting them in a cluster and so doing double execution
with each bullet but the disappointment neither chilled his ardour nor
embarrassed his plans his scheme of attack had been framed to embrace
all contingences and he wasted no further time in deliberation a
few whispered words conveyed his last instructions to the soldier who
reflecting that he was fighting in the cause of humanity remembering his
own heavy wrongs and marking the fiery eagerness that flamed from
nathan's visage banished from his mind whatever disinclination he might
have felt at beginning the fray in a mode so seemingly treacherous and
ignoble he laid his axe on the brink of the gully at his side together
with his foraging cap and then thrusting his rifle through the bushes
took aim at one of the savages at the fire nathan directing his piece
against the other both of them presented the fairest marks as they sat
wholly unconscious of their danger enjoying in imagination the tortures
yet to be inflicted on the prisoner but a noise in the gully the
falling of a stone loosened by the soldier's foot or a louder than usual
plash of water suddenly roused them from their dreams they started up
and turned their eyes towards the hill now friend whispered
nathan if thee misses thee loses thee maiden and thee life into the
bargain is thee ready

ready was the reply

right then through the dog's brain fire

the crash of the pieces and the fall of the two victims both marked by
a fatal aim and both pierced through the brain were the first
announcement of peril to their companions who springing up with yells
of fear and astonishment and snatching at their arms looked wildly
around them for the unseen foe the prisoner also astounded out of his
despair raised his head from the grass and glared around the wreaths
of smoke curling over the bushes on the hill-side betrayed the lurking
place of the assailants and savages and prisoner turning together they
all beheld at once the spectacle of two human heads or to speak more
correctly two human caps for the heads were far below them rising in
the smoke and peering over the bushes as if to mark the result of the
volley loud furious and exulting were the screams of the indians as
with the speed of thought seduced by a stratagem often practised among
the wild heroes of the border they raised and discharged their pieces
against the imaginary foes so incautiously exposed to their vengeance
the caps fell and with them the rifles that had been employed to raise
them and the voice of nathan thundered through the glen as he grasped
his tomahawk and sprang from the ditch now friend up with thee axe
and do thee duty

with these words the two assailants at once leaped into view and with a
bold hurrah and bolder hearts rushed towards the fire where lay the
undischarged rifles of their first victims the savages yelled also in
reply and two of them bounded forward to dispute the prize the third
staggered into momentary inaction by the suddenness and amazement of the
attack rushed forward but a step but a whoop of exultation was on his
lips as he raised the rifle which he had not yet discharged full
against the breast of tiger nathan but his triumph was short-lived the
blow so fatal as it must have proved to the life of nathan was averted
by an unexpected incident the prisoner near whom he stood putting
all his vigour into one tremendous effort burst his bonds and with a
yell ten times louder and fiercer than had yet been uttered added
himself to the combatants with a furious cry of encouragement to his
rescuers hurrah for kentucky give it to em good he threw himself
upon the savage beat the gun from his hands and grasping him in his
brawny arms hurled him to the earth where rolling over and over in
mortal struggle growling and whooping and rending one another like wild
beasts the two still locked in furious embrace suddenly tumbled down
the banks of the brook there high and steep and were immediately lost
to sight

before this catastrophe occurred the other indians and the assailants
met at the fire and each singling out his opponent and thinking no more
of the rifles they met as men whose only business was to kill or to die
with his axe flourished over his head nathan rushed against the tallest
and foremost enemy who as he advanced swung his tomahawk in the act
of throwing it their weapons parted from their hands at the same moment
and with perhaps equal accuracy of aim but meeting with a crash in the
air they fell together to the earth doing no harm to either the indian
stooped to recover his weapon but it was too late the hand of nathan
was already upon his shoulder a single effort of his vast strength
sufficed to stretch the savage at his feet and holding him down with
knee and hand nathan snatched up the nearest axe if the life of thee
tribe was in thee bosom he cried with a look of unrelenting fury of
hatred deep and ineffaceable thee should die the dog's death as thee
does and with a blow furiously struck and thrice repeated he
despatched the struggling savage as he lay

he rose brandishing the bloody hatchet and looked for his companion he
found him upon the earth lying upon the breast of his antagonist whom
it had been his good fortune to over-master both had thrown their
hatchets and both without effect roland because skill was wanting and
the shawnee because in the act of throwing he had stumbled over the
body of one of his comrades so as to disorder his aim and even to
deprive him of his footing before he could recover himself roland
imitated nathan's example and threw himself upon the unlucky indian a
youth as it appeared whose strength perhaps at no moment equal to his
own had been reduced by recent wounds and found that he had him
entirely at his mercy this circumstance and the knowledge that the
other indians were now overpowered softened the soldier's wrath and
when nathan rushing to assist him cried aloud to him to move aside
that he might knock the assassin knave's brains out roland replied by
begging nathan to spare his life i have disarmed him he cried he
resists no more don't kill him

to the last man of his tribe cried nathan with unexampled ferocity
and without another word drove the hatchet into the wretch's brain

the victors now leaping to their feet looked round for the fifth savage
and the prisoner and directed by a horrible din under the bank of the
stream which was resounding with curses groans heavy blows and the
plashing of water ran to the spot where the last incident of battle was
revealed to them in a spectacle as novel as it was shocking the indian
lay on his back suffocating in mire and water while astride his body sat
the late prisoner covered from head to foot with mud and gore furiously
plying his fists for he had no other weapons about the head and face of
his foe his blows falling like sledge-hammers or battering-rams with
such strength and fury that it seemed impossible any one of them could
fail to crush the skull to atoms and all the while garnishing them with
a running accompaniment of oaths and maledictions little less emphatic
and overwhelming you switches gentlemen do you you exflunctified
perditioned rascal ar'n't you got it you niggur-in-law to old satan
you tarnal half-imp you h'yar's for you you dog and thar's for you
you dog's dog h'yar's the way i pay you in a small-change of
sogdologers

and thus he cried until roland and nathan seizing him by the
shoulders dragged him by main force from the indian who was found when
they came to examine the body afterwards actually pommelled to death
the skull having been beaten in as with bludgeons the victor sprang
upon his feet and roared his triumph aloud ar'n't i lick'd him
handsome hurrah for kentucky and old salt cock-a-doodle-doo

and with that turning to his deliverers he displayed to
their astonished eyes though disfigured by blood and mire the
never-to-be-forgotten features of the captain of horse-thieves
soaring ralph stackpole




chapter xxvi


the amazement of stackpole at finding to whom he owed his deliverance
was not less than that of the travellers but it was mingled in his
case with feelings of the most unbounded and clamorous delight nathan
he grasped by the hands being the first upon whom he set his eyes but
no sooner had they wandered to the soldier than throwing his arms around
him he gave him a hug neither tender nor respectful but indicative of
the intensest affection and rapture

you cut the rope stranger and you cut the tug he cried on madam's
beseeching but h'yar's the time you holped me out of a fix without
axing now strannger i ar'n't your dog cause how i'm anngelliferous
madam's but if i ar'n't your dog i'm your man ralph stackpole to be
your true-blue through time and etarnity any way you'll ax me and if
you wants a sodger i'll list with you i will tarnal death to me

but how in heaven's name came you here a prisoner i saw you escape
with my own eyes said roland better pleased perhaps at the accession
of such a stout auxiliary than with his mode of professing love and
devotion

strannger said ralph if you war to ax me from now till doomsday
about the why and the wharfo i couldn't make you more nor one answer i
come to holp anngelliferous madam out of the hands of the abbregynes
according to my sworn duty as her natteral-born slave and redemptioner i
war hard on the track when the villians here caught me

what cried roland his heart for the first time warming towards the
despised horse-thief while even nathan surveyed him with something like
complacency you are following my poor cousin then you were not brought
here a prisoner

if i war i wish i may be shot said ralph it warn't a mile back on
the ridge whar the injuns snapped me causa how i jist bang'd away at
a deer and jist then up jumps the rascals on me afo i had loaded old
speechifier and so they nabb'd me and so sodger h'yar's the way of it
all you see d'you see as soon as tom bruce comes to so as to
be able to hold the hoss himself 

what said roland was he not mortally wounded

he ar'n't much hurt to speak on for all of his looking so much like
coffin-meat at the first jump it war a kind of narvousness come over him
that men feels when they gets the thwack of a bullet among the narves
and so you see d'you see says i tom bruce do you stick to the
critter and he'll holp you out of the skrimmage and says i i'll
take the back-track and foller atter madam and says he says he but
tarnal death to me let's scalp these h'yar dead villians and do the
talking atter did you see the licking i gin this here feller it war a
reggular fair knock-down-and-drag-out and i licked him thar's all sorts
of ways of killing injuns but i reckon i'm the only gentleman in all
kentuck as ever took a scalp in the way of natur hurrah for kentuck
and hurrah for ralph stackpole for he ar a screamer

the violation of the dead bodies was a mode of crowning their victory
which roland would have gladly dispensed with but such forbearance
opposed to all border ideas of manly spirit and propriety found no
advocate in the captain of horse-thieves and none we are sorry to say
even in the conscientious nathan who having bathed his peaceful sword
too deep in blood to boggle longer at trifles seemed mightily inclined
to try his own hand at the exercise but this addition to the catalogue
of his backslidings was spared him roaring ralph falling to work with an
energy of spirit and rapidity of execution which showed he needed no
assistance and left no room for competition such is the practice of
the border and such it has been ever since the mortal feud never
destined to be really ended but with the annihilation or civilisation
of the american race first began between the savage and the white
intruder it was and is essentially a measure of retaliation
compelled if not justified by the ferocious example of the red man
brutality ever begets brutality and magnanimity of arms can be only
exercised in the case of a magnanimous foe with such the wildest and
fiercest rover of the frontier becomes a generous and even humane enemy

the virginian was yet young in the war of the wilderness and turning in
disgust from a scene he could not prevent he made his way to the fire
where the haunch of venison sending forth a savoury steam through the
whole valley was yet roasting on the rude indian spit a spectacle
which we record it with shame quite banished from his mind not only all
thoughts of ralph's barbarism but even the sublime military ardour
awakened by the din and perils of the late conflict nor were its effects
less potential upon nathan and ralph who having first washed from their
hands and faces the stains of battle now drew nigh snuffing the perfume
of a dinner with as much ardour as they could have bestowed on the scent
of battle the haunch cooked to their hands was straightway removed to
a convenient place where all drawing their knives fell foul with an
energy of appetite and satisfaction that left them oblivious of most
sublunary affairs the soldier forgot his sorrows and nathan forgot
little peter though little peter by suddenly creeping out of the
bushes on the hill and crawling humbly to the table and his master's
side made it apparent he had not forgot himself as for the captain of
horse-thieves he forgot everything save the dinner itself which he
attacked with an appetite well nigh ravenous having as he swore by way
of grace over the first mouthful eaten nothing save roots and leaves for
more than three days it was only when by despatching at least twice his
share of the joint he began to feel as he said summat like a hoss
and a gentleman that the others succeeded in drawing from him a full
account of the circumstances which had attended his solitary inroad into
the indian country and his fall into the clutches of the shawnee party

but little had the faithful fellow to impart beyond what he had already
told galloping from the fatal hill the scene of defeat to the young
kentuckians he sustained tom bruce in his arms until the latter
reviving had recovered strength enough to provide for his own safety
upon which ralph with a degree of quixotism that formed a part of his
character and which was in this instance strengthened by his grateful
devotion to edith the saver of his life declared he would pursue the
trail of her captors even if it led him to their village nor cease his
efforts until he had rescued her out of their hands or laid down his
life in her service in this resolution he was encouraged by bruce who
swore on his part that he would instantly follow with his father and
all the men he could raise recover the prisoners and burn the towns of
the whole shawnee nation about their ears a determination he was perhaps
the more readily driven to by the reflection that the unlucky captives
were his father's individual guests and had been snatched away while
still in a manner under or relying on his father's protection so
much he promised and so much there was no doubt he would if able
perform nevertheless he exhorted ralph to do his best in the
meanwhile to help the strangers vowing if he succeeded in rendering
them any assistance or in taking a single scalp of the villains that had
borne them off he would not only never lynch him himself but would not
even allow others to do it though he were to steal all the horses in
kentucky his father's best bay mare included

thus encouraged the valiant horse-thief bidding farewell to tom bruce
and brown briareus together commenced making good his words by creeping
back to the battle-field when arriving before nathan he struck the
trail of the main party and immediately pursued it with zeal and
courage but still with the necessary caution and circumspection his
hopes of being able to do something to the advantage of his benefactress
resting principally on his knowledge of several of the outer indian
towns in every one of which he boasted he had stolen horses being but
poorly provided with food and afraid to hunt while following so closely
on the heels of the marauders he was soon reduced to want and suffering
which he bore for three days with heroic fortitude until at last on
the morning of the present day being in a state of utter starvation and
a buck springing up in his path he could resist the temptation no
longer and so fired upon it the animal being wounded and apparently
severely he set off in pursuit too eager to lose time by recharging his
piece and it was while he was in that defenceless condition that the
five indians a detachment and rear-guard as it proved of the very
party he was dogging attracted by the sound of his gun stole upon him
unawares and made him a prisoner this it seems had happened but a
short distance behind and there was every reason to suppose that the
buck from whose loins the travellers had filched the haunch that destiny
had superseded by a better was the identical animal whose seducing
appearance had brought stackpole into captivity he was immediately
recognised by his captors whose exultation was boundless as indeed was
their cruelty and he could only account for their halting with him in
that retired hollow instead of pushing on to display their prize to the
main body by supposing they could not resist their desire to enjoy a
snug little foretaste of the joys of torturing him at the stake all by
themselves a right they had earned by their good fortune in taking him
in the valley then they had paused and tying him up proceeded
straightway to flog him to their hearts content and they had just
resolved to intermit the amusement awhile in favour of their dinner
when the appearance of his bold deliverers rushing into their camp
converted the scene of brutal merriment into one of retributive vengeance
and blood

the discovery that the five human beings he had contributed so much to
destroy were part and parcel of the very band the authors of all his
sufferings the captors of his kinswoman abated some little feelings of
compunction with which roland had begun occasionally to look upon the
gory corses around him

the main body of marauders with their prisoner there seemed good reason
to suppose were yet upon their march to the village though too far
advanced to leave any hope of overtaking them were that even desirable
it is true that roland fired by the thought of being so near his
kinswoman and having before his eyes a proof of what might be done by
craft and courage even against overwhelming numbers urged nathan
immediately to re-commence the pursuit the indians would doubtless halt
to rest and refresh as the luckless five had done and might be
approached and destroyed now that they themselves had increased their
forces by the rescue of ralph in the same way we can carry with us
he said these indians guns with which we shall be more than a match
for the villains and he added other arguments such however as
appeared much more weighty to himself than to honest nathan that the
main party should have halted as he supposed did not appear at all
probable to nathan they had no cause to arrest them in their journey
and they were but a few miles removed from the village whither they
would doubtless proceed without delay to enjoy the rewards of their
villany and end the day in revel and debauch and truly friend he
added it will be better for thee and me and the maid edith that we
steal her by night from out of a village defended only by drowsy squaws
and drunken warriors than if we were to aim at taking her out of the
camp of a war-party do thee keep thee patience and truly there is no
telling what good may come of it in short nathan had here as in
previous instances made up his mind to conduct affairs his own way and
roland though torn by impatience could do nothing better than submit

and now the dinner being at last despatched nathan directed that the
bodies of the slain indians should be tumbled into a gully and hidden
from sight a measure of such evident precaution as to need no
explanation this was immediately done but not before ralph and the man
of peace had well rummaged the pouches of the dead helping themselves
to such valuables and stores of provender and ammunition as they could
lay hands on in addition to which nathan stripped from one a light
indian hunting-shirt from another a blanket a woman's shawl and a
medicine bag from a third divers jingling bundles of brooches and
hawk-bells together with a pouch containing vermilion and other paints
the principal articles of savage toilet which he made up into a bundle
to be used for a purpose he did not conceal from his comrades he then
seized upon the rifles of the dead from among which stackpole had
already singled out his own and removing the locks hid them away in
crannies of the cliffs concealing the locks in other places a
disposition which he also made of the knives and tomahawks remarking
with great justice that if honest christian men were to have no good of
the weapons it was just as well murdering injuns should be no better
off

these things concluded the dead covered over with boughs and brambles
and nothing left in the vale to attract a passing and unobservant eye he
gave the signal to resume the march and with roland and captain ralph
stole from the field of battle




chapter xxvii


the twilight was darkening in the west when the three adventurers
stealing through tangled thickets and along lonely ridges carefully
avoiding all frequented paths looked out at last from a distant hill
upon the valley in which lay the village of the black-vulture the ruddy
light of evening bursting from clouds of crimson and purple and
shooting down through gaps of the hills in cascades of fire fell
brightly and sweetly on the little prairies or natural meadow-lands
which dotted over with clumps of trees and watered by a fairy river a
tributary of the rapid miami winding along from side to side now hiding
beneath the shadow of the hills now glancing into light gave an air of
tender beauty to the scene better befitting as it might have seemed the
retreat of the innocent and peaceful sons of oberon than the wild and
warlike children of the wilderness looking further up the vale the eye
fell upon patches of ripening maize waving along the river and beyond
these just where the valley winded away behind the hills at the
distance of a mile or more thin wreaths of smoke creeping from roofs of
bark and skins indicated the presence of the indian village

thus arrived at the goal and haven of their hopes the theatre in which
was to be acted the last scene in the drama of their enterprise the
travellers surveyed it for awhile from their concealment in deep
silence each speculating in his own mind upon the exploits still to be
achieved the perils yet to be encountered ere success should crown
their exertions already so arduous and so daring then creeping back
again into a deep hollow convenient for their purpose they held their
last consultation and made their final preparations for entering the
village this nathan at first proposed to do entirely alone to spy out
the condition of the village and to discover if possible in what
quarter the marauders had bestowed the unhappy edith and this being a
duty requiring the utmost secrecy and circumspection he insisted it
could not be safely committed to more than one person

in that case said valiant ralph i'm your gentleman do you think
old tiger nathan and tarnal death to me i do think you're ginnin to
be a peeler of the rale ring-tail specie i do old rusty and thar's my
fo'paw on it you've got to be a man at last a feller for close locks
and fighting injuns that's quite cu'rous to think on and i'll lick any
man that says a word agin you i will tarnal death to me but i say
do you think i'm come so far atter madam to gin up the holping her out
of bondage to any mortal two-legg'd crittur whatsomever i'm the person
what knows this h'yar town better nor ar another feller in all kentucky
and that i stick on for cuss me i've stole hosses in it

truly said nathan after reflecting awhile thee might make theeself
of service to the maid even in thee own way but verily thee is an
unlucky man and thee brings bad luck wheresoever thee goes and so i'm
afeard of thee

afeard of your nose said ralph with great indignation ar'n't i jist
been slicked out of the paws of five mortal abbregynes that had me in the
tugs and ar'n't that luck enough for any feller i tell you what
nathan me and you will snuff the track together you shall hunt up
anngelliferous madam and gin her my compliments and while you're about
it i'll steal her a hoss to ride off on

truly said nathan complacently i was thinking of that for they
says thee is good in a horse-pound and it needs the poor maid should
have something better to depend on in flight than her own poor innocent
legs and so friend if thee thinks in thee conscience thee can help her
to a strong animal without fear of discovery i don't care if thee goes
with me and truly if thee could steal two or three more of the
creatures for our own riding it might greatly advantage the maid

thar you talk like a feller of gumption said ralph only show me
the sight of a bit of skin-rope for halters and you'll see a sample of
hoss-stealing to make your ha'r stand on eend

of a truth said nathan thee shan't want for halters if leather can
make them there is that on my back which will make thee a dozen and
truly as it needs i should now put me on attire more suitable to an
injun village it is a satisfaction thee can put the old garment to such
good use

with these words nathan stripped off his coat of skins so aged and so
venerable and gave it to the captain of horse-thieves who vastly
delighted with the prize instantly commenced cutting it into strips
which he twisted together and fashioned into rude halters while
nathan supplied its place by the loose calico shirt he had selected
from among the spoils of the indian party throwing over it mantle-wise
the broad indian blanket his head he bound round with the gaudy shawl
which he had also taken from the brows of a dead foe-man and he hung
about his person various pouches and ornamented belts provided for the
purpose then daubing over his face arms and breast with streaks of
red black and green paint that seemed designed to represent snakes
lizards and other reptiles he was on a sudden converted into a highly
respectable-looking savage as grim and awe-inspiring as these barbaric
ornaments and his attire added to his lofty stature could make him
indeed the metamorphosis was so complete that captain ralph as he
swore could scarce look at him without longing as this worthy personage
expressed it to be at his top-knot

in the meanwhile forrester had not deferred with patience to an
arrangement which threatened to leave him the most interested of all in
inglorious activity while his companions were labouring in the cause of
his edith he remonstrated and insisted upon accompanying them to the
village to share with them all the dangers of the enterprise

if there was danger to none but ourselves truly thee should go with
us and welcome said nathan representing justly enough the little
service that roland destitute of the requisite knowledge and skill
could be expected to render and the dangers he must necessarily bring
upon the others in case of any the most ordinary difficulties arising
in their progress through the village everything must now depend upon
address upon cunning and presence of mind the least indiscretion and
how many might not the soldier his feelings wound up to a pitch of the
intensest excitement commit must of necessity terminate in the
instant destruction of all in short roland was convinced though sorely
against his will that wisdom and affection both called on him to play
the part nathan had assigned him and he submitted to be ruled
accordingly with the understanding however that the rendezvous in
which he was to await the operations of the others should be upon the
very borders of the village whence he might in any pressing emergency
in case of positive danger and conflict be immediately called to their
assistance

when the twilight had darkened away and the little river rippling along
on its course sparkled only in the light of the stars the three friends
crept from their retreat and descended boldly into the valley where
guided by the barking of dogs the occasional yells of a drunken or
gamesome savage and now and then the red glare of a fire flashing from
the open crannies of a cabin they found little difficulty in approaching
the indian village it was situated on the further bank of the stream
and as described just behind the bend of the vale at the bottom of a
rugged but not lofty hill which jutting almost into the river left
yet space enough for the forty or fifty lodges composing the village
sheltering them in winter from the bitter blasts that rush at that
season from the northern lakes beyond the river on the side towards
the travellers the vale was broader and it was there the indians had
chiefly planted their corn-fields fields enriched by the labour
perhaps also by the tears of their oppressed and degraded women

arriving at the borders of the cultivated grounds the three
adventurers crossed the river which was neither broad nor deep and
stealing among logs and stumps at the foot of the hill where some
industrious savage had in former years begun to clear a field which
however his wives had never planted they lay down in concealment
waiting until the subsiding of the unusual bustle in the village a
consequence manifestly of the excesses which nathan predicted the victors
would indulge in should render their further advance practicable but
this was not the work of a moment the savage can drink and dance through
the night with as lusty a zeal as his white neighbour the song the
jest the merry tale are as dear to his imagination and in the
retirement of his own village feeling no longer the restraint of stolid
gravity assumed in the haunts of the white man less to play the part
of a hero than to cover the nakedness of his own inferiority he can
give himself up to wild indulgence the sport of whim and frolic and
when the fire-water is the soul of the feast the feast only ends with
the last drop of liquor

it could be scarcely doubted that the indians of the village were this
night paying their devotions to the manito of the rum-keg and drinking
folly and fury together from the enchanted draught which one of the
bravest of the race its adorer and victim like logan the heroic and
red-jacket the renowned declared could only have been distilled from
the hearts of wild-cats and the tongues of women it made him so fierce
and so foolish nor could it on the other hand be questioned that many
a sad and gloomy reminiscence the recollection of wrong of defeat of
disaster of the loss of friends and of country was mingled in the joy
of the debauch from their lurking-place near the village the three
friends could hear many a wild whoop now fierce and startling now
plaintive and mourning the one as nathan and ralph said the halloo
for revenge the other the whoop of lamentation at intervals chiming
strangely in with unmeaning shrieks and roaring laughter the squeaking
of women and the gibbering of children with the barking of curs the
utterance of obstreperous enjoyment in which the whole village brute
and human seemed equally to share for a time indeed one might have
deemed the little hamlet an outer burgh of pandemonium itself and the
captain of horse-thieves swore that having long been of opinion the
red abbregynes war the rule children of sattan and niggers only the
grand-boys he should now hold the matter to be as settled as if booked
down in an almanac he would tarnal death to him

but if the festive spirit of the barbarians might have lasted for ever
there was it appeared no such exhaustless quality in their liquor and
that failing at last the uproar began gradually to decrease although it
was not until within an hour of midnight that nathan declared the moment
had arrived for entering the village

he then rose from his lair and repeating his injunctions to roland to
remain where he was until the issue of his own visit should be known
added a word of parting counsel which to roland's imagination bore
somewhat an ominous character the thing that is to come he said
neither thee nor me knows anything about for truly an injun village
is a war-trap which one may sometimes creep into easy enough but
truly the getting out again is another matter and so friend if it
should be my luck and friend ralph's to be killed or captivated so
that we cannot return to thee again do thee move by the first blink of
day and do thee best to save thee own life and truly i have some hope
that thee may succeed seeing that if i should fall little peter which
i will leave with thee for truly he would but encumber me among the
dogs of the village having better skill to avoid murdering injuns than
the creatures of his own kind will make thee his master as verily he
can no longer serve a dead one and show thee the way back again from
the wilderness truly friend he hath an affection for thee for thee
has used him well which he can say of no other persons save only thee
and me excepted

with that having laid aside his gun which as he represented could
be in such an undertaking of no service and directed stackpole to do
the same he shook roland by the hand and waiting an instant till
ralph had followed his example and added his farewell in the brief
phrase sodger i'm atter my mistress and for all nathan's small talk
about massacree and captivation we'll fetch her with a most beautiful
lot of hosses so thar's no fawwell about it turned to little peter
whom he addressed quite as gravely as he had done the virginian now
little dog peter said he i leave thee to take care of theeself and
the young man that is with thee and do thee be good and faithful and
obedient as thee always has been and have a good care thee keeps out of
mischief

with these words which peter doubtless perfectly understood for he
squatted himself down upon the ground without any attempt to follow his
master nathan departed with roaring ralph at his side leaving roland
to mutter his anxieties and fears his doubts and impatience into the
ears of the least presuming of counsellors




chapter xxviii


the night was brilliantly clear the stars shining with an excess of
lustre with which nathan would perhaps at that moment have gladly
dispensed since it was by no means favourable to the achievement he was
now so daringly attempting fortunately however the indian village lay
for the most part in the shadow of the hill itself covered with
majestic maples and tulip-trees that rose in dark and solemn masses
above it and thus offered the concealment denied in the more open parts
of the valley with ralph still at his side he crept round the
projecting corner of the hill and shrouded in its gloom drew nigh the
village wherein might be still occasionally heard the halloo of a
drunken savage followed by an uproarious chorus of barking and howling
curs

whether it was that these sounds or some gloomy forebodings of his own
awoke the anxieties of nathan he did not deign to reveal but by and
by having arrived within but a few paces of a wretched pile of skins and
boughs the dwelling of some equally wretched and improvident barbarian
he came to a sudden halt and withdrawing the captain of horse-thieves
aside from the path addressed him in the following terms 

thee says friend thee has taken horses from this very village and
that thee knows it well

as well replied ralph as i know the step-mothers on my own thumbs
and fingers i do tarnal death to me that is to say all the parts
injacent and outjacent circum-surrounding the boss-stamp for thar's the
place of my visiting the way to fetch it old boy is jist to fetch
round this h'yar old skin-pot whar thar's a whole bee's-nest of young
papooses the size of bull-toads from that up i know it cause how
i heerd em squallin and thar war some one a lickin em or if you
don't favour taking it so close to the skirmudgeons then you must claw
up the knob h'yar and then take and take the shoot till you fetch right
among the hosses whar you h'ar them whinnying down the holler and
thar 

friend said nathan cutting him short it is on thee doings more
than on them of any others that the hopes of the maid edith 

call her anngelliferous madam said ralph for i can't stand any
feller being familiar with her i can't no how

well friend said nathan it is on thee doings that her escaping the
shawnee villains this night depends if thee does well it may be we
shall both discover and carry her safe away from captivation if thee
acts as a foolish imprudent man and truly friend i have my fears of
thee thee will both fail to help her theeself and prevent others doing
it who it may be has the power

old boy said the captain of horse-thieves with something like a gulp
of emotion you ar'n't respectable to a feller's feelings but i'll
stand anything from you cause how you down'd my house in a fa'r
tussle and you helped the captain thar that helped me out of trouble if
you're atter ginning me a bit of wisdom and all on madam's account i'm
jist the gentleman that h'ars you state the case and h'yar stands i
confawmable

well friend said nathan what i have to advise thee is that thee
stops where thee is leaving the rest of this matter entirely to me
seeing that as thee knows nothing of this injun village excepting the
horse-pound thereof it will not be safe for thee to enter do thee rest
where thee is and i will spy out the place of the maiden's concealing

old feller said captain ralph you won't pretend you knows more of
the place than me you don't go for to say you ever stole a hoss here

do thee be content friend said nathan to know there is not a cabin
in all the village that is unbeknown to me do thee be content with that
thee must not go near the pound until thee knows for certain the maid
thee calls madam can be saved truly friend it may be we cannot help
her to-night but may do so to-morrow night

i see what you're up to said ralph and thar's no denying it war a
natteral piece of nonsense to steal a hoss afo madam war ready to ride
him and so old nathan if it ar your qualified opinion i'll sarve
madam better by snuggin under a log than by snuffin atter her among
the cabins i'm jist the gentleman to knock under accordin to reason

this declaration seemed greatly to relieve the uneasiness of nathan who
recommending him to be as good as his word and ensconce among some logs
lying near the path awaiting the event of his own visit to the heart of
the village immediately took his leave though not with the timid and
skulking step of a spy wrapping his blanket about his shoulders and
assuming the gait of a savage he stalked boldly forwards jingling under
his mantle the bundle of hawk's-bells which he carried in his hand as if
actually to invite the observation of such barbarians as were yet moving
through the village

but this stretch of audacity as the listening horse-thief was at first
inclined to esteem it was soon seen to have been adopted with a wise
foreknowledge of its effects in removing one of the first and greatest
difficulties in the wanderer's way at the first cabin was a troop of
yelling curs that seemed somewhat disturbed by the stranger's approach
and disposed to contest his right of passing scot-free but a jerk of the
bells settled the difficulty in a moment and the animals mute and
crest-fallen slunk nastily away as if expecting the crash of a tomahawk
about their ears in the usual summary indian way to punish their
presumption in baying a warrior

a right-down natteral fine conceit muttered captain ralph
approvingly the next time i come a-grabbin hosses if i don't fetch a
bushel of the jinglers i wish i may be kicked them thar injun dogs is
always the devil

in the meanwhile nathan though proceeding with such apparent boldness
and relying upon his disguise as all-sufficient to avert suspicion was
by no means inclined to court any such dangers as could be really
avoided if the light of a fire still burning in a wigwam and watched by
wakeful habitants shone too brightly from its door he crept by with the
greatest circumspection and he gave as wide a berth as possible to every
noisy straggler who yet roamed through the village

there was indeed necessity for every precaution it was evident that the
village was by no means so destitute of defence as he had imagined that
the warriors of wenonga had not generally obeyed the call that carried
the army of the tribes to kentucky but had remained in inglorious ease
and sloth in their own cabins there was no other way at least of
accounting for the dozen or more male vagabonds whom he found at
intervals stretched here before a fire where they had been carousing in
the open air and there lying asleep across the path just where the
demon of good cheer had dropped them making his own inferences from
their appearance and passing them with care sometimes even where their
slumbers seemed unsound crawling by on his face he succeeded at last in
reaching the central part of the village where the presence of several
cabins of logs humble enough in themselves but far superior to the
ordinary hovels of an indian village indicated the abiding place of the
superiors of the clan or of those apostate white men renegades from the
states traitors to their country and to civilisation who were at that
day in so many instances found uniting their fortunes with the indians
following and even leading them in their bloody incursions upon the
frontiers to one of those cabins nathan made his way with stealthy step
and peeping through a chink in the logs beheld a proof that here a
renegade had cast his lot in the appearance of some half a dozen naked
children of fairer hue than the savages yet not so pale as those of his
own race sleeping on mats round a fire at which sat nodding and
dozing the dark-eyed indian mother

one brief earnest look nathan gave to this spectacle then stealing
away he bent his steps towards a neighbouring cabin which he approached
with even greater precautions than before this was a hovel of logs like
the other but of still better construction having the uncommon
convenience of a chimney built of sticks and mud through whose low wide
top ascended volumes of smoke made ruddy by the glare of the flames
below a cranny here also afforded the means of spying into the doings
within and nathan who approached it with the precision of one not
unfamiliar with the premises was not tardy to avail himself of its
advantages bare naked walls of logs the interstices rudely stuffed with
moss and clay a few uncouth wooden stools a rough table a bed of
skins and implements of war and the chase hung in various places about
the room all illuminated more brilliantly by the fire on the hearth than
by the miserable tallow candle stuck in a lamp of humid clay that
glimmered on the table were not the only objects to attract the
wanderer's eye sitting by the fire were two men both white though the
blanket and calico shirt of one and the red shawl which he was just in
the act of removing from his brows as nathan peeped through the chink
with an uncommon darkness of skin and hair might have well made him pass
for an indian his figure was very tall well proportioned and athletic
his visage manly and even handsome though the wrinkles of forty winters
furrowed deeply in his brows and perhaps a certain repelling gleam the
light of smothered passions shining from the eyes below might have left
that merit questionable with the beholder

the other was a smaller man whom roland had he been present would have
recognised as the supposed half-breed who at the partition of spoils
after the capture of his party and the defeat of the young kentuckians
had given him a prisoner into the hands of the three piankeshaws in a
word the renegade father of telie doe nor was his companion less
familiar to nathan who beheld in his sombre countenance the features of
that identical stranger seen with doe at the fire among the assailants
at the memorable ruin whose appearance had awakened the first suspicion
that there was more in the attack than proceeded from ordinary causes
this was a discovery well fitted to increase the interest and sharpen
the curiosity of the man of peace who peering in upon the pair from the
chink gave all his faculties to the duty of listening and observing the
visage of doe dark and sullen at the best was now peculiarly moody and
he sat gazing into the fire apparently regardless of his companion who
as he drew the shawl from his head and threw it aside muttered
something into doe's ears but in a voice too low for nathan to
distinguish what he said the whisper was repeated once and again but
without seeming to produce any impression upon doe's ears at which the
other growing impatient gave to nathan's great satisfaction a louder
voice to his discourse

hark you jack atkinson doe shanogenaw rattlesnake or
whatever you may be pleased to call yourself he cried striking the
muser on the shoulder are you mad drunk or asleep get up man and
tell me since you will tell me nothing else what the devil you are
dreaming about

why curse it said the other starting up somewhat in anger but
draining before he spoke a deep draught from an earthen pitcher that
stood on the table i was thinking if you must know about the
youngster and the dog's death we have driven him to christian work for
christian men eh

the fate of war exclaimed the renegade's companion with great
composure we have won the battle boy the defeated must bear the
consequences

ondoubtedly said doe up to the rack fodder or no fodder that's
the word there's no scaping them consequences they must be taken as
they come gantelope fire-roasting and all but i say dick saving
your pardon for being familiar he added there's the small matter to
be thought on in the case and that is it was not injuns but rale
right-down christian men that brought the younker to the tug it's a bad
business for white men and it makes me feel oncomfortable

pooh said the other with an air of contemptuous commiseration you
are growing sentimental this comes of listening to that confounded
whimpering telie

no words agin the gal cried doe sternly you may say what you like
of me for i'm a rascal that desarves it but i'll stand no barking agin
the gal

why she's a good girl and a pretty girl too good and too pretty to
have so crusty a father and i have nothing against her but her taking
on so about the younker and so playing the devil with the wits and
good-looks of my own bargain

a dear bargain she is like to prove to all of us said doe drowning
his anger or remorse in another draught from the pitcher she has cost
us eleven men already it is well the bulk of the whelps was wabash and
maumee dogs or you would have seen her killed and scalped for all of
your guns and whisky you would there's no two ways about it
howsomever four of em was dogs of our own and two of them was picked
off by the jibbenainosay i tell you what dick i'm not the man to skear
at a raw-head-and-bloody-bones but i do think the coming of this here
cursed jibbenainosay among us jist as we was nabbing the girl and
sodger was as much as to say there was no good could come of it and so
the injuns thought too you saw how hard it was to bring em up to the
scratch when they found he had been knifing a feller right among em i
do believe the crittur's old nick himself

so don't i said the other for it is quite unnatural to suppose the
devil would ever take part against his own children

perhaps said doe you don't believe in the crittur

good jack honest jack replied his companion i am no such ass

them that don't believe in hell will natterly go agin the devil
muttered the renegade with strong signs of disapprobation and then
added earnestly look you squire you're a man that knows more of
things than me and the likes of me you saw that ere injun dead in
the woods under the tree where the five scouters had left him a living
man

ay said the man of the turban but he had been wounded by the
horseman you so madly suffered to pass the ambush at the ford and was
obliged to stop from loss of blood and faintness what so natural as to
suppose the younker fell upon him we saw the tracks of the whole party
where the body lay and slashed him in your devil's style to take
advantage of the superstitious fear of the indians

there's nothing like being a lawyer sartain grumbled doe
but the warrior right among us there at the ruin you seed him
yourself marked right in the thick of us i reckon you won't say
the sodger that we had there trapped up fast in the cabin put the
cross on that injun too

nothing more likely said the sceptic a stratagem a bold man might
easily execute in the dark

well squire said doe waxing impatient you may jist as well work it
out according to law that this same sodger younker that never seed
kentucky afore in his life has been butchering shawnees there ay and
in this d d town too for ten years agone ay dick it's true jist as
i tell you there has been a dozen or more injun warriors struck and
scalped in our very wigwams here in the dead of the night and nothing
in the morning but the mark of the jibbenainosay to tell who was the
butcher there's not a cussed warrior of them all that doesn't go to his
bed at night in fear for none knows when the jibbenainosay the howl of
the shawnees may be upon him you must know there was some bloody
piece of business done in times past injuns is the boys for them
things the murdering of a knot of innocent people by some of the
tribe with the old villain wenonga at the head of em ever since that
the jibbenainosay has been murdering among them and they hold that it's
a judgment on the tribe as ondoubtedly it is and now you see that's
jist the reason why the old chief has turned such a vagabond for the
tribe is rifled at him because of his bringing such a devil on them and
they won't follow him to battle no more except some sich riff-raff
vagabond rascals as them we picked up for this here rascality no how
and so you see it has a sort of set the old feller mad he thinks of
nothing but the jibbenainosay that is when he's sober though cuss
him i believe it's all one when he's drunk too of hunting him up and
killing him for he's jist a feller to fight the devil there's no two
ways about it it was because i told him we was going to the woods on
salt where the crittur abounds and where he might get wind of him that
he smashed his rum-keg and agreed to go with us

well well said doe's associate this is idle talk we have won the
victory and must enjoy it i must see the prize

what good can come of it demanded doe moodily the gal's half dead
and whole crazy or so telie says and as for your gitting any good-will
out of her cuss me if i believe it and telie says 

that telie will spoil all i told you to keep the girl away from her

well and didn't i act accordin i told her i'd murder her if she went
near her agin a full-blooded rale-grit rascal to talk so to my own
daughter an't i but i should like to know where's the good of keeping
the gal from her since it's all she has for comfort

and that is the very reason she must be kept away said the stranger
with a look malignly expressive of self-approving cunning there must be
no hope no thought of security no consciousness of sympathy to make me
more trouble than i have had already she must know where she is and
what she is a prisoner among wild savages a little fright a little
despair and the work is over you understand me eh there is a way of
bringing the devil himself to terms and as for a woman she is not much
more unmanageable one week of terrors real and imagined does the work
and then my jolly jack you have won your wages

and i have desarved em said doe striking his fist upon the table
with violence for i have made myself jist the d  dest rascal that was
ever made of a white man lying and cheating and perjuring and
murdering it's nothing better nor murder that of giving up the younker
that never did harm to me or mine to the piankeshaws for they'll burn
him they will d n em there's no two ways about it there's what
i've done for you and if you were to give me had the plunder i reckon
twould do no more than indamnify me for my rascality and so here's the
end on't you've made me a rascal and you shall pay for it

it is the only thing the world ever does pay for said the stranger
with edifying coolness and so don't be afflicted to be a rascal is to
be a man of sense provided you are a rascal in a sensible way that
is a profitable one

ay said doe that's the doctrine you have been preaching ever since i
knowed you and you have made a fortun by it but as for me though
i've toed the track after your own leading i'm jist as poor as ever and
ten times more despisable i am d n me for i'm a white injun and
there's nothing more despisable but here's the case he added working
himself into a rage i won't be a rascla for nothing i'm sworn to it
and this is a job you must pay for to the full vally or you're none the
better on it

it will make your fortune said his companion in iniquity there was
bad luck about us before but all is now safe the girl will make us
secure

i don't see into it a bit said doe morosely you were secure enough
without her the story of the other gal you know of gave you the grab on
the lands and vall'ables and i don't see what's the good to come of this
here other one no how

then have you less brains my jolly jack then i have given you credit
for said the other the story you speak of is somewhat too flimsy to
serve us long we must have a better claim to the lands than can come of
possession in trust for an heir not to be produced till we can find the
way to abraham's bosom we have now obtained it the younker thanks to
your piankeshaw cut-throats is on the path to paradise the girl is left
alone sole claimant and heiress at law in a word jack i design to
marry her ay faith will-she nill-she i will marry her and thereby
besides gratifying certain private whims and humours not worth
mentioning i will put the last finish to the scheme and step into
the estate with a clear conscience

but the will the cussed old will cried doe you've got up a cry
about it and there's them that won't let it drop so easy what's an heir
at law agin a will you take the gal back and the cry is where's the
true gal the major's daughter i reckon you'll find you're jist got
yourself into a trap of your own making

in that case said the stranger with a grin we must e'en act like
honest men and find after much hunting and rummaging mind you the
major's last will

but you burned it exclaimed doe you told me so yourself

i told you so jack but that was a little bit of innocent deception to
make you easy i told you so but i kept it to guard against accidents
and here it is jack added the speaker drawing from amid the folds of
his blanket a roll of parchment which he proceeded very deliberately to
spread upon the table the very difficulty you mention occurred to me i
saw it would not do to raise the devil without retaining the power to
lay him here then is the will that settles the affair to your liking
the girl and the younker are co-heirs together but the latter dying
intestate you understand the whole falls into the lap of the former
are you easy now honest jack will this satisfy you all is safe

it is jist the thing to an iota ejaculated doe in whom the sight of
the parchment seemed to awaken cupidity and exultation together there's
no standing agin it in any court in virginnee

right my boy said his associate but where is the girl i must see
her

in the cabin with wenonga's squaw right over agin the council-house
replied doe adding with animation but i'm agin your going nigh her
till we settle up accounts jist as honestly as any two sich d d rascals
can i say by g  i must know how the book stands and how i'm to
finger the snacks for snacks is the word or the bargain's no go

well we can talk of this on the morrow

to-night's the time said doe there's nothing like having an honest
understanding of matters afore-hand i'm not going to be cheated not
meaning no offence in saying so and i've jist made up my mind to keep
the gal out of your way till we've settled things to our liking

spoken like a sensible rogue said the stranger with a voice all
frankness and approval but with a lowering look of impatience which
nathan who had watched the proceedings of the pair with equal amazement
and interest could observe from the chink though it was concealed from
doe by the position of the speaker who had risen from his stool as if
to depart but who now sat down again to satisfy the fears of his
partner in villany to this he immediately addressed himself but in
tones lower than before so that nathan could no longer distinguish his
words

but nathan had heard enough the conversation as far as he had
distinguished it chimed strangely in with all his own and roland's
suspicions there was indeed not a word uttered that did not confirm
them the confessions of the stranger vague and mysterious as they
seemed tallied in all respects with roland's account of the villanous
designs imputed to the hated braxley and it was no little additional
proof of his identity that in addressing doe whom he styled throughout
as jack he had once at least called him by the name of atkinson a
refugee whose connection with the conspiracy in roland's story nathan
had not forgotten it was not indeed surprising that abel doe should
possess another name since it was a common practice among renegades
like himself from some sentiment of shame or other obvious reasons to
assume an alias and nom de guerre under which they acquired their
notoriety the only wonder was that he should prove to be that person
whose agency in the abduction of edith would of all other men in the
world go furthest to sustain the belief of braxley being the principal
contriver of the outrage

such thoughts as these may have wandered through nathan's mind but he
took little time to con them over he had made a discovery at that moment
of more stirring importance and interest allowing that edith forrester
was the prisoner of whom the disguised stranger and his sordid
confederate spoke and there was little reason to doubt it he had
learned out of their own mouths the place of her concealment to
discover which was the object of his daring visit to the village her
prison-house was the wigwam of wenonga the chief if chief he could
still be called whom the displeasure of his tribe had robbed of almost
every vestige of authority and thither nathan to whom the vile
bargaining of the white-men no longer offered interest supposing he
could even have overheard it instantly determined to make his way

but how was nathan to know the cabin of the chief from the dozen other
hovels that surrounded the council-house that was a question which
perhaps nathan did not ask himself for creeping softly from doe's hut
and turning into the street if such could be called the irregular
winding space that separated the two lines of cabins composing the
village he stole forward with nothing of the hesitation or doubt which
might have been expected from one unfamiliar with the village




chapter xxix


while nathan lay watching at the renegade's hut there came a change over
the aspect of the night little less favourable to his plans and hopes
than even the discovery of edith's place of concealment which he had so
fortunately made the sky became suddenly overcast with clouds and deep
darkness invested the indian village while gusts of wind sweeping with
a moaning sound over the adjacent hills and waking the forests from
their repose came rushing over the village whirring and fluttering
aloft like flights of the boding night-raven or the more powerful bird
of prey that had given its name to the chieftain of the tribe

in such darkness and with the murmur of the blasts and the rustling of
boughs to drown the noise of his footsteps nathan no longer feared to
pursue his way and rising boldly to his feet drawing his blanket close
around him and assuming as before the gait of a savage he strode
forwards and in less than a minute was upon the public square if such
we may call it the vacant area in the centre of the village where
stood the rude shed of bark and boughs supported by a circular range of
posts all open except at top to the weather which custom had
dignified with the title of council-house the bounds of the square were
marked by clusters of cabins placed with happy contempt of order and
symmetry and by trees and bushes that grew among and behind them
particularly at the foot of the hill on one side and on the other
along the borders of the river which in the pauses of the gusts could
be heard sweeping hard by over a broken and pebbly channel patches of
bushes might even be seen growing in places on the square itself and
here and there were a few tall trees remnants of the old forest which
had once overshadowed the scene towering aloft and sending forth on the
blast such spiritual murmurs and wild oraculous whispers as were wont
in ancient days to strike an awe through soothsayers and devotees in the
sacred groves of dodona

through this square looking solitude and desolation together lay the
path of the spy and he trode it without fear although it offered an
obstruction that might well have daunted the zeal of one less crafty and
determined in its centre and near the council-house he discovered a
fire now burning low but still as the breeze time by time fanned the
decaying embers into flame sending forth light enough to reveal the
spectacle of at least a dozen savages stretched in slumber around it
with as many ready rifles stacked round a post hard by their appearance
without affrighting greatly perplexed the man of peace who though at
first disposed to regard them as a kind of guard to whom had been
committed the charge of the village and the peace of the community
during the uproar and terrors of the debauch found reason upon more
mature inspection to consider them a band from some neighbouring
village perhaps an out-going war party which unluckily for himself
had tarried at the village to share the hospitalities and take part in
the revels of its inhabitants thus there was near the fire a huge heap
of dried corn-husks and prairie-grass designed for a couch a kind of
luxury which nathan supposed the villagers would have scarce taken the
trouble to provide unless for guests whose warlike pride and sense of
honour would not permit them to sleep under cover until they had struck
the enemy in his own country and were returning victorious to their own
and as a proof that they had shared as guests in all the excesses of
their hosts but few of them were seen huddled together on the couch the
majority lying about in such confusion and postures as could only have
been produced by the grossest indulgence

pausing awhile but not deterred by the discovery of such undesirable
neighbours nathan easily avoided them by making the circuit of the
square creeping along from tree to tree and bush to bush until he had
left the whole group on the rear and arrived in the vicinity of a cabin
which from its appearance might with propriety be supposed the dwelling
of the most distinguished demagogue of the tribe it was a cottage of
logs very similar to those of the renegades who had themselves perhaps
built it for the chief whose favour it was so necessary to purchase by
every means in their power but as it consisted of only a single room
and that by no means spacious the barbarian had seen fit to eke it out
by a brace of summer apartments being tents of skins which were pitched
at its ends like wings and perhaps communicated directly with the
interior though each had its own particular door of mats looking out
upon the square

all these appearances nathan could easily note in occasional gleams from
the fire which falling upon the rude and misshapen lodge revealed its
features obscurely to the eye it bore an air of solitude that became the
dwelling of a chief the soil around it as if too sacred to be invaded
by the profane feet of the multitude was left overgrown with weeds and
starveling bushes and an ancient elm rising among them and flinging
its shadowy branches wide around stood like a giant watchman to repel
the gaze of the curious

this solitude these bushes through which he could crawl unobserved and
the shadows of the tree offering a concealment equally effectual and
inviting were all circumstances in nathan's favour and giving one
backward glance to the fire on the square and then fixing his eye on one
of the tents in which as the mat at the door shook in the breeze he
could detect the glimmering of a light and fancied he could even faintly
hear the murmur of voices he crawled among the bushes scarcely doubting
that he was now within but a few feet of the unhappy maid in whose
service he had toiled so long and so well

but the path to the wigwam was not yet free from obstructions he had
scarce pushed aside the first bush in his way opening a vista into the
den of leaves where he looked to find his best concealment before a
flash of light from the fire darting through the gap and falling upon a
dark grim visage almost within reach of his hand showed him that he
had stumbled unawares upon a sleeping savage a man that had evidently
staggered there in his drunkenness and falling among the bushes had
straightway given himself up to sottish repose

for the first time a thrill smote through the bosom of the spy but it
was not wholly a thrill of dismay there was little indeed in the
appearance of the wretched sleeper at that moment to inspire terror
for apart from the condition of helpless impotence to which his
ungovernable appetites had reduced him he seemed to be entirely
unarmed at least nathan could see neither knife nor tomahawk about him
but there was that in the grim visage withered with age and seamed with
many a scar in the mutilated but bony and still nervous hand lying on
the broad naked chest and in the recollections of the past they
recalled to nathan's brain which awoke a feeling not less exciting if
less unworthy than fear in the first impulse of surprise it is true
he started backwards and grovelled flat upon his face as if to beat an
instant retreat in the only posture which could conceal him if the
sleeper should have been disturbed by his approach but the savage slept
on drugged to stupefaction by many a deep and potent draught and
nathan preserving his snake-like position only for a moment rose slowly
upon his hands and peered over again upon the unconscious barbarian

but the bushes had closed again around him and the glimmer of the dying
fire no longer fell upon the barbarian with an audacity of daring that
marked the eagerness and intensity of his curiosity nathan with his
hands pushed the bushes aside so as again to bring a gleam upon the
swarthy countenance which he perused with such feelings as left him for
a time unconscious of the object of his enterprise unconscious of
everything save the spectacle before him the embodied representation of
features which events of former years had painted in indelible hues on
his remembrance the face was that of a warrior worn with years and
covered with such scars as could be boasted only by one of the most
distinguished men of the tribe deep seams also marked the naked chest of
the sleeper and there was something in the appearance of his garments of
dressed hides which though squalid enough were garnished with
multitudes of silver brooches and tufts of human hair with here and
there a broad spanish dollar looped ostentatiously to the skin to prove
he was anything but a common brave to each ear was attached a string of
silver coins strung together in regular gradation from the largest to
the smallest a profusion of wealth which could appertain only to a
chief to prove indeed that he was no less there was visible upon his
head secured to the tiara or glory as it might be called for such
is its figure of badgers hairs which is so often found woven around
the scalp-lock of a north-western indian an ornament consisting of the
beaks and claws of a buzzard and some dozen or more of its sable
feathers these as nathan had previously told the soldier were the
distinguishing badges of wenonga or the black-vulture for so the name
is translated and it was no less a man than wenonga himself the
oldest most famous and at one time the most powerful chief of his
tribe who thus lay a wretched squalid sot before the doors of his own
wigwam which he had been unable to reach such was wenonga such were
many of the bravest and most distinguished of his truly unfortunate race
who exchanged their lands their fathers graves and the lives of their
people for the doubtful celebrity which the white man is so easily
disposed to allow them

the spy looked upon the face of the indian but there was none at hand
to gaze upon his own to mark the hideous frown of hate and the more
hideous grin of delight that mingled on and distorted his visage as
he gloated snake-like over that of the chief as he looked he drew
from its sheath in his girdle his well-worn but still bright and keen
knife which he poised in one hand while feeling with what seemed
extraordinary fearlessness or confidence of his prey with the other
along the sleeper's naked breast as if regardless how soon he might
wake but wenonga still slept on though the hand of the white man lay
upon his ribs and rose and fell with the throbs of his warlike heart
the knife took the place of the hand and one thrust would have driven it
through the organ that had never beaten with pity or remorse and that
thrust nathan quivering through every fibre with nameless joy and
exultation and forgetful of everything but his prey was about to make
he nerved his hand for the blow but it trembled with eagerness he
paused an instant and before he could make a second effort a voice from
the wigwam struck upon his ear and the strength departed from his arm
he staggered back and awoke to consciousness the sound was repeated it
was the wail of a female voice and its mournful accents coming to his
ear in an interval of the gust struck a new feeling into his bosom he
remembered the captive and his errand of charity and mercy he drew a
deep and painful breath and muttering but within the silent recesses of
his breast thee shall not call to me in vain buried the knife softly
in its sheath then crawling silently away and leaving the chief to his
slumbers he crept through the bushes until he had reached the tent from
which the mourning voice proceeded still lying upon his face he dragged
himself to the door and looking under the corner of the mat that waved
before it in the wind he saw at a glance that he had reached the goal of
his journey

the tent was of an oval figure and of no great extent but being
lighted only by a fire burning dimly in the centre of its earthen floor
and its frail walls darkened by smoke the eye could scarcely penetrate
to its dusky extremity it consisted as has been said of skins which
were supported upon poles wattled together like the framework of a
crate or basket the poles of the opposite sides being kept asunder by
cross-pieces which at the common centre of intersection or radiation
were themselves upheld by a stout wooden pillar upon this pillar and on
the slender rafters were laid or suspended sundry indian utensils of the
kitchen and the field wooden bowls earthen pans and irazen pots guns
hatchets and fish-spears with ears of corn dried roots smoked meats
blankets and skins and many articles that had perhaps been plundered
from the long-knives such as halters and bridles hats coats shawls
and aprons and other such gear among which was conspicuous a bundle of
scalps some of them with long female tresses the proofs of the prowess
of a great warrior who like the other fighting-men of his race
accounted the golden ringlets of a girl as noble a trophy of valour as
the grizzled locks of a veteran soldier

on the floor of the tent piled against its sides and farthest extremity
was the raised platform of skins with rude partitions and curtains of
mats which formed the sleeping-couch or perhaps we might say the
sleeping-apartments of the lodge but these were in a great measure
hidden under heaps of blankets skins and other trumpery articles that
seemed to have been snatched in some sudden hurry from the floor which
they had previously cumbered in fact there was every appearance that
the tent had been for a long time used as a kind of store-room the
receptacle of a bandit's omnium-gatherum and had been hastily prepared
for unexpected inmates but these particulars which he might have noted
at a glance nathan did not pause to survey there were objects of
greater attractions for his eyes in a group of three female figures in
one of whom standing near the fire and grasping the hands and garments
of a second as if imploring pity or protection her hair dishevelled
her visage bloodless her eyes wild with grief and terror he beheld the
object of his perilous enterprise the lovely and unhappy edith
forrester struggling in her grasp as if to escape yet weeping and
uttering hurried expressions that were meant to soothe the agitation of
the captive was the renegade's daughter telie who seemed herself
little less terrified than the prisoner the third person of the group
was an indian beldam old withered and witch-like who sat crouching
over the fire warming her skinny hands and only intermitting her
employment occasionally to eye the more youthful pair with looks of
malignant hatred and suspicion

the gale was still freshening and the elm-boughs rustled loudly in the
wind but nathan could overhear every word of the captive as still
grasping telie by the hand she besought her in the language of
desperation not to leave her not to desert her at such a moment
while telie shedding tears which seemed to be equally those of shame
and sorrow entreated her to fear nothing and permit her to depart

they won't hurt you no my father promised that she said it is the
chief's house and nobody will come nigh to hurt you you are safe lady
but oh my father will kill me if he finds me here

it was your father that caused it all cried edith with a vehement
change of feeling it was he that betrayed us he that killed oh
killed my roland go i hate you heaven will punish you for what you
have done heaven will never forgive the treachery and the murder go
go they will kill me and then all will be well yes all will be
well

but telie thus released no longer sought to fly she strove to obtain
and kiss the hand that repelled her sobbing bitterly and reiterating
her assurances that no harm was designed the maiden

no no harm do i not know it all exclaimed edith again giving
way to her fears and grasping telie's arm you are not like your
father if you betrayed me once you will not betray me again stay with
me yes stay with me and i'll forgive you forgive you all that
man that dreadful man i know him well he will come he has murdered my
cousin and he is oh heaven how black a villain stay with me telie
to protect me from that man stay with me and i'll forgive all you have
done

it was with such wild entreaties edith agitated by an excitement that
seemed almost to have unsettled her brain still urged telie not to
abandon her while telie repeating again and again her protestations
that no injury was designed or could happen and that the old woman at
the fire was specially deputed to protect her and would do so begged to
be permitted to go insisting with every appearance of sincere alarm
that her father would kill her if she remained that he had forbidden
her to come near the prisoner which nevertheless she had secretly
done and would do again if she could this time avoid discovery

but her protestations were of little avail in moving edith to her
purpose and it was only when the latter worn out by suffering and
agitation and sinking helpless on the couch at her feet had no longer
the power to oppose her that telie hurriedly yet with evident grief and
reluctance tore herself away she pressed the captive's hand to her
lips bathed it in her tears and then with many a backward glance of
sorrow stole from the lodge nathan crawled aside as she passed out and
watching a moment until she had fled across the square returned to his
place of observation he looked again into the tent and his heart smote
him with pity as he beheld the wretched edith sitting in a stupor of
despair her head sunk upon her breast her hands clasped her ashy lips
quivering but uttering no articulate sound thee prays heaven to help
thee poor maid he muttered to himself heaven denied the prayer of
them that was as good and as lovely but thee is not yet forsaken

he took his knife from its sheath and turned his eyes upon the old hag
who sat at the fire with her back partly towards him but her eyes
fastened upon the captive over whom they wandered with the fierce and
unappeasable malice that was in those days seen rankling in the breast
of many an indian mother and expended upon prisoners at the stake with
a savage nay a demoniacal zeal that might have put warriors to shame
in truth the unlucky captive had always more to apprehend from the
squaws of a tribe than from its warriors and their cries for vengeance
often gave to the torture wretches whom even their cruel husbands were
inclined to spare

with knife in hand and murderous thoughts in his heart nathan raised a
corner of the mat and glared for a moment upon the beldam but the
feelings of the white-man prevailed he hesitated faltered and dropping
the mat in its place retreated silently from the door then restoring
his knife for a second time to its sheath listening awhile to hear if
the drunken wenonga yet stirred in his lair and taking a survey of the
sleepers at the nearly extinguished fire he crept away retraced his
steps through the village to the place where he had left the captain of
horse-thieves whom to the shame of that worthy be it spoken he found
fast locked in the arms of morpheus and breathing such a melody from his
upturned nostrils as might have roused the whole village from its repose
had not that been at least twice as sound and deep as his own

tarnal death to me said he rubbing his eyes when nathan shook
him from his slumbers i war nigh gone in a dead snooze being as
how i ar'n't had a true reggelar mouthful of snortin this h'yar
no-time considering i always took it with my hoptical peepers right
open but i say nathan what's the last news from the abbregynes and
anngelliferous madam

give me one of thee halters said nathan and do thee observe now what
i have to say to thee

a halter cried ralph in dudgeon you ar'n't for doing all and the
hoss-stealing too

friend said nathan with this halter i must bind one that sits in
watch over the maiden and truly it is better it should be so seeing
that these hands of mine have never been stained with the blood of
woman

and you have found my mistress said ralph in a rapture jist call
the captain and let's be a doing

he is a brave youth and a youth of a mighty heart said nathan but
this is no work for them that has never seen the ways of an injun
village now friend does thee hear me the town is alive with
fighting-men and there is a war-party of fourteen painted wyandotts
sleeping on the council-square but don't thee be dismayed thereupon
for truly these assassin creatures is all besotted with drink and were
there with us but ten stout young men of kentucky i do truly believe we
could knock every murdering dog of an on the head and nobody the wiser
does thee hear friend do but thee own part in this endeavour well and
we will save the young and tender maid thee calls madam take theeself to
the pound which thee may do safely by following the hill pick out four
good horses fleet and strong and carry them safely away going up the
valley mind friend thee must go up as if thee was speeding thee
way to the big lake instead of to kentucky then when thee has ridden a
mile thee may cross the brook and follow the hills till thee has
reached the hiding-place that we did spy from out upon this village thee
hears friend there thee will find the fair maid edith which i will
straightway fetch out of her bondage and truly it may be i have
learned that this night which will make both her and the young man
thee calls captain which is a brave young man both rich and happy and
now friend thee has heard me and thee must do thee duty

if i don't fetch her the beautifullest hoss that war ever seed in the
woods said ralph thar's no reason except because the injuns ar'n't
had good luck this year in grabbing and i'll fetch him round up the
holler jist as you say too and round about till i strike the snuggery
jist the same way for thar's the way you show judgematical and i'm
cl'ar of your way of thinking and so now h'yar's my fo-paw in token
thar's no two ways about me ralph stackpole a hoss to my friends and a
niggur to them that sarves me

with these words the two associates equally zealous in the cause in
which they had embarked parted each to achieve his own particular share
of the adventure in which they had left so little to be done by the
young virginian

but as it happened neither roland's inclination nor fate was favourable
to his playing so insignificant a part in the undertaking he had
remained in the place of concealment assigned him tortured with
suspense and racked by self-reproach for more than an hour until his
impatience getting the better of his judgment he resolved to creep
nigher the village to ascertain if possible the state of affairs he
had arrived within earshot of the pair and without overhearing all had
gathered enough of their conversation to convince him that edith was at
last found and that the blow was now to be struck for her deliverance
his two associates separated before he could reach them ralph plunging
among the bushes that covered the hill while nathan as before stalked
boldly into the village he called softly after the latter to attract
his notice but his voice was lost in the gusts sweeping along the hill
and nathan proceeded onwards without heeding him he hesitated a moment
whether to follow or return to his station where little peter more
obedient or more prudent than himself still lay having resolutely
refused to stir at the soldier's invitation to accompany him until
finally surrendering his discretion to his anxiety he resolved to
pursue after nathan a measure of imprudence if not of folly which at
a less exciting moment no one would have been more ready to condemn than
himself but the image of edith in captivity and perhaps of braxley
standing by the master of her fate was impressed upon his heart as if
pricked into it with daggers and to remain longer at a distance and in
inaction was impossible imitating nathan's mode of advance as well as
he could guided by his dusky figure and hoping soon to overtake him he
pushed forward and was soon in the dreaded village




chapter xxx


in the meanwhile edith sat in the tent abandoned to despair her mind
not yet recovered from the stunning effect of her calamity struggling
confusedly with images of blood and phantasms of fear the dreary
recollections of the past mingling with the scarce less dreadful
anticipations of the future of the battle on the hill-side she
remembered nothing save the fall of her kinsman shot down at her
feet all she had herself witnessed and all she could believe for
telie doe's assurances contradicted in effect by her constant tears and
agitation that he had been carried off to captivity like herself
conveyed no conviction to her mind from that moment events were
pictured on her memory as the records of a feverish dream including all
the incidents of her wild and hurried journey to the indian village but
with these broken and dream-like reminiscences there were associated
recollections vague yet not the less terrifying of a visage that had
haunted her presence by day and by night throughout the whole journey
watching over her with the pertinacity of an evil genius and which as
her faculties woke slowly from their trance assumed every moment a more
distinct and dreaded appearance in her imagination

it was upon these hated features seen side by side with the
blood-stained aspect of her kinsman she now pondered in mingled grief
and terror starting occasionally from the horror of her thoughts only to
be driven back to them again by the scowling eyes of the old crone who
still crouching over the fire as if its warmth could never strike deep
enough into her frozen veins watched every movement and every look with
the vigilance and as it seemed the viciousness of a serpent no ray of
pity shone even for a moment from her forbidding and even hideous
countenance she offered no words she made no signs of sympathy and
as if to prove her hearty disregard or profound contempt for the
prisoner's manifest distress she by and by to while the time began to
drone out a succession of grunting sounds such as make up a red-man's
melody and such indeed as any village urchin can drum with his heels out
of an empty hogshead the song thus barbarously chanted at first
startled and affrighted the captive but its monotony had at last an
effect which the beldam was far from designing it diverted the maiden's
mind in a measure from its own harassing thoughts and thus introduced a
kind of composure where all had been before painful agitation nay as
the sounds which were at no time very loud mingled with the piping of
the gale without and the rustling of the old elm at the door they lost
their harshness and were softened into a descant that was lulling to the
senses and might like a gentler nepenthe have in time cheated the
over-weary mind to repose such perhaps was beginning to be its effect
edith ceased to bend upon the hag the wild terrified looks that at first
rewarded the music she sunk her head upon her bosom and sat as if
gradually giving way to a lethargy of spirit which if not sleep was
sleep's most beneficent substitute

from this state of calm she was roused by the sudden cessation of the
music and looking up she beheld with a renewal of all her alarms a
tall man standing before her his face and figure both enveloped in the
folds of a huge blanket from which however a pair of gleaming eyes
were seen riveted upon her own countenance at the same time she
observed that the old indian woman had risen and was stealing softly
from the apartment filled with terror she would have rushed after the
hag to claim her protection but she was immediately arrested by the
visitor who seizing her by the arm firmly yet with an air of respect
and suffering his blanket to drop to the ground displayed to her gaze
features that had long dwelt its darkest phantoms upon her mind as he
seized her he muttered and still with an accent of the most earnest
respect fear me not edith i am not yet an enemy

his voice though one of gentleness and even of music completed the
terrors of the captive who trembled in his hand like a quail in the
clutches of a kite and would but for his grasp as powerful to sustain
as to oppose have fallen to the floor her lips quivered but they gave
forth no sound and her eyes were fastened upon his with a wildness and
intensity of glare that showed the fascination the temporary
self-abandonment of her spirit

fear me not edith forrester he repeated with a voice even more
soothing than before you know me i am no savage i will do you no
harm

yes yes yes muttered edith at last but in the tones of an
automaton they were at first so broken and inarticulate though they
gathered force and vehemence as she spoke i know you yes yes i do
know you and know you well you are richard braxley the robber and
now the persecutor of the orphan and this hand that holds me is red with
the blood of my cousin oh villain villain are you not yet content

the prize is not yet won replied the other with a smile that seemed
intended to express his contempt of the maiden's invectives and his
ability to forgive them i am indeed richard braxley the friend of
edith forrester though she will not believe it a rough and self-willed
one it may be but still her true and unchangeable friend where will
she look for a better anger has not alienated contempt has not
estranged me injury and injustice still find me the same i am still
edith forrester's friend and such in the sturdiness of my affection i
will remain whether my fair mistress will or no but you are feeble and
agitated sit down and listen to me i have that to say which will
convince my thoughtless fair the day of disdain is now over

all these expressions though uttered with seeming blandness were yet
accompanied by an air of decision and even command as if the speaker
were conscious the maiden was fully in his power and not unwilling she
should know it but his attempt to make her resume her seat upon the pile
of skins from which she had so wildly started at his entrance was
resisted by edith who gathering courage from desperation and shaking
his hand from her arm as if snatching it from the embraces of a serpent
replied with even energy i will not sit down i will not listen to
you approach me not touch me not you are a villain and murderer and
i loathe oh unspeakably loathe your presence away from me or 

or interrupted braxley with the sneer of a naturally mean and
vindictive spirit you will cry for assistance from whom do you expect
it from wild murderous besotted indians who if roused from their
drunken slumbers would be more like to assail you with their hatchets
than to weep for your sorrows know fair edith that you are now in
their hands that there is not one of them who would not rather see
those golden tresses hung blackening in the smoke from the rafters of his
wigwam than floating over the brows they adorn look aloft there are
ringlets of young and fair the innocent and tender swinging above
you learn moreover that from these dangerous friends there is none
who can protect you save me ay my beauteous edith he added as the
captive overcome by the representation of her perils so unscrupulously
nay so sternly made sank almost fainting upon the pile it is even so
and you must know it it is needful you should know what you have to
expect if you reject my protection but that you will not reject in
faith you cannot the time has come as i told you it would when your
disdainful scruples i speak plainly fair edith are to be at an end i
swore to you and it was when your scorn and unbelief were at the
highest that you should yet smile upon the man you disdained and smile
upon no other it was a rough and uncouth threat for a lover but my
mistress would have it so it was a vow breathed in anger but it was a
vow not meant to be broken you tremble i am cruel in my wooing but
this is not the moment for compliment and deception you are mine
edith i swore it to myself ay and to you you cannot escape you have
driven me to extremities but they have succeeded you are mine or you
are nothing

nothing let it be said edith over whose mind prone to agitation and
terror it was evident the fierce and domineering temper of the
individual could exercise an irresistible control and who though yet
striving to resist was visibly sinking before his stern looks and
menacing words let it be nothing kill me if you will as you have
already killed my cousin oh mockery of passion of humanity of
decency to speak to me thus to me the relative the more than
sister of him you have so basely and cruelly murdered

i have murdered no one said braxley with stony composure and if you
will but listen patiently you will find i am stained by no crime save
that of loving a woman who forces me to woo her like a master rather
than a slave your cousin is living and in safety

it is false cried edith wringing her hands with my own eyes i saw
him fall and fall covered with blood

and from that moment you saw nothing more rejoined braxley the blood
came from the veins of others he was carried away alive and almost
unhurt he is a captive a captive like yourself and why shall i
remind my fair edith how much of her hostility and scorn i owed to her
hot and foolish kinsman how he persuaded her the love she so naturally
bore so near a relative was reason enough to reject the affection of a
suitor how impossible she should listen to the dictates of her own
heart or the calls of her interest while misled by a counsellor so
indiscreet and yet so trusted before that unlucky young man stepped
between me and my love edith forrester could listen ay and could
smile nay deny it if you will but hearken your cousin is safe rely
upon that but rely also he will never again see the home of his
birth or the kinswoman whose fortunes he has so opposed until she is
the wife of the man he misjudges and hates he is removed from my path
it was necessary to my hopes his life is at all events safe his
deliverance rests with his kinswoman when she has plighted her troth
and surely she will plight it 

never never cried edith starting up her indignation for a moment
getting the better of her fears with one so false and treacherous so
unprincipled and ungrateful so base and revengeful with such a man
with such a villain never no never

i am a villain indeed edith said braxley but with exemplary
coolness all men are so good and evil are sown together in our
natures and each has its season and its harvest in this breast as in
the breast of the worst and the noblest nature set at birth an angel
and a devil either to be the governor of my actions as either should be
best encouraged if the devil be now at work and have been for months
it was because your scorn called him from his slumbers before that time
edith i was under the domination of my angel who then called or who
deemed me a villain was i then a robber and persecutor of the orphan
am i now perhaps so but it is yourself that have made me so for
you i called up my evil genius to my aid and my evil-genius aided me
he bade me woo no longer like the turtle but strike like the falcon
through plots and stratagems through storms and perils through battle
and blood i have pursued you and i have conquered at last the captive
of my sword and spear you will spurn my love no longer for in truth
you cannot i came to the wilderness to seek an heiress for your uncle's
wealth i have found her but she returns to her inheritance the wife of
the seeker in a word my edith for why should i who am now the master
of your fate forbear the style of a conqueror why should i longer sue
who have the power to command you are mine mine beyond the
influence of caprice or change mine beyond the hope of escape this
village you will never leave but as a bride

so spoke the bold wooer elated by the consciousness of successful
villany and perhaps convinced from long experience of the timorous and
doubtless feeble character of the maid that a haughty and overbearing
tone would produce an impression however painful it might be to her
more favourable to his hopes than the soft hypocrisy of sueing he was
manifestly resolved to wring from her fears the consent not to be
obtained from her love nor had he miscalculated the power of such a
display of bold unflinching energetic determination in awing if not
bending her youthful spirit she seemed indeed stunned wholly
overpowered by his resolved and violent manner and she had scarcely
strength to mutter the answer that rose to her lips

if it be so she faltered out this village then i must never leave
for here i will die die even by the hands of barbarians and die a
thousand times ere i look upon you base and cruel man with any but the
eyes of detestation i hated you ever i hate you yet

my fair mistress said braxley with a sneer that might have well
become the lip of the devil he had pronounced the then ruler of his
breast knows not all the alternative death is a boon the savages may
bestow when the whim takes them but before that they must show their
affection for their prisoner there are many that can admire the bright
eyes and ruddy cheeks of the white maiden and some one doubtless will
admit the stranger to a corner of his wigwam and his bosom ay madam i
will speak plainly it is as the wife of richard braxley or of a pagan
savage you go out of the tent of wenonga or why go out of the tent of
wenonga at all is wenonga insensible to the beauty of his guest the hag
that i drove from the fire seemed already to see in her prisoner the
maid that was to rob her of her husband

heaven help me exclaimed edith sinking again to her seat wholly
overcome by the horrors it was the object of the wooer to accumulate on
her mind he noted the effect of his threat and stealing up he took her
trembling almost lifeless hand adding but in a softer voice 

why will edith drive one who adores her to these extremities let her
smile but as she smiled of yore and all will yet be well one smile
secures her deliverance from all that she dreads her restoration to her
home and to happiness with that smile the angel again awakes in my
bosom and all is love and tenderness

heaven help me iterated the trembling girl struggling to shake off
braxley's hand but she struggled feebly and in vain and braxley in the
audacity of his belief that he had frightened her into a more reasonable
mood proceeded the length of throwing an arm around his almost
insensible victim

but heaven was not unmindful of the prayer of the desolate and helpless
maid scarce had his arm encircled the waist of the captive when a pair
of arms long and brawny infolded his body as in the hug of an angry
bear and in an instant he lay upon his back on the floor a knee upon
his breast a hand at his throat and a knife glittering blood-red in
the light of the fire flourished within an inch of his eyes while a
voice subdued to a whisper yet distinct as if uttered in tones of
thunder muttered in his ear speak and thee dies

the attack so wholly unexpected so sudden and so violent was as
irresistible as astounding and braxley unnerved by the surprise and by
fear succumbing as to the stroke of an avenging angel the protector of
innocence whom his villany had conjured from the air lay gasping upon
the earth without attempting the slightest resistance while the
assailant dropping his knife and producing a long cord of twisted
leather proceeded with inexpressible dexterity and speed to bind his
limbs which he did in a manner none the less effectual for being so
hasty an instant sufficed to secure him hand and foot in another a gag
was clapped in his mouth and secured by a turn of the rope round his
neck at the third the conqueror thrusting his hand into his bosom
tore from it the stolen will which he immediately after buried in his
own then spurning the baffled villain into a corner and flinging over
his body a pile of skins and blankets until he was entirely hidden from
sight he left him to the combined agonies of fear darkness and
suffocation

such was the rapidity indeed with which the whole affair was conducted
that braxley had scarce time to catch a glimpse of his assailant's
countenance and that glimpse without abating his terror took but
little from his amazement it was the countenance of an indian or such
it seemed grimly and hideously painted over with figures of snakes
lizards skulls and other savage devices which were repeated upon the
arms the half-naked bosom and even the squalid shirt of the victor one
glance in the confusion and terror of the moment braxley gave to his
extraordinary foe and then the mantles piled upon his body concealed all
objects from his eyes

in the meanwhile edith not less confounded sat cowering with terror
until the victor having completed his task sprang to her side a
movement however that only increased her dismay crying with warning
gestures fear not and speak not up and away when perceiving she
recoiled from him with all her feeble strength and was indeed unable to
rise he caught her in his arms muttering thee is safe thee friends
is nigh and bore her swiftly yet noiselessly from the tent




chapter xxxi


the night was even darker than before the fire of the wyandotts on the
square had burned so low as no longer to send even a ray to the hut of
wenonga and the wind though subsiding still kept up a sufficient din
to drown the ordinary sound of footsteps under such favourable
circumstances nathan for as may be supposed it was this faithful
friend who had snatched the forlorn edith from the grasp of the betrayer
stalked boldly from the hut bearing the rescued maiden in his arms and
little doubting that having thus so successfully accomplished the first
and greatest step in the enterprise he could now conclude it in safety
if not with ease

but there were perils yet to be encountered which the man of peace had
not taken into anticipation and which indeed would not have existed
had his foreboding doubts of the propriety of admitting either of his
associates and honest stackpole especially to a share of the exploit
been suffered to influence his counsels to the exclusion of that worthy
but unlucky personage altogether he had scarce stepped from the
tent-door before there arose on the sudden and at no great distance from
the square over which he was hurrying his precious burden a horrible
din a stamping snorting galloping and neighing of horses as if a
dozen famished bears or wolves had suddenly made their way into the
indian pinfold carrying death and distraction into the whole herd and
this alarming omen was almost instantly followed by an increase of all
the uproar as if the animals had broken loose from the pound and were
rushing mad with terror towards the centre of the village

at the first outbreak of the tumult nathan had dropped immediately into
the bushes before the wigwam but perceiving that the sounds increased
and were actually drawing nigh and that the sleepers were waking on the
square he sprang again to his feet and flinging his blanket around
edith who was yet incapable of aiding herself resolved to make a bold
effort to escape while darkness and the confusion of the enemy
permitted there was in truth not a moment to be lost the slumbers of
the barbarians proverbially light at all times and readily broken even
when the stupor of intoxication has steeped their faculties were not
proof against sounds at once so unusual and so uproarious a sudden yell
of surprise bursting from one point was echoed by another and another
voice and in a moment the square resounded with these signals of
alarm added to the wilder screams which some of them set up of
long-knives long-knives as if the savages supposed themselves
suddenly beset by a whole army of charging kentuckians

it was at this moment of dismay and confusion that nathan rose from the
earth and all other paths being now cut off darted across a corner of
the square towards the river which was in a quarter opposite to that
whence the sounds came in hopes to reach the alder-thicket on its banks
before being observed and this perhaps he would have succeeded in
reaching had not fortune which seemed this night to give a loose to all
her fickleness prepared a new and greater difficulty

as he rose from the bushes some savage possessed of greater presence of
mind than his fellows cast a decaying brand from the fire into the heap
of dried grass and maize-husks designed for their couches which
bursting immediately into a furious flame illuminated the whole square
and village and revealed as it was designed to do the cause of the
wondrous uproar a dozen or more horses were instantly seen galloping
into the square followed by a larger and denser herd behind all
agitated by terror all plunging rearing prancing and kicking as if
possessed by a legion of evil spirits though driven as was made
apparent by the yells which the indians set up on seeing him by nothing
more than the agency of a human being

at the first flash of the flames seizing upon the huge bed of straw and
whirling up in the gust in a prodigious volume nathan gave up all for
lost not doubting that he would be instantly seen and assailed but the
spectacle of their horses dashing madly into the square with the cause
of the tumult seen struggling among them in the apparition of a white
man sitting aloft entangled inextricably in the thickest of the herd
and evidently borne forward with no consent of his own was metal more
attractive for indian eyes and nathan perceived that he was not only
neglected in the confusion by all but was likely to remain so long
enough to enable him to put the thicket betwixt him and the danger of
discovery

the knave has endangered us and to the value of the scalp on his own
foolish head muttered nathan his indignation speaking in a voice
louder than a whisper but truly he will pay the price and truly
his loss is the maiden's redeeming

he darted forwards as he spoke but his words had reached the ears of
one who cowering like himself among the weeds around wenonga's hut now
started suddenly forth and displayed to his eyes the young virginian
who rushing eagerly up clasped the rescued captive in his arms
crying forward now for the love of heaven forward forward

thee has ruined all cried nathan with bitter reproach as edith
rousing from insensibility at the well known voice opened her eyes upon
her kinsman and all unmindful of the place of meeting unconscious of
everything but his presence the presence of him whose supposed death
she had so long lamented sprang to his embrace with a cry of joy that
was heard over the whole square a tone of happiness pealing above the
rush of the winds and the uproar of men and animals thee has ruined
all theeself and the maid save thee own life

with these words nathan strove to tear edith from his grasp to make one
more effort for her rescue and roland yielding her to his superior
strength and perceiving that a dozen indians were running against them
drew his tomahawk and with a self-devotion which marked his love his
consciousness of error and his heroism of character waved nathan away
while he himself rushed back upon the pursuers not so much however in
the vain hope of disputing the path as by laying down his life on the
spot to purchase one more hope of escape to his edith

the act so unexpectedly so audaciously bold drew a shout of admiration
from throats which had before only uttered yells of fury but it was
mingled with fierce laughter as the savages without hesitating at or
indeed seeming at all to regard his menacing position ran upon him in a
body and avoiding the only blow they gave him the power to make seized
and disarmed him a result that notwithstanding his fierce and furious
struggles was effected in less space than we have taken to describe it
then leaving him in the hands of two of their number who proceeded to
bind him securely the others rushed after nathan who though encumbered
by his burden again inanimate her arms clasped around his neck as they
had been round that of her kinsman made the most desperate exertions to
bear her off seeming to regard her weight no more than if the burden had
been a cushion of thistle-down he ran for a moment with astonishing
activity leaping over bush and gully where such crossed his path with
such prodigious strength and suppleness of frame as to the savages
appeared little short of miraculous and it is more than probable he
might have effected his escape had he chosen to abandon the helpless
edith as it was he for a time bade fair to make his retreat good he
reached the low thicket that fringed the river and one more step would
have found him in at least temporary security but that step was never
to be taken as he approached two tall barbarians suddenly sprang from
the cover where they had been taking their drunken slumbers and
responding with exulting whoops to the cries of the others they leaped
forward to secure him he turned aside running downwards to where a
lonely wigwam surrounded by trees offered the concealment of its
shadow but he turned too late a dozen fierce wolf-like dogs rushing
from the cabin and emboldened by the cries of the pursuers rushed
upon him hanging to his skirts and entangling his legs rending and
tearing all the while so that he could fly no longer the indians were
at his heels their shouts were in his ears their hands were almost
upon his shoulders he stopped and turning towards them with a gesture
and look of desperate defiance and still more desperate hatred
exclaimed here devils cut and hack your time has come and i am the
last of them and holding edith at the length of his arm he pulled open
his garment as if to invite the death-stroke

but his death at least at that moment was not sought after by the
indians they seized him and edith being torn from his hands dragged
him with endless whoops towards the fire whither they had previously
borne the captured roland over whom as over himself they yelled their
triumph while screams of rage from those who had clashed among the
horses after the daring white man who had been seen among them and the
confusion that still prevailed showed that he also had fallen into
their hands

the words of defiance which nathan breathed at the moment of yielding
were the last he uttered submitting passively to his fate he was
dragged onwards by a dozen hands a dozen voices around him vociferating
their surprise at his appearance even more energetically than the joy of
their triumph his indian habiliments and painted body evidently struck
them with astonishment which increased as they drew nearer the fire and
could better distinguish the extraordinary devices he had traced so
carefully on his breast and visage their looks of inquiry their
questions jabbered freely in broken english as well as in their own
tongue nathan regarded no more than their taunts and menaces replying
to these as to all only with a wild and haggard stare which seemed to
awe several of the younger warriors who began to exchange looks of
peculiar meaning at last as they drew nearer the fire an old indian
staggered among the group who made way for him with a kind of respect
as was indeed his due for he was no other than the old black-vulture
himself limping up to the prisoner with as much ferocity as his
drunkenness would permit he laid one hand upon his shoulder and with
the other aimed a furious hatchet-blow at his head the blow was arrested
by the renegade doe or atkinson who made his appearance at the same
time with wenonga and muttered some words in the shawnee tongue which
seemed meant to soothe the old man's fury

me injun-man said the chief addressing his words to the prisoner and
therefore in the prisoner's language me kill all white-man me
wenonga me drink white-mans blood me no heart and to impress the
truth of his words on the prisoner's mind he laid his right hand from
which the axe had been removed as well as his left on nathan's
shoulder in which position supporting himself he nodded and wagged his
head in the other's face with as savage a look of malice as he could
infuse into his drunken features to this the prisoner replied by bending
upon the chief a look more hideous than his own and indeed so strangely
unnatural and revolting with lips so retracted features so distorted by
some nameless passion and eyes gleaming with fires so wild and
unearthly that even wenonga chief as he was and then in no condition
to be daunted by anything drew slowly back removing his hands from the
prisoner's shoulder who immediately fell down in horrible convulsions
the foam flying from his lips and his fingers clenching like spikes of
iron into the flesh of two indians that had hold of him

taunts questions and whoops were heard no more among the captors who
drew aside from their wretched prisoner as if from the darkest of their
manitoes all looking on with unconcealed wonder and awe the only
person indeed who seemed undismayed at the spectacle was the renegade
who as nathan shook and writhed in the fit beheld the corner of a piece
of parchment projecting from the bosom of his shirt and looking vastly
like that identical instrument he had seen but an hour or two before in
the hands of braxley stooping down and making as if he would have
raised the convulsed man in his arms he drew the parchment from its
hiding-place and unobserved by the indians transferred it to a secret
place in his own garments he then rose up and stood like the rest
looking upon the prisoner until the fit had passed off which it did in
but a few moments nathan starting to his feet and looking around him in
the greatest wildness as if for a moment not only unconscious of what
had befallen him but even of his captivity

but unconsciousness of the latter calamity was of no great duration and
was dispelled by the old chief saying but with looks of drunken respect
that had succeeded his insane fury me brudder great-medicine white-man
great white-man medicine me wenonga great injun-captain great
kill-man-white-man kill-all-man man-man squaw-man little papoose-man
me make medicine-man brudder-man medicine-man tell wenonga all
jibbenainosay where find jibbenainosay how kill jibbenainosay kill
white-man's devil-man medicine-man tell injun-man why medicine-man come
injun town steal injun prisoner steal injun hoss me wenonga me good
brudder medicine-man

this gibberish with which he seemed besides expressing much new-born
good will to intimate that his cause lay in the belief that the prisoner
was a great white conjuror who could help him to a solution of sundry
interesting questions the old chief pronounced with much solemnity and
suavity and he betrayed an inclination to continue it the captors of
nathan standing by and looking on with vast and eager interest but a
sudden and startling yell from the indians who had charge of the young
virginian preceded by an exclamation from the renegade who had stolen
among them upset the curiosity of the party or rather substituted a
new object for admiration which set them all running towards the fire
where roland lay bound the cause of the excitement was nothing less than
the discovery which doe had just made of the identity of the prisoner
with roland forrester whom he had with his own hands delivered into
those of the merciless piankeshaws and whose escape from them and sudden
appearance in the shawnee village were events just as wonderful to the
savages as the supposed powers of the white medicine-man his associate

but there was still a third prodigy to be wondered at the third prisoner
was dragged from among the horses to the fire where he was almost
immediately recognised by half a dozen different warriors as the
redoubted and incorrigible horse-thief captain stackpole the wonderful
conjuror and the wonderful young long-knife who was one moment a
captive in the hands of piankeshaws on the banks of the wabash and the
next an invader of a shawnee village in the valley of the miami were
both forgotten the captain of horse-thieves was a much more wonderful
person or at least a much more important prize his name was howled
aloud and in a moment became the theme of every tongue and he was
instantly surrounded by every man in the village we may say every
woman and child too for the alarm had brought the whole village into
the square and the shrieks of triumph the yells of unfeigned delight
with which all welcomed a prisoner so renowned and so detested produced
an uproar ten times greater than that which gave the alarm

it was indeed stackpole the zealous and unlucky slave of a mistress whom
it was his fate to injure and wrong in every attempt he made to serve
her and who had brought himself and his associates to their present
bonds by merely toiling on the present occasion too hard in her service
it seems for so he was used himself to tell the tale that he entered
the indian pound with the resolution to fulfil nathan's instructions to
the letter and he accordingly selected four of the best animals of the
herd which he succeeded in haltering without difficulty or noise had he
paused here he might have retreated with his prizes without fear of
discovery but the excellence of the opportunity the best he had ever
had in his life the excellence too of the horses thirty or forty in
number the primest and beautifullest critturs he averred what war
ever seed in a hoss-pound with a notion which now suddenly beset his
grateful brain namely that by carrying off the whole herd he could
make anngelliferous madam rich in the item of hoss-flesh proved too
much for his philosophy and his judgment and after holding a council of
war in his own mind he came to a resolution to steal the lot

this being determined upon he imitated the example of magnanimity lately
set him by nathan stripped off and converted his venerable wrap-rascal
into extemporary halters and so made sure of half a dozen more of the
best horses with which and the four first selected not doubting that
the remainder of the herd would readily follow at their heels he crept
from the fold to make his way up the valley and round among the hills
to the rendezvous but that was a direction in which as he soon learned
to his cost neither the horses he had in hand nor those that were to
follow in freedom had the slightest inclination to go and there
immediately ensued a struggle between the stealer and the stolen which
in the space of a minute or less resulted in the whole herd making a
demonstration towards the centre of the village whither they succeeded
both in carrying themselves and the vainly resisting horse-thief who was
borne along on the backs of those he had haltered like a land-bird on
the bosom of a torrent incapable alike of resisting or escaping the
flood

in this manner he was taken in a trap of his own making as many a better
and wiser man of the world has been and daily is and it was no
melioration of his distress to think he had whelmed his associates in his
ruin and defeated the best and last hopes of his benefactress it was
with such feelings at his heart that he was dragged up to the fire to
be exulted over and scolded at as long as it should seem good to his
captors but the latter exhausted by the day's revels and satisfied
with their victory so complete and so bloodless soon gave over
tormenting him resolving however that he should be soundly beaten at
the gantelope on the morrow for the especial gratification and in
honour of the wyandott party their guests

this resolution being made he was like roland and nathan led away
bound each being bestowed in a different hut where they were committed
to safer guards than had been appointed to watch over edith and in an
hour after the village was again wrapped in repose the last to betake
themselves to their rest were doe and his confederate braxley the
latter of whom had been released from his disagreeable bonds when edith
was carried back to the tent it was while following doe to his cabin
that he discovered the loss of the precious document upon the possession
of which he had built so many stratagems and so many hopes of success
his agitation and confusion were so great at the time of nathan's
assault that he was wholly unaware it had been taken from him by this
assailant and doe to whom its possession opened newer and bolder
prospects and who had already formed a design for using it to his own
advantage effected to believe that he had dropped it on the way and
would easily recover it on the morrow as no indian could possibly
attach the least value to it

another subject of agitation to braxley was the reappearance of his
rival who however doe assured him was now as certainly a dead man
as if twenty bullets had been driven through his body he is in the
hands of the old vulture said he grimly and he will burn in fire
jist as sure as we will dick braxley when the devil gits us that
is unless we ourselves save him

we jack said the other with a laugh and yet who knows how the wind
may blow you but an hour ago you were as remorseful over the lad's
supposed death as you are now apparently indifferent what befalls him

it is true replied doe coolly but see the difference when the
piankeshaws were burning him or when i thought the dogs were at it it
was a death of my making for him it was i that helped him to the
stake but here the case is altered he comes here on his own hook the
injuns catch him on his own hook and d n them they'll burn him on
his own hook and so it's no matter of my consarning there's the root of
it

this explanation satisfied his suspicious ally and having conversed a
while longer on what appeared to them most wonderful and interesting in
the singular attempt at the rescue the two retired to their repose




chapter xxxii


the following day was one of unusual animation and bustle in the indian
village as the prisoners could distinguish even from their several
places of confinement without however being sensible of the cause
prom sunrise until after mid-day they heard at intervals volleys of
fire-arms shot off at the skirts of the town which being followed by
shrill halloos as from those who fired them were immediately re-echoed
by all the throats in the village men women children and dogs uniting
in a clamour that was plainly the outpouring of savage exultation and
delight it seemed as if parties of warriors returning victorious from
the lands of the long-knife were time after time marching into and
through the village proclaiming the success of their arms and
exhibiting the trophies of their triumph the hubbub increased the
shouts became more frequent and multitudinous and the village for a
second time seemed given up to the wildest and maddest revelry to the
sway of unchained demons or of men abandoned to all the horrible
impulses of lycanthropy

during all this time the young virginian lay bound in a wigwam guarded
by a brace of old warriors who occasionally varied the tedium of
watching by stalking to the door where like yelping curs paying their
respects to passers-by they up-lifted their voices and vented a yell or
two in testimony of their approbation of what was going on without now
and then also they even left the wigwam but never for more than a few
moments at a time when having thus amused themselves they would
return squat themselves down by the prisoner's side and proceed to
entertain him with sundry long-winded speeches in their own dialect of
which of course he understood not a word wrapped in his own bitter
thoughts baffled in his last hope and now grown indifferent what might
befall him he lay upon the earthen floor during the whole day expecting
almost every moment to behold some of the shouting crew of the village
rush into the hovel and drag him away to the tortures which at that
period were so often the doom of the prisoner

but the solitude of his prison-house was invaded only by his two old
jailers and it was not until nightfall that he beheld a third human
countenance at that period telie doe stole trembling into the hut
bringing him food which she set before him but with looks of deep grief
and deeper abasement which he might have attributed to shame and remorse
for a part played in the scheme of captivity had not all her actions
shown that although acquainted with the meditated outrage she was
sincerely desirous to avert it

her appearance awakened his dormant spirits and recalled the memory of
his kinswoman of whom he besought her to speak though well aware she
could speak neither hope nor comfort but scarce had telie more abashed
and more sorrowful at the question opened her lips to reply when one of
the old indians interposed with a frown of displeasure and taking her
by the arm led her angrily to the door where he waved her away with
gestures that seemed to threaten a worse reception should she presume to
return

thus thwarted and driven back again upon his own reflections roland gave
himself up to despondency awaiting with sullen indifference the fate
which he had no doubt was preparing for him but he was doomed once more
to experience the agitations of hope the tormentor not less than the
soother of existence

soon after nightfall and when his mind was in a condition resembling the
hovel in which he lay a cheerless ruin lighted only by occasional
flickerings from a fire of spirit fast smouldering into ashes he heard a
step enter the door and by and by a jabbering debate commenced between
the newcomer and his guards which resulted in the latter presently
leaving the cabin the intruder then stepped up to the fire which he
stirred into a flame and seating himself full in its light revealed
somewhat to roland's surprise the form and visage of the renegade abel
doe whose acts on the hill-side had sufficiently impressed his
lineaments on the soldier's memory he eyed the captive for awhile very
earnestly but in deep silence which roland himself was the first to
break

to the soldier however bent upon preserving the sullen equanimity which
was his best substitute for resignation there was enough in the
appearance of this man to excite the fiercest emotions of indignation
others might have planned the villany which had brought ruin and misery
upon his head but it was doe who for the bravo's price and with the
bravo's baseness had set the toils around him and struck the blow
it was indeed only through the agency of such an accomplice that
braxley could have put his schemes into execution or ventured even to
attempt them the blood boiled in his veins as he surveyed the mercenary
and unprincipled hireling and strove though in vain to rise upon his
fettered arms to give energy to his words of denunciation

villain he cried base wretched dastardly caitiff have you come to
boast the fruits of your rascally crime

right captain replied doe with a consenting nod of the head you
have nicked me on the right p'int villain's the true word to begin on
and perhaps twill be the one to end on but that's as we shall
conclude about it after we have talked the matter over

begone wretch trouble me not said roland i have nothing to say to
you but to curse you

well i reckon that's natteral enough too that cussing of me said
doe seeing as how i've in a manner deserved it but there's an end to
all things even to cussing and may be you'll jist take a jump the
other way when the gall's over a friend to-day an enemy to-morrow as
the saying is and you may jist as well say it backwards for as things
turn up i'm no sich blasted enemy jist now no-way no-how i'm for
holding a peace talk as the injuns say d n em burying the axe and
taking a whiff or two at the kinnikinick of friendship so cuss away if
it will do you good and i'll stand it but as for being off why i don't
mean it noway i've got a bargain to strike with you and it is jist a
matter to take the tiger-cat out of you it is d n it and when you've
heard it you'll be in no sich hurry to get rid of me but afore we
begin i've jist got a matter to ax you and that is how the h   you
cleared the old piankeshaw and his young uns

if you have anything to propose to me said roland smothering his
wrath as well as he could though scarce hoping assistance or comfort of
any kind from the man who had done him so much injury propose it and
be brief and trouble me with no questions

well now said doe a civil question might as well have a civil
answer if you killed the old feller and the young-uns you needn't be
ashamed of it for cuss me i think all the better of you for it for
it's not every feller can kill three injuns that has him in the tugs by
no means no-how but i reckon the ramscallions took to the liquor
injuns will be injuns there's no two ways about it and you riz on
em and so paid em up scot and lot according to their desarvings you
couldn't have done a better thing to make me beholden for you see i
had the giving of you up to em and i felt bad i did d n me for i
knew the butchers would burn you if they got you to the wabash i did
captain and i had bad thoughts about it but it was a cussed mad
notion of you following us it was there's no denying howsomever
i won't talk of that i jist want to ax you where you picked up that
injun-looking feller that was lugging off the gal and what his natur
the injuns say he's a conjuror now i never heerd of conjurors among
the whites like as among the injuns afore i cut loose from em and i'm
cur'ous on the subject i jist ax you a civil question and i don't mean
no harm in it there's nobody can make the feller out and as for ralph
stackpole blast him he says he never seed the crittur afore in his
life

if you would have me answer your question said roland in whom doe's
discourse was beginning to stir up many a former feeling you must first
answer mine this person you speak of what is to be his fate

why burning i reckon but that's according as he pleases the old
vulture for if he can find out what never an injun medicine has been
able to do it may be the old chief will feed him up and make him his
conjuror they say he's conjuring with the crittur now

and stackpole what will they do with him

burn him sartin they're jist waiting till the warriors come in from
the licking where you must know they have taken a hundred scalps or
so at one grab and then the feller will roast beyond all mention

and i too said the virginian with such calmness us he could i
too am to meet the same fate

most ondoubtedly said doe with an ominous nod of assent there's
them among us that speak well of you as having heart enough to be made
an injun but there's them that have sworn you shall burn and burn you
must that is onless  but he was interrupted by roland exclaiming
hurriedly 

there is but one more to speak of my cousin my poor friendless
cousin

there said doe you needn't be afeard of burning by no means
whatsomever we didn't catch the gal to make a roast of she is safe
enough there's one that will take care of her

and that one is the villain braxley oh knave that you are could you
have the heart you who have a daughter of your own could you have
committed her into the arms of such a villain

no by g   i couldn't said doe with great earnestness but
another man's daughter is quite another thing howsomever you needn't
take on for nothing for he means to marry her and take her safe back to
virginny and you see i bargained with him agin all rascality for i
had a gal of my own and i couldn't think of his playing foul with the
poor creatur no we had an understanding about all that when we was
waiting for you on old salt all dick wants is jist a wife that will help
him to them lands of the old major and that you see is jist the whole
reason of our making the grab on you

you confess it then cried roland too much excited by the bitterest
of passions to be surprised at the singular communicativeness of his
visitor you sold yourself to the villain for gold for gold you
hesitated not to sacrifice the happiness of one victim of his passions
the life of another oh basest of all that bear the name of man how
could you do this villany

because replied doe with as much apparent sincerity as emphasis
because i am a d d rascal there's no sort of doubt about it and we
won't be tender the way we talk of it i was an honest man once captain
but i am a rascal now warp and woof skin-deep and heart-deep ay to
the bones and marrow i am all the way a rascal but don't look as if
you was astonished already i come to make a clean breast of all sorts of
matters jist captain for a little bit of your advantage and my own
and there's things coming that will make you look a leetle of a sight
wilder and first and foremost to begin have you any particular
longing to be out of this here injun town and well shut of the d d fire
torture

have i any desire to be free mad question

well captain i'm jist the man and the only one that can help you
for them that would can't and them that can won't and secondly and
lastly captain as the parsons say in the settlements have you any
hankering to be the master of the old major your uncle's lands and
houses

if you come to mock and torture me said roland but was interrupted
by the renegade

it is jist to save you from the torture said he that i'm now
speaking for cuss me the more i think of it the more i can't stand it
no-how i'm a rascal captain but i'm no tiger-cat especially to them
that hasn't misused me and there's the grit of a man about you that
strikes my feelings exactly but you see captain there's a bargain
first to be struck between us afore i comes up to the rack but i'll
make tarms easy

make them what you will and but alas where shall i find means to
repay you i who am robbed of everything

didn't i say i could help you to the major's lands and houses and a'n't
they a fortun for an emperor

you you help me help me to them

captain said the renegade with sundry emphatic nods of the head i'm
a sight more of a rascal than you ever dreamed on and this snapping of
you up by injun deviltry that you think so hard of is but a small part
of my misdoings i've been slaving agin you this sixteen years more of
less slaving that's the word for i made a niggur of myself to rob
you of these here very lands that i'm now thinking of helping you to you
don't believe me captain well did you ever hear of a certain honest
feller of old augusta called john atkinson

hah cried the soldier looking with new eyes upon the renegade you
are then the fellow upon whose perjured testimony braxley relied to
sustain his frauds

the identical same man john atkinson or jack as they used to call me
but now abel doe for convenience sake said the refugee with great
composure and so now you can see into the whole matter it was me
that had the keeping of the major's daughter that you knows of well
i was an honest feller in them days i was captain by g   repeated
the fellow with something that sounded like remorseful utterance and
jist as contented in my cabin on the mountain as the old major himself in
his big house at felhallow but dick braxley came d n him and there
was an end of all honest doings for dick was high with the old major
and the major was agin his brothers and says dick says he put but
this little gal meaning the major's daughter out of the way and i'm
jist as good as the major's heir and i'll make your fortun 

ay and it was he then the villain himself cried roland who
devised this horrible iniquity which by innuendo at least he charged
upon my father you are a rascal indeed and you murdered the poor
child

murdered no rat it there was no murdering in the case it was jist
hiding in a hole as you may call it we burned down the wigwam and made
on as if the gal was burned in it and then i stumped off to the injun
border among them that didn't know me and according to dick's advice
helped myself to another name and jist passed off the gal for my own
daughter

your own daughter cried roland starting half up but being unable to
rise on account of his bonds the story then is true and telie doe is
my uncle's child the lost heiress

well supposing she is said atkinson i reckon you'd not be exactly
the man to help her to her rights

ay by heaven but i would though said roland if rights they be if
my uncle upon knowledge that she was still alive thought fit to alter
his intentions with regard to edith and myself he would have found none
more ready to acknowledge the poor girl's claims than ourselves none
more ready to befriend and assist her

well there's all the difference between being an honest feller and a
rascal muttered atkinson casting his eyes upon the fire which he fell
to studying for a moment with great earnestness then starting up
hastily and turning to the prisoner he exclaimed 

there's not a better gal in the etarnal world you don't know it
captain but that telie that poor critter that's afeard of her own
shadow did run all risks and play all manner of fool's tricks to save
you from this identical same captivation and the night you was sleeping
at bruce's fort and we waiting for you at the ford she cried and
begged and prayed that i would do you no more mischief and cuss her
she threatened to tell you and bruce there the whole affair of the
ambush till i scared her with my tomahawk like a d  d rascal as i am
but there's nothing will fetch her round but fear of murdering and so
swore her to keep silence and then captain her running away after you
in the woods why it was jist to circumvent us to lead you to the
t'other old road and so save you it was captain and she owned it and
if you'd a taken to her leading as she axed you she'd a got you out
of the snarl altogether howsomever captain he continued after making
those admissions which solved all the enigmas of telie's conduct i
won't lie in this matter no-how the gal is no gal of the major's but
my own flesh and blood the major's little critter sickened on the
border and died off in less than a year and so there was all our
rascally burning and lying for nothing for if we had waited a while
the poor thing would have died of her own accord well captain i'm
making a long story about nothing but the short of it is i didn't make
a bit of a fortun at all but fell into troubles and the end was i
turned injun jist as you see me and a feller there tom bruce took to
my little gal out of charity and so she was bred up a beggar's brat
with everybody a jeering of her because of her d  d rascally father
and you see this made a wolf of me for i couldn't bring her among the
injuns to marry her to a cussed niggur of a savage no captain i
couldn't for she's my own natteral flesh and blood and captain i love
her and so i goes back to virginny to see what braxley could do for
her and there d  n him he puts me up to a new rascality which was
nothing less than setting up my gal for the major's daughter and making
her a great heiress and marrying of her howsomever this wouldn't do
this marrying for first dick braxley was a bigger rascal than myself
and it was agin my conscience to give him the gal who was a good gal
deserving of an honest husband and next the feller was mad after young
madam and there was no telling how soon he might p'ison my gal to
marry the other and so we couldn't fix the thing then to our liking no
way but by and by we did for when the major died he sends for me in a
way i told him of and here's jist the whole of our rascality we was in
the first place jist to kill you off 

to kill me villain cried roland whose interest was already excited
to the highest pitch by the renegade's story

not exactly with our own hands for i bargained agin that but it was
agreed you should be put out of the way of ever returning agin to
virginny well captain dick was then to marry the young lady and then
jist step into the major's estate by virtue of the major's will the
second one you must know which dick took good care to hide away
pretending to suppose the major had destroyed it

and that will exclaimed roland the villain the unparalleled villain
is still possessed of

no rat him the devil has turned upon him at last and it is in better
hands said atkinson and without more ado he drew the instrument from
his bosom and unfolded it before roland's astonished eyes read it
said doe with exulting voice i can make nothing of the cursed
pot-hooks myself having never been able to stand the flogging of a
school-house but i know the fixings of it the whole estate devised
equally to you and the young woman to be divided according as you may
agree of yourselves a monstrous silly way that but there's no helping
it

and holding it before the virginian in the light of the fire the latter
satisfied himself at a glance that atkinson had truly reported its
contents it was written with his uncle's own hand briefly but clearly
and while manifesting throughout the greatest affection on the part of
the testator toward his orphan niece it contained no expressions
indicative either of ill-will to his nephew or disapprobation of the part
the young man had chosen to play in the great drama of revolution and
this was the more remarkable as it was dated at a period soon after
roland had so wilfully or patriotically fled to fight the battles of
his country and when it might have been supposed the stern old
loyalist's anger was at its height a better and more grateful proof that
the young man had neither lost his regard nor confidence was shown in a
final codicil dated in the year of roland's majority in which he was
associated with braxley as executor the latter worthy having been
made to figure in that capacity alone in the body of the will

this is indeed a discovery cried roland with the agitation of joy and
hope cut my bonds deliver me with my cousin and companions and the
best farm in the manor shall reward you nay you shall fix your own
terms for your daughter and yourself

exactly said atkinson who although the prisoner was carefully bound
exhibited a jealous disinclination to let the will come near his hands
and now restored it carefully to his own bosom we must talk over that
matter of tarms jist to avoid mistakes and to begin captain i will
jist observe as before that if you don't take my offer and close with
me hard and fast you will roast at an injun stake jist as sartainly as
you are now snugging by an injun fire you will d  n me there's no
two ways about it

the terms the terms cried roland eagerly name them i will not
dispute them

but the renegade was in no such hurry

you see said he i'm a d  d rascal as i said and in this matter
i am just as much a rascal as before for i'm playing foul with braxley
having bargained to work out the whole thing in his sarvice howsomever
there is a kind of fair play in cheating him seeing it was him that
made a rascal of me and moresomever i have my doubts of him and
there's no way i can hold him up to a bargain and lastly captain i
don't see how he can be of any sarvice to my gal he can't marry her if
he would and if he could he shouldn't have her and as for leaving her
to his tender mercies i would jist as soon think of hunting her up
quarters in a bear's den and as for keeping her among these d  d
brutes the injuns for brutes they are captain there's no denying it 

why need you speak of it more i will find her a home and protection a
home and protection for both of you

as for me captain thanking you for the favour you won't do me no
sich thing seeing as how i don't look for it there's two or three small
matters agin me in the settlements which it is no notion of mine to
bring up for reckoning the gal's the crittur to be protected and i'll
take my pay out chiefly in the good you do to her and for the small
matters not meaning no offence i can trust best to her for she's my
daughter and she won't cheat me now captain a better gal than
telie her true name's matilda but she never heard anything of it but
telie a better gal was never seen in the woods for all she's young and
timorsome and it's jist my notion and my desire that whatever may
become of me nothing but good shall become of her and now captain

carry you safe to the settlements and give you this here precious
sheepskin which is jist as much as saying i'll make you the richest
man in farms flocks and niggurs in all virginny and you shall marry
the gal and make a lady of her

make her a good husband for you're an honest feller and a brave
one i'll say that for you and she'll make you a good wife or i'll give

for her whatever you can wish or demand the best farm in the whole
estate shall be hers and the protection of my kinswoman will be
cheerfully and gratefully granted

as for jesting captain said the renegade with a lowering brow
there's not one particle of it about me from top to toe i offer you a
bargain that has all the good on your side and i reckoned you'd a
jumped at it with a whole hoss-load of thank'ees i offer you a gal
that's the best gal in the whole eternal wood and i reckon you may count

giving a'n't that making tarms easy for as for the small matters for
myself them is things i will come upon the gal for without troubling
you for em now you see captain i'll jist argue the matter you may
reckon it strange i should make you such an offer and ondoubtedly so it
is but here's the case first captain i'm agin burning you it makes
me oneasy to think of it for you ha'n't done me no harm and you're a
young feller of the rale virginny grit jist after my own heart and i
takes to you and next captain there's the gal a good gal captain
that's desarving of all i can do for her and a heap more but captain
what's to become of the crittur when i'am done for you see some of
these cussed injuns or it may be the white men for they're all agin

ways about it well then what's to become of the poor gal that ha'n't
no friend in the big world to care for her now you see i'm thinking of

marry my gal to him and there's jist two good things i'll do for the
pair of em and so captain there's exactly the end of it if you'll
take the gal you shall have her and you'll make three different
critturs greatly beholden to you first the gal who's a good gal and
a comely gal and will love and honor you jist as hard as the best madam
in the land next myself that am her father and longs to give her to
an honest feller that won't misuse her and last your own partickelar
self for the taking of her is exactly the only way you have of gitting
hack the old major's lands and what i hold to be jist as agreeable
dragging clear of a hot injun fire that will roast you to cinders if you
remain in this d d village two days longer

my friend cried roland driven to desperation for he perceived
atkinson was making his extraordinary proposal in perfectly good faith
and simplicity as a regular matter of matter of business you know not
what you ask free me and my kinswoman 

as for young madam there interrupted the renegade don't be at all
oneasy she's in good hands i tell you and braxley'll fetch her
straight off to virginny as soon as he has brought her to reason

and your terms said roland smothering his fury as he could imply an
understanding that my cousin is to be surrendered to him

ondoubtedly replied doe there's no two ways about it i work on my
own hook in the matter of the fortun cause how dick's not to be
trusted where the play's all in his own hands but as for cheating him
out of the gal there's no manner of good can come of it and it's clear
agin my own interest no captain here's the case you takes my gal
telie and braxley takes the t'other and so it's all settled fair
between you

hark you rascal cried roland giving way to his feelings if you
would deserve a reward you must win it not by saving me but my
cousin my own life i would buy at the price of half the lands which that
will makes me master of for the rescue of edith from the vile braxley i
would give all save her save her from braxley and then ask me what
you will

well said atkinson and you'll marry my gal

death and furies are you besotted i will enrich her ay with the best
of my estate with all she shall have it all

and you won't have her then cried the renegade starting up in anger
you don't think her good enough for you because you're of a great
quality stock and she's come of nothing but me john atkinson a plain
back-woods feller or mayhap he added more temperately you're agin
taking her because of my being sich a d d notorious rascal well now i
reckon that's a thing nobody will know of in virginny unless you should
tell it yourself you can jist call her telie jones or telie small or
any nickname of that natur and nobody'll be the wiser and i shall jist
say nothing about it myself i won't captain d n me for it's the
gal's good i'm hunting after and none of my own

you are mad i tell you cried the soldier fix your own terms for
her i will execute any instrument i will give you any bond 

none of your cussed bonds for me said doe with great contempt i
knows the worth of em and i'm jist lawyer enough to see how you could
git out of em by swearing they were written under compulsion or
whatsomever you call it and besides who's to stop your cheating the
gal that has nobody to take care of her when you gits her in virginny
where i darn't follow her no captain there's jist but the one way to
make all safe and fair and that's by marrying her so marry her
captain and jist to be short captain you must marry her or burn
there's no two ways about it i make you the last offer there's no time
for another for to-morrow you must be help'd off or it's too late for
you come captain jist say the word marry the gal and i'll save you

you are mad i tell you again marry her i neither can nor will but 

there's no occasion for more interrupted doe starting angrily up
you've jist said the word and that's enough and now captain when you
come to the stake don't say i brought you there no d n it
don't for i've done jist all i could do to help you to life and
fortun i have d n me you can't deny it

and with these words uttered with sullen accents and looks the renegade
stole from the hut disregarding all roland's entreaties to him to
return and all the offers of wealth with which the latter in a frenzy
of despair sought to awaken his eupidity and compassion the door-mats
had scarce closed upon his retreating figure before they were parted to
give entrance to the two old indians who immediately assumed their
positions at his side preserving them with vigilant fidelity throughout
the remainder of the night




chapter xxxiii


in the meantime and at the very moment when the renegade was urging his
extraordinary proposals to the young virginian a scene was passing in
the hut of wenonga in which one of roland's fellow-prisoners was
destined to play an important and remarkable part there in the very
tent in which he had struck so daring a blow for the rescue of edith but
in which edith appeared no more lay the luckless nathan a victim not so
much of his own rashness as of the excessive zeal not to say folly of
his coadjutors and thither he had been conducted but a few hours before
after having passed the previous night and day in a prison-house less
honoured but fated as it proved to derive peculiar distinction from
the presence of such a guest

his extraordinary appearance partaking so much of that of an indian
juggler arrayed in the panoply of legerdemain had produced as was
mentioned a powerful effect on the minds of his captors ever prone to
the grossest credulity and superstition and this was prodigiously
increased by the sudden recurrence of his disease a dreadful
infliction whose convulsions seem ever to have been proposed as the
favourite exemplars for the expression of prophetic fury and the
demoniacal orgasm and were aped alike by the pythian priestess on her
tripod and the ruder impostor of an indian wigwam the foaming lips and
convulsed limbs of the prisoner if they did not speak the god to the
awe-struck barbarians declared at least the presence of the mighty fiend
who possessed his body and when the fit was over though they took good
care to bind him with thongs of bison-hide like his companions and led
him away to a place of security it was with a degree of gentleness and
respect that proved the strength of their belief in his supernatural
endowments this belief was still further indicated the next day by
crowds of savages who flocked into the wigwam where he was confined some
to stare at him some to inquire the mysteries of their fate and some
as it seemed with credulity less unconditional to solve the enigma of
his appearance before yielding their full belief among these last were
the renegade and one or two savages of a more sagacious or sceptical turn
than their fellows who beset the supposed conjuror with questions
calculated to pluck out the heart of his mystery

but questions and curiosity were in vain the conjuror was possessed by a
silent devil and whether it was that the shock of his last paroxysm had
left his mind benumbed and stupefied whether his courage had failed at
last leaving him plunged in despair or whether indeed his frigid
indifference was not altogether assumed to serve a peculiar purpose it
was nevertheless certain that he bestowed not the slightest attention
upon any of his questioners not even upon doe who had previously
endeavoured to unravel the riddle by seeking the assistance of ralph
stackpole assistance however which ralph waxing sagacious of a
sudden professed himself wholly unable to give this faithful fellow
indeed professed to be just as ignorant of the person and character of
the young virginian swearing with a magnanimous resolve to assume
the pains and penalties of indian ire on his own shoulders that the
hoss-stealing which he doubted not would be held the most
unpardonable feature in the adventure was jist a bit of a private
speculation of his own that there was nobody with him that he had
come on his expedition alone and knew no more of the other fellers than
he did of the tarnal tempers of injun hosses not he in short the
skeptics were baffled and the superstitious were left to the enjoyment
of their wonder and awe

at nightfall nathan was removed to wenonga's cabin where the chief
surrounded by a dozen or more warriors made him a speech in such english
phrases as he had acquired informing the prisoner as before that he
wenonga was a great chief and warrior that the other the prisoner was
a great medicine-man and finally that he wenonga required of his
prisoner the medicine-man by his charms to produce the jibbenainosay
the unearthly slayer of his people and curse of his tribe in order that
he the great chief who feared neither warrior nor devil might fight
him like a man and kill him so that he the aforesaid destroyer
should destroy his young men in the dark no longer

not even to this speech though received by the warriors with marks of
great approbation did nathan vouchsafe the least notice and the savages
despairing of moving him to their purpose at that period but hoping
perhaps to find him in a more reasonable mood at another moment left
him but not until they had again inspected the thongs and satisfied
themselves they were tied in knots strong and intricate enough to
hold even a conjuror they also before leaving him to himself placed
food and water at his side and in a way that was perhaps designed to
show their opinion of his wondrous powers for as his arms were pinioned
tightly behind his back it was evident he could feed himself only by
magic

the stolid indifference to all sublunary matters which had distinguished
nathan throughout the scene vanished the moment he found himself alone
in fact the step of the savage the last to depart was yet rustling among
the weeds at the black-vulture's door when making a violent effort he
succeeded in placing himself in a sitting posture and glared with eager
look around the apartment which was as before dimly lighted by a fire
on the floor the piles of skins and domestic utensils were hanging
about as on the preceding night and indeed nothing seemed to have been
disturbed except the weapons of which there had been so many when
edith occupied the den but of which not a single one now remained over
the fire the long tresses that depended from it swinging and fluttering
in the currents of smoke and heated air was the bundle of scalps to
which braxley had so insidiously directed the gaze of edith and which
was now one of the first objects that met nathan's eyes

having reconnoitered every corner and cranny and convinced himself that
there was no lurking savage watching his movements he began straightway
to test the strength of the thong by which his arms were bound but
without making the slightest impression on it the cord was strong the
knots were securely tied and after five or six minutes of struggling in
which he made the most prodigious efforts to tear it asunder without
hesitating at the anguish it caused him he was obliged to give over his
hopes fain could he have like thomson's demon in the net of the good
knight enjoyed that consolation of despair to

sit him felly down and gnaw his bitter nail

he summoned his strength and renewed his efforts again and again but
always without effect and being at last persuaded of his inability to
aid himself and leaned back against a bundle of skins to counsel with
his own thoughts what hope if any yet remained

at that instant and while the unuttered misery of his spirit might have
been read in his haggard and despairing eyes a low whining sound coming
from a corner of the tent but on the outside with a rustling and
scratching as if some animal were struggling to burrow its way betwixt
the skins and the earth into the lodge struck his ear he started and
he stared round with a wild but joyous look of recognition

hist hist he cried or rather whispered for his voice was not above
his breath hist hist if thee ever was wise now do thee show it

the whining ceased the scratching and rustling were heard a moment
longer and then rising from the skin wall under which he had made his
way appeared no bulky demon indeed summoned by the conjuror to his
assistance but little dog peter his trusty sagacious and hitherto
inseparable friend creeping with stealthy step but eyes glistening with
affection towards the bound and helpless prisoner

i can't hug thee little peter cried the master as the little animal
crawled to him wagging his tail and throwing his paws upon nathan's
knee looked into his face with a most meaning stare of inquiry i can't
hug thee peter thee sees how it is the injuns have ensnared me but
where thee is peter there is hope quick little peter he cried
thrusting his arms out from his back thee has teeth and thee knows how
to use them thee has gnawed me free before quick little peter quick
the teeth is thee knives and with them thee can cut me free

the little animal whose remarkable docility and sagacity have been
instanced before seemed actually to understand his master's words or
at least to comprehend from his gestures the strange duty that was now
required of him and without more ado he laid hold with his teeth upon
the thong round nathan's wrists tugging and gnawing at it with a zeal
and perseverance that seemed to make his master's deliverance sooner or
later sure and his industry was quickened by nathan who all the while
encouraged him with whispers to continue his efforts

thee gnawed me loose when the four shawnees had me bound by their fire
at night on the banks of the kenhawa does thee remember that
peter ay thee did while the knaves slept and from that sleep they
never waked the murdering villains no not one of them gnaw little
peter gnaw hard and fast and care not if thee wounds me with thee
teeth for truly i will forgive thee even if thee bites me to the
bone faster peter faster does thee boggle at the skin because of its
hardness truly i have seen thee a hungered peter when thee would have
cracked it like a marrow-bone fast peter fast and thee shall see
me again in freedom

with such expressions nathan inflamed the zeal of his familiar who
continued to gnaw for the space of five minutes or more and with such
effect that nathan who ever and anon tested the brute's progress by a
violent jerk at the rope found at the fourth or fifth effort that it
yielded a little and cracked as if its fibres were already giving way

now peter tug if thee ever tugged he cried his hopes rising almost
to ecstacy a little longer one bite more a little but a little
longer peter if thee loves thee master yea peter and we will walk
the woods again in freedom now peter now for the last bite

but the last bite peter on the sudden betrayed a disinclination to
make he ceased his toil jostled against his master's side and uttered
a whine the lowest that could be made audible

hah cried nathan as at the same instant he heard the sound of
footsteps approaching the wigwam thee speaks the truth and the
accursed villains is upon us away with thee dog thee shall finish thee
work by and by

faithful to his master's orders or perhaps to his own sense of what
was fitting and proper in such a case little peter leaped hastily
among the skins and other litter that covered half the floor and the
sleeping-berths of the lodge and was immediately out of sight having
left the apartment or concealed himself in its darkest corner the steps
approached they reached the door nathan threw himself back reclining
against his pile of furs and fixed his eye upon the mats at the
entrance they were presently parted and the old chief wenonga came
halting into the apartment halting yet with a step that was designed
to indicate all the pride and dignity of a warrior and this attempt at
state was the more natural and proper as he was armed and painted as if
for war his grim-countenance hideously bedaubed on one side with
vermillion and the other with black a long scalping-knife without
sheath or cover swinging from his wampum belt while a hatchet the
blade and handle both of steel was grasped in his hand in this guise
and with a wild and demoniacal glitter of eye that seemed the result of
mingled drunkenness and insanity the old chief stalked and limped up to
the prisoner looking as if bent upon his instant destruction that his
passions were up in arms that he was ripe for mischief and blood was
indeed plain and undeniable but he soon made it apparent that his rage
was only conditional and alternative as regarded the prisoner pausing
within three or four feet of him and giving him a look that seemed
designed to freeze his blood it was so desperately hostile and savage
he extended his arm and hatchet not however to strike as it
appeared but to do what might be judged almost equally agreeable to
nine-tenths of his race that is to deliver a speech

i am wenonga he cried in his own tongue being perhaps too much
enraged to think of any other i am wenonga a great shawnee chief i
have fought the longknives and drunk their blood when they hear my
voice they are afraid they run howling away like dogs when the squaws
beat them from the fire who ever stood before wenonga i have fought
my enemies and killed them i never feared a white man why should i
fear a white man's devil where is the jibbenainosay the curse of my
tribe the shawneewannaween the howl of my people he kills them in the
dark he creeps upon them while they sleep but he fears to stand before
the face of a warrior am i a dog or a woman the squaws and the
children curse me as i go by they say i am the killer of their
husbands and fathers they tell me it was the deed of wenonga that
brought the white man's devil to kill them if wenonga is a chief let
him kill the killer of his people i am wenonga i am a man i fear
nothing i have sought the jibbenainosay but the jibbenainosay is a
coward he walks in the dark he kills in the time of sleep he fears to
fight a warrior my brother is a great medicine-man he is a white man
and he knows how to find the white man's devils let my brother speak for
me let him show me where to find the jibbenainosay and he shall be a
great chief and the son of a chief wenonga will make him his son and
he shall be a shawnee

does wenonga at last feel he has brought a devil upon his people
said nathan speaking for the first time since his capture and speaking
in a way well suited to strike the interrogator with surprise a sneer
as it seemed of gratified malice crept over his face and was visible
even through the coat of paint that still invested his features and to
crown all his words were delivered in the shawnee tongue correctly and
unhesitatingly pronounced which was itself or so wenonga appeared to
hold it a proof of his superhuman acquirements

the old chief started as the words fell upon his ear and looked around
him in awe as if the prisoner had already summoned a spirit to his
elbow

i have heard the voice of the dead he cried my brother is a great
medicine but i am a chief i am not afraid

the chief tells me lies rejoined nathan who having once unlocked his
lips seemed but little disposed to resume his former silence the
chief tells me lies there is no white-devil hurts his people

i am an old man and a warrior i speak the truth said the chief
with dignity and then added with sudden feeling i am an old man i
had sons and grandsons young warriors and boys that would soon have
blacked their faces for battle where are they the jibbenainosay has
been in my village he has been in my wigwam there are none left the
jibbenainosay killed them

footnote the young warriors of many tribes are obliged to confine
themselves to black paint during their probationary campaigns

ay exclaimed the prisoner and his eyes shot fire as he spoke they
fell under his hand man and boy there was not one of them spared they
were of the blood of wenonga

wenonga is a great chief cried the indian he is childless but
childless he has made the long-knife

the long-knife and the son of onas said nathan

the chief staggered back as if struck by a blow and stared wildly upon
the prisoner

my brother is a medicine-man he knows all things he exclaimed he
speaks the truth i am a great warrior i took the scalp of the
quakel 

footnote quakels a corruption of quakers whom the indians of
pennsylvania originally designated as the sons of onos that being one
of the names they bestowed upon penn

and of his wife and children you left not one alive ay continued
nathan fastening his looks upon the amazed chief you slew them all
and he that was the husband and father was the shawnees friend the
friend even of wenonga

the white-men are dogs and robbers said the chief the quakel was my
brother but i killed him i am an indian i love white-man's blood my
people have soft hearts they cried for the quakel but i am a warrior
with no heart i killed them their scalps are hanging to my fire-post
i am not sorry i am not afraid

the eyes of the prisoner followed the indian's hand as he pointed with
savage triumph to the shrivelled scalps that had once crowned the heads
of childhood and innocence and then sank to the floor while his whole
frame shivered as with an ague-fit

my brother is a great medicine-man iterated the chief he shall show
me the jibbenainosay or he shall die

the chief lies cried nathan with a sudden and taunting laugh he can
talk big things to a prisoner but he fears the jibbenainosay

i am a chief and warrior i will fight the white-man's devil

the warrior shall see him then said the captive with extraordinary
fire cut me loose from my bonds and i will bring him before the
chief

and as he spoke he thrust out his legs inviting the stroke of the axe
upon the thongs that bound his ankles

but this was a favour which stupid or mad as he was wenonga hesitated
to grant

the chief cried nathan with a laugh of scorn would stand face to
face with the jibbenainosay and yet fears to loose a naked prisoner

the taunt produced its effect the axe fell upon tho thong and nathan
leaped to his feet he extended his wrists the indian hesitated again
the chief shall see the jibbenainosay cried nathan and the cord was
cut

the prisoner turned quickly round and while his eyes fastened with a
wild but joyous glare upon his jailer's a laugh that would have become
the jaws of a hyena lighted up his visage and sounded from his lips
look he cried thee has thee wish thee sees the destroyer of thee
race ay murdering villain the destroyer of thee people and
theeself

and with that leaping upon the astounded chief with rather the rancorous
ferocity of a wolf than the enmity of a human being and clutching him by
the throat with one hand while with the other he tore the iron tomahawk
from his grasp he bore him to the earth clinging to him as he fell
and using the wrested weapon with such furious haste and skill that
before they had yet reached the ground he had buried it in the indian's
brain another stroke and another he gave with the same murderous
activity and force and wenonga trode the path to the spiritland bearing
the same gory evidences of the unrelenting and successful vengeance of
the white-man that his children and grand-children had borne before him

ay dog thee dies at last at last i have caught thee

with these words nathan leaving the shattered skull dashed the
tomahawk into the indian's chest snatched the scalping-knife from the
belt and with one grinding sweep of the blade and one fierce jerk of
his arm the gray scalp-lock of the warrior was torn from the dishonoured
head the last proof of the slayer's ferocity was not given until he had
twice with his utmost strength drawn the knife over the dead man's
breast dividing skin cartilage and even bone before it so sharp was
the blade and so powerful the hand that urged it

then leaping to his feet and snatching from the post the bundle
of withered scalps the locks and ringlets of his own murdered
family which he spread a moment before his eyes with one hand while
the other extended as if to contrast the two prizes together the
reeking scalp-lock of the murderer he sprang through the door of the
lodge and fled from the village but not until he had in the insane
fury of the moment given forth a wild ear-piercing yell that spoke the
triumph the exulting transport of long-baffled but never-dying revenge
the wild whoop thus rising in the depth and stillness of the night
startled many a wakeful warrior and timorous mother from their repose
but such sounds in a disorderly hamlet of barbarians were too common to
create alarm or uneasiness and the wary and the timid again betook
themselves to their dreams leaving the corse of their chief to stiffen
on the floor of his own wigwam




chapter xxxiv


from an uneasy slumber into which notwithstanding his sufferings of
mind and body he had at last fallen roland was roused at the break of
day by a horrible clamour that suddenly arose in the village a shrill
scream that seemed to come from a female voice was first heard then a
wild yell from the lungs of a warrior which was caught up and repeated
by other voices and in a few moments the whole town resounded with
shrieks dismal and thrilling and expressing astonishment mingled with
fear and horror

the prisoner incapable of comprehending the cause of such a commotion
looked to his guards who had started up at the first cry grasped their
arms and stood gazing upon one another with perturbed looks of inquiry
the shriek was repeated by one twenty a hundred throats and the two
warriors with hurried exclamations of alarm rushed from the wigwam
leaving the prisoner to solve the riddle as he might but he tasked his
faculties in vain his first idea and it sent the blood leaping to his
heart that the village was suddenly attacked by an army of white
men perhaps by the gallant bruce the commander of the station where
his misfortunes had begun was but momentary no lusty hurrahs were
heard mingling with the shrieks of the savages and no explosions of
fire-arms denoted the existence of conflict and yet he perceived that
the cries were not all of surprise and dismay some voices were uplifted
in rage which was evidently spreading among the agitated barbarians
and displacing the other passions in their minds

in the midst of the tumult and while he was yet lost in wonder and
speculation the renegade doe suddenly rushed into the wigwam pale with
affright and agitation

they'll murder you captain he cried there's no time for holding
back now take the gal and i'll save you the village is up they'll
have your blood they're crying for it already squaws warriors and
all ay d  n em there's no stopping em now

what in heaven's name is the matter demanded the soldier

all etarnity's the matter replied doe with vehement utterance
the jibbenainosay has been in the village and killed the chief ay
d  n him struck him in his own house marked him at his own fire he
lies dead and scalped ay and crossed too on the floor of his own
wigwam the conjuror gone snapped up by his devil and wenonga stiff
and gory don't you hear em yelling the jibbenainosay i tell you he
has killed the chief we found him dead in his cabin and the injuns are
bawling for revenge they are d  n em and they'll murder you burn
you tear you to pieces they will there's no two ways about it
they're singing out to murder the white men and they'll be on you in no
time

and there is no escape cried roland whose blood curdled as he
listened to the thrilling yells that were increased in number and
loudness as if the enraged barbarians rushing madly through the
village were gathering arms to destroy the prisoners there is no
escape

take the gal jist say the word and i'll save you or die with you i
will d  n me exclaimed doe with fierce energy there's hosses
grazing in the pastures there's halters swinging above us i'll mount
you and save you say the word captain and i'll cut you loose and save
you say it and be quick your life depends on it hark the dogs is
coming hold out your arms till i cut the tug 

anything for my life cried the virginian but if it can be only
bought at the price of marrying the girl it is lost

and the soldier would have resisted the effort doe was making for his
deliverance

you'll be murdered i tell you re-echoed doe with increased
vehemence holding the knife ready in his hand they're coming on us i
don't want to see you butchered like an ox one word captain i'll take
your word you're an honest fellow and i'll believe in you jist one
word captain i'll help you i'll fight the dogs for you i'll give you
weapons the gal captain life and the fortun captain the gal the
gal

never i tell you never cried roland who faithful to the honour and
integrity of spirit which conducted the men of that day the mighty
fathers of the republic through the vicissitudes of revolution to the
rewards of liberty would not stoop to the meanness of falsehood and
deception even in that moment of peril and fear anything but that but
that never

but whilst he spoke doe urged on by his own impetuous feelings had
cut the thong from his wrists and was even proceeding to divide those
that bound his ankles disregarding all his protestations and averments
or perhaps drowning them in his own eager exclamations of the gal
captain the word jist one word when a dozen or more savages burst
into the hut and sprang upon the virginian yelling cursing and
flourishing their knives and hatchets as if they would have torn him to
pieces on the spot and such undoubtedly was the aim of some of the
younger men who struck at him several furious blows that were only
averted by the older warriors at the expense of some of their own blood
shed in the struggle which was for a moment as fiercely waged over the
prisoner as the conflict of enraged hounds over the body of a disabled
panther that are all emulous to worry and tear one instant of dreadful
confusion of shrieks blows and maledictions and the virginian was
snatched up in the arms of two or three of the strongest men and dragged
from the hut but only to find himself surrounded by a herd of villagers
men women and children who fell upon him with as much fury as the
young warriors had done beating him with bludgeons wounding him with
their knives so that it seemed impossible the older braves could protect
him much longer but others ran to their assistance and forming a circle
around him so as to exclude the mob he was borne onwards in temporary
security but destined to a fate to which murder on the spot would have
been gentleness and mercy

the tumult had roused edith also from her painful slumbers and the more
necessarily since although removed from the tent in which she was first
imprisoned she was still confined in wenonga's wigwam it was the scream
of the hag the chieftain's wife who had discovered his body that first
gave the alarm and the villagers all rushing to the cabin and yelling
their astonishment and terror there arose an uproar almost in her ears
that was better fitted to fright her to death than to lull her again to
repose she started from her couch of furs and with a woman's weakness
cowered away in the furthest corner of the lodge to escape the pitiless
fees whom her fears represented as already seeking her life nor was
this chimera banished from her mind when a man rushing in snatched her
from her ineffectual concealment and hurried her towards the door but
her terrors ran in another channel when the ravisher conquering the
feeble resistance she attempted replied to her wild entreaties not to
kill her in the well-remembered voice of braxley

kill you indeed he muttered but with agitated tones i come to save
you even you are in danger from the maddened villains they are
murdering all we must fly ay and fast my horse is saddled the
woods are open i will yet save you

spare me for my uncle's sake who was your benefactor spare me
cried edith struggling to free herself from his grasp but she struggled
in vain i aim to save you cried braxley and without uttering another
word bore her from the hut and still grasping her with an arm of iron
sprang upon a saddled horse the identical animal that had once
sustained the weight of the unfortunate pardon dodge which stood under
the elm-tree trembling with fright at the scene of horror then
represented on the square

upon this vacant space was now assembled the whole population of the
village old and young the strong and the feeble all agitated alike by
those passions which when let loose in a mob whether civilised or
savage almost enforce the conviction that there is something essentially
demoniac in the human character and composition as if indeed the earth
of which man is framed had been gathered only after it had been trodden
by the foot of the prince of darkness

even edith forgot for a moment her fears of braxley nay she clung to
him for protection when her eye fell upon the savage herd of whom the
chief number were crowded together in the centre of the square
surrounding some object rendered invisible by their bodies while others
were rushing tumultuously hither and thither driven by causes she could
not divine brandishing weapons and uttering howls without number one
large party was passing from the wigwam itself their cries not less loud
or ferocious than the others but changing occasionally into piteous
lamentations they bore in their arms the body of the murdered chief an
object of such horror that when edith's eye had once fallen upon it it
seemed as if her enthralled spirit would never have recovered strength to
remove them

but there was a more fearful spectacle yet to be seen the wife of
wenonga suddenly rushed from the lodge bearing a fire-brand in her hand
she ran to the body of the chief eyed it for a moment with such a look
as a tigress might cast upon her slaughtered cub and then uttering a
scream that was heard over the whole square and whirling the brand round
her head until it was in a flame fled with frantic speed towards the
centre of the area the mob parting before her and replying to her
shrieks which were uttered at every step with outcries scarce less wild
and thrilling as they parted thus opening a vista to the heart of the
square the object which seemed the centre of attraction to all was fully
revealed to the maiden's eyes bound to two strong posts near the
council-house their arms drawn high above their heads a circle of
brush-wood prairie-grass and other combustibles heaped around them
were two wretched captives white men from whose persons a dozen savage
hands were tearing their garments while as many more were employed
heaping additional fuel on the pile one of these men as edith could see
full well for the spectacle was scarce a hundred paces removed was
roaring ralph the captain of horse-thieves the other and that was a
sight to rend her eye-balls from their sockets was her unfortunate
kinsman the playmate of her childhood the friend and lover of maturer
years her cousin brother her all roland forrester it was no
error of sight no delusion of mind the spectacle was too palpable to be
doubted it was roland forrester whom she saw chained to the stake
surrounded by yelling and pitiless barbarians impatient for the
commencement of their infernal pastime while the wife of the chief
kneeling at the pile was already endeavouring with her brand to kindle
it into flame

the shriek of the wretched maiden as she beheld the deplorable the
maddening sight might have melted hearts of stone had there been even
such among the indians but indians engaged in the delights of torturing
a prisoner are as the dead chief had boasted himself without heart
pity which the indian can feel at another moment as deeply perhaps
and benignly as a white man seems then and is entirely unknown as
much so indeed as if it had never entered into his nature his mind is
then voluntarily given tip to the drunkenness of passion and cruelty in
its most atrocious and fiendish character reigns predominant the
familiar of a spanish inquisition has sometimes moistened the lips of a
heretic stretched upon the rack the buccaneer of the tropics has
relented over the contumacious prisoner gasping to death under his lashes
and heated pincers but we know of no instance where an indian torturing
a prisoner at the stake the torture once begun has ever been moved to
compassionate to regard with any feelings but those of exultation and
joy the agonies of the thrice-wretched victim

the shriek of the maiden was unheard or unregarded and
braxley himself so horrified by the spectacle that while pausing
to give it a glance he forgot the delay was also disclosing it to
edith grasping her tighter in his arms from which she had half leaped
in her frenzy turned his horse's head to fly without seeming to be
regarded or observed by the savages which was perhaps in part owing to
his having resumed his indian attire but as he turned he could not
resist the impulse to snatch one more look at his doomed rival a
universal yell of triumph sounded over the square the flames were
already bursting from the pile and the torture was begun

the torture was begun but it was not destined long to endure the
yell of triumph was yet resounding over the square and awakening
responsive echoes among the surrounding hills when the explosion of at
least fifty rifles sharp rattling and deadly like the war-note of the
rattle-snake followed by a mighty hurrah of christian voices and the
galloping of horse into the village from above converted the whole scene
into one of amazement and terror the volley was repeated and by as many
more guns and in an instant there was seen rushing into the square a
body of at least a hundred mounted white men their horses covered with
foam and staggering with exhaustion yet spurred on by their riders with
furious ardour while twice as many footmen were beheld rushing after in
mad rivalry cheering and shouting in reply to their leader whose voice
was heard in front of the horsemen thundering out small change for the
blue licks charge em the brutes give it to em handsome

the yells of dismay of the savages taken thus by surprise and as it
seemed by a greatly superior force whose approach rapid and tumultuous
as it must have been their universal devotion to the saturnalia of blood
had rendered them incapable of perceiving the shouts of the mounted
assailants as they dashed into the square and among the mob shooting as
they came or handling their rifles like maces and battle-axes the
trampling and neighing of the horses and the thundering hurrahs of the
footmen charging into the town with almost the speed of the horse made a
din too horrible for description the shock of the assault was not
resisted by the indians even for a moment some rushed to the
neighbouring wigwams for their guns but the majority like the women and
children fled to seek refuge among the rocks and bushes of the
overhanging hill from which however as they approached it a deadly
volley was shot upon them by foemen who already occupied its tangled
sides others again fled towards the meadows and corn-fields where in
like manner they were intercepted by bands of mounted long-knives who
seemed pouring into the valley from every hill in short it was soon
made apparent that the village of the black-vulture was assailed from all
sides and by such an army of avenging white men as had never before
penetrated into the indian territory

all the savages all at least who were not shot or struck down in the
square fled from the village and among the foremost of them was
braxley who as much astounded as his indian confederates but better
prepared for flight struck the spurs into his horse and still retaining
his helpless prize dashed across the river to escape as he might

in the meanwhile the victims at the stake though roused to hope and
life by the sudden appearance of their countrymen were neither released
from bonds nor perils though the savages fled as described from the
charge of the white men there were some who remembered the prisoners
and were resolved that they should never taste the sweets of liberty the
beldam who was still busy kindling the pile roused from her toil by the
shouts of the enemy and the shrieks of her flying people looked up a
moment and then snatching at a knife dropped by some fugitive rushed
upon stackpole who was nearest her with a wild scream of revenge the
horse-thief avoiding the blow as well as he could saluted the hag with
a furious kick his feet being entirely at liberty and such was its
violence that the woman was tossed into the air as if from the horns of
a bull and then fell stunned and apparently lifeless to perish in the
flames she had kindled with her own breath

a tall warrior hatchet in hand with a dozen more at his back rushed
upon the virginian but before he could strike there came leaping with
astonishing bounds over the bodies of the wounded and dying and into
the circle of fire a figure that might have filled a better and braver
warrior with dread it was the medicine-man and former captive the
indian habiliments and paint still on his body and visage though both
were flecked and begrimed with blood in his left hand was a bundle of
scalps the same he had taken from the tent of wenonga the grizzled
scalp-lock of the chief known by the vulture-feathers beak and
talons still attached to it was hanging to his girdle while the steel
battle-axe so often wielded by wenonga was gleaming aloft in his right
hand

the savage recoiled and with loud yells of the jibbenainosay the
jibbenainosay turned to fly while even those behind him staggered back
at the apparition of the destroyer thus tangibly presented to their
eyes nor was their awe lessened when the supposed fiend taking one
step after the retreating leader of the gang drove the fatal hatchet
into his brain with as lusty a whoop of victory as ever came from the
lungs of a warrior at the same moment he was hidden from their eyes by a
dozen horsemen that came rushing up with tremendous huzzas some darting
against the band while others sprung from their horses to liberate the
prisoners but this duty had been already rendered at least in the case
of captain forrester the axe of wenonga dripping with blood to the
hilt divided the rope at a single blow and then roland's fingers were
crushed in the grasp of his preserver as the latter exclaimed with a
strange half-frantic chuckle of triumph and delight 

thee sees friend thee thought i had deserted thee truly truly thee
was mistaken

hurrah for old tiger nathan i'll never say q to a quaker agin as long
as i live exclaimed another voice broken feeble and vainly aiming to
raise a huzza and the speaker seizing nathan with one hand while the
other grasped tremulously at captain forrester's displayed to the
latter's eyes the visage of tom bruce the younger pale sickly
emaciated his once gigantic proportions wasted away and his whole
appearance indicating anything but fitness for a field of battle

strannger cried the youth pressing the soldier's hand with what
strength he could and laughing faintly we've done the handsome thing
by you me and dad thar's no denying but we went your security agin all
sorts of danngers in our beat and thar's just the occasion but h'yar's
dad to speak for himself as for me i rather think breath's too short
for wasting

hurrah for kentucky roared colonel bruce as he sprang from his horse
and seized the hand of roland wringing and twisting it with a fury of
friendship and gratulation which at another moment would have caused
the soldier to grin with pain h'yar we are captain he cried picked
you out of the yambers swore to follow you and young madam to the end
of creation beat up for recruits sung out blue lick to the people
roused the general from the falls whole army a thousand men double
quick step found tiger nathan in the woods whar's the creatur told of
your fixin beat to arms flew ahead licked the enemy and ha'n't
we extarminated em

with these hurried half-incoherent expressions the gallant kentuckian
explained or endeavoured to explain the mystery of his timely and most
happy appearance an explanation however of which the soldier
bewildered by the whirl of events the tumult of his own feelings and
not less by the uproarious congratulations of his friends of whom the
captain of horse-thieves released from his post of danger was not the
least noisy or affectionate heard or understood not a word to these
causes of confusion were to be added the din and tumult of conflict the
screams of the flying indians and the shouts of pursuing and opposing
white-men rising from every point of the compass for from every point
they seemed rushing in upon the foe whom they appeared to have
completely environed was there no other cause for the distraction of
mind which left the young soldier while thus beset by friendly hands and
voices incapable of giving them his whole attention his thoughts were
upon his kinswoman of whose fate he was still in ignorance but before
he could ask the question prompted by his anxieties it was answered by a
cheery hurrah from bruce's youngest son richard who came galloping into
the square and up to the place of torture whirling his cap into the air
in a frenzy of boyish triumph and rapture at his heels and mounted
upon the steed so lately bestridden by braxley the very animal which
notwithstanding its uncommon swimming virtues had left its master
pardon dodge at the bottom of salt river was could roland believe his
eyes the identical pardon dodge himself looking a hero he was so
begrimed with blood and gunpowder and whooping and hurrahing as he
came with as much spirit as if he had been born on the border and
accustomed all his life to fighting indians but roland did not admire
long at the unlooked-for resurrection of his old ally of the ruin in his
arms sustained with an air of infinite pride and exultation was an
apparition that blinded the virginian's eyes to every other object it
was edith forrester who extending her own arms as the soldier sprang
to meet her leaped to his embrace with such wild cries of delight such
abandonment of spirit to love and happiness as stirred up many a
womanish emotion in the breast of the surrounding kentuckians

there cried dodge there capting seed the everlasting injun feller
carrying her off on the hoss knowed the crittur at first sight took
atter and brought the feller to seed it was the young lady and was
jist as glad to find her as to find my hoss if i wa'n't it a'n't no
matter

thar dad cried tom bruce grasping his father's arm and pointing
but with unsteady finger and glistening eye at the two cousins that
that's a sight worth dying for with which words he fell suddenly to the
earth

dying you brute cried the father in surprise and concern you ar'n't
had a hit tom

not an iota replied the youth faintly except them etarnal slugs i
fetched from old salt but i reckon they've done for me i felt em a
dropping a dropping inside all night and so father if you'll jist
say i've done as much as my duty i'll not make no fuss about going

going you brute iterated the father clasping the hand of his son
while the others startled by the young man's sudden fall gathered
around to offer help or to gaze with alarm on his fast changing
countenance why tom my boy you don't mean to make a die of it

if if you think i've done my duty to the strannger and the young lady
said the young man and added feebly pressing the father's hand and
to you dad to you and mother and the rest of em

you have tom said the colonel with somewhat a husky voice to the
travelling strannger to mother father and all 

and to kentucky murmured the dying youth

to kentucky replied the father

well then it's no great matter you'll jist put dick in my place he's
the true grit thar'll be no mistake in dick for all he's only a young
blubbering boy and then it'll be jist all right as before and it's my
notion father 

well tom what is it demanded bruce as the young man paused as if
from mingled exhaustion and hesitation

i don't mean no offence father said he but it's my notion if
you'll never let a poor traveller go into the woods without some
dependable body to take care of him 

you're right tom and i an't mad at you for saying so and i won't

and don't let the boys abuse nathan for i reckon he'll fight if you
let him take it in his own way and and father don't mind captain
ralph's stealing a hoss or two out of our pound

he may steal the lot of em the villain said bruce shaking his head
to dislodge the tears that were starting in his eyes and he shall be
none the wuss of it

well father  the young man spoke with greater animation and with
apparently reviving strength and you think we have pretty considerably
licked the injuns h'yar jist now

we have tom thar's no doubting it and we'll lick em over and over
again till they've had enough of it

hurrah for kentucky cried the young man exerting his remaining
strength to give energy to the cry so often uplifted in succeeding
years among the wild woodlands around it was the last effort of his
sinking powers he fell back pressed his father's and his brother's
hands and almost immediately expired a victim not so much of his
wounds which were not in themselves necessarily fatal nor perhaps even
dangerous had they been attended to as of the heroic efforts so
overpowering and destructive in his disabled condition which he had made
to repair his father's fault for such he evidently esteemed the
dismissing the travellers from the station without sufficient guides and
protection




chapter xxxv


thus fell the young kentuckian a youth endeared to all who knew him by
his courage and good humour and whose fall would at a moment of less
confusion have created a deep and melancholy sensation but he fell amid
the roar and tempest of battle when there was occasion for other
thoughts and other feelings than those of mere individual grief

the indians had been driven from their village as described aiming not
to fight but fly but being intercepted at all points by the assailants
and met here by furious volleys poured from the bushy sides of the hill
there by charges of horsemen galloping through the meadows and
cornfields they were again driven back into the town where in sheer
desperation they turned upon their foes to sell their lives as dearly
as they might they were met at the edge of the village by the party of
horse and footmen that had first dislodged them with whom being driven
pell-mell among them by the shock of the intercepting bands they waged a
fierce and bloody but brief conflict and still urged onwards by the
assailants behind fought their way back to the square which deserted
almost entirely at the period of young bruce's fall was now suddenly
seen as he drew his last gasp scattered over with groups of men flying
for their lives or struggling together in mortal combat while the
screams of terror-struck women and children gave a double horror to the
din

the return of the battle to their own immediate vicinity produced its
effects upon the few who had remained by the dying youth it fired in
especial the blood of captain ralph who snatching up a fallen axe
rushed towards the nearest combatants roaring by way of consolation or
sympathy to the bereaved father don't take it hard cunnel i'll have
a scalp for tom's sake in no time as for tiger nathan he had
disappeared long before with most of the horsemen who had galloped up
to the stake with the younger bruce and his father being evidently too
fiercely excited to remain idle any longer the father and brother of the
deceased the two cousins and pardon dodge who lingered by the latter
still on his horse as if old companionship with the soldier and the
service just rendered the maid had attached him to all their interests
were all that remained on the spot but all were driven from a
contemplation of the dead as the surge of battle again tossed its bloody
spray into the square

thar's no time for weeping muttered bruce softly laying the body of
the youth for tom had expired in his arms upon the earth he died like
a man and thar's the end of it up dick and stand by the lady thar's
more work for us

everlasting bad work cunnel cried dodge they're a killing the
squaws hark dunt you hear em squeaking now cunnel i can kill your
tarnal man fellers for they've riz my ebenezer and i've kinder got my
hand in but i rather calkilate i han't no disposition to kill
wimming

close round the lady shouted bruce as a sudden movement in the mass
of combatants and the parting from it of a dozen or more wild indian
figures flying in their confusion for they were pursued by thrice their
number of white men right towards the little party at the stake
threatened the latter with unexpected danger

i'm the feller for em now that my hand's in cried pardon dodge and
taking aim with his rifle the only one in the group that was charged
at the foremost of the indians he shot him dead on the spot a feat
that instantly removed all danger from the party for the savages
yelling at the fall of their leader and the discovery of antagonists thus
drawn up in front darted off to the right hand at the wildest speed as
wildly pursued by the greater number of kentuckians

and now it was that as the wretched and defeated barbarians scattering
at dodge's fire fled from the spot the party at the stake beheld a
sight well fitted to turn the alarm they had for a moment felt on their
own account into horror and pity the savage shot down by dodge was
instantly scalped by one of the pursuers of whom five or six others
rushed upon another man for a second of the fugitives had fallen at the
same moment but only wounded attacking him furiously with knives and
hatchets while the poor wretch was seen with raised arms vainly
beseeching for quarter as if this spectacle was not in itself
sufficiently pitiable there was seen a girlish figure at the man's side
struggling with the assailants as if to throw herself between them and
their prey and uttering the most heart-piercing shrieks

it is telie doe shouted forrester leaping from his kinswoman's side
and rushing with the speed of light to her assistance he was followed
at almost as fleet a step by colonel bruce who recognised the voice at
the same instant and knew by the ferocious cries of the men kill the
cursed tory kill the renegade villain that it was the girl's apostate
father abel doe who was dying under their vengeful weapons

hold friends hold cried roland as he sprang amid the infuriated
kentuckians his interposition was for a moment successful surprise
arrested the impending weapons and doe taking advantage of the pause
leaped to his feet ran a few yards and then fell again to the ground

no quarter for turn-coats and traitors no mercy for white injuns
cried the angry men running again at their prey but roland was before
them and as he bestrode the wounded man the gigantic bruce rushed up
and catching the frenzied daughter in his arms exclaimed with tones of
thunder off you perditioned brutes would you kill the man before the
eyes of his own natteral-born daughter kill injuns you brutes thar's
the meat for you

hurrah for cunnel tom bruce shouted the men in reply and satisfying
their rage with direful execrations invoked upon all white injuns and
injun white men they rushed away in pursuit of more legitimate objects
of hostility if such were still to be found a thing not so certain
for few indian whoops were now mingled with the white man's cry of
victory

in the meanwhile roland had endeavoured to raise the bleeding and
mangled renegade to his feet but in vain though assisted by the efforts
of the unhappy wretch himself who raising his hands as if still to
avert the blows of an unrelenting enemy ejaculated wildly it a'n't
nothing its only for the gal don't murder a father before his own
child

you are safe fear nothing said roland and at the same moment poor
telie herself rushed into the dying man's arms crying with tones that
went to the virginian's heart they're gone father they're gone now
get up father and they won't hurt you no more the good captain has
saved you father they won't hurt you they won't hurt you no more

is it the captain cried doe struggling again to rise while bruce
drew the girl gently from his arms is it the captain he repeated
bending his eager looks and countenance ghastly with wounds upon the
virginian they han't murdered you then i'm glad on it captain i'll
die the easier captain and the gal too he exclaimed as his eyes
fell upon edith who scarce knowing in her horror what she did but
instinctively seeking the protection of her kinsman had crept up to the
group now around the dying wretch it's all right captain but where's
dick where's dick braxley you han't killed him among you

think not of the villain said roland i know naught of him

i'm a dying man captain exclaimed doe i know'd this would be the
end of it if dick's a prisoner jist bring him up and let me speak with
him it will be for your good captain

i know nothing of the scoundrel think of yourself said the virginian

why there don't i see his red han'kercher cried doe pointing to
dodge who from his horse which he had not yet deserted perhaps from
fear of again losing him sat looking with soldier-like composure on the
expiring renegade until made conscious that the shawl which he had tied
round his waist somewhat in manner of an officer's sash had become an
object of interest to doe and all others present

i took it from the injun feller said he with great self-complacency
the everlasting big rascal that was a carrying off madam on my own hoss
and madam was jist as dead as a piece of rock i know'd the crittur and
sung out to the feller to stop and he wouldn't and so i jist blazed
away at him right bang at his back knocked him over jist like a streak
o lightning and had the scalp off his tarnal ugly head afore you could
say john robinson and all the while madam was jist as dead as a piece
of rock here's the top-knot and an ugly dirty top-knot it is with
which words the valiant dodge displayed his trophy a scalp of black
hair yet reeking with blood

a shiver passed through edith's frame she grasped her cousin's arm to
avoid falling and with a countenance as white and ghastly as countenance
could be exclaimed 

it was braxley it was he carried me off but i knew nothing it was
he yes it was he

it war'n't a white man cried dodge dropping his prize in dismay
while even roland staggered with horror at the thought of a fate so
sudden and dreadful overtaking his rival and enemy

ha ha cried the renegade with a hideous attempt at laughter i told
dick the devil would have us but i had no idea dick would be the first
afore him shot scalped sarved like a mere dog of an injun well the
game's up at last and we've both made our fortun's captain i've been a
rascal all my life and i die no better you wouldn't take my offer
captain it's no matter he fumbled in his breast and presently drew
to light the will with which he so vainly strove the preceding night to
effect his object with roland it was stained deeply with his blood
take it captain he cried take it i give it to you without axing
tarms i leave it to yourself captain but you'll remember her captain
the gal captain the gal i leave it to yourself 

she shall never want friend or protector said roland

captain murmured the renegade with his last breath and grasping the
soldier's hand with his last convulsive effort you're an honest feller
i'll yes captain i'll trust you

these were the renegade's last words and before bruce who muttered
half in reproach half in kindness the gal never wanted friend or
protector till she fled from me who was as a father to her could draw
the sobbing daughter away the wretched instrument of a still more
wretched principal in villany had followed his employer to his last
account

in the meanwhile the struggle was over the battle was fought and
won the army for such it was being commanded in person by the hero
of kaskaskias the great protector and almost founder of the
west summoned in haste to avenge the slaughter at the blue licks a
lamentable disaster to which we have several times alluded although it
was foreign to our purpose to venture more than an allusion and
conducted with unexampled speed against the indian towns on the miami
had struck a blow which was destined long to be remembered by the
indians thus for the first time assailed in their own territory
consisting of volunteers well acquainted with the woods all well mounted
and otherwise equipped all familiar with battle and all burning for
revenge it had reached within but ten or twelve miles of wenonga's town
and within still fewer of a smaller village which it was the object of
the troops first to attack at sunset of the previous day and encamped
in the woods to allow man and horse both well nigh exhausted a few
hours refreshment previous to marching upon the neighbouring village
when nathan flying with the scalp and arms of wenonga in his hand and
looking more like an infuriated madman than the inoffensive man of peace
he had been so long esteemed suddenly appeared amidst the vanguard
commanded by the gallant bruce whom he instantly apprised of the
condition of the captives at wenonga's town and urged to attempt their
deliverance

footnote general george rogers clark

this was done and with an effect which has been already seen the
impetuosity of bruce's men doubly inflamed by the example of the father
and his eldest son to whom the rescue of their late guests was an object
of scarce inferior magnitude even compared with the vengeance for which
they burned in common with all others had in some measure defeated the
hopes of the general who sought by a proper disposition of his forces
completely to invest the indian village so as to ensure the destruction
or capture of every inhabitant as it was however very few escaped
many were killed and more including all the women and children who
honest dodge's misgivings to the contrary notwithstanding were in no
instance designedly injured taken prisoners and this too at an
expense of but very few lives lost on the part of the victors the
indians attempting resistance only when the fall of more than half their
numbers and the presence of foes on every side convinced them that
flight was wholly impracticable

the victory was indeed so complete and as it appeared that several
bands of warriors from more distant villages were in the town at the time
of the attack the blow inflicted upon the tribe so much severer than was
anticipated even from a series of attacks upon several different towns
as was at first designed that the victors satisfied that they had done
enough to convince the red-man of the irresistible superiority of the
long-knife satisfied too perhaps that the cheapness of the victory
rendered it more valuable than a greater triumph achieved at a greater
loss gave up at once their original design of carrying the war into
other villages and resolved to retrace their march to the settlements

but the triumph was not completed until the village with its fields of
standing corn had been entirely destroyed a work of cruel vengeance
yet not so much of vengeance as of policy since the destruction of their
crops by driving the savages to seek a winter's subsistence for their
families in the forest necessarily prevented their making warlike
inroads upon their white neighbours during that season the maize-stalks
accordingly soon fell before the knives and hatchets of the kentuckians
while the wigwams were given to the flames when the last of the rude
habitations had fallen crashing to the earth the victors began their
retreat towards the frontier so that within a very few hours after they
first appeared as if bursting from the earth amid the amazed
barbarians nothing remained upon the place of conflict and site of a
populous village save scattered ruins and mangled corses

their own dead the invaders bore to a distance and interred in the
deepest dens of the forest and then with their prisoners carried with
them as the surest means of inducing the tribe to beg for peace in order
to effect their deliverance they resumed the path which in good time
led them again to the settlements




chapter xxxvi


with the battle at the black-vulture's town the interest of our history
ceases and there it may be said to have its end the deliverance of the
cousins the one from captivity and death the other from a fate to her
more dreadful than death the restoration of the will of their uncle and
the fall of the daring and unprincipled villain to whose machinations
they owed all their calamities had changed the current of their
fortunes which was now to flow in a channel where the eye could no
longer trace obstructions the last peal of thunder had dissipated the
clouds of adversity and the star of their destiny shone out with all its
original lustre the future was no longer one of mere hope it presented
all the certainty of happiness of which human existence is capable

such being the case it would be a superfluous and unprofitable task to
pursue our history further were it not that other individuals whose
interests were so long intermingled with those of the cousins have a
claim upon our notice and first before speaking of the most important
of all the warlike man of peace the man-slaying hater of blood the
redoubtable nathan slaughter let us bestow a word upon honest pardon
dodge whose sudden re-appearance on the stage of life so greatly
astonished the young virginian

this resuscitation however as explained by dodge himself was after
all no such wonderful matter swept from his horse by the violence of
the flood in the memorable flight from the ruin a happy accident had
flung him upon the raft of timber that bordered the fatal chute where
not doubting that from the fury of the current all his companions had
perished and that he was left to contend alone against the savages he
immediately sought a concealment among the logs in which he remained
during the remainder of the night and the greater part of the following
day until pretty well assured the indians were no longer in his
vicinity then scaling the cliffy banks of the river and creeping
through the woods it was his good fortune at last to stumble upon the
clearings around brace's station at which he arrived soon after the
defeated regulators had effected their return here having now lost his
horse arms everything but life having battled away also in the
midnight siege some of those terrors that made indians and border life so
hateful to his imagination and being perhaps seduced by the hope of
repairing his losses and revenging the injuries he had suffered he was
easily persuaded to follow colonel bruce and the army of kentuckians to
the indian territory where fate through his arm struck a blow so
dreadfully yet retributively just at the head of the long-prospering
villain the unprincipled and unremorseful braxley

it was mentioned that when nathan first burst upon the astonished
bruce where he lay with his vanguard encamped in the woods his
appearance and demeanour were rather those of a truculent madman than of
the simple-minded inoffensive creature he had so long appeared to the
eyes of all who knew him his indian garments and decorations contributed
somewhat to this effect but the man it was soon seen was more changed
in spirit than in outward attire the bundle of scalps in his hand the
single one yet reeking with blood at his belt and the axe of wenonga
gory to the helve and grasped with a hand not less blood-stained were
not more remarkable evidences of transformation than were manifested in
his countenance deportment and expressions his eye beamed with a wild
excitement with exultation mingled with fury his step was fierce
active firm and elastic like that of a warrior leaping through the
measures of the war-dance and when he spoke his words were of battle
and bloodshed he flourished the axe of wenonga pointed grimly toward
the village and while recounting the number of warriors who lay therein
waiting to be knocked on the head he seemed judging his thoughts from
his gestures to be employed in imagination in despatching them with his
own hands

when the march after a hasty consultation was agreed upon and resumed
he although on foot maintained a position at the head of the army
guiding it along with a readiness and precision which argued
extraordinary familiarity with all the approaches to the village and
when the assault was actually commenced he was still among the foremost
as the reader has seen to enter the village and the square to cut the
bonds of the virginian and utter a fervent expression of delight at his
rescue was not enough to end the ferment in nathan's mind leaving the
virginian immediately to the protection of the younger bruce he rushed
after the flying indians among whom he remained fighting wherever the
conflict was hottest until there remained no more enemies to encounter
achieving such exploits as filled all who beheld him with admiration and
amazement

nor did the fervour of his fury end altogether even with the battle he
was among the most zealous in destroying the indian village applying the
fire with his own hands to at least a dozen different wigwams shouting
with the most savage exultation as each burst into flames

it was not indeed until the work of destruction was completed the
retreat commenced and the army once more buried in the woods that the
demon which had thus taken possession of his spirit seemed inclined to
relax its hold and restore him once more to his wits it was then
however that the remarks which all had now leisure to make on his
extraordinary transformation the mingled jests and commendations of
which he found himself the theme began to make an impression on his
mind and gradually wake him as from a dream that had long mastered and
distracted his faculties the fire of military enthusiasm flashed no more
from his eyes his step lost its bold spring and confidence he eyed
those who so liberally heaped praise on his lately acquired courage and
heroic actions with uneasiness embarrassment and dismay and cast his
troubled eyes around as if in search of some friend capable of giving
counsel and comfort in such case made and provided his looks fell upon
little peter who had kept ever at his side from the moment of his escape
from the village and now trotted along with the deferential humility
which became him while surrounded by so gallant and numerous an
assemblage but even little peter could not relieve him from the weight
of eulogy heaped on his head nor from the prickings of the conscience
which every word of praise and every encomiastic huzza seemed stirring up
in his breast

in this exigency he caught sight of the virginian mounted once more
upon his own trusty briareus which the younger bruce had brought with
him to the field of battle and remembered on the sudden that he had not
yet acquainted the former with the important discovery of the will which
he had so unexpectedly made in the village the young soldier was riding
side by side with his cousin for whom a palfrey had been easily provided
from the indian pound and indulging with her many a joyous feeling which
their deliverance was so well suited to inspire but his eye gleamed with
double satisfaction as he marked the approach of his trusty associate and
deliverer

we owe you life fortune everything he cried extending his hand
and be assured neither edith nor myself will forget it but how is this
nathan he added with a smile as he perceived the bundle of scalps
which nathan in the confusion or absence of his mind yet dangled in his
hands you were not used so freely to display the proofs of your
prowess

friend said nathan giving one look ghastly with sorrow and
perturbation to the shaking ringlets another to the youth thee looks
upon locks that was once on the heads of my children he thrust the
bundle into his bosom and pointed with a look of inexpressible triumph
to that of wenonga hanging to his belt and here he muttered is the
scalp of him that slew them it is enough friend thee has had my
story thee will not censure me but friend he added hastily as if
anxious to revert to another subject i have a thing to say to thee
which it concerns thee and the fair maid thee cousin to know there was
a will friend a true and lawful last will and testament of thee
deceased uncle in which theeself and thee cousin was made the sole heirs
of the same truly friend i did take it from the breast of the villain
that plotted thee ruin but truly it was taken from me again i know
not how

i have it safe said roland displaying it for a moment with great
satisfaction to nathan's eyes it makes me master of wealth which you
nathan shall be the first to share you must leave this wild life of the
border go with me to virginia 

i friend exclaimed nathan with a melancholy shake of the head thee
would not have me back in the settlements to scandalise them that is of
my faith no friend my lot is cast in the woods and thee must not ask
me again to leave them and friend thee must not think i have served
thee for the lucre of money or gain for truly these things is now to
me as nothing the meat that feeds me the skins that cover the leaves
that make my bed are all in the forest around me to be mine when i want
them and what more can i desire yet friend if thee thinks theeself
obliged by whatever i have done for thee i would ask of thee one favour
that thee can grant

a hundred said the virginian warmly

nay friend muttered nathan with both a warning and beseeching look
all that i ask is that thee shall say nothing of me that should
scandalise and disparage the faith to which i was born

i understand you said roland and will remember your wish

and now friend continued nathan do thee take theeself to the
haunts of thee fellows the habitations of them that is honest and
peaceful thee and the good maiden thee cousin for truly it is not
well neither for thee nor for her and especially for her that is
feeble and fearful to dwell nigh to where murdering injuns abound

yet go with us good nathan said edith adding her voice to the
entreaties of her kinsman there shall be none to abuse or find fault
with you

thee is a good maid said nathan surveying her with an interest that
became mournful as he spoke when thee goes back to thee father's house
thee will find them that will gladden at thee coming and hearts will
yearn with joy over thee young and lovely looks thee will smile upon
them and they will be happy such he added with deep emotion such
might have been my fate had the injun axe spared me but a single
child but it is not so there is none left to look upon me with smiles
and rejoicing none to welcome me from the field and the forest with the
voice of love no truly truly there is not one not one and as he
spoke his voice faltered his lip quivered and his whole countenance
betrayed the workings of a bereaved and mourning spirit

think not of this said roland deeply affected as his cousin also
was by this unexpected display of feeling in the rude wanderer the
gratitude of those you have so well served shall be to you in place of a
child's affection we will never forget our obligations come with us
nathan come with us

but nathan ashamed of the weakness which he could not resist had turned
away to conceal his emotion and stalking silently off with the
ever-faithful peter at his heels was soon hidden from their eyes

the virginian never saw his wild comrade again neither nathan's habits
nor inclinations carried him often into the society of his fellow-men
where reproaches and abuse were sure to meet him insult and contumely
were indeed no longer to be dreaded by the unresisting wanderer after
the extraordinary proofs of courage which he had that day given but
apparently he now found as little to relish in encomiums passed on his
valour as in the invectives to which he had been formerly exposed he
stole away therefore into the woods abandoning the army altogether
and was no more seen during the march

but roland did not doubt be should behold him again at bruce's
station where he soon found himself with his kinswoman in safety
and where now happily able to return to the land of his birth and the
home of his ancestors he remained during a space of two or three weeks
waiting the arrival of a strong band of virginia rangers who their term
of military service on the frontier having expired were on the eve of
returning to virginia and with whom he designed seeking protection for
his own little party during all this period he impatiently awaited the
re-appearance of nathan but in vain and as he was informed and indeed
from nathan's own admissions knew that the latter had no fixed place of
abode he saw that it was equally vain to attempt hunting him up in the
forest in short he was compelled to depart on his homeward journey a
journey happily accomplished in safety without again seeing him but
not until he had left with the commander of the station a goodly store of
such articles of comfort and necessity as he thought would prove
acceptable to his solitary friend

nor did he take leave without making others of his late associates
acquainted with his bounty the pledge he had given the dying renegade he
offered to redeem to the daughter by bearing her with him to virginia
and providing her a secure home under the protection of his cousin but
telie preferring rather to remain in the family of colonel bruce who
seemed to entertain for her a truly parental affection he took such
steps as speedily converted the poor dependent orphan into a person of
almost wealth and consequence his bounty-grants and land-warrants he
left in the hands of bruce with instructions to locate them to the best
advantage in favour of the girl to whom he assigned them with the proper
legal formalities a few hundred acres however being conveyed to
captain ralph and the worthy dodge of whom the latter had given over
all thought of returning to the bay-state having as he said got his
hand in to killing injuns and not caring a fourpence-ha'penny for the
whole everlasting set of them

thus settling up his accounts of gratitude he joyously and with edith
still more joyous at his side turned his face towards the east and
virginia towards fell-hallow and home to enjoy a fortune of happiness
to which the memory of the few weeks of anguish and gloom passed in the
desert only served to impart additional zest

nor did he even in the tranquil life of enjoyment which he was now
enabled to lead lose his interest in the individuals who had shared his
perils and sufferings his inquiries made wherever and whenever
intelligence could be obtained were continued for many years until in
fact the district and wilderness of kentucky existed no more but were
both merged in a state too great and powerful to be longer exposed to
the inroads of savages the information which he was able to glean in
relation to the several parties was however uncertain and defective
the means of intelligence being at that early period far from
satisfactory but such as it was we lay it before the reader

the worthy colonel bruce continued to live and flourish with his station
which soon grew into a town of considerable note the colonel himself
when last heard from was no longer a colonel his good stars his
military services and perhaps the fervent prayers of his wife having
transformed him one happy day into a gallant brigadier his son dick
trode in the footsteps and grew into the likeness of his brother tom
being as brave and good-humoured and far more fortunate and roland
heard a few years after his own departure from kentucky with much
satisfaction that the youth was busily occupied during such intervals
of peace as the indians allowed in clearing and cultivating the lands
bestowed on telie doe whom he had though scarce yet out of his teens
taken to wife

no very certain information was ever obtained in regard to the fate of
pardon dodge but there was every reason to suppose he remained in
kentucky fighting indians to the last having got so accustomed to that
species of pastime as to feel easy while practising it we are the more
inclined to think that such was the case as the name is not yet extinct
on the frontier and one individual bearing it has very recently in one
of the fiercest though briefest of indian wars covered it with immortal
lustre

of ralph stackpole the invader of indian horse-pounds it was captain
forrester's fortune to obtain more minute though we are sorry to say
scarce more satisfactory intelligence the luck good and bad together
which had distinguished roaring ralph in all his relations with roland
never it seems entirely deserted him his improvident harum-scarum
habits had very soon deprived him of all the advantages that might have
resulted from the soldier's munificent gift and left him a landless
good-for-nothing yet contented vagabond as before with poverty
returned sundry peculiar propensities which he had manifested in former
days so that ralph again lost savour in the nostrils of his
acquaintance and the last time that forrester heard of him he had got
into a difficulty in some respects similar to that in the woods of salt
river from which roland at edith's intercession had saved him in a
word he was one day arraigned before a county-court in kentucky on a
charge of horse-stealing and matters went hard against him his many
offences in that line having steeled the hearts of all against him and
the proofs of guilt in this particular instance being both strong and
manifold many an angry and unpitying eye was bent upon the unfortunate
fellow when his counsel rose to attempt a defence which he did in the
following terms gentlemen of the jury said the man of law here is
a man captain ralph stackpole indicted before you on the charge of
stealing a horse and the affa'r is pretty considerably proved on
him here there was a murmur heard throughout the court evincing much
approbation of the counsel's frankness gentlemen of the jury
continued the orator elevating his voice what i have to say in reply
is first that that man thar captain ralph stackpole did in the
year seventeen seventy-nine when this good state of kentucky and
particularly those parts adjacent to bear's grass and the mouth
thereof where now stands the town of louisville were overrun with
yelping injun-savages did i say gentlemen meet two injun-savages in
the woods on bear's grass and take their scalps single-handed a feat
gentlemen of the jury that a'n't to be performed every day even in
kentucky here there was considerable tumult in the court and several
persons began to swear secondly gentlemen of the jury exclaimed the
attorney-at-law with a still louder voice what i have to say
secondly gentlemen of the jury is that this same identical
prisoner at the bar captain ralph stackpole did on another occasion
in the year seventeen eighty-two meet another injun-savage in the
woods a savage armed with rifle knife and tomahawk and met him
with you suppose gentlemen with gun axe and scalper in like
manner no gentlemen of the jury with his fists and with a
voice of thunder licked him to death in the natural way gentlemen
of the jury pass upon the prisoner guilty or not guilty the attorney
resumed his seat his arguments were irresistible the jurors started up
in their box and roared out to a man not guilty from that moment
it may be supposed roaring ralph could steal horses at his pleasure
nevertheless it seems he immediately lost his appetite for horse-flesh
and leaving the land altogether he betook himself to a more congenial
element launched his broad-horn on the narrow bosom of the salt and was
soon afterwards transformed into a mississippi alligator in which
amphibious condition we presume he roared on to the day of his death

as for the valiant nathan slaughter the last of the list of worthies
after whom the young virginian so often inquired less was discovered in
relation to his fate than that of the others a month or more perhaps
after roland's departure he re-appeared at bruce's station where he was
twice or thrice again seen but whether it was that as we have once
before hinted he found the cheers and hearty hurrahs in token of
respect for his valiant deeds at wenonga's town with which bruce's
people received him more embarrassing and offensive than the flings and
sarcasms with which they used in former days to greet his appearance or
whether he had some still more stirring reason for deserting the
neighbourhood it is certain that he in a short time left the vicinity
of salt river altogether going no man knew whither he went and with
him his still inseparable friend little dog peter

from that moment the jibbenainosay ceased to frequent his accustomed
haunts in the forest the phantom nick of the woods was never more beheld
stalking through the gloom nor was his fearful cross ever again seen
traced on the breast of a slaughtered indian

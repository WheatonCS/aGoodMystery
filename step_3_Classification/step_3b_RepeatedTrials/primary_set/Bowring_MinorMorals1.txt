haying been engaged in the publication
 a work which is intended to
establish the principles morality on
what appears to me their only true and
sure foundation namely their influence
upon the happiness mankind
it had often occurred to me that it
would be rendering some service to
those whose opinions will be the
opinions the coming generations if
the theory genuine morals could be
elucidated for the service the young
by the blending amusement and instruction

and in the attempt to accomplish
so important a purpose i felt encouragement
from a frequently repeated
observation mr bentham's that
nothing is wanting for the establishment
 sound opinions in all questions
 right and wrong but the determination
to follow the consequences 
actions into the regions pain and
pleasure no better guide for judgment
has i believe been ever proposed
 and my conviction is as strong
as it can be that it is impossible to
add to the stock virtue without
adding to that felicity or to increase
the amount felicity without increasing
that virtue
with the exception those illus
rationis which have been borrowed
from history most the facts referred
to belong to my own observation and
experience and i have the rather
chosen to draw on such sources from
the conviction that the everyday wants
ofhfe afford to every man ample scope
for the application that standard 
morality whose universal recognition
will as i behaves be the characteristic
 a new and better era
this little volume is launched as an
experiment if welcomed it will be
followed by others in which the
greatest happiness principle will be
applied to a variety ofother topics
my wish is to cover the whole field
 thought and action with seeds which
appear to promise so fair so rich a
harvest whether the husbandman is
worthy his labor i know not nor
know i if the ground is ready for the
scattering the grain j but that it is
destined to fill future fields with products
 beauty and plenty i cannot
doubt and the seeds i fling around
me all will not assuredly fall in stony
places or be choked with nettles and
briars j b
anger
 oh see how that cruel fellow is beating
his poor beast said arthur howard to his
father and his brother george as they were
going out for an early country walk arthur's
attention had been excited by a shabbily dressed
man who was belaboring a roughcoated
feeble and blind old horse that was dragging
or rather attempting to drag a cart with a
heavy load vegetables to market the
poor creature tried and tried but could not
get the wheels out the rut in which they
had stuck and the driver whose anger increased
with the increased but vain attempts
 the horse to move onward was dealing
 minor morals
out ms blows most unmercifully about the
animals legs and bead and swearing more
loudly and laying on more violently at every
stroke what an abominable rascal exclaimed
arthur again til iv and away
he scampered almost as much in a passion as
the man whom he was going to reprimand
and to punish
now see said his father to george in
what an unfit state arthur is for doing a
humane thing ho intends to act kindly and
generously but he will most likely make
matters worse he will only exasperate the
man the more and the poor beast will be the
sufferer for his imprudence
what do you mean you worthless vagabond
v cried arthur when out breath and
hardly able to find words for his rage he
came up to the carter what what do
anger ii
tou mean by treating the poor horse so
wickedly what do i mean mr impertinent
there that's what i mean upon which
he turned upon the silent and suffering creature
with far greater violence than before and
smote him so ferociously that every blow made
arthur's heart shudder within him
 and now young gentleman if you don't
move off said the man mayhap i may try
how you like the stick upon your own shoulders
by way teaching you how to meddle with
other peoples concerned
arthur was a boy humane and generous
dispositions and he could not immediately see
that he had done anything wrong by giving way
to what he had perhaps thought as many others
would have thought a natural and proper sentiment
 indignation yet he felt he must have
made some mistake for he had failed in his
 minor morals
purpose and with a spirit somewhat broken
and subdued he ran back to his father and his
brother
 well my boy v were the first words he
heard from his father and what have you
got by throwing yourself into such a towering
passions how could i help it papa when
i saw that mans frightful cruelty but
has your passion been any service to you
arthur did it help you to persuade the
cruel man or to rescue the suffering beast
you intended to do what was humane i know 
but you set about it rashly your anger was
more violent than your reason you were more
bent upon punishing than preventing an offence 
and though you proposed to do good you have
only done evils
but tell us papa said george whose
temper was more sedate and whose judgment
anger 
more cool tian his brother's is anger never
justifiable never commendable must one see
all sorts wicked and improper conduct and
not be angry with it i have often heard
indignation called generous and anger virtuous
are they never so 
never my son for what is anger it
is pain pain inflicted on yourself by which
you are excited to inflict pain on another
it may be necessary to inflict pain on another
for that other's good and for the good society
but your being angry is just the way to prevent
you from properly judging what pain and how
much pain it is right to inflict in order to produce
that good now if arthur instead breaking
out into a storm passion had first considered
what he really meant to do which was to
induce that ignorant man to refrain from misusing
that unfortunate beast he would have prevented
b minor morals
three mischiefs the mischief being in a passion
 with all its pains annoyances and dis
appointments the mischief to the animal which
has only suffered the more from his interference
and the mischief to the carter whom
he has but exasperated the more and perhaps
strengthened in his vicious propensities
the lesson was borne in mind and as is the
case with all good and useful lessons an early
opportunity was found applying it to practice
the morning walk was continued it was a
great delight for the lads to ramble into the
fields with their father soon after break day 
and such walks were the frequent rewards 
their good behaviour the day before on such
occasions mr howard was accustomed to talk
to them on all the subjects their studies and
to make it his invariable rule to tell them something
they had not heard before for he had
anger 
travelled much and studied mueli and what
was best all his travels and his studies and
all his thoughts had been always busied in
making others happy
 course he was universally loved for it is
but natural we should love those who do us
kind services and there is no service so kind
as that making us happy
he talked to his boys the beauties 
nature that surrounded them and showed them
in what a wonderful variety ways beauty is
a source pleasure he bade them listen to
the songs the birds to the fall the
waters to the thousand sounds the earth
and air teaching them how each added something
to the great account living happiness
when the wind blew in their faces or the sun
shone on their foreheads or the frost bit the
ends their fingers he told them how each
 minor morals
administered to mans enjoyment if the air
was fragrant with the flowers spring or the
sweet hay summer he explained to them
how the organs smell were made subservient
to the same great and as they looked upon
the different tribes busy creatures partaking
 the various food presented to them by their
makers munificence he pointed out how
numerous their pleasures how perpetually renewed
how marvellously provided for how
infinitely spread sees said he the great
purpose providence the general lesson 
creation happiness 
and the thought again came over arthur's
mind that anger never made anybody the
happier
they returned homeward their walk had
been long longer than usual whom should
they meet but the carman who had excited
anger y
so much arthur's indignation a few hours
before he had delivered his cartload to the
market gardener and was walking sulkily by
the side his cart every now and then giving
the poor horse a heavy stroke with his stick
the horse however being now relieved 
his burthen moved on with something like
activity the man no sooner saw arthur
approaching than as if in pure spite and contradiction
he struck his beast a vehement blow
upon his nose but arthur had learnt wisdom 
and his father was charmed to see that he was
struggling to check the outbreak his anger
he however went to the carter who began
to scowl at him as he approached expecting
no doubt another violent scolding but arthur
had found out his mistake the man perceived
the difference and his own looks changed as
arthur said to him in a quiet and gentle tone
 minor morals
 i spoke to you improperly this morning 
i am sorry for it the man did not give the
horse another blow and once or twice as
george and arthur turned round to watch
what was going on which they did very cautiously
indeed they saw the carter kindly
patting his poor beast upon the back and heard
him singing in the distance a goodhumored
song
courage
in the evening george and arthur went into
their father's library to give an account the
school business the day i have been
reading said george such an interesting
story in livy where he tells the courage
and devotedness the young curtis what
a fine example patriotism papa v but
arthur had not read the roman historian and
george was called upon to describe the event
which he did in the following words it was
between three and four hundred years before
the christian era when a large gap suddenly
opened in the forum at rome the people
were affrighted and consulted the oracles as
to the meaning so alarming a catastrophe
 minor morals
the oracles answered that the gap would not
close until the greatest treasures rome were
flung into it upon this a young roman whose
name was curtis asked his countrymen whether
they possessed any treasures so great as their
weapons and their courage they acknowledged
they had none and the young curtis
clad himself in full armour mounted his horse
plunged into the chasm and perished the
people gathered round and poured offerings
 flowers and fruits after him into the void
which soon closed over him but can the story
be true papa the probability is my boys
in this as in other instances where miraculous
events are spoken by the classical historians
that a portion truth is the groundwork upon
livy has the candor to confess that he sometimes
records the expressions a credulous age and excuses
himself if in speaking the past his mind is under the
influences produced by the tone ancient days xliii 
courage 
which a fable has been raised but in this case
it does not seem very difficult to separate the
facts from the fictions it appears to me most
likely that curtis was destroyed by one the
great earthquakes which have so frequently
visited italy and sometimes changed the character
 the surface the country curtis
was perhaps some young man distinguished for
his rank and his virtues who perished with his
armour on while assisting the citizens during
the sufferings created by such an event his
name and deeds were kept alive in the memory
 generations till in progress time they
were associated with that fabulous decoration
which now accompanies them another historian
festus speaks the place where the chasm
was as having been covered with water and
being called the curtis lacus and it is
very likely that a lake would be the result 
the changes which an earthquake would produce
 minor morals
was it not if true a very brave and heroic
action papa was not his courage very praiseworthy
 do you think in these days so much
 selfdevotion would be found inquired
george
 i say yes to all your questions george
the action was courageous was praiseworthy 
and i believe if needful imitators would not
now be found wanting i do not think any real
virtue has diminished in the world and i am
sure some virtues have greatly increased
 i am glad continued mr howard you
have introduced the subject for i wished to
show yon that courage is not always a virtue
and therefore not always worthy your admiration
or your applause if it is not useful for
some good purpose it has nothing in it to
deserve approval the courage a bad ran
may be exceedingly vicious the timidity a
good man may be preeminently virtuouscourage

courage only enables a man to subdue difficulties
 but the difficulties may be in the way
either his wisdom or his folly
 i will give you a few examples and you
shall tell me whether courage is always intitled
to praise and you will try to distinguish
between the courage that is virtuous and that
which is not so
 during my travels in spain i fell in with
a famous bandit chieftain whose name was
jayme alfonso a man whose adventures were
far more romantic and marvellous than those
 either the english freebooter robin hood
or the scotch mountaineer rob toy jayme
was brave but not cruel and i say this because
some writers have hastily and thoughtlessly said
that no brave man was ever cruel but my
boys there have been many men very brave
and very cruel it happens that people get into
their beads a notion that courage is a virtue 
 minor morals
always a virtue so when they find men
committing cruel acts they deny these menes
courage though their courage is really as
remarkable as their cruelty this comes from
the confused notions that the world is filled
with as to what is virtue and what not
jayme was one the most courageous men
i ever knew or heard he was daunted
by no dangers he seemed never to think 
his privations he lived year after year amidst
the rocks and the forests and sometimes for
whole months entered no human habitation
it was his custom to order his band to disperse
at sunset and he invariably fixed on someplace
for their meeting at break day jayme
however had many virtuous qualities and
when the remembrances the past came over
him when he thought the days his youth
and his innocence regrets and penitence sometimes
broke out in tears i had when in spain
courage 
a muleteer for a servant who told me that a
brother his a boy who had wandered away
from crevillente the birthplace jayme
once saw a man sitting on a rock hanging
over a stream weeping bitterly he soon
found from his dress appearance and the
number weapons he wore that it was jayme
the robber and being much alarmed took to
his heels and ran away but jayme summoned
him back seized him by the hand and
inquiring his name told him he knew his
family and that they were honest people and
that he hoped the boy would be honest too 
for he said am jayme el ladrone and
very wretched am i indeed yet i was once
as innocent and as happy as you
 but i was about to tell you an instance 
jaymes courage the governor crevillente
had been long in search jayme and his band
they had done so many kind things to the
c
 minor morals
peasantry they had provided food for the
necessitous in the time a dearth and had
so frequently relieved them with the money
they had plundered from travellers that jayme
was popular throughout all the district and
not a villager or cottager would betray him or
his companions a regiment soldiers had
been for years kept marching and countermarching
in pursuit jayme who had often
surprised them and had even carried away some
 the officers to his mountain haunts and on
one occasion where a lieutenant had been
wounded and left for dead in a skirmish with
the bandits jayme took him to some the
deepest solitudes the neighbourhood cured
him his wounds and conducted him safely
to the main road which led to the town 
crevillente jaymes mother lived in that
town she was a respectable person independent
though not wealthy and one day
courage 
the governor exasperated with jayme's
long resistance and weary his own vain
attempts to capture him ordered jaymes
mother to be arrested thrown into prison
and levied a heavy fine upon her declaring
she should not have her liberty till
she divulged the hiding place her son she
could not have done this if she would for
jayme never communicated to her any 
his proceedings so that the conduct the
governor was alike useless unjust and cruel
the next daw it was before the sun had

arisen a sternfaced man with a rifle in his
hand and several pistols in his belt his bare legs
girded with the chickweed sandals worn by the
valencia peasantry and clad in one those
button covered vests whose arms hang over
the shoulders and often entangle themselves
with the many colored ribands that float from
the band the sombrero hat a stern faced
 minoe morals
man appeared at the gate the governor's
abode and said he came on matters extreme
urgency and must have an instant audience 
his excellency his presence awed the guard
and supposing perhaps that he was a messenger
 the government he was allowed to enter
and without saying a word he marched straight
to the governor's bed room who was still
asleep shutting the door he stood erect at the
foot the bed aroused the governor and said
in a loud voice i am jayme the robber and
am answerable for my own deeds you have
taken a poor old woman she was helpless 
she is innocent you have extorted money
from her you have thrown her into prison
now hear me the sun has not yet risen if
before that sun sets the money is not restored
and the prison doors opened in the grave i
have ordered to be dug for you you shall be
buried i am jayme the robber he left
courage 
as he had entered unmolested but the governor
knew so well the firmness and determination
 jayme that he ordered the money
to be paid back and the prisoner to be released
and the circumstances were related
to me on the spot soon after they occurred
 this was indeed courage papa v exclaimed
arthur was it virtuous courage no
doubt it was arthur for it checked injustice
rescued innocence and gave a lesson to the
governor he would not soon forgets
 and will you teach us papa how we
may know when courage is really a virtue
and when it is not 
yesv said mr howard i will first
give you a rule for judging not only courage
but every other quality whether or not they
are virtues and then i will mention another
example or two in illustration
 have told you that a coward is not
 minor morals
necessarily bad nor a brave man necessarily
good courage like other dispositions maybe
applied to wicked purposes it may be
injurious to the courageous person and injurious
to others if courage make men less
happy if it expose them to useless risks and
annoyances if it injure the comforts or destroy
the property others it is not a virtue buta
vice guided by prudence and by benevolence
courage is virtuous but if it is
not directed by these it may be quite the
contrary
 have you heard sebastian cabot one
 the earliest and most adventurous among
maritime discoverers in he sailed for
south america he had only two countrymen
with him and the jealousy the spanish
captains immediately under hin broke out
into open disaffection a clamour was raised
among the crews which menaced not only his
courage 
own life but the safety the whole expedition
cabot was almost a stranger among
them disliked because a stranger and not less
misrepresented than disliked mended was
second in authority rajas and rodas two 
the captains in command and these three men
were the leaders in that insubordination which
was on the point breaking out into mutiny
cabot's energy and courage were equal to the
occasion he seized on rajas placed him
with mended and rodas in a boat which conveyed
them to shore the eflpect says the
historian was instants discord vanished and
for five years service through which the
expedition passed full as they were toil
privation and peril we hear not the slightest
murmur on the contrary everything indicates
the most harmonious action and the most devoted
fidelity now this was an instance
memoirs cabot p 
 minor morals
 courage this was prudence this was virtue
and you will find a thousand such in the
history intrepid and virtuous men
 there is in some the towns germany
an institution which exhibits the most exalted
courage united with the most praiseworthy
benevolence at hamburg for example there
are certain men chosen for their known in
rapidity whose office it is to rescue human
beings from dangers to be so chosen is
deemed one the highest honors that can be
conferred by their fellowcitizens they wear
a peculiar uniform are found in certain stations
 the city and bear the name menschenbetter
or men savers in cases fire or flood
or other public calamities it is their special
business to rescue human beings from the perils
that surround them others may be occupied
with the preservation property their concern
is with human life alone and the instances
courage 
 heroic self exposure which i have heard 
show how much courageous virtue there is
in the world and what an extraordinary power
the good opinion our fellows has to excite
it there is not one these menschenretter
who has not often exposed his own life and
often saved others from destruction even
before the honorable title is conferred manyare
the efforts selfdevotion to obtain it
they have been known to force their way
through the raging flames and to have rescued
infants in the highest stories houses when
the roof was failing in and after the staircases
had been consumed it is not long ago that
one the most distinguished the menschenbetter
a celebrated mathematical instrumentmaker
at hamburg made a desperate attempt
to save a fellowcreature in a building that
was being rapidly consumed by fire he failed
the flames had made too much progress
 minor morals
roof beams all fell in he was buried in the
ruins his mutilated corpse was afterwards
found it was exposed in the market place to
the grateful gaze ten thousands the people
it was remarked that though the body
was terribly mutilated the features were scarcely
changed they were calm and serene as if
in sleep the menschenretter had often been
heard to say there are two ways in either
 which i desire to die in the exercise
 my oflqce or surrounded by my friends
both wishes may be said to have been fulfilled
in one for multitudes friends witnessed his
heroism and deplored his fate all admired
all wept and they followed him with solemn
hymns to his grave
here my boys was courage here was
benevolence here was virtue v
 we understand we understand exclaimed
arthur and george at the same time you
courage 
need not tell us now what the courage is that
is not virtue 
 good night lads mamma and edith will
be our party tomorrow
generosity
mrs howard returned the following day accompanied
by miss edith and great was the
joy and great the greeting on their arrival 
for edith who was a special favorite and an
only sister had been very ill and was now
come back from a visit to the sea shore where
her health had been improved and she clapped
her hands for very joy as she entered the doors
first clasping her papa and then her brothers
round the neck and then running about wildly
and then coming back again and asking a
thousand questions and leaping and dancing
and forgetting everything but her own happiness
and her parents looked at her with
smiles pleasure and the boys laughed aloud
generosity 
at her antics till at last tired out with enjoyments
she sat herself clown on a stool at her
mamma's feet o dear dear v she said 
what a nice thing it is to be at home again v
it was near the time for school mr howard
took his hat and went out to his business and
the two boys having again kissed their young
sister tripped away lighthearted to their
lessons
 you said mamma that when we came
home you would talk to me about that generous
little girl who gave money to all the beggars
as we rode along was it not very kind and
very good 
 i dare say it seemed so to you edith and
yet the money which that little girl so carelessly
threw away might have been much better employed

better employed mamma i thought there
could be no better employment than charity 
 minor morals
by charity i suppose you mean doing
goods love and what if the money so spent
instead doing good does harm
 can that possibly be mamma can there
be harm in assisting the poor v
 there can be no harm in assisting the poor
edith if you do them real services but there
may be much harm in acting without any consideration
as to the consequences what
you do
but are not the consequences the relief 
their wants mamma and is it not right to
relieve them and ought not we to show pity
towards the distressed and to help them as
far as we can 
we ought my dear to do whatever we canto
relieve and remove distress but in order todo
so we must always ask ourselves how we can
relieve it most speedily and most effectually
and that you may judge for yourself and
generosity 
understand my meaning i will tell you the
difference between the person who gives money
prudently and usefully and the person who
does not money is given to the poor for the
relief some want but suppose it creates
more wants than it relieves or for the cure
 some misfortune now fancy that it produces
more misfortune than it cures certainly it
would be wrong to give the money the want
 prudence and providence among the poor
cannot be provided against unless they suffer
something for their neglect it is often for
their own interest that they should suffer if
i punish you for a fault it is not because i have
any pleasure in punishing you and seeing you
suffer but because i know unless you are made
to suffer you will not try to correct the fault
if a poor person were as well or better off by
his laziness or his drunkenness than he would
be by his industry and his temperance he would
 minor morals
have a stronger motive to do wrong than todo
right you must always try to give to people
reasons or motives for doing right suppose
one boy works hard very hard in the fields
and at the the weary day gets sixpence
for his labor and there is another idle beggarboy
who gets a shilling without work by
merely asking alms travellers the bad boy
will be twice as well recompensed as the
good boy and every penny you have given
the bad boy is an encouragement to his idleness
and his beggary i have seen a little
girl who hunted for mushrooms all the day
long she was then a pattern neatness and
industry she went into the fields and was
as diligent and as busy as could be and in
the evening if she had earned two or threepence
by the sale her mushrooms she was
as pleased as possible but one evening when
she was coming home from her walks and
generosity 
very tired indeed she was lie saw a girl 
about her own age who asked charity from a
lady in a fine carriage and the lady threw
her a shilling and said to her in a very kind
tone there poor child upon which
the little girl who had been used to gather
up pennies and twopences and threepences
by her own industry said to herself why
do i lead this weary life why do i go
trudging away through field and field and
after all can only get a few halfpence for all
my toils and travels i will turn beggar too
and so she did and she lost her good habits
and took to bad ones the clean and diligent
child was no longer to be seen hunting for
mushrooms in the field she became a practised
beggar and at last an insolent one and
then grew careless about right and wrong 
and invented stories about her sufferings that
were untrue and ended by committing crimes
d
s minor morris
for which she was transported to a distant
land and sorrowful indeed it was to recall
the time her childhood when she gathered
mushrooms in the green fields now
you must not think that the lady who gave
the shilling to the beggargirl intended to act
amiss she thought she did a generous thing
and it was generous to give a shilling to a
poor child but it was very mischievous and
thus you see that to be generous is not quite
the same as to be wise and goods
may not money be sometimes generously
and usefully given asked edith who looked
a little perplexed and who before her mammalesson
began had been thinking that she would
spend all her money among the poor beggars
who accosted her edith had indeed been
much fascinated by the smiles with which all
the beggars looked upon her generous young
companion and thought how very delightful it
generosity 
twould he if she could hear addressed to herself
the same words which had been used to her
fellowtraveller god bless you sweet young
lady a pleasant journey to you and thank
your goodness but her mother's conversation
had brought many new thoughts into her mind
and she therefore timidly inquired whether
money might not sometimes be generously
and usefully given
yes indeed love v answered mrs howard
 and to enable you to give it generously and
usefully you must give it prudently
nor was an occasion long wanting for
tvhile they were talking a servant came in and
said that a sad accident had just happened in
front the house a waggonload timber
was passing and one the beams not having
been carefully fastened had slipped off and
had fallen upon a crippled man who was crossing
the road and was supposed to have done
 minor morals
mm serious injury mrs howard hastened to
the spot and was followed by edith they
soon found that the poor man's leg was broken 
we must immediately send for a surgeon
said mrs howard to edith you may be
generous now
and edith saw at once that there had been
no fault on the part the man and that she
could do no harm to him nor to anybody else
by her liberality so she ran in and despatched
a servant for a surgeon and she asked to be
allowed to pay out her own pocket money
the expenses the poor man's cure
happy was the evening when the family
were all gathered together edith told her
brothers the sights she had seen at the sea
 the pleasure she had in playing with the
waves how they rushed up the sloping shore
broke into white foam and then ran back
again to meet the advancing tide she told
n
generosity 
them how the waters rolled the pebbles one
over another till all their sharp points were
made round how she had seen the seagulls
float on the surface the ships with their white
sails in the distance and the fishermen arriving
with their boats full mackerel shining like
bright silver and emeralds in the sun she
told them how high the waves rose at the
time the full moon and how low the neaptides
sank how the seabirds flew aloft in the
calm weather and how when the storms were
coming on they hovered close upon the top
 the surges and the waves never rests
she said but splash and splash and rise and
fall all the night and all the day long as if
they could never be tired
 but i must tell you arthur the accident
we have had today and though
arthur had heard it all from the servants on
his return from school he let the talkative
 minor morals
little girl rattle on and recount in her own
way the story the poor man whose leg had
been broken
she said nothing however the part she
had taken in the business nothing her own
good deeds nothing even the conversation
with her mamma about liberality and charity
sand don't you think edith said mrs
howard to her that you could now explain
the difference between generosity and true
goodness edith blushed and answered i
have been thinking mamma that generosity
is very like the jackdaw in the fable strutting
about in borrowed feathers and making a great
clatter about merits that are not its own 
intolerance
 there was a very droll dispute at school
today papa v said george one boy insisted
that a latin verse was written one way in the
original another declared it was written another
way the quarrel became so hot that we expected
it would have ended in blows when
one the bigger boys recommended that each
should bring his and it was found that
each had quoted the passage correctly from
his own copy but they had different editions
and the text was diflferent
it was said mr howard only a small
display that intolerance which there are
too many great exhibitions in the world
each boy thought himself right and had
 minor morals
good reason for thinking so but there was
not the same reason for thinking the other
wrong he had seen his own with his
own eyes and had therefore very sufficient
evidence for himself but he could not know
what evidence the other had had hence the
folly expecting everybody to think as we
think they will think as we think if the
same reasons are given to them and if those
reasons influence them as they influence us
if they have other reasons unknown to us or
if our reasons appear to them not to warrant
our opinions they cannot think as we
think it is impossible and there is no help
for it
but what ought to be helped and oidght to
be avoided is our attempting to punish others
because they do not see as we see or think
as we think this is persecution
when i was in lisbon i was accompanied

down to pray when he saw two blackpinioned
birds descend from heaven one which seized
the rudder and the other perched on the bow
 the ship by these he was safely conducted
to portugal and among the majority the
portuguese there is no more doubt the
 minor morals
miracle than the ordinary events which
they have been witnesses themselves
did you believe the story papa inquired
edith
by no means and though i never said
anything which should show that i felt contempt
for the credulity the portuguese yet
i have no doubt they considered me somewhat
heretical
 come said the monk come with me to
the tgreja de sao antonio and i will give you
such evidence as shall be irresistible we
walked together under the magnificent arches
 the church between avenues pillars on
many which the miracles the saint were
recorded and we reached a narrow staircase at
the foot the tower follow mess said the
monki and fear notes i ascended after him the
long longwinding stone steps the darkness 
the way being only lighted by distant gleams
intolerance 
which broke through the narrow interstices
left in the thick walls and on reaching the
top the monk pointed out a huge cage it
was as large as an ordinary sized room in
which were two enormous black crows gravelyseated
on a metal bar look there seniors
said the monk and bowed his head reverently
before the crows those are the identical birds
which brought st anthony hither and do
you doubt the miracle now 
 i doubted and did not doubt the less inconsequence
 what i saw and why did i
doubt edith 
t suppose papa because you did not think
they were the real crows that brought st
anthony to lisbon
 even so my love and i did not believe
that st anthony had been brought to lisbon
by crows at all and the attempt to convince
 minor morals
me that the two crows were still living and
had lived for many hundreds years was one
difficulty more to believe and not one difficulty
less
the menes reasoning was what logicians
call begging the questions he took for
granted the very thing to be proved that st
anthony had been escorted by the crows and
then fancied that his telling me the crows i
saw were the real crows was to weigh down
all my experience the habits the animal
all my knowledge natural history and the
very natural reflection that it was much more
likely there should be a succession crows
provided by the monk and his brethren as the
old ones died than that a perpetual miracle
should be wrought in order to prove the truth
 a very improbable story besides i saw
that the crows were richly and regularly fed
intolerance 
and i might have asked him why if the crows
were miraculously preserved all the expenses
 nourishing them were not saved 
and did you not tell him papa that you
could look through the whole the imposture
v said george did you not tell him
that he was a rogue and that you were not
to be duped by his roguery 
softly my impatient boy that would
neither have been prudent nor courteous it
would have done neither me nor him nor
anybody any good no good to me for i
should have been exposed to some danger the
monk would have looked upon me with hatred
because my expression incredulity would
have implied contempt for his opinions or
distrust his honesty and veracity it would
have done him no good for it was his interest
to persist in the fraud and as to the fads 
the case he knew more about them than i
 minor morals
did and no good to anybody else for nobody
else was present but it may do good now
to you and to others for to others you may
tell the story as i may tell it to others
 my purpose in telling the story was not
to excite your scorn or dislike towards the
monk who though h could not believe
against the knowledge he had that those identical
crows really escorted st anthony up the
tagus may have believed that st anthony
leas escorted by crows i did not wish you
to be angry with the monk or the monk's
tale but i wished to ask you two questions
if i had really desired and tried to believe
the story coidd i have done so in spite 
myself
 no indeed papa that would have been
impossible said all the children at once 
 you would not have been so foolish
 and if i could not have believed it even
intolerance 
though i wished to believe it could i do so
because the monk or any other person wished
me to believe it y
 oh no no they all repeated again and
again
swell then my children the lesson i
wished to teach you is this never be angry
with any person merely because his opinion
is not your opinion never be angry because
you cannot persuade him to change his opinion
and above all never do him an injury or
hesitate about doing him a good because his
opinions and yours are different nobody can
believe what he likes however he may try todo
so at all events if he hears all that is to
be said on all sides a question still less
can anybody believe according to the likings
 others where you doubt inquire in
your own opinions seek nothing but truth
because truth after all is the great thing in
 minor morals
your conduct to others be guided by the rule
that you should never cause useless pain in
the minds the best men there is always
has been and always perhaps will be much
difference opinion as to what is true but
everybody knows and feels what is mnd and
truth itself is most likely to be found when
it is sought for by tolerance and benevolence

 i canst understand plato papa his fine
words are without meaning to my minds said
george he says that all truth and science
is in recollection but we can only recollect
what we know and you papa have always
taught us to observe and to inquire and to
gather up knowledge from all around us but
plato says all knowledge is in ourselves do
you think the ancient philosophers understood
the science morals as well as the moderns

 assuredly not answered mr howard 
 we have the experience many generations
to add to their experience plato lived at a
period when it was the fashion to treat the
e
 minor morals
great majority human beings with contempt
he owns that his morality was not intended
for universal use it was too sublime for those
whom he called the vulgar but christianity
teaches us to regard all men as our brethren
and no system morality can be really good
which is not fitted for mankind
 in those days the many were slaves to the
few and as was natural the few treated the
many with scorn and insolence they called
them a base and unlettered herd and seemed
to consider them as belonging to a different
race they were indeed in many respects
worse off than the poor blacks in the west
india islands nothing gives a meaner notion
 the doctrines what is denominated the
academic school than their carelessness about
the happiness all but themselves and the
contumelious manner in which they put forth
their opinions
advicegiving 
to give advice to others prudently and
benevolently is one the lessons i would
have my children learn on this subject there
are among the distichs cato some very
admirable counsels which i should like them
to commit to their memory and they will serve
to illustrate what i have to say
submit thy tongue to virtue's discipline
for welljudged silence is a gift divine
therefore do not intrude advice unless you
aire sure it will be useful if it is likely to
irritate and do not improve the person to
whom it is addressed restrain yourself from
giving it your silence in such case will bea
 welljudged silence
 give no advice which is injurious to
yourself this also is the counsel cato
 virtute primam esse put compeers lingua
proxies ille neo est qui sit ratione facere
 minor morals
injuring thyself if others thou condemn
well may they deem that thou wilt injure them
and a serious injury to yourself it will be
if you give advice that is illtimed intrusive
or unbecoming advicegiving assumes superiority
and the right to give it must only
be used where the good to be done is undoubted

if you give advice give it benevolently
do not mingle censure with it for censure
will exasperate speak always in the tones 
kindness never anger
for ire brings hatred concord nurtures love's
besides we must moderate oar accusations
 others for we are not ourselves free from
blame
 seme repugnant tibi tu contraries esse
convenient nulli qui secum dissidet ipse
t ira odium general concordia nntrit amorem
advicegiving 
he will be slow to censure others who
feels he is bare to others censure too
 and now having given you so much 
morals without a story i will tell you a story
 which you shall find the moral
sin a country that had never been visited
by man a stream broke forth from the mountain
side and ran dancing into the valley
at every step it sparkled with joy and sang
delighted a perpetual song to every flower
that it passed to every bush and every tree
that grew near it and the flowers breathed
sweet odours above it and the trees gratefully
lowered their branches and often the little
birds having bathed themselves in its sprightly
waters sat on the shrubs which were closest
to the current and tried to excel one another
in the boldness and the variety their music
 si vitam inspicias hominem si denique mores
cum culpes alios nemo sine crime vivitj
 minor morals
over the stream the lark loved to soar and
to look down from the heavens that he might
see his reflection on the surface the kingfishers
built their nests upon its banks and
lulled themselves to sleep with its dulcet murmurs
the place was like a little paradise
and had been so for ages the stream could not
remember that it had ever had cause to grieve 
it had seen evernew generations flowers
and watered by its care they constantly
increased in number and lost nothing in
beauty the change seasons did not interfere
with its pleasures the rain added
to its strength and usefulness brought news
from the clouds or from the neighboring hills
whence the rivulets came with their contributions
 the sunshine brightened its face with
silvery light in the daytime it talked withall
the living creatures that surrounded it
in the night the moon and stars would often
advicegiving 
visit it and dance upon its dancing wavelets
in the storm it only lifted up its voice more
loudly to keep harmony with the great concert
around in truth it was a happy stream and
seemed to have the art diffusing happiness
all about its neighborhood
 one day an unusual noise was heard
the stream looked up and saw a large black
creature hovering over it who can this new
visitor be v whispered the stream to a bluebell
that had been just singing the daybreak hour
as it was wont to do in order to wake a
beautiful green lizard that slept in a bed 
moss only a few steps away from the flower
indeed i don't know said the bluebell 
 but i will ring the louder that i may rouse
my neighbor and send him oflp to the kingfisher
who is more a traveller than i and
who can perhaps tell us something about the
strangers when the lizard woke and had
 minor morals
washed himself as usual in the goodnatured
stream away he ran to the kingfisher abode
to ask what the black monster could be that
had come with his discordant voice to trouble
the peace the place the kingfisher said
he had seen in his journey black beetles and
black crows and black cats and black whales
but which these it was the lizard could not
tell him so he said he would come and look
for himself he put his gay feathers in order
which had been rather ruffled by the lizard's
intrusion and then shot away like an arrow
to the place where the monster was
 but before he arrived he heard him
croaking in the most illnatured and insolent
tone and abusing the favorite stream in a way
that seemed quite shocking to the poor kingfisher
who observed as he went along that
all the flowers were hanging their heads or
turning away from the black creatures s abuse
advicegiving 
he slw too that the lark had flown up to
the clouds in order to be out hearings and
that there was a general commotion amidst all
the inhabitants the happy region and
when he listened these were the words he
heard 
 cease that noise thou everlasting babbler
 canst thou not stop tormenting us with
thine incessant tongue here ever since i
came into the neighborhood hast thou been
tattling prate prate helterskelter i wonder
what use such a headachegiving intruder
can be running down the slope the hill
then over the valley here and there one side
and another side just as if all the land were
thine own and then impudent scampering
down to the very sea i should like to know
who gave thee an invitation into other people s
company a pert little country jude moving
into the great world without anybody asking
 minor morals
thee and here have i been for the last
halfhour wearying myself with giving good
advice which the insolent vagabond takes
no notice tis past endurance
 upon which the raven for it was a raven
dashed violently into the stream and the
stream instead losing its temper merely
washed the dirt off the ravens wings
 but at this moment all the community setup
such a shout indignation that the raven
was very glad to betake himself to flight and
never again did he appear in the land the
streams
presence mind
among the daily topics conversation in mr
towards family were the interesting events
which the newspapers communicated what
an advantages remarked mr howard we
have over past generations what a quantity
 instruction is brought to us every day 
what a perpetual contribution valuable
topics for reflection does a newspaper bring 
 how many countries it speaks how many
occurrences it records how far it travels in
search information and how far it communicates
the information that it collects together 
think how many thousands persons have
been concerned in the preparation that
great sheet it contains volumes knowledge
 minor morals
gathered together from innumerable sources
how much pleasure has been enjoyed howmuch
pain has been suffered to afford materials
for so much collected matter and like itself
every newspaper that it quotes is dependent
too on a vast establishment with its correspondents
editors compositors printers postmen
to circulate and vehicles to convey it
and perhaps fifty such have been consulted
from all parts the world for the production
 that we are reading more than a
hundred thousand persons i should think are
directly or indirectly connected with the publication
 a morning newspaper men have
admired the manufacture a watch as a
master piece human sagacity but what is
the manufacture a watch to that a newspaper
 a few hands have been occupied in
digging the metal and transporting it to the
meltinghouse and conveying it to the workpresence
 mind 
slip and in moulding or shaping it into the
exquisite finns required but a newspaper
contains the history nations shows the
movement the great and complicated machine
 man bring into its columns all time and
all space discusses all topics exhibits all
interests exemplifies all vice and all virtues 
and pours out floods instruction into the
minds its readers
to read newspapers with advantage one
principle should always be present that the
only useful and honorable object human
exertion is to increase the sum human happiness
and to diminish that human misery
learn to estimate all events and all projects
by this sole standard forget the language
 praise or blame with which parties speak
 one another and inquire whether the conduct
in question is likely to remove pain or
add to enjoyment if it be so learn to think
 minor morals
 it with approval however harshly that conduct
may be spoken if on the contrary 
actions be praised which are unfriendly to
human felicity be no party to the praise
i read todays continued mr howard
 an interesting example presence mind
which i thought you would like to hear for
presence mind though a gift nature to
some may be strengthened by habit and encouraged
by example it is prompt prudential
courage providing the best safeguards in the
moment peril it does not seek dangers
unnecessarily for that would be folly but
if dangers arrive it is ready with the best
means for averting them timidity that flies
without inquiring what ought to be done both
confuses and debilitates the mind i would
not have my children foolhardy nor presumptuous
but i would have them considerate 
and presence mind s one the good
presence mind 
qualities in which i hope they will not be
wanting
but i must give you the newspaper
account the life the right honorable
edward ellice and perhaps several other persons
was saved the other day by the presence
 mind displayed by his sen a youth underage
a fire broke out and was making great
progress it had nearly reached the apartments
in which were mr ellice and his son in a
closet close to the room was a large canister
 gunpowder sufficient to have blown up the
whole edifice without mentioning his intention
to anybody the young ellice hastened
to the closet got hold the canister and
flung it out window a few moments 
delay or forgetfulness might have led to the
destruction the edifice and every body
in it now which you children can
remember an instance presence mind v
 minor morals
soh papas said edith i recollect the
story the gentleman who was saved by his
presence mind when the madman got hold
 him in bedlamite
 well then let ns hear it for to repeat a
story to others is the yqvj best way 
remembering it yourself
well papa there was a party gentlemen
and ladies who went to visit bedlam
and as they averse going through the wards
one the gentlemen was accosted by a
person whom he supposed to be one the
keepers and who said to him in a whisper 
 your friends are only going through the common
parts the establishment but if you
will come with me i will show you the
apartments which are not generally opened
to strangers the man went off and beckoned
to the gentleman who stepped away
from his companions to follow his new guide
presence mind 
who led lii through sundry passages to the
top the building and then out upon the
leads no sooner were they there than the
man said to the gentleman now sir jump
into the street v you may suppose what
were his feelings when he found himself in
the presence a madman and knew that the
madman's next step would probably be to
throw him off the building but his presence
 mind suggested a means escape and he
said to the madman jump down anybody
can jump down but if you'll let me i'll go
down and jump up which will be much
more a feats the madman burst into a
laugh ha ha indeed it will march down
and try so the gentleman was allowed to
go and naturally the first thing he did was
to inform the keepers the narrow escape
he had had and to urge them to be a little
more careful in future that such a dangerous
 minor morals
lunatic should not be allowed to put people's
lives in jeopardy and now george let us
hear your story
 will tell you then an example 
presence mind which i have somewhere
read in ancient time do you remember
the story that philosopher when alexander
 macedonia had menaced with destruction a
city asia that had refused to pay him
tribute who was sent forth to entreat the
conqueror's clemency he had been alexander's
tutor and he was employed to interfere
in the earnest hope that from his former
influence with the conqueror he would not
intercede in vain but alexander seeing him
approach and knowing the object his coming
called out don't trouble yourself orme
i vow to you and i have sworn a solemn
oath to all the gods that i will never grant
your request on which the philosopher said
presence or mind 
i humbly entreat your majesty to reduce
the city to ashes and to let no one its
inhabitants escape alexander perplexed it
is said by the solemnity his vow desisted
from injuring the city or punishing the citizens
now arthur it is your turn
 i hardly know papa said arthur whether
the conduct herman cortes when he
destroyed his whole fleet which robertson
calls san effort magnanimity unparalleled
in history should be considered as most remarkable
for courage or for presence mind
remarkable for both said mr howard 
and now let me hear what you recollect 
the history 
while cortes was making arrangements
for advancing the conquest mexico by
sending an envoy to spain in order to communicate
with the spanish court on matters
 extreme urgency a plot was formed to
s minoe morals
seize one the vessels and to intercept the
messenger on his way homewards and thus
to thwart all cortes's plans and supersede him
in his command one the conspirators communicated
the purpose to cortes a few hours
before the intended departure cortes instantly
went on board and found the conspirators
all assembled and about to sail intimidated
by his sudden appearance they neither
denied nor attempted to justify their treason
they were all arrested the leaders executed
the subordinates forgiven because says the
spanish historian he was so careful the
lives his men and mingled kindness with
his severest justice yet he felt that this
attempt to undermine his authority was buta
system feelings which might again break
out and that he could not rely on the chances
 fortune in the discovery any future plots
against him he determined with a reading
 mind 
ness and a boldness far beyond ordinary experience
to identify his followers with his own
fate and to cut off all means retreat and
 return to spain he determined to sacrifice
the whole his fleet leaving nothing
to the choice his comrades but success or
inevitable destruction to a few the most
faithful his friends he communicated his
plans the sailors were won over by presents and
promises to declare that the ships were no
longer sea worthy the soldiers were induced
to believe that the accession the seamen
to their body would be a most important and
valuable addition to their forces cortes
energetic purpose carried him through his
bold design the vessels were dismantled
and sunk and he now stood at the head 
his band with nothing before him but conquest
or a grave and he succeeded
very wells said mr howard bravely
 minor morals
told but it is not very likely any us should
have an opportunity showing presence 
mind on so grand an occasion but occasions
are frequent occurrence i know a lady welland
you know her whose infant child had to
undergo a dangerous and most painful operation
it was the removal a great portion the
baby's cheek and she knew that her presence
would comfort the child as far as it could be
comforted and determined so to master her
sympathies as to be most useful yet she was
remarkable for tenderness towards her children
and would not for the world have inflicted on
them a needless pain i remember well that
the surgeon looked at her with some surprise
but his doubts as to the propriety her
presence were removed by the calmness and
firmness with which she insisted she held the
babe during the operation and if any thing
would have assuaged his terrors or lightened his
presence op mind l
sufferings it would have been his mothers
watchfulness and care i am sure that at the
cost some present pain she purchased a store
 future pleasure for herself and future
gratitude from her boy and that as i have often
told you is the arithmetic virtue which
increases happiness always or at least
diminishes suffering
in very early life i have seen presence 
mind exhibited usefully and thoughtfully
exhibited i was once travelling in the mail
coach with a little boy a very little boy for a
companion and when we were getting into the
vehicle he asked me what would happen if we
were overturned i told him that what would
happen i did not know perhaps we should get
our bones broken but at all events the way
to run the least risk was to be calm and quiet
and to sit as firmly as possible in the seat it
did so chance that the mail was overturned my
 minor morals
little man was as grave and as steady as a
philosopher and when i had dragged him out
 the window and set him upon his legs he
said very solemnly papa i have several
bones broken but happily though several
passengers were seriously bruised and injured
no mischief whatever befell the little thoughtful
boy
 and now i think we have had examples
enough both among the little and the great 
the virtue presence mind and you will
not forget that its value depends wholly on the
good which is done or the suffering that is
prevented by it but as nobody knows when
the opportunities for exercising it may happen
and as those opportunities may be the
greatest importance endeavor to form the habit
 selfcontrol be ready to do promptly what
is best to be done in the calm hour when no
interruptions break in upon the thoughts fancy
presence mind 
circumstances that require a speedy decision
from you if you hear mistakes or vexations
from the want presence mind in others
employ your own mind in thinking how soit
would have prevented them make the errors
 others useful as beacons to warn you away
make their wisdom useful as magnets to
attract and guide you
humanity to animals
in the evenings mr howard was reading shakspeare
to the assembled circle and when he
came to that celebrated passage 
and the poor beetle that we tread upon
in corporal suffering feels a pang as great
as when a giant dies 
is that true papa v interrupted arthur
 nos indeed answered mr howard putting
down the it is poetry and not truth 
it is the exaggeration a benevolent feelings
strongly and beautifully put but it will not
bear a very close examination what however
ought not to be forgotten isj that insects
however small and seemingly contemptible
have feelings both pain and pleasure and
humanity to animals 
those feelings ought not to be thoughtlessly
wounded 
i would not number on my list friends
who heedlessly sets foot upon a worm 
for though the worm's enjoyments and sufferings
may be small compared to those human
beings they are enjoyments they are sufferings
and therefore are very worthy our
regard to increase those enjoyments is
virtue to diminish them is vice to lessen
those sufferings is virtue and it is vice to
augment them
some people think humanity to animals
as a sort condescending virtue for which
the animals ought to be very much obliged
it is however to be judged by the same
rule as every other virtue and depends upon
the pains and pleasures to which animals are
subject and which they are susceptible
could they feel as much as human beings they
 minor morals
would be intitled to just the same quantity 
our benevolence they administer to our pleasures
and thus they have a hold upon our
good will many them can make a grateful
return for our kindness to them and so again
we have a motive for using them kindly and
we may add to their happiness and as far as
we can do so we exercise benevolence a
man who treats the animals that depend upon
him with unnecessary harshness or cruelty is
a very bad moralist in practice thousands
 persons especially among the poor who
cannot do much for the increase the happiness
 mankind have beasts burthen or
other animals subjected to them whose lives
they may make wretched by their severity
or comfortable by their friendly acts in halfcivilized
life it often happens that more 
benevolence is exhibited to the brute creation
than among us the affection an arab for
humanity to animals 
his horse has been often spoken with admiration
he is his masters companion his
prides and his best possession his master's
first concern is to provide for his waits to
take care his health to keep him clean and
to caparison him richly a laplander will
treat a rein deer almost like one his family 
give the useful animal his food even before his
own has been prepared shelter him with kindness
almost parental and mourn over him when
necessity compels the sacrifice his life as a
needful provision for a lapland winter instances
 the mutual aflfectionbetween elephants
and their keepers have been again and again
spoken and i confess that in visiting that
strange and gigantic animal the cameleopard
or giraffe in the garden plants at paris
i was nearly as much interested by the coalblack
nubian slave who waited upon him as
by the splendid creature himself so attentive
 minor morals
did he seem to his charge so proud its
majesty its docility its beauty its fame 
he appeared to me a most important portion
 the whole effect and created round the tall
and gentle creature a sort natural and
domestic atmosphere there was a real
brotherhood between them and i thought if
either were to die how lonely and desolate the
survivor would be 
the greatest philosopher our days the
man whose mind was beyond comparison the
most exalted and whose benevolent affections
the most expansive that i have ever been
privileged to know was himself a striking example
 the powers sympathy towards the
animal creation he felt for all that had
feeling and was habitually showing though
not intrusively how much he felt i have
known the mice run up and down his legs
as he was engaged in the profoundest studies 
humanity to animals 
making their way to a drawer under his desk
where he was accustomed to keep sundry
crumbs bread nor would he disturb or
allow them to be disturbed till they got noisy
and riotous and then they were chased away
upon his own principle that they annoyed him
more than they benefited themselves
there was a cat in the family who was a
very important personage a stately grave
reverend and blackcoated gentleman who in
the latter part his days was advanced to
high honors his early history had been like
that many his race he dwelt in the
kitchen but every now and then took predatory
excursions into the garden and came home
quite unable to give a good account himself
in a word it was generally thought he was no
better than he should be but as age came on
he grew steady and sober and was often seen
with his eyes closed engaged in deep medius
minor morals
nation as if lie were recalling the events 
his life and pondering over the errors his
ways people said there were decided symptoms
 reform and gradually he established
such a reputation for steadiness and sobriety
that his master paid him marked attention
on one occasion it was even reported that he
was observed giving moral lessons to some 
his younger brethren and reproving their
flighty and irregular habits at last he became
so undoubtedly sage and prudent that he was
installed in ecclesiastical dignity and called
the rev john blackman nothing could
exceed the propriety his deportment his
step was solemn and his every motion that 
a thoughtful philosopher having established
his claims to advancement the diploma 
doctor divinity was conferred upon him
and the rev dr blackman was introduced
with due solemnity to the guests who visited
humanity to animals 
the philosopher's hermitage it was a goodlysight
to see with how much humility and
gravity the doctor bore his accumulated
dignities his merits were indeed so striking
and undoubted that it was thought he would
do honour to the episcopacy and there was
a serious intention conferring on him a
bishop's rank but he did not live to receive
this new mark distinction from the state
authorities he died during the discussion full
 years and was buried amidst the real regrets
and respectful remembrances all who had
had the privilege his acquaintance
 animals by no means occupy that place in
our affection and our regards to which they are
intitled we hardly know how much they
might learn if they were properly taught
they are far more improbable beings than
we generally suppose them to be and they
would many them become apt and intelli
g
 minor morals
gent scholars if trouble were taken to instruct
them those which add most to man's enjoyments
and therefore obtain most his attention
show great docility and by care and
kindness sometimes mingled with discipline
 for animals must be dealt with like men or
children and taught to refrain or to act by
means hopes and fears rewards and
punishments those i said which man employs
to do him services have their characters moulded
by education the racer and the courser the
saddle carriage or dray horse have each received
instruction fitted for the business in
which they are to be engaged the sheepdog
the coachdog and the housedog the
setter pointer spaniel and terrier have all
had their natural qualities developed and improved
by education you have heard that
there are people among the hindoo who train
the most venomous serpents to prompt and
humanity to animals 
perfect obedience and exercise over them an
authority which would hardly be credited if
it were not told us on undoubted testimony
we have seen with our eyes on waterloo
bridge a variety animals in the same cage
all living together in perfect harmony whose
natural instincts would appear to lead them to
prey upon one another i know not by what
happy art all the unfriendly propensities were
got rid and the friendly affections planted in
their stead but it was certainly the work 
education in that abode peace and goodwill
the mouse might have been seen taking
shelter under the hawk's wing or seated
sportingly upon the back the cat puss
never quarrelled with his neighbor pug and
pug took care not to fright the linnets and
the goldfinches that sometimes hid their beaks
in his rough coat perched upon his tail or
fluttered about his ears all these creatures
 minor morals
had been made moral by a judicious master 
and it is very likely tliat with a little trouble
we might make many a naughty little animal
wellbehaved and virtuous
 i saw once on the boulevards at paris a
whole troop little birds many species
taught to obey the order their keeper they
played all sorts antics and i could not fancy
that they were not in some way tied so that
their master could guide their motions but no 
they were all free and they flew away and
returned as they were bidden they would
climb a ladder walk or run at command there
was one that shouldered a musket and another
i think professed to play on a fiddle at a
given word they all lay down like dead creatures
side by side and at another they arose
all this was education all this shows how
much little birds were able to learn
 in the south europe children frequently
humanity to animals 
tame lizards play with them and nurse them
in their sleeves and their bosoms
 i love the child that loves animals sometime
ago when i was on the banks the
garonne a little french boy ran to me with a
tumbler turned upside down on a plate where
there was some water and some fresh leaves
saying see what a pretty thing i have got to
tell me what the weather will be it was a
very small frog with a back as green as
emeralds a belly as yellow as gold and eyes
as bright as diamonds i keep him heres
said the little boy and when it is going to be
bad weather he goes and hides himself in the
water under the leaves and when it is going
to be fine he comes out and clambers to the
top the glass and then i know i can go and
play in the fields 
had the little boy taught him to do sos
papa v inquired edith
 minor morals
no my love there is an almost universal
instinct among animals by wliicli they are
enabled to anticipate the changes the seasons
and it enables them to make provision for these
changes but i have heard frogs that came
when they were called and i have heard 
children who had need to be taught even that
now what say you young people shall
we open a school for animals v
oh yes yes they all cried out together
well then said mr howard each one
shall choose a pupil and tell us how it is to be
brought up
oh v said edith i will have a pretty
white mouse such as i have seen the savoyard
boys showing about with rosecolored eyes and
ears and tail so transparent that you can almost
see through them and i will teach it to thread
my needles and to do my errands and it shall
sit by the side my plate at dinner and on
humanity to animals s
my lap in the evenings when you papa are
telling us your pretty stories and i will teach
it to wake me in the morning and it shall go
with me to my dancing lessons and then when
i am alone i can dance a duet with it
upon which a loud laugh from all the rest
stopped the talkative little girl and george
said oh edith you began with a mouse
and with a hull but now what does
arthur say 
i should likes said arthur a lion's
cub for what a fine thing it would be to teach
it and to tame it and when it became a fullgrown
lion what a pride to be accompanied
by such a noble creature and to go into the
woods to hunt with it 
i am afraid said mr howard that
arthur's first experiment is somewhat too
daring and that he would be very soon desirous
 changing his lion for a more docile pupil's
 minor morals
 i should like papa i think said george
 to try what i could do with a goodnatured
hare and then i would turn to account the
experience the poet cowper who certainly
did manage to get the friendship one hare
at least and to get a friend papa is worth a
little trouble
now suppose you were each you left
on an uninhabited island and were to choose
one animal for your companion what should
it be
 a lamb for me said edith that would
be the best companion for it is never in a
passion we could enjoy ourselves together
in the fields by day and it would keep me
warm at night and its wool would be so useful 
and it would not be coaxed away to leave me
by any wild creatures
i think i should choose said arthur a
welltrained falcon for he would go forth and
humanity to animals 
catch me food and find food for himself without
any anxiety for me and he might decoy other
creatures and there is something so cheerful
in the flight a bird that it would keep up
my spirits in solitude
 i said george hardly know what to
fix upon but i vote for the llama the andes
which is strong enough to carry burthens
which would give me milk and wool which i
should learn to weave into garments and
what does mamma say
 mamma says mrs howard answered
that sie should prefer a dog for a companion 
because she knows more about its good qualities
and its docility and its patience and its
courage a biography dogs and their
virtuous deeds would fill many volumes they
live in all climates and all the companions
 man are the most attached and faithful i
don't think i should dismiss mv old favorite for
 minor morals
the sake a stranger whose excellencies i
should not feel quite so sure
 amen said mr howard and now
children away to your dreams
they went and before sleep george arthur
and edith said to themselves and to one
another that they had never liked animals so
well before and never thought all the uses
that might be made them
veracity
the next day they all met at the breakfasttable
and the subject they talked about was
truth george and edith had a strong sense
 its value but arthur now and then not
because he meant to prevaricate or utter falsehood
but generally from mere precipitancy
and carelessness was used to speak with inaccuracy
about matters so it frequently happened
that he underwent those crossquestionings
which nobody ever thought employing with
edith or george if george erred it was
by too much reserve while the error arthur
was on the side inconsiderateness little
edith was all ingenuousness and prattle she
never thought concealing anything and the
 minoe morals
idea misrepresentation never entered her
mind in fact mr and mrs howard were
so desirous establishing habits veracity
amongst their children that no known misstatement
had ever gone unpunished and the
frank avowal even a fault was sure to be
accepted as a peaceoffering for half its ordinary
penalties
what led to the conversation was this 
mr howard had inquired george what
lessons they had to prepare for school and
george answered our greek exercise our
latin verses and our three problems in euclid
papas and are you ready yes replied
he upon which mr howard said i
will hear you your latin verses and trust to
your word for the rest and george repeated
them perfectly well mr howard soon after
met arthur and not telling him that he had
seen george he asked him what were his
veracity 
tasks for the clay arthur hesitated and
said latin verses and euclid for in truth
he had not learnt his greek lesson and was
afraid his father would inquire about it and
reprove him for his negligence upon which
his father looked him full in the face and
said arthur is that all and arthur's
cheeks became red and fiery he felt he had
meant to conceal a part the truth and bitter
were the selfreproaches he felt his papa
admonished him in gentle terms arthur
you have given yourself much pain you have
given me much pain i trust what you suffer
and i suffer will be enough to prevent you
from giving way again to this sad infirmity
 yours 
truth then was the breakfasttable topic
but mr howard made no reference whatever
to arthur s fault hoping and believing that
he had suffered enough for present correction 
 minor morals
and the art punishment is to inflict no more
misery than is necessary to produce reformation
arthur had suffered humiliation his papa
wished to spare him the additional humiliation
 having his weakness exposed to his mamma
his brother and his sister it would have
grieved all them and mr howard would
not grieve them needlessly it would have
been as cruel for him to inflict useless sorrow
to help a moral cure as for the surgical
operator to make an unnecessary incision in
the limbs the patient he was endeavoring
to heal
but mr howard thought the opportunity
should not be lost enforcing the importance
 veracity he read from the newspaper the
account the crossexamination a prevaricating
witness how sad it is he re
marked that the solemnity and importance
 a judicial proceeding are not a sufficient
veracity 
security for the utterance truth now
george tell me what you think a story
i will relate to you
a wellknown portuguese courtier dom
duarte pereyra being called upon to state his
age in a court justice swore he was forty
years old ten years afterwards in the same
court and before the same judge he again
swore that his age was forty and when the
judge recalled to his mind that he had made
the same statement ten years before he answered
 please your highness you cannot
have a better proof my veracity for t always
say the same thing 
 indeed papa it seems an occasion very
ill chosen for a display wit and levity at
the expense truth if the auditory laughed
at the joke they could have little respect for
the joker
true george and if pereyra had not
 minor morals
been a courtier and a powerful man the
probability is be would have been severely
punished for contempt the courts
there is a proverbs said george that
truth is not to be spoken at all times can
you give us some rules papa by which we
may know when truth is to be spoken and
when not t
the proverb you have quoted may be
made a mischievous one j it has a bad and a
good meaning its bad meaning is that falsehood
may sometimes be spoken its good
meaning is that it is not always incumbent
on us to speak at all the general rule is
that whatever is spoken should be true but
it is not all truth that is useful useful truths
should be spoken pernicious truths should be
suppressed you might annoy everybody you
meet by the utterance truth but its being
truth would be no justification truth like
veracity 
everything else is a means to an and
any one might make himself as vexatious by
the utterance illtimed truths as by the
utterance the boldest falsehoods i knew
a man whose pride it was to tell people what
he called the truth that man was an absolute
nuisance and avoided by everybody
he scarcely ever opened his lips but to make
others unhappy and he thought this habit
very frank and meritorious he would not
have told a lie for the world but he produced
more unhappiness than many a liar he was
always on the lookout for occasions to say
true and disagreeable things the more true
the more disagreeable and he flattered himself
with the thought that he was a fine example
 moral courage aud virtue
tar different was the conduct a truly
benevolent friend mine his rule with
very rare exceptions was never to utter a
h
 minor morals
word never to do a deed which should give
pain to another if it were absolutely necessary
to say anything which caused pain he
made the pain as little as possible by the
gentleness and kindness his manner he
seldom uttered paingiving truths paingiving
falsehoods never
 prudence and benevolence take veracity
under their care to violate truth is to lose
reputation and this is imprudent whenever
by a violation truths injury is done to
others the virtue benevolence is violated
no falsehood can be uttered without some
mischief to the mind and the case which
would justify falsehood by producing a result
 good is so rare that a man must be quite
sure it will warrant the sacrifice a portion
 his reputation
there is no virtue which obtains for its
possessors a larger portion good opinion in
veracity 
early life than the love truth virtue mj
children consists in the sacrifice some present
enjoyment to a future greater good and
truthtelling often subjects us to great temporary
inconvenience sometimes to considerable
suffering which if we undergo for the
sake truth is evidence a virtuous disposition
and a determination to acquire a
virtuous habit
 three boys john thomas and henry
were playing in a field and saw without
being perceived a man who had been very
kind to them misuse and rob another man
they were not near enough to interfere but
they were near enough to witness all the
circumstances the case the robber having
quitted his victim passed close to the
place where the boys were and at once discovered
that they had been spectators his
crime and that perhaps his life was in the
 minor morals
hands those very boys whose benefactor
he had been he was too much hurried to
stop but as he went on he said to the boys
you won betray me the man who
had been robbed having got assistance the
robber was arrested and the three boys having
been found so near the scene the
robbery were carried before the magistrate
to be interrogated as to what they knew 
the affair
 they were separately examined in john's
mind the desire to save his friend and benefactor
mastered every other feeling he
would rather have told the truth if he could
have done so without danger to the robber
but while he was questioning his own mind
as to what he ought to do the robbers
words rushed upon his thoughts you will
not betray me and he said to himself 
 no i will not betray you come what wills
veracity 
sos then he was questioned he denied all
knowledge the robbery denied that he
had seen either the robber or the person robbed
and did this with a pertinacity which
no doubt he thought heroic and which went
far in the mind the magistrate to shake
his faith in the story the robbed man
thomas's struggle with himself was yet
severer he could not determine to tell a
falsehood nor could he determine to give
evidence against his friend he feared too
in his anxiety not to appear a liar on the
one hand or a betrayer on the other that
he might be caught in prevarication or that
his statements might not be corroborated by
those john and henry his first thought
was to escape and hide himself but finding
this impossible he feigned dumbness he preserved
an obstinate silence and nothing that
 minor morals
the magistrate was able to say could extort
a word from him
henry too had some difficulty in deciding
how to act but the claims truth
especially on so solemn an occasion at last
got the mastery he weighed the consequences
as well as he was able and his
conscience told him that his own honor and
the good society ought to outweigh the
claims the robber upon his silence he
stated the facts simply truly though it was
obvious how much he suffered
 tell me said mr howard which 
the boys acted most meritoriously they all
decided against john george and edith took
henry's part but arthur seemed to think
that thomas had after all behaved most
nobly that he had not violated truth and
had exhibited proper gratitude to his benefactor
veracity 
 no replied mr howard the mischief
 falsehood may on some occasions be equally
produced by insincerity in other shapes the
difference between john and thomas was
merely this that john was the more rashly
imprudent the two the claim society
upon each the boys in a case where the
just laws society had been so violently outraged
was stronger than any claim gratitude
could be in cases doubt decide in
favor veracity and sincerity for as an
ancient writer has said truth it endures
and is stronger than all things 
praise and blame
as george and arthur were returning home
from school they saw a crowd gathered round
a preacher whose loud voice caused many
passengers to tarry and listen he had made
a pulpit a chair which he had borrowed
at a neighboring house and was exerting himself
violently in order to excite attention
some persons stopped for curiosity some out
 respect for the preachers zeal some to
make jokes while others passed heedlessly
or scornfully by george and arthur fell in
with the crowd and they were much struck
by the variety opinions they heard expressed
gne person said he is very intemperate
but perhaps he is acting under a sense
praise and blame 
 religious duty another said did you
ever see such an exhibition fanaticism 
while a poor woman whispered to a very
soberlooking man who was listening with
great reverence and attention he must bea
good man to bear with so much patience
the taunts these worldlyminded sinners
the preacher continued his discourse
amidst all the annoyances and discouragements
around one person cried out come down
old hypocrite from your preachingtub and
he was answered by another's reproof how
can you be so profane v the law ought to
stop such superstitious frenzy said one 
the law ought to protect him from such
improper interruptions answered another all
this set the boys meditating on the different
judgments formed the same action and
they told mr howard when they came home
how much they had been entertained by the
 minor morals
dissimilarity the opinions they had heard
and how much they were embarrassed by the
opposing sentiments that had been expressed
one the most important lessons to
learn said mr howard ais to judge 
things apart from the language praise or
blame there are three ways speaking
 every action menes lives one in approval
one in disapproval and one which conveys
no opinion as to merit or demerit few
things have done the world so much injury
as the custom attaching words reproach
or words eulogy to every thing said or
done by another in this way every event
becomes distorted by prejudiced or passionate
judgment the same act will be called by
different persons prudence economy parsimony
or covetousness another act will be
denominated by one man desire information
j by another inquisitiveness by a third
praise and blame 
curiosity j by a fourth impertinence what
one person calls laudable pride another will
call ostentation and a third arrogance soin
the case you have been mentioning the
preachers conduct was subjected to every title
that could be found for it from piety and godliness
on the one side to superstition hypocrisy
and fanaticism on the other the simple truth
being only that he was preaching in the street 
all the rest was the addition despotic opinions
sitting in judgment on his conduct
 one the great things then to learn is
to weigh the merit an action apart from the
phrases in which others speak it the
worst actions are sometimes praised the best
 actions are sometimes condemned accustom
yourselves always to inquire into the consequences
 conduct which you may study in
the pains and pleasures it produces never seek
the causes conduct in motives which you
 minor morals
cannot discover which nobody can discover for
as hudibras quaintly says 
nature has made man's breast no windows
to publish what he does within doors
all motives are the same in intention no
voluntary action is done from any other than
from a desire to do it a desire is created by
the presence or the hope pleasure or by
the hope escape from pain a man robs
his neighbor he thinks he shall have more
pleasure from the possession the articles he
steals than he shall lose by the consequences 
the robbery having the same opportunity
another man does not rob his neighbor
why because he would have less pleasure
in robbing him than he has in refraining a
man tells a lie and wherefore because
he thinks it is his interest to do so another
under the same circumstances tells the truth 
but solely because in his view the case it
praise and blame 
is his interest to tell the truth the motive is
the same always but the determination that
prompts to the virtuous action has made a wise
calculation pleasure and the opposite determination
has made a foolish calculation
as you advance in life you will often hear
language the effect which and often the intention
 which is to conceal the true character
 actions intemperance will take the name
 sociability or conviviality antipathy
 public spirit maleficence patriotism
and widespreading mischief fame and
glory but if you accustom yourselves to look
to the influence actions upon human happiness
upon your own happiness and that 
others you never will be at a loss no fictions
or fallacies will bewilder or betray you
did you not observe today that the
strongest and most passionate language was
held by those who were most excited and thus
 minor morals
the least able to judge if there were any
in the crowd who looked on calmly and
expressed their opinion quietly i am sure you
must have thought them the most worthy 
being listened to and so it is and so it will
ever be in life a serene state mind is the
best fitted for honest judgment
once it was a beautiful morning in spring
a light breeze rose from the depths the
waters and went wandering over the face 
the earth as it sped along a green and
narrow valley the flowers were delighted with
its approach and welcomed it with a thousand
gentle words violets perfumed it as it passed
cowslips danced in their family groups daisies
and buttercups shook for very joy as the breeze
glided over them stays said they among
us fair breeze the morning and gladden us
with your presence your gaiety makes us
gay and we all spring up at your comings
praise and blame ill
but the breeze answered i have a long journey
before me i avill visit you again some
other day and away it hurried to the heath
among the ferns and the furzes great was
their clamor when the breeze arrived the
furzes put forth all their thorns and gave way
to the language illhumor and discontent
what business have you here in our territory
noisy and vulgar creature why will you not
respect our golden earrings who allowed
you to blow in our faces and disarrange our
green garments and the ferns fluttered about
in pride and vain glory and said to the
breeze don't you see you illbred adventurer
that you are treading on our toes and
shaking our treasures out our pockets by your
carelessness but the breeze assured the captious
inhabitants the waste that it had only
come to pay a visit courtesy with no intention
to offend and away it hastened to a mountains
minor morals
stream every ripple which kissed it as it
passed and threw up living diamonds in honor
 its coming as it mounted the hillside it
said good day to the echoes and good day's
was repeated back in cordial granulation this
gave notice to the forest that the breeze was at
hand and great was the commotion with which
they hailed its advent it shouted loudly as it
glided through the trees and the trees waved
their branches and bowed their heads in
triumph delighted with its excursion the
breeze returned to the ocean where it laid
itself down to rest
 do you see the moral the fable children
the breeze was not less kind not less useful to
the rough ferns and prickly gorse than to
the flowers the valley and the trees the
wood j but they received its visit in a different
spirit and so will it be in the world praise
and blame will not be apportioned according to
praise and blame 
the merit actions but according to the
tempers individuals the virtuous are far
more willing to praise than to blame they never
blame unnecessarily and they delight to praise
judge rightly my children wherever you can 
but always judge benevolently you cannot be
sure that you will not fall into mistakes but
you may be sure that you will not fall into the
mistakes malevolence which are the worst
 all
employment time
i will give joxxy my children's said mr
howard an account a happy man and
what do you think was the principal cause 
his happiness it was the wise employment
 his time time must be employed either
in doing what is useful or what is not for the
time that is not usefully is uselessly employed
and all the time employed uselessly is employed
badly did time ever hang heavy en your
hands if it did you have much to learn in
order to be happy for the wise man and the
happy man have no idle time time is the
material out which pleasure is made and he
who makes most pleasures out it is the
man who employs it best
employment time 
 what are you thinking about arthur
said mr howard who observed that arthur was
almost bursting with a desire to speak
nothing papa said arthur oh yes 
i was thinking that if i had nothing to do but
to look about for pleasures i should be a very
happy fellow
 well then and how would you employ
yourself arthur 
in the first place i would have plenty 
holidays and plenty sport
and plenty vexation arthur from not
having learnt as much as other boys your
age
but i would buy myself all sorts delicacies

and buy sickness and headashes with
them said his father
so arthur was a little abashed and began to
blush and said i was too hasty papa and
 minor morals
before i run away after pleasures i will think 
a little more about it
and edith said i fancy t understand you
papa nobody can be happy unless he is
pleased at something but it is not every pleasure
that makes happiness
that is my meaning love happiness is
made up pleasures but the best pleasures
are those which do not bring any pain after
them it would be a bad bargain if you were
to borrow a penny today and have to pay a
shilling tomorrow for the loan it yet that
is exactly what people do who never think 
the consequences a pleasure do you recollect
when you were a little girl how you
ate the twelfth cake in excess and how yon
suffered for it and took disagreeable medicine
and felt so wretched and made us all so
uncomfortable about you when you ate the
cake it was the pennyworth pleasure for
employment time ll
which you were obliged to pay a shillingsworth
 pain
i remember it well papa and i won't
make so foolish a mistake against
 but i was going to show you how much
happiness or how many pleasures rather 
which happiness is made depend upon the
judicious use time time is our great
treasure and should be dealt with as a treasure 
part with it as with money sparing pay
no moment but in purchase its worth
except when you are suffering bodily or mental
pain there is no moment that you may not
make useful or pleasurable
but tell us how papa the children all
demanded
by employing it well when you are not
otherwise engaged employ your time in happy
thoughts everybody has time for thought and
lis minor morals
as the mind is scarcely ever at rest one great
secret towards being happy is to have the
thoughts occupied with pleasing objects plans
for acquiring knowledge plans for giving
knowledge to others plans for innocent amusement
plans for doing good you may not be
able to execute all that you plan but your
thoughts at all events will be a source much
pleasure to you
the happy man that i was speaking to
you about used to say there are two gates
into the mind through one misery enters 
through the other enjoyment keep the gate
 misery shut the gate enjoyment open
thoughts will come knocking at the gate where
misery enters do not let them in if you can
shut them out when thoughts come to the
gate enjoyment give them welcomes
in disposing your time and when you
have made the best it in useful employment
employment time 
much will remain to be filled up there are
no engagements so constant as not to leave
unoccupied moments and many engagements
merely employ our hands or our feet without
employing our mind do not let painful
thoughts intrude upon such moments do not
call back the recollection sufferings that are
passed do not indulge in vain regrets or useless
selfreproaches do not be fancying coming
evils but instead all these crowd your mind
with thoughts good look out for what is
bright and beautiful waste no time that you
can engage in the pursuit some future comfort
think any way relieving human
misery think any way increasing human
felicity you may do this in the moments that
would otherwise be lost and nothing can be
more important to your happiness than that
you should feel the value that time which
 minor morals
slips away unemployed or at least unimproved
by those who have not learnt its importance
 take care the moments and the hours
will take care themselves you cannot
employ short periods wisely without the wise
employment long ones
but my friends cares were not confined
alone to the encouragement happy thoughts
in his own mind or in the minds others t he
was always occupied in some useful deed one
 his constant engagements was the spreading
through different parts the world flowers
fruit sj plants and trees unknown before he
introduced into this country the sultana raisin
from turkey and rarer fruits the hothouses
 his friends were crowded with specimens
collected by his care when he had ascertained
the habits any useful vegetable great
was the ardor with which he sought to spread
employment time 
the knowledge it in the places where it was
likely to prosper in this way it would not be
easy to calculate how much he added to human
enjoyment nor the debt that future generations
will owe to his kind concern for his race he
preferred botany to all the other departments 
natural philosophy because its pleasures could
be made so diffusive and he valued plants ashe
valued men in proportion to the extent 
their usefulness you cannot he would say
multiply minerals nor insects nor animals at
will you cannot communicate to others this
species your riches without self deprivation 
but most vegetable productions you can
easily increase the number you can enrich
others without impoverishing yourself now
if you have time on your hands only think
in how many ways you may thus employ it in
the service man 
another topics occupied his leisure hours
 minor morals
he would think human infirmities and
human wants and busy himself in alleviating
or removing them the condition the
maniac for example and he had corresponded
with many countries in order to ascertain what
means had been found most efficient for coercion
without violence and with the smallest
suffering to the patient he had thought 
various amusements and various employments
compatible with the situation the lunatic
so for the blind he had invented many pleasures
 he had suggested several improvements
which made instruction more easy and more
agreeable for the deaf and dumb he had
also shown a practical and useful sympathy
inventing many sources happiness for them
he had thought labors fitting for the lame
for the onehanded and for the aged but
i need not detail more i have only mentioned
these as examples what may be done with
employment time 
time i wish you to feel that with time everything
may be done
and while thus engaged in seeking solace
for human misery do not think my friend was
unoccupied in seeking to diminish the evils
 human crime that pursuit i may say
was the daily business his life he was
not used to look upon a criminal with any
feeling other than that benevolence he
knew how much poverty and ignorance had
to do with the offences which the laws proscribe
to punish for the sake punishment
for the sake retaliation and revenge seemed
to him folly and wickedness his constant
inquiry was how the penalties crime could
be safely diminished how the infliction unnecessary
pain could be avoided he thought
the prisoner worthy all the care and all the
instruction likely to amend him and to relieve
 minor morals
society from the repetition his offences
to employ the time the prisoner he
would say is the most urgent necessity
if his mind be left unoccupied by you it will
be occupied by himself by his old thoughts
and habits his mind cannot be long empty
he will fill it with bad projects unless you
fill it with better purposes and better prospects
do this and you will shut out as much evil
as you can introduce goods
 in the same way was he perpetually suggesting
something which should diminish ignorance
and spread knowledge among the
people the child does not walk alone before
its education is begun think how you can
make instruction pleasurable what the elder
has learnt and found interesting amusing
or instructive let him communicate to the
younger the younger to the younger still
employment time 
every one in turn will thus be a teacher
and a teacher who will be loved and honored 
loved for kindness honored for superiority
 does this seem like a sermon my children 
never mind i think you will find it worthy
 your serious meditation and i will give
you a text out which you shall make a
sermon for yourselves
time can do wonders 
love flowers
the next day edith said to her papa pray
tell us something more about that good gentleman
who was always employed in making
other people happy papa had he a garden
 his own in which he cultivated the flowers
he gave away so generously 
 yes edith and a beautiful garden too
it was the garden in which the great milton
walked and his house overshadowed by a
large sycamore tree still forms a part the
buildings that inclose it there is an inscription
scarcely visible through the leaves and
branches sacred to the prince poets
here it was that i listened to the instructions
love flowers 
i am endeavoring to communicate to you and
here i listened with a double reverence
 we will talk milton some day or other
as yet you can hardly comprehend the veneration
with which i always think him
whose voice was like the sea
pure as the naked heavens majestic free 
and i think him with a more profound
homage when i remember the patience the
piety the greatness mind he exhibited under
the taunts that insulted his blindness and his
poverty the deity regards me he said
 with more tenderness and compassion in that
i am able to behold nothing but himself 
the divine law not only shields me from
injury but almost renders me too sacred to
attack not indeed so much from the privation
 my sight as from the overshadowing those
heavenly winces which seem to have occasioned
 minor morals
this obscurity and which when occasioned
he is wont to illuminate with an interior light
more precious and more pure it was here
he gave expression to those deep and retired
thoughts which have winged their way through
the world in one his works he introduces
a fair gardens and a gardener sowing all
wholesome herbs and delightful flowers according
to every season cutting his hedges
pruning his trees looking to his tender slips
and plucking up the weeds that hindered their
growth laboring ever since the daypeeps
and loving his own handy work
the love flowers is intimately allied
to gentleness and virtue how should a
harsh and cruel spirit condescend to admire
anything so humble and so beautiful as those
transitory creatures that fade so soon after
their birth that flatter no passions assume no
influence do nothing but look charming send
love flowers 
forti perfumes and die in many countries
flowers are associated with death because they
are striking images the transitoriness life
and are so meek and lovely and suited to
the melancholy thoughts the grave one
 the sights that most struck me when i was
a boy and travelling in biscay was the manner

 there was a poor widow the widow 
a soldier her husband had long followed the
fortunes napoleon the renowned warrior
and had received from him that great object
 a frenchman's ambition the cross the
legion honor he went with the grand
army to the russian campaign no tidings
were ever heard him and it was supposed
he perished among the tens thousands who
died in misery and whom no history tells
his poor wife was told the ice and the
snow and the freezing the soldiers and
the burning towns and the murders 
love flowers 
the cossacks lie heard that regiments had
perished but him for whom she cared more
than for all the world besides she could get
no tidings yet she dared not think he had
died she dreamed and dreamed and dreamed
again that he had been preserved in the midst
 the desolation often did he appear to her
in her sleep and often in the morning did
she say perhaps he may come before the
evening but he came not how should he
come he had been frozen to death on the
steppes russia
 so by degrees the soldiers widow began
to say to herself there is no hope never
never shall we meet again she had one
child whose name was mathilde and with
her she was accustomed to talk her father
and the happy time when they lived together
the girl was eight years old and
recollected little her sire she thought she
 minor morals
had seen some one in a smart blue dress
wearing a high cap who used to smile upon
her and kiss her but her remembrance was
indistinct and she doubted whether she should
know him again were he to return yet sometimes
she had a faint memory songs he
used to sing and she fancied that she should
never hear music so sweet till that voice again
sounded in her ears but now her mother
told her that she would not see the smile or
hear the song her father on which she
would drag a favorite wooden stool to her
mother's feet and hide her face on her mother's
lap and sob aloud
rebut what saddened her most all was
that her mother seemed sick sick at heart
and grew paler and paler and every day she
spoke fewer words and those words she spoke
seemed feebler to mathilde her mother had
supported them both by spinning flax and
love flowers 
her distaff was in her hands from morning
to night and it was as much as she could
do to support herself and mathilde by her
ceaseless labor iniathilde was already some
use she could go to the merchant and buy
the flax help to clean it and when it was
spun she could take it to the masterweavers
for sale but mathilde had remarked that for
some time the quantity which her mother spun
diminished and every week the little pittance
she had to receive diminished too she said
nothing to her mother but thought that for
her mother's sake she must make some effort
to keep poverty away from the door
 mathilde had often been to the marche
aux fleurs she had watched the flowersellers
 they came to the market and the flowers
which were most readily disposed it was
when camellias came into fashion and mathilde
observed that whenever one was offered at a
 minor morals
moderate price a buyer was always found
and now said she i think i can do something
for my mother and myself i will train
camellias i will bring them to the flowermarket
if people will buy them me i
shall be happy 
 she had only a few sous which had been
given her at various times by the master weaver
to whom she took her mother s flaxen thread
and who had been struck by the child's modest
and amiable demeanor but with these she
went to a nursery gardener and said she should
like to buy some camellia plants which she
wished to rear till they grew into flower
the gardener was pleased with her appearance
and said you shall have double the value
 the money you bring and you shall repay
me when you are abler he told her too
how best to take care the plants when to
water them and in what temperature they best
love flowers 
thrived with what delight did she conveyhome
the pots in which her treasures were 
with what anxiety did she watch the growth
 the flowers at last she saw them bud
one came forth like a carving pure white
wax another bright and glowing as a ruby
how her heart leaped as she carried them to
the marche aux fleurs she scarcely knew
what price to set on them a lady came
and inquired for how much she would sell
them twenty sous madame said mathilde
her cheeks blushing like the red camellia it
is far too little said the lady here are two
francs my child and oh how her heart
leaped as she danced homewards to tell her
mother how happy she had been and to present
the produce her care her mother
smiled upon her but mathilde thought she
had never seen so sad a smile her mother
wept they were not tears pain but
 minor morals
mathilde fancied her mother had never looked
so pale and wan
but mathilde felt she must exert herself
the more she doubled her stock camellias 
and when she went to the marche aux fleurs
her stand was remarked for the beauty and
variety the specimens she brought her
courteous and attractive manners won her many
a purchaser her flowers and those who
bought once never failed to return again
and to recommend her to their friends and
acquaintance
 she would have been happy for her mother
toiled less at the spindle and mathilde was
able from the profits her little trade to
bring many comforts home but day after
day she perceived that her mother's voice
grew yet weaker her sight became dim and
the words kindness which had every day
been addressed to her when she came home
love flowers 
were fewer and fewer till at last nothing
welcomed mathilde but a grasp the hand
and a kind look from eyes that had almost
lost their light mathilde sought and found
a boy to take her flowers to market and gave
herself up to her sinking mother she called in
the neighboring apothecary who told her that
no medical aid could save her mother whose
frame was worn out and who was now dying
in peace in a few days she died mathilde
threw the rarest her camellias into the coffin
and planted over her grave at pere la chaise
a specimen singular beauty go there at
the hour sunrise and you will see her
watching the grave or watering the beautiful
flower while mathilde lives people say it
will live it will want no care no kindness
and if it should die she will replace it with
another
perseverance
when you were showing us papas said
george that a great many the virtues
commonly so called are not virtues unless they
are under the control other virtues i thought
perseverance too might be sometimes a false
virtue for that a man mihi persevere in doing
wrong
that is most true george and i am glad
that you are learning how to distinguish between
what are real virtues and what are not 
between what are virtues sometimes and what
are virtues always and as i remember two
cases one vicious and another virtuous
perseverance they will serve to explain what
is good and what is evil in persevering conduct
perseverance 
a quarrel had taken place between two
clerks in a merchant's countinghouse jonas
and jonathan the quarrel was little importance
in itself for it was merely as to the
quantity work that each had to do the
merchant had given six letters to be copied 
jonas said that each should copy three jonathan
said that as they were not the same length
one should copy four and the other two they
disputed violently about it and from words
came to blows jonas beat jonathan severely
and jonathan vowed that he would be revenged
in this determination he persevered and it was
a part every dayes thoughts how he could
injure jonas
 jonas kept what is called the petty cash in
the merchant's counting house that is he was
charged with the payment all the small sums
for the ordinary expenses the business and
was settled with by the merchant every week
 minor morals
on his producing the accounts and the vouchers
for payment when any receipts were given
jonas was particularly careful to keep his documents
in order and jonathan who knew jonas's
pride in having his cashbook right determined
to do all that he could to embarrass and confuse
him whenever jonathan could lay his hands
upon any voucher that jonas wanted to show
that his payments were regular jonathan
took the opportunity when nobody was present
either to burn or otherwise destroy it
this made jonas very miserable who never
fancied that his companion could have been
so wicked but jonas was bitterly distressed
when on three following saturdays instead
 receiving the merchant's accustomed praise
he was reprimanded for negligence jonas
protested that he had been as careful as usual
but could not conceive how the documents had
disappeared he determined in future to
perseverance 
lock them iip instead leaving them under
the leads the desks as he had hitherto done
the nextweek all jonasss accounts were as
correct as usual and all the vouchers in order
and his tranquillity returned
 but it did not last long for jonathan
finding that he had not succeeded in his illnatured
attempt was resolved to injure jonas
even more seriously and one day when jonas
had gone to the docks and had by accident
left the key in his desk jonathan took a fivepound
note out the cashbox which jonas
kept there and concealed it in another part
 the desk he did not dare to steal it 
he would have been afraid detection but
he knew how much jonas would suffer and
he persevered in making him suffer
jonas came home and pat the keys in
his pocket he did not even recollect that he
had left them in the desk but the next day
 minor morals
when he opened his desk to count the money
in the cashbox a fivepound note was missing
this was indeed a sad discovery he racked
his brains to remember whether he had made
any payment that he had not entered he
inquired jonathan whether he had seen him
pay any money away jonathan professed to
feel for his distress while in fact he was
rejoicing in it and he was even much delighted
wicked lad when he heard the merchant
in his private room severely reproaching
jonas for his carelessness
 a few weeks after jonas having occasion
to ransack his desk for some papers found
the fivepound note it never occurred to
him that anybody could have been so spiteful
as to hide it in order to give him pain and
he supposed that he himself had by accident
stowed it away with other papers but his
joy at finding it was even greater than his
perseverance 
distress at losing it he ran to the merchant
and told him his good fortune the merchant
recommended more caution in future
still jonathan persevered in persecuting
jonas and having been hitherto undetected
became bolder it was jonasss duty to take
the letters to the postofsce one day a letter
 great importance containing a bill exchange
for a large amount was missing the
merchant had as usual intrusted the correspondence
to jonas's care and had left the
city for his country abode next day the
first inquiry when the merchant came was
whether the letters had been despatched jonas
burst into tears and said that the letter with
the remittance was not to be found what 
said the merchant with extreme displeasure 
iliad letter missing and looking on the
ground he saw the letter at jonas's feet wet
and dirty as if it had been trampled on
 minor morals
this had been also jonathan's doing he had
concealed the letter the night before he had
flung it unperceived having himself trodden
upon it under jonasss desk
in this way many months passed all
jonathan's conduct was the persevering annoyance
 jonas but he generally managed with
so much cunning as to be undiscovered in his
malice but things went on so ill that the
merchant dismissed them both
years rolled by in which they had little
intercourse with one another jonas and jonathan
in the progress time became merchants
themselves but nothing could eradicate from
jonathan's mind the determination to injure
and if possible to ruin jonas and he at
last accomplished it though his own ruin was
at hand he undermined the credit jonas
by persevering indirect insinuations as to the
state his affairs by doubts and intends
perseverance 
and shrugs the shoulder by a succession 
unfounded reports and malevolently expressed
suspicions jonas's reputation as a merchant
suffered and bankruptcy took place
some the statements by which jonas had
been injured were however traced to jonathan
he was prosecuted for damages convicted
and his own insolvency soon followed
but perseverance vicious perseverance
he was a striking example
it is not long ago that i went to visit
an interesting old man who lives by the side
 the khone at a short distance from lyons
have you ever heard the jacquard machine

by which the most complicated patterns
can be woven with the same ease as the
plainest a machine which enables an ordinary
weaver to produce all those manycolored

the classes whose garments were formerly
made coarse wool or hemp the old man
i speak was jacquard and he was one 
the great causes this diffusion enjoyment
as i happened to be near the place his
abode i determined to visit him and did so
accompanied by several friends
 it was a sunshiny day i remember and
we had a delightful walk along the margin
 the rapid pthone a river renowned in history
and whose banks are still crowded with
the ruins past time calling to mind the
days when every feudal chief was obliged to

shut himself up in high and embattled towers
built often upon dangerous crags in order
to be secure from the attacks some neighboring

the petty feuds have passed away togethereverything
now bears the face security 
 industry peace talking the delightful
contrast and hoping that nations would
one day harmonize as the once contending
peasantry the shone noir harmonize we
reached old jacquard's abode
 he welcomed us with heartiness but
come forth into my vineyards he said let
us get among the grapes and the sunshine 
so he led the way with a tottering step
hither hither he called out come with
me to the arbor e followed him there
let me sit in the centre and let me tell
you how glad i am to see you my friends 
we sat down around him the clematis was
 minor morals
blended with the vine and together they
made the roof and the walls the quiet
retreat where every day the venerable old
man was used to sit and to recall the events
 his much chequered life some those
events you shall hear as he himself related
them and you will see what perseverance
virtuous perseverance is and what virtuous
perseverance can do
i told jacquard that i was an englishman
and as he had been one the benefactors
 my country i was come to thank
him how proud i am said he to be
visited by an englishman if i have ever
done any good i owe the very first suggestion
to england it was an english newspaper
that led me to occupy my thoughts
with mechanical improvements but for that
perhaps i should still have been a poor strawhat
maker in an obscure street at lyons
perseverance 
instead the happy man you see me honored
by my native town recompensed by the
government pointing to the red ribbon which
he wore at his buttonhole and pensioned
by the state but how i enquired did
you owe to england your first success it
was he answered during the peace 
amiens and we were accustomed to meet
in order to talk politics at a friend's house on
the quay it was there a translated extract
from an english newspaper met my eye
stating that a premium was offered by a
society in london to any one who would
apply machinery to the manufacture nets
i meditated long upon the matter and after
many attempts i made a machine by which
nets could be produced it was the first 
my mechanical experiments and i will tell
you if you have the patience and the desire
to hear me how that trifling affair was the
 minor morals
beginning my good fortune and my fame
nothing we assured him could gratify us
more than to continue his history well
then said he i contrived a machine and
made a net by it and thought no more 
the matter i carried the net about in my
pocket and one day meeting with a friend
who had heard the paragraph the english
paper read i threw it to him saying there
is the difficulty got over and the net made 
and the matter passed out my mind i
had persevered until i had succeeded and
there was an it sometime afterwards
i was much surprised at getting an order
from the prefect to appear at the prefect
palace i went and the prefect said he had
only lately heard my proficiency in the mechanical
arts it was a great mystery to me 
i really did not comprehend his meaning
and i stammered out a sort an apology
perseverance 
for not understanding him my net and the
machine that made it had gone quite out 
my head the prefect expressed surprise that
i should deny my own abilities but at last he
produced the very net that i had made and
which to me had seemed a very trifling affair
as it was in reality i have orders from the
emperor to send the machine to paris said the
prefect from the emperor that's strange
indeed but you must give me time to make
it so i set about it and in a few weeks
i completed it and trudged away with my
machine and a halfmanufactured net in it
to the prefect he was very impatient to see
it work so i bid him count the number 
loops and then strike the bar with his foot 
he did so and another loop was added to the
number great was the delight that he expressed
and he told me that no doubt i should
hear from him again i heard from him again
 minor morals
in truth very soon and in a way that perplexed
me not a little for his first greeting was you
must go to paris m jacquard by his majesty's
orders to paris sir how can that be 
what have i done how can i leave my affairs
here not only must you go to paris but
you must go today you must go immediately 
these were not times in which there was any
resisting the orders authority so i said if
it must be so it must i will go home and
pack up my baggage and i shall be ready to
obey your commands no m jacquard 
said the prefect you cannot go home a carriage
is waiting to take you to paris not
go home not say adieu to my wife not makeup
my luggage for a journey leagues 
 i have orders said the prefect to dispatch
you instantly you may send to your wife 
you may tell her to give to my messenger
anything you desire to take i will provide
perseverance 
you with money but there must be no delay
there was no arguing about the matter so
i sent to my wife got a small bundle clothes 
jumped into the carriage and away away 
we were off full gallop towards paris when
we reached the first station i opened the
door and i found myself stopped by a gendarme
who said to me sir if you please
you are not to go out my sight i found
i was a prisoner and escorted by military
force to the capital things were so managed
at that time there was however no use in
complaining so i made the best my fate
and submitted in good humor
 i reached paris for the first time in my
life and strange was my introduction there
i was escorted to the conservatory and whom
should i see there but napoleon and carnot
carnot said to me suddenly are you the
man that can do what omnipotence cannot
 minor morals
do can you tie a knot in a string on the
stretch v i was overwhelmed with the presence
 the emperor and the abruptness 
his minister and knew not what to answer
but napoleon spoke very condescendingly tome
about my discovery told me he would
protect me and urged me to go on with my
mechanical pursuits
 materials were brought me and i was
directed to make a netproducing machine in
the conservatory which i did
 at that time a superb shawl was being
woven for the empress josephine and for its
production they were employing a very costly
and complicated loom a loom upon which
more than twenty thousand francs had been
expended it appeared to me that the same
effect might be produced by a less perplexing
machinery and i recollected having seen a
model by vaucauson in which i thought a
perseverance 
principle was developedwhich i could apply
to the desired purpose long thought and
perseverance enabled me to produce the mechanism
that bears my name when i had
succeeded the emperor conferred this decoration
upon me and granted me a pension
 crowns
 but on returning to lyons far different
was my destiny when i endeavored to introduce
my machine the workmen broke out
into open revolt i was everywhere denounced
as the enemy the people as the man who
had been scheming the destruction their
trade and the starvation themselves and
their families three plots were laid to assassinate
me and twice i had great difficulty in
escaping with my life so strong was the tide
 prejudice and indignation that my machine
was ordered to be openly destroyed by the
public authorities it was broken to pieces
 minor morals
in the great square the city the iron
was sold for old iron the wood for firewood
think what a shipwreck all my hopes 
 i did not quite lose courage the successful
competition foreigners and the consequent
decline trade in france led some
intelligent manufacturers a few years after
to think the man whose discovery might
perhaps bring some relief to that depression
under which they labored they found strength
 mind to make another experiment it
succeeded silks greater beauty were introduced
at a lower cost there was a dawn
 prosperity and it has continued to shine
 that machine which had been devoted to
ignominy and destruction i have now seen
thousands introduced and there is now scarcely
any man so blind or so ignorant as not to
acknowledge that its introduction has been a
great blessing it has given labor to tens 
perseverance 
tliousauds and i have lad a complete recompense
for all i have gone through
 we talked these and other matters till
the shades coming twilight bid us depart
the happy old man is still in my memory 
a striking instance virtuous perseverance
crowned with fit rewards
goodnature
if goodnature is not a virtue it is at all
events a very agreeable companions said arthur
to george as they were talking over the merits
and demerits one their school fellows
 goodnature is called a virtue in most
books i thinks answered george and yet
if nature gave a man the goodness i do not
quite see how it can be a virtue for which any
merit is due to him for a virtue papa has
often told us is acquired by habit and always
supposes that we make some sacrifice present
pleasure but we will talk about it to papa
and mamma when we get homes
and so they did and mr howard was much
gratified to find that his boys began now
goodnature 
habitually to discern the true characteristics 
virtue for he knew that the practice virtue
would be sure to follow the knowledge it
 goodnatures he said is indeed a most
attractive quality but its title to the name 
virtue depends to a great extent upon the constitutional
character the person who possesses
it it may be highly honorable to its owner
as where the influences illnature have been
subduedjby severe and longcontinued struggles
all the goodnature that is acquired is virtue 
and very meritorious virtue too but its exhibition
can only be in words or deeds prudence
and benevolence the result to human happiness
will be the same whether prudence or
goodnature is the cause right conduct yet
the merit the same conduct may be very
different for in one case there may be no
temptation to do wrong no disposition to misconduct
or illhumor the disposition may
 minor morals
have been made so gentle by native temperament
as not to feel any desire to give pain in
another case the impulse may be to act amiss
and the stronger the impulse the greater will
be the virtue conquering it i think your
mamma can tell you a story in illustration 
what i say
 i have known two little girls grace and
julia said mrs howard the one was the
gentlest creature that nature ever formed even
from her earliest infancy the other as passionate
and as untractable as a wolf's cub but
by virtuous effort she at last subdued her natural
temper and as she grew older became one 
the most amiable and delightful women
they were not sisters but companions and
i have often heard julia's rebellious disobedience
and the plague she was to her
family to her governess and her schoolfellows
how it happened that grace loved julia so well 
goodnature 
i can scarcely tell for it seemed to me that
julia was constantly acting the part a tyrant
and exacting from grace a thousand services
which she had no right to expect julia had
her fits generosity and affection and these
perhaps had won over grace who bore without
complaint and without reproach all julia's illtemper
perhaps grace knew more julia's
good qualities than other people knew for in
general julia was thought to be a very disagreeable
girl whom nobody cared about at
all events nobody cared about pleasing her
 on one occasion julia had been venting her
illhumor in the sittingroom upon one her
junior schoolfellows something had put julia
out temper which was very easily done and
so to gratify her spitefulness she tried to snatch
a out the hands the younger girl
who not surrendering it at once was violently
pushed away and fell on her forehead which
m
 minor morals
was much bruised by the fall the governess
heard julia scolding and fancying that as
usual she was playing the despot came into
the room instead apologising and expressing
regret julia spoke impertinently to
her mistress and ran into the schoolroom
where she slapped the door and locked it on
the inside in absolute defiance she not only
did this but she put the poker in the fire and
said to herself in the midst her passion
liuonh be punished the governess came
to the door and required julia to open it she
refused at first but being apprehensive the door
might be forced she at last opened it ran to the
fire drew out the red hot poker which she
brandished and told the governess to come
near her if she dared you may fancy what
an effect such daring insubordination as this
had upon the governess she left the schoolroom
and julia there to reflect a little upon
goodnature 
her violent and unladylike conduct and soon
did julianss conscience smite her and she was as
wretched as contrition and selfcondemnation
could make her she was severely punished
by exclusion from that schoolroom where her
misbehaviour had been so outrageous and in
truth the schoolgirls were not sorry she was
kept away they loved their governess and
were indignant at the manner in which julia
had behaved towards her they loved the
little girl whom julia had treated so unkindly
and when the time was expired during which
she was banished from the schoolroom they
felt no willingness to make any advances or
to say or do anything that should alleviate
julia's suffering
not so however grace at the first
moment which her governess allowed her she
flew to julianss room whom she found in tears
grace wiped the tears away from her cheeks
r
 minor morals
and they only streamed the more grace could
not utter a word but smiled and julia saw
that her friend had been weeping too she
felt as if her stubbornness and illhumor were
melting away from her mind and shaking
grace by the hand she said oh grace 
i will try indeed i wills grace kissed her
and led her to the schoolroom
it was a terrible struggle all the girls
there was not one that welcomed her she
saw some them frowning others turned
away from her several engaged in conversation
that they might appear not to notice
her julianss heart felt heavy twice or thrice
she was about to give way to her pride and
to say aloud that she did not care for one 
them but in the midst her perturbation
the little girl whose she had snatched
away came running to her and said kindly
i am glad to see you here again and
goodnature 
julia exclaimed have you pardoned me 
in a tone so novel and so imploring that
many the girls were moved to pity oh yes 
yes v said the little girl i have thought
about you twenty and twenty times and often
have grace and i talked about you i am
sure we shall be friends
from that moment the seeds selfcontrol
began to spring up in julia's mind everyday
some little conquest was made and how
grace rejoiced to find her friend gradually
become all that she wished her to be to
grace julia confided all her anxieties often
and often when she really meant to do right
when she was striving to obtain the mastery
over her illhumor she was misunderstood
she did not get credit even for her resolutions
and for her exertions she had been so long
an object dislike that scarcely anybody
was willing to give her any further trial she
 minor morals
had been judged so often and so often condemned
that her companions were unwilling
to think she could ever be worthy their
regard she had thus not only the difficulty
 subduing her own vicious tendencies but
what appeared to her a greater difficulty namely
to remove the prejudices against her which
existed in the minds others
 she was not without encouragement however
 for grace who always felt a remarkable
partiality for her a partiality which had been
proof even against all julianss defects a partiality
which had forgiven so much unkindness
grace i say had become attached to julia
with extraordinary affection it is true that
julia had not been all that grace fancied
she should have liked in the friend her
bosom but she now found her constantly
attempting to become a model goodness
and as grace was disposed to do her more
goodnature is
than justice towards grace all julia's virtues
were exhibited because they were so much
appreciated so kindly welcomed and grace
was julia's perpetual advocate a favorite herself
she gradually insinuated her favorite into
the favor others the friendship between
grace and julia seemed if that were possible
to strengthen every day julia felt no small
portion gratitude mingled with her love 
for on no occasion had grace forsaken her
in the perilous moment in that crisis when
it seemed doubtful whether right or wrong
would have been her choice it was grace
who determined that the balance should incline
to the side virtue and in the mind grace
gentle and good as she was there was
perhaps a small portion pride in that she
had been able to influence the selfwilled julia
and to make her so kind and amiable as she
was now become
 minor morals
 grace and julia are grown to womanhood 
and it would not be easy to say which 
them is the happier or which the better each
is at the head a family each the object
 the most affectionate attachment from all
around them their mutual friendship has
never subsided never slackened and it seems
as if it would descend to their children virtuous
effort has done for julia everything that
natural gentleness did for grace if you were
to speak to grace her own amiable temper
she would say that she had no merit at all 
for that she was born without violent passions
and deserved no credit for resisting what was
never a temptation but she would break out
in eloquent praises julia and tell you that
you might there study a specimen virtue 
that you might there see the might good
resolutions that you might there learn how a
perfect character was to be formed in spite 
goodnature 
all the tendencies and trials an infirm
nature ask julia how she managed to triumph
over her infirmity she will assure you the
merit was not hers she will attribute all to
grace's gentleness and kindness both grace
and julia my children are objects fit for
imitation grace vias virtuous julia

had been for which he had been punished
they had seen nothing that looked like crime
he was docile industrious but most wretched
he had been well educated they were sure
he was superior in every respect to those
around him their contamination had left
him untouched in fact the keepers had represented
his meritorious conduct in the hope
that his punishment might be commuted they
knew not why their representations had no
 minor morals
effect for generally attention was paid to
them when the commissaries the prison
reported to the minister justice instances
like this
 i made my way to the convict he was
sitting in tears on the stone bench where the
party who were to compose the chains were
seated in order before they were led out to
the middle the yard to have the iron
collars ri wetted round their necks on one
side was a criminal who was scoffing at what
he called his hareheartiness on the other
side another was exciting him to be a man
 his companions there was one only one
i observed who looked on him with commiseration
from the rest obloquy insult
mockery brutality was his portion tell
me something your history my friends i
said to him o sir i would bear anything
but this i was born at dijon j i belong to
mercy 
a respectable family there my parents my
brothers and sisters are living there and weare
to be marched through dijon o sir 
death were far better than this v but what
has been your offence i was a conscript 
i became intoxicated i incurred a debt 
thirty sous at a cabaret in my senseless passion
i refused to pay the landlord i even
insulted him a report was made to the minister
 war he ordered me to be delivered
over to the civil tribunal with the expression
 a desire that for the preservation the
discipline the army my punishment should
be most severe and so indeed it is my
friend and i could not resist the desire to
talk to the commissary the prison charged
with the dispatch the galleyslaves about
the unfortunate young convict the commissary
 told us that he himself had been
interested about him and had done all that
 minor morals
depended upon mm to obtain some commutation
 his sentence but it had been impossible
irregularities at the small winehouses
had increased late among the troops and
there was a stern determination the minister
to visit them with exemplary punishment
while we were discussing the matter the
ckaine were escorted to the rivetting place
one after another we saw the iron collars
fixed the anvil was removed from convict to
convict by the assistants and the executioner
with his sledge hammer rivetted the bolt it
would be too painful for me to describe it is
miserably painful to recollect how the frame
 the convict was shaken what suffering was
pourtrayed in the countenance while the
iron cravat as they called it in their levity
was fixed round their necks we saw them
reach the young convict whether a gleam
 hope had shone upon his mind that the
mercy 
interest we had expressed for him might
lead to a reprieve whether the earnestness 
our appeals to the prison authorities which he
had witnessed afar oflp was supposed by him
to be exercised in his behalf i know not but
i had seen his imploring looks and now the
anvil was fixed behind him the iron collar
was passed over his head and measured round
his throat he trembled like a broken twig
one heavy blow another and another and
his doom was sealed he had hidden his face
in his hands by and by i saw two streams 
tears flowing down upon his breast
we did not relax in our efforts on his
behalf and strongly urged how extreme was
the measure punishment dealt out for an
offence ordinarily visited by a very different
penalty we expressed our belief that mercy
would be extended to the convict were the
facts made known that the first application 
 minor morals
the severe regulations the minister had
fallen to the lot one whom every circumstance
recommended to lenient consideration
our representations were seconded by several
other visitors who had been attracted by the
irresistible impulse which prompts men to interfere
in cases obvious harshness at last
the commissary appeared to give way will
you gentlemen take upon you any the
responsibility sall the responsibility with
which you can invest us will an application
to yourself signed by every one present
to defer only to defer the execution this
young mans sentence be sufficient will an
engagement that the minister or the king
himself shall be spoken to tomorrow to
interest their clemency at least to have this
case reconsidered well then so be it i
will venture this muche a document was
drawn up hastily and hastily signed the
mercy 
chains was led out again the anvil placed
erects the iron collar was broken the young
man was led to a solitary bench i dared not
describe his agony when he was linked ashe
thought for ever to degradation and despair
shall i dare attempt to describe his
present feelings not i
the representations made were successful 
the case was thoroughly investigated circumstances
to mitigate the original offence came
out on a more rigid inquiry the personal
character the young man was discovered
except in this instance to have been blameless
a slight punishment superseded that 
the galleys and merci assuredly never did a
more honorable or a more virtuous works

i was dining once said mr howard in
allusion to the discussion on west indian
slavery which then occupied every bodies
thoughts at the table a distinguished american
when i happened to mention the pleasure
i had received from my intercourse with one
or two black men haiti and the interest
with which i had read an ablyconducted controversy
as to the best form government
which had been carried on in that island during
the war between king henry and president
potion curiosity was expressed to know
whether i had ever sat at table with negroes
and when i averred that i had often done soone
portion the company looked incredulity
and the other expressed surprise
nobility skin 
and why not i answered is an intelligent
black man less worthy regard than
an intelligent white 
i could not hear it said one the ladies
present black people may do for servants
but it is a degradation to make them com
panions
so then i replied you have no objection
to use their services you will tolerate their
presence while they labour for you even to
weariness you will permit them to stand but
not to sit down before you 
but you must allow there is something
naturally disgusting about the african blacks
said the boldest the company in fact
they are a different race from ours and have
a disagreeable smell
the persecuted always smell disagreeably
to the persecutor i said there are a
hundred catholic authors who aver that jews
 minor morals
and heretics stink by nature and only a few
months ago a political writer endeavored to
excite the inhumanity the people england
against the poor bavarian girls who sell brooms
in the street by abusing them as a stinking
race now to me the stench persecution
is all stenches the most offensively
 but you cannot deny that the african is
really a different animal from the european 
he has a skull another shape the muscles
 his legs are differently arranged
and suppose it were so does the high
cheek bone a celt make him a fit object
 illusage from the roundchecked scandinavian
or has the tall biscay his huge
legs given him to kick his neighbors the
shortlegged inhabitants the landes ask
any them whether their head ever aches
or their limbs get ever weary and then talk
with disregard their pleasures and their
nobility skin 
pains if it be not benevolence to feel for
what has feeling i know not what benevolence
is
it was in vain to reason it was in vain
to give examples virtues among the africans 
to give examples intelligence to quote books
they had written or pictures they had painted 
to mention instances the display all the
qualities which we respect and honor among
the whites prejudice is deaf and will not
hear pride is blind and will not see but
you my children will listen to a story or
two such as i have gathered in my own
experience
 a few years ago a black african woman
brought me a letter from the bishop blois
it was he who published a work on the literature
 the africans and who had collected
a considerable library books written by black
and woollyhaired men he recommended
 minor morals
the negress to me as a woman thoroughly
instructed and whose tale could not but gratify
me she came to me with a little boy 
whom she was the mother and i will tell
you her history in her own words 
 i was born in a village not a great way
from the banks the congo river my father
was a chief in the village he had an enemy
who was a chief in another village i was
my father's only child i was seven years old
it was the spring time and i went into the
peasegarden and was gathering some the
white flowers my father's enemy kidnapped
me he beat me cruelly he stopped my
mouth to prevent my crying from being heard
he carried me first to his own village and
then to another village and then to another
we travelled many days i was very weary
but still we travelled i was hungry and
thirsty but we always always travelled at
nobility skin 
last we came to a larger village than i had
ever seen and there he sold nee he went
away but i saw another man give him some
pieces silver i had heard white people
that bought black people and carried them
over the great water and used them very
cruelly and i thought that i was going to
be sold to the whites and carried over the
great water and used very cruelly too and
so it was but i was not alone there were
more than twenty besides me there was not
one that spoke the language my village
but there was one poor girl a little older
than i who spoke something like me and i
understood her she told me shocking things
i cried and she cried too then the man
who had bought us flogged us both he gave
us plenty millet for food and the girl told
me it was that we might get fat and look
healthy and sell for more money to the wicked
 minor morals
white men after some days we all were
tied to one another we walked and walked 
 how tired we were at last from the
top a hill we saw a river a wide river
on it was a great great boat with many cords
and strings and finecolored flags that the
wind was blowing about i first thought it
was a comfort to see the river for now said
 our journey must and i felt as if i
could walk no farther but then i thought
again that the large boat must belong to the
cruel white men and was there to carry us
over the great water and i trembled and
i said to my heart never shall i see my
father never shall i see the village where i
was born we were led to the shore and
soon there came several the cruel white
men to look at us they pushed us from
one side to another turned us round they
would not give the money that the black
nobility skin 
man asked they made a great noise they
laughed aloud it was a shocking laugh while
we were so wretched i did not understand anything
they said the black man laughed too
and the white men laughed louder and the
chief the white men shook a bag silver
and there was another laugh and the blackman
held up his ten fingers and the white
man shook his head and he poured out the
sever from his bag upon the sand and he
called more white men who were his servants 
and they rolled four barrels out the great
boat and upon the four barrels they placed
two muskets but our black master again
shook his head and held up two fingers his
left hand and pointed to the barrels and then
held up one finger and pointed to the muskets
then the white man nodded and we were
all delivered to the white man and many 
 minor morals
the white mans servants came and made us
go into the vessel
 what a shocking place the vessel was 
yet while it remained in the river we could
bear it we had food and plenty water
and it was three weeks before we were ready
to sail almost every day some other slaves
came on board sometimes one sometimes two
at a time sometimes thirty or forty but
when orders were given for our sailing our
worst sufferings began we were two hundred
slaves on board there were sixty men
forty women and one hundred boys and girls
the men were ironed two together the
women and girls had a part the vessel to
themselves we could not sit upright there
was not length for us to lie down you cannot
think how hot how filthy how stinking was
the place many fell sick many died when
nobility skin 
we had been twenty days at sea the black men
many whom had been dreadfully flogged
by the captain rose and killed the mate and
two the crew but the captain shot the
leader with his own hand and ran another
slave through the body with a sword the
rest were frightened and gave way five 
them were hanged we were all called out
to see the execution some us could not
look on one girl when she saw her father
with a rope around his neck jumped overboard
and was drowned we saw the dead
bodies thrown like dead dogs into the sea
i did not like to die but i wished i was
dead we were several weeks at sea we
had suffered agony from thirst the latter
days we had only a quart water between
six us one day there was a hurricane
and violent rain some it came into our
hatches i saw the women lap it up from
 minor morals
the plank sj that not a drop might be lost
i did the same i was almost blind with
pain
 one hundred and thirty us reached the
 the voyage water was brought onboard
there was a large tub full we
rushed to drink and our heads were absolutely
wedged in by our eagerness some broke
the jugs that were brought to them in their
fury and fear that they might be wrested from
their hands
 the following day we landed it was at
guadaloupe i was bought for two hundred
dollars to be a domestic slave i was called
handsome this saved me from the slavery
 the field but i had much to endure from
a cruel master and a drunken mistress they
often quarrelled about me if my master
praised my mistress was sure to punish me
if my mistress ever said a friendly word to
nobility skin 
me which she did sometimes my master kicked
me for attending more to my mistress than
to him i livedwith them five or six years
every year more unhappily but i learned to
speak french i was much better off than
those who worked at the plantations
 there was a spanish lady at the point a
pitre where i was who one day saw me at
market she asked me my name and who
was my master i told her she called the
next day and said she had taken a fancy tome
she offered my master five hundred
dollars for me he could not resist the offer
i went to live with the lady i was the happiest
slave in the colony the lady made me
her companion she taught me her language 
she taught me to read and write she gave
me some books and lent me many more never
heard from her an unkind word she talked
to me my native village she made me
 minor morals
repeat all i remembered she at last knew
my story as well as i knew it myself she
asked me if i should like to return to africa
she said that i might be useful to my countrymen
she spoke humane people in
france and england who had been endeavoring
to make the blacks happier at home she
had a large map africa and she tried to
find out exactly where i was born and through
what villages i had passed when i was stolen
and in what part the river i was taken
on board some the names she mentioned
seemed names i had heard in my childhood
mine was but a very confused memory 
them four years i lived with the spanish
lady but she was taken ill and died she
emancipated me by her will and left me five
hundred dollars i think her every day
i pray to her every night
 very soon after her death i married my
nobility skin 
husband was a freed man color who carried
on a small trade at basseterre we lived
for some time in tolerable comfort he died
two years ago and left me with the little boy
you see here he is now seven years old
i have money to carry me to africa i am
going to return i shall find my way to my
own village i have learnt many things which
i shall teach my own countrymen i have
been showing my boy how he may be useful
to themes
poor woman i i heard that she had embarked
for sierra leone with the design 
penetrating to the district her birth may
her steps be guided thither in safety and may
her dreams be realised in her history are
lessons patience and patriotism generosity
and goodness prudence and philanthropy
and she was a negro woman she
was black as the wing a raven

 i will now tell you a story a red man
you have heard the arabian indians
they are the subject an epic poem in
spanish written by ercilla the spaniards
were engaged with them in a long and bloody
war during which they exhibited extraordinary
instances heroism the speech one 
their leaders colocolo who settled a dispute
among their chieftains for the supreme command
by conferring it on him who could lift
the heaviest block wood has been often
spoken with admiration it is too long to
repeat now but i hope you will read it one
day or other in the original because you
will find a great many indian virtues described
in it
a french vessel was wrecked on the
south western coast america most the
crew perished among those who escaped was
a sailor the name colline he reached
nobility skin 
the town santiago in a state utter destitution
having obtained some relief from
the authorities and finding no prospects 
employment before him he determined to
explore the interior the country and he
journeyed until he reached the foot the
andes he here fell in with some scattered
tribes indians who received him kindly
and he fixed himself among them their
mode life suited his adventurous spirit
any wants that he experienced became bearable
because they were borne by others and nothing
so disposes the mind to patience and to
courage as the companionship and sympathy
 our fellowmen to colin the kindness
 his red brethren was particularly welcome
for he had led a hard life at sea a lifert'hich
had been chequered with much suffering 
and he was well content to exchange the
hardlyearned fare and severe discipline a
vessel for the wild and wandering life a

colhne in the course a few months became
one the principal personages the indian
tribes he was their counsellor in their disputes
with others and the arbiter in the questions
which arose among themselves after
dwelling some time with the tribe among
whom his lot had first fallen desire farther
travels again took possession colline's mind
and accompanied by one the tribe they
penetrated far into the interior the country
and mounted high up the ridges the andes
they made their way to the habitation
 a distinguished cacique or indian chief
collins fame had gone before him and he
met with the most hearty reception and
doubly hearty was it because the cacique was
ill and fancied the white stranger might bring
nobility skin 
him relief colline like most seamen knew
something the usual treatment for maladies
such simple prescriptions as perspiration in
cases fever gargles for sore throat and so
forth the little he knew reckoned for much
where less was known he had learned that
the rapidity the pulse the color the
tongue were among the symptoms by which
disease might be ascertained he bad some
ordinary remedies for a burn a cut and the
common accidents life he prescribed for
the cacique and had the good fortune to
perceive a sensible improvement
 the cacique was a man highly venerated
by the indians he was a descendant the
peruvian incas and had been initiated by his
forefathers into many their religious mysteries
he was also the depository much
 their traditional history and was looked
upon as a man destined by himself or his
 minor morals
descendants to recover for the red men the
land their ancestors from those who had
violently possessed themselves it such a
man exercised great influence over the widely
but thinly scattered remains the old peruvian
people he had visited most the spots
which they deemed sacred he had preserved
and diffused among them the names their
ancient kings and priests and heroes he
knew where their battles had been fought
and where their altars and temples had been
raised 
 a sense gratitude for benefits received
awakened in the cacique's mind the strongest
affection for colline and as soon as colin
had sufficiently learnt the language there was
the completest communication their thoughts
and feelings to one another one day the
cacique told colline a most important secret
that he was the possessor the quipos 
nobility skin 
the famous historical records the peruvian
nation records said to contain the annals 
the ancient incas for three thousand years
consisting innumerable and curiouslycolored
knots which had been added by the initiated
from time to time and for the reading which
none but the incas possessed the key in his
confidence for couine he exhibited to him
this precious treasure they were in a large
box on which were engraved divers allegorical
stories connected with the quipos representing
most prominently the ancient temple the
sun where the old peruvians had carried on
their mysterious and costly devotions the
box had been splendidly gilded in former times 
but its lustre was faded and colline who had
learned the art gilding in europe undertook
to restore it to its original beauty he
did this nothing could have been so acceptable
to the cacique who watched the progress
 minor morals
 the work from day to day and looked upon
it with absolute ecstacy when it was completed
he then embraced colline and said in the
most enthusiastic language friends for ever 
i will be your father now you shall marry
my daughter
the cacique had two children whom
colline had seldom seen though he had frequently
heard among the tribe the praises 
the daughter's beauty the son was almost
habitually wandering and when he came
home he always looked upon colline with so
much jealousy and suspicion that his presence
was considered perilous even the cacique
saw him without pleasure for his illhumor
vented itself so frequently and so passionately
that his father was afraid hospitality itself
would be violated by him
the american indians are as implacable in
their hatred as they are fervent in their friendnobility
 skin 
slip and no sooner had the cacique's son
heard his father's intention towards comines
than he endeavoured to persuade his sister
kanka to join with him in a plot for the
strangers destruction kanka appeared to
lend a willing ear but it was to save and not
to sacrifice colline she had conceived an
affection for her proposed husband he had
been more in her company ever since the
cacique had spoken his purpose and she
was full admiration for his many to her
splendid talents and acquirements she listened
to his adventures with extreme delight when
he told her the world that was far off over
the seas its mighty cities its fleets and
armies its courts and gardens its superb
edifices the bridges upon its rivers it roads
and the carriages rolling over them its cultivated
lands its birds and cattle the rich
dresses its inhabitants she looked around
 minor morals
her thinking the contrast between all this
and the bare andean mountain where she was
born then sometimes the thought came
across her like a child's fancy that colline
might take her to see all those wondrous
sights and bring her back again to her native
home to tell the indians that she herself had
seen them and that there was no fiction no
falsehood in the story
 the marriage took place and with all the
solemnities which are usual among the indians
kanka was much loved and as the descendant
 the cacique himself descended from the
most illustrious the inca race nothing was
wanting to give interest to the celebration
but the brother was absent and he was
known to be maturing his purposes illwill
he had not indeed concealed his evil disposition
and when he left his father's house
it was in the season spring just before the
nobility skin 
marriage lie publicly said tlie flowers are
on the trees before the fruits ripen the enemy
shall be placed from the stem whither he
went nobody knew he took with him two
young indians as his companions but did not
say farewell to his father or his sister a few
days before he left he said to kanka fares
the pure mountain stream that mingles with
a foreign puddle to her he had been generally
kind and never had he uttered so severe
a reproach kanka answered more proudly
rolls the stream when it joins a current brighter
and stronger than its own on which he looked
at her with a look scorn and silently quitted
her presence
colline did kanka justice she was so tractable
so teachable so gifted with goodnature
yet withal so dignified and intelligent that
he was well content to renounce the thoughts
 his european home except when sometimes
 minor morals
kanka said lie would accompany him thither 
that they would descend the mountains together
and find some ship to convey them to
the other world and to bring them back again
to the cacique's abode kanka engaged colline
to adopt the indian costume in order that
she might adorn it with her own diligent
hands and so he did and the headdress 
plumes he wore was the most beautiful that
had ever been seen among the indian people
she winged his arrows with splendid feathers
and plaited the gay sandals which decorated
his feet
the autumnal season came and the
menace the brother was perpetually ringing
in kanka's ear for the fruits were beginning
to ripen and she was sure that couine's life
was exposed to peril the cacique had indeed
charged kanka to watch her husband
with particular attention to accompany him
nobility skin 
in his hunting expeditions and to take every
precaution against surprise but precautions
were in vain against the determined and exasperated
hostility the young indian kanka
eras told one day when at a short distance from
home accompanied by colline that her brother
had been seen in the neighborhood and she
said to her husband let us return i will
seek my brother i will tell him how happy
i am i am sure i shall teach him to love
you for he loves me and we shall all dwell
together in peace hardly had she said this
ere an arrow passed by and fixed itself
quivering in her husbands right arm he
fell and kanka shrieked for help she withdrew
the arrow with difficulty she saw that
it was poisoned colline turned deathly pale 
and kanka hanging over him sucked the
blood from the wound in this position she
was found by the old cacique who then as he
 minor morals
frequently did had followed their footsteps
unseen with some difficulty they lifted colline
from the ground and conveyed him home
it was long doubtful whether he would recover 
but the prompt assistance kanka at the
moment attack and her most assiduous cares
and thoughtful attentions brought about his
convalescence but added to the anxieties all
in less than a month another attempt was
made upon collins life the old cacique
irritated by his son's misconduct had declared
he would disinherit him and this as may well
be supposed added fuel to the flames the
young man's vengeful passions
 one midnight the cacique's habitation
was in a blaze it had been set fire to by his
son who did not purpose to destroy his father
and his sister who he fancied might easily
escape while couine confined to his bed by
his wounds would probably be the only vienobility
or skin 
tim his calculations failed they all escaped
and saved their most valuable treasures their
quipos and their antiquities all that happened
was to be exposed to the storm without
a habitation until they could make their
way to a neighboring indians choza and
set about rebuilding their own but as they
had now been involved in a common danger
they felt more closely united to one another
couine recovered but his existence was
made miserable by the constant plots the
young cacique plots in which he had now
engaged other indians by representing to
them that colline was one the race that
had invaded robbed and ruined the indian
country that had massacred their kings and
priests and taken possession the land 
their fathers the old cacique had been remonstrated
with for harboring the intruder
and had been told that unless colline removed
 minor morals
he would inevitably be subjected to a cruel
and violent death the cacique only asked
a few days to arrange matters and promised
that couine should quietly depart but he
engaged them by a solemn vow that they
would not commit any act outrage and
that they would prevent any from being committed
for the three next suns and with all
the courage and calmness he could muster
he sought colline and kanka and spoke to
them thus 
 the old man's heart is sad my children 
and sad must be the words his tongue
but the bitter thing must be uttered and the
bitter sorrow must be borne if i loved kanka
well no less have i loved colline he came
to me a stranger i made him a son love
could do no more now we must part and
oh that we could part as we met it is vain
to talk about what must be what must be in
nobility skin 
spite all our talk if couine stay lie is
doomed to die and kanka would not buy lies
staying here at the price his life's kandahar
fallen on her husbands breast uttering
that she would go too or that they would die
together but the cacique continued 
 jo that cannot be kanka must dwell
in the abode her fathers if she go with
colline it will be the destruction both or
 all us the indians will not hear 
her departure we will go together to the
boundaries the land and that before sunset 
for the hours are numbered on which i can
answer for couine's safety i know not how
to dismiss him once i had treasures but i
have none value save the records my
nation i cannot trust them to the keeping 
my son i will give them to colline he
shall deposit them in a place safety among
the white people and in some future time
q
 minor morals
theywill be found again come my children
 let us go forth
 thus suddenly was the link broken which
bound colline to the indian family his
spirit was sorrowful but he saw there was
no choice no escape they rose together
they travelled through the night each in turn
bearing the cacique treasure they reached
the boundary by the following evening it
was twilight colline preceded his companions
only a few steps he turned round they had
disappeared no doubt the parting word
was as the old man had said too bitter for
utterance
 gloomily and alone colline pursued his
journey the quitobox had been carefully
slung for the convenience carrying it he
found a basket food all the remains 
what they had brought from the cacique's
home after many days travel colline reached
nobility skin 
the habitation some spanish south americans
 he there changed his indian dress and
made his way to the capital the argentine
republic there he took up his abode and
there i believe he still remains
 the peruvian records are now in england's

one morning there was considerable perplexity
arthur's latin exercise was
missing with his exercise in it nobody knew
where it was he did not know himself whether
he had left it at school or brought it
home sure it was that he could not hind
its and sure too that he had the vexation
 being forced to write his exercise over again
his brother having lent him his exercise 
to enable him to do so
and thus arthur's said mr howard
after half an hour had been wasted in the
fruitless search and thus you have caused
yourself a great annoyance which might have
been prevented by a very little cares
order 
in mr howard's family all such events were
wont to lead to useful conversation on the
various topics started so it happened now
and order was the order the day
 i have seen many cases where a wise
arrangement matters said mr howard
has given to a man inferior industry
inferior zeal and inferior talent great advantage
over him who possessed all these qualities
in a far superior degree in ordinary affairs
a habit order is a source more comfort
than you would suppose could possibly depend
upon or be influenced by it it doubles the
usefulness all the stores we possess by placing
them where they are immediately at hand
the possession which cannot be called into the
field when wanted is no more value than
an estate in the moon
a smaller portion knowledge well
ordered and arranged in the mind is more
 minor morals
valuable than a larger portion which is in a
state confusion no matter how costly the
treasures you collect unless they are accessible
they are little use they may be even
an incumbrance i remember during the peninsular
war seeing some soldiers so overladen
with pillage as to impede their march so that
they either lost their lives or fell into the
hands the enemy knowledge my old
philosopher friend used to say should like
any other material be portable without fatigue
if the workman is overburdened no matter
whether it be with rubbish or the most useful
and necessary things these become rubbish
when they become unmanageable
 marmaduke method was a boy who made
his way through the world and established a
great reputation and died possessed great
wealth and he owed all his success to his
habits regularity and order he was not

remarkable for talent not even remarkable
for anything but this one circumstance but
the practice which he had adopted in early
life putting everything straight as he
called it left much time on his hands enabled
him to enjoy many pleasures more than his
companions spared him many vexations and
brought at last distinction and opulence to
himself and his children
 marmaduke was the child very poor
parents they could afford him only a small
portion instruction so they paid for him
twopence a week at the parish school when
very young he was observed by his mother
standing on tiptoe and endeavoring to drive
a large nail into the wall with a stone he
could hardly lift she found this was to hang
his hat upon for he had been much distressed
the day before by seeing his father sit down
on his hat which he had incautiously left on
 minor morals
the chair prom that day however the hat
was always either on marmadukes head or
on the nail or in the appointed place at school
soon after he found the means getting two
other nails on which he suspended his best
pair shoes and always took care that they
hung straight for it is not more useful to
put hera in their right places than to put
them there tidily and carefully by and by
he got a little shelf on which the two or three
small books he had were kept nice and clean
they were not soiled with dirt nor rumpled
with dogsears but spoke for themselves in
favor the attentive little boy his clothes
were coarse but always neatly buttoned his
common shoes were old but always clean and
carefully tied he could not bear to see anything
wrong which a little trouble would put
right so that when he was seven years old his
schoolfellows gave him the nickname mr
order 
orders a name which he well deserved he
laughed at the boy who first called him so
and never felt an instants annoyance when
all the other boys took the hint and called
him mr orderly too
 before he was nine years old his mother
died and his father removed him from school
and obtained a place where he got sixpence
a day for cleaning knives and forks and shoes
and running such errands as were required
 he became a favorite with the servants
since he did everything so cheerfully and well
everybody knew where to find what armature
had put away and all his doings appeared
to the greatest advantage from the order in
which he left them his knives and forks
were always arranged side by side as bright
and regular as attention could place them
if he cleaned the plate it seemed to shine
with double lustre as one piece reflected back
 minor morals
the polish the next if he was sent on
messages he so arranged it as to go the least
distance and to employ the least possible time
by taking them all in order which was also
 putting everything straight he had in
truth a love for right lines all sorts and
received so much pleasure from the best arrangement
 things that order and virtue
and happiness were very much alike to him
he had not read the poets nor heard the
verse which says that order is heaven's first
laws he did not know by what wonderful
regulations suns and stars are kept in their
places seasons return night and day succeed
one another and generation follows generation
but he had a sense a tact which taught him
that order was beauty and that order was
wisdom and the want order was therefore
discordant to his mind so he naturally sought
to put things straight and when he had
order 
done so he felt as if he had done a good
deed and one that brought with it instant
recompense
the lady the house where marmaduke
was had occasion to go into the kitchen one
day and saw how very nicely he had done his
work she spoke it to her husband who
had also marked with what neatness and
order marmaduke arranged the shoes he had
blacked and the clothes he had brushed
 the gentleman recommended marmaduke
to a neighboring chemist and that love 
order which was quite a habit and almost a
passion with the boy soon showed itself in
the chemist's shop marmaduke was very
careful not to disturb anything that was in
place but his anxiety to have everything
straight soon enabled him to arrange matters
that had been before neglected and great was
the comfort which his master found in the
 minor morals
humble services the lad the pins which
were before scattered on the floor were now
invariably collected on a pincushion the pens
which had been thrown about in different
places were now always found in the inkstand
the empty vials were now constantly
placed in order according to their sorts and
sizes and the rags and bits paper which
were before swept every evening out the
shop were now collected by marmaduke
and by the chemist's consent sold to the rag
collector at the the week for a few
pence which served as pocket money for
marmaduke and with which he began his
little fortune every penny so collected he
entered in an account and thus the
value money was habitually present to his
mind and as he also entered every farthing
he expended the entry being in view whenever
he opened his served as a check
order 
upon any improper oatltiy he thus learned
too by his own little affairs to keep accounts
correctly and he was at last allowed to make
entries in the books the chemist his
habits neatness were such that though he
wrote indifferently his love for having everything
straight made his writing plain and
clear time improved his hand and he was
soon trusted to keep the journal and the
ledger the trade
i need not tell you that a boy so orderly
was very attentive to his person his coats
and trowsers lasted longer than those most
boys his age because he was accustomed
to be so careful them one thing he did
which was real use to the chemist he
copied into a every prescription that
came in vith its date and cost and made
a complete index all the articles it cones
minor morals
gained and the initials or signatures 
the physician that signed it he thus got
a great deal medical knowledge and was
able at any time to refer to the medicine he
had prepared for a particular person one
day when he heard a young lady who
 had beck poisoned in consequence a chemists
 boy having sold her oxalic acid instead epsom
salts he had great pleasure on reflecting that
since he came to the chemist s no one mistake
had been made if you had asked him
how he managed to be so fortunate he would
tell you it was by keeping things all straight
and so indeed it was
 marmaduke grew to manhood and he had
the satisfaction thinking that ever since the
age nine he had provided for himself he
not only had been no expense to his father
but he had saved thirty pounds to which he
order 
was now able to add ten pounds a year more
so that lie now felt himself in a situation 
what seemed to him independence
but though the chemist had never told
marmaduke how sensible he was all the use
he had been to him and though marmaduke
never took to himself any credit because he
believed he had been only doing his duty to
a kind and considerate master marmaduke
could not but perceive that the tone in which
he was spoken to was more and more friendly 
and the thought did sometimes pass through
his mind that he might become the master in
that very shop where he had entered so poor
and young a servant and if it were ever so i
would put things straighter he said to himself
and spend some money in improving the shop's
appearance and making it more attractive to
customers
 one evening when the chemist was unwell
 minor morals
and marmaduke had been counselling him to
use a prescription which had been very much
praised by the customers the shop for
curing the complaint under which he was
suffering he said to marmaduke give me
your hand boy i i have long intended to tell
you how well pleased i have been with your
conduct ever since you came to me i have
always admired your love order your
thoughtfulness and prudence you have been
obedient to me and well behaved to my customers
now i want a little rest and i mean
to give you a part my business and if you
conduct it well in a few years perhaps i
shall leave it wholly to you you have improved
it already and will i dare say improve
it more by my business i have been made
comfortable through life and it has given me
more means comfort than i shall ever want
but it will be a great comfort in addition if
order 
i live to see the business thrive under your
care at all events i shall make the experiment

marmaduke methods name was soon added
to the firm and inscribed in gold letters over
the door the shop i don't tell you aith
how much pride marmaduke looked up to seethe
painter changing the inscription but his
pride had in it nothing that did him injury
or injured anybody else it was realizing to
himself a dream in which he had once thought
it presumptuous almost criminal to indulge
but now that his orderly character and wish
to set all things straight had full play the
changes he introduced were such as excited
everybody's attention though nobody called
them rash or improper it was not long before
the chemist's portion profits the business
were really larger than when he had the management
 it so that without any detriment
r
 minor morals
to himself he had done marmaduke a most
important service and this my children is
often the case with virtuous actions they
benefit the person served and that without any
sacrifice to the virtuous person
 at this time the infirmities age grew upon
armaduke's father he had been long dependent
upon his son for much his support
and he was now taken into the house and
made some use by keeping things straight
for these words did not go out marmaduke's
mind in his prosperity i owe every thing to
this he would repeat to the lads whom
there were now several who received their
orders from him i don't give you many
lessons but i say keep things straights 
the rest mr marmaduke method's
history may be soon told he married had
several children taught them the lesson that
he had found so useful saw several them
order 
happily settled and at last died full riches
and honors j and his will contained these remarkable
words by attention to order i rose
from poverty to opulence by it i prevented
loss j by it i amassed gain after my death
let me be put into my coffin in an orderly
way let me be carried by six orderly poor
people and followed by my friends and family
in due order to a clean orderly brickwalled
grave and there let me be laid down and
placed straight waiting the orders my
maker from above 
justice
 do you remember the question put forward
hj mr hume and which he says he was
not able to solve a miner possesses an
ingot silver it comes into the possession
 a silversmith without any blame on his
part he doubles its value by making it into
a cup to which the two ought it to
belong v
ohp said arthur they should sell the
cup and divide the proceeds between them
but that is not the question now it is
what does justice require as between the two
parties supposing one them only was to
have the cup 
 said edith would give the cup to
justice 
the miner for he produced the metal and
without his labor the cup could never have
been made at all he was the first cause 
its being made
 and i said george would give it to
the silversmith because the metal was worth
nothing until it was turned to some use and
it was the silversmith s art and knowledge
that made it useful
 i rather agree with edith said arthur 
for the miner is the more important person
to be protected the finding the material is
more useful to society than the forming it
into shape the silversmith could do nothing
without the miner but the miner supplies
many trades besides the silversmith
let us look a little closer into the matter
children said mr howard justice as
far as it is useful is an instrument happiness
all its value consists in this it is to
 minor morals
prevent unhappiness that we seek to prevent
injustice
 now which the two would suffer least
pain by being deprived the cup i think
it would be the miner and which would
experience most pleasure in having the cup
awarded to him in my judgment it would
be the silversmith and if it be so the question
is solved
justice requires rewards when rewards are
necessary to increase happiness or to prevent
misery justice requires punishment when
punishment would add to human happiness or
lessen human suffering where there is no
mischief there should be no punishment
when punishment will not prevent mischief
or its consequences there is no use in inflicting
it the less punishment the better
because the less pain the better the rule
is always the same i repeat it to you my
justice 
children in a hundred ways judge everything
by the happiness or misery which it
produces or removes your business in the
world is to change things that are evil into
things that are good and in things that are
evil to lessen the evil as much as possible
a rat got into a pantry and was quietly
devouring a cheshire cheese he was discovered
by the butler who condemned the rat
to die how can you treat me so unjustly v
said the rat this house is as much mine as
your masters i was born in it and so were
my forefathers you are the intruders and
took possession against all right and justice
it is not just to let me starve and it is very
unjust indeed to punish me with death for
indulging in a natural propensity which is
yours and your master's as well as mine
now what could the butler say in reply to
the rat
 minor morals
 oh said george the butler should have
said that the cheese was his master's property
and that the rat was a robber and deserved
transportation at least if not hanging
the rat would have liked transportation
very well said arthur but when rats
offend however small the offence they are
sure capital conviction
well now papa responded edith i
don't think that is just there should be
some difference in the punishment different
sins even in the case a poor rat
i believe answered mr howard that
if you get no other guide than what is called
justice in the matter the rat would have a
good chance escape and could he give a
fee and a brief to a clever barrister a pretty
strong case injustice could be made out
against the butler but the rat is here an
intruder upon human enjoyment and there
justice 
would be a loss no small sum pleasure
if he were not dealt with by summary judgment
all that benevolence can plead for
him is that he shall be put out existence
with the least possible pain
 a poor man owed a rich man a sum 
money it was justly the rich man's due 
but the poor man was unable to pay the debt
at the moment when the rich man claimed it
the rich man arrested the poor man and
justice and the laws decided that the poor man
should be sent to prison there to pay by
personal suffering for his incapacity to discharge
the debt the rich man exacted nothing
but what was strictly is but his conduct
was the opposite virtuous
 there is a curious phrase sometimes made
use by lawyers the greatest right the
greatest wrong which when it means anything
means that law and justice may be the
 minor morals
causes imman misery and that when they
are so they ought to be set aside
 one day i saw a man strike another mana
violent blow in the face it would perhaps
have been just to return the blow but was
it not more prudent more benevolent and
hence more virtuous to refrain 
 assuredly so in the case in question the
man who struck the blow was in a state 
extreme irritation he had lost the power 
judgment by exasperation the man who
received the blow had the wisdom to avoid
asking whether justice required him to retaliate
in the same offensive and violent way he
asked what duty what virtue demanded and
found that they demanded forbearance he
forbore the man who had injured him not
only relented but was overcome with sorrow
he felt that the injustice was on his side
he felt that the man whom he had struck
justice 
might justly and even with the work's approval
have used towards him similar or
greater violence his hesitating to do so won
the friendly affections the wrongdoer in
every respect the injured man was a gainer
gainer in selfrespect on the ground selfcontrol
 gainer in selfapproval by that recompense
which prudence brings with it gainer
in the good opinion others by the exercise
 benevolence towards the offender whether
he acted jusfhj or not is a consideration 
little importance he acted wisely he acted
virtuously
a child for a small fault is punished
severely and the severity punishment leads
to the child's reformation the injustice 
the punishment is no reason for its not beinginflicted
 because the punishment may be in
the highest degree jjnidentj as respects the
parent and beneficent as regards the child
 minor morals
justice wherever it is an instrument 
human happiness is an excellent thing but
it is not because it is justice but because it
is an instrument happiness
the young people expressed a desire to
know how they were to distinguish what is
just from what is virtuous and mr howard
thus answered their inquiries 
the world calls its laws and its usages
justice for the most part they are so and
in countries where instruction is spreading
they become more so every day whenever
the object laws is thoroughly understood
laws will be only a means to an and that
 will be happiness whenever any conduct
is on the whole useful to mankind the
question its justice or injustice is a very
needless one for to say that if it is just
it cannot but be useful is to make justice
and usefulness the same thing as they ought
justice 
indeed to be never therefore set up nor
allow any one to set up as a rule conduct
for yourself any standard justice which is
not wholly in conformity with that conduct
which will lead to the greatest quantity 
happiness for happiness everybody can
judge but justice there may be a hundred
dissentient opinions
ancient times
how comes it papa that there is generally
such a respect for ancient times 
inquired george one day after reading a
speech in which respect for the wisdom 
ancestors was made a reason for not altering
some foolish usage
 it is a sad prejudice said mr howard 
i once heard a man say he had no wish
to appear wiser than his forefathers and people
applauded him j though had they reflected
that nobody can have too much wisdom and
that it is the best part wisdom to add to
wisdom they might have thought differently
a philosopher remarked that the same people
who are most loud in praise past time are
ancient times 
those who are always insisting on the superiority
 old men over young ones now
ancient days are the youth society and
the farther you go back the younger is the
human race if there is reason for deeming
old men superior in knowledge to young men
there is the same reason why the present
times should be superior to the past there
is indeed more reason for old men grow
decrepit but not so the race man individuals
decay and their faculties are enfeebled
as their experience increases but nations
communicate their experience from one generation
in full mental vigor to another equally
so in morals there is a great improvement
both in knowledge and practice the effect
 conduct upon human happiness is more
closely watched and more accurately traced
many actions once held to be blameless are
now prohibited by opinion many which were
 minor morals
deemed pernicious are now considered laudable

never be astonished my children never
be discouraged if you should fail to find in
ancient books what the illadvised praises 
some may have taught you to expect you
will hear those whose opinions are weight
in the world talk with awe and reverence
respecting authors antiquity and when
you turn them over in order to discover
their merits you may experience bitter disappointment
do not despond j do not think
because you are unable to discover the extraordinary
excellences that your own faculties
are necessarily in fault it may be that the
excellence you seek for is not there do
not check your own habit thinking because
you cannot unravel the thoughts others
many a worthless idol has had its worshippers
take courage even though you canancient
times 
not understand the renowned authority perhaps
he did not understand himself recollect
what epictetus said to the expositors 
chrysippusj you plume yourselves upon
your meritorious labors if lysippus had
been able to tell us his own meaning would
he have needed you 
 journeying once in andalusia i reached
one the refreshing streams which are so
welcome to the traveller not only because they
serve to quench his thirst but enable him
to wash in their invigorating waters my
muleteer drank and washed his hands but
no water did he convey to his cheeks or neck
i asked him the reason he said i don't
like it i deserted from the army because
they would make me wash my face every day
my forefathers never washed their faces 
the next day mr howard and george
walked together to a neighboring village they
 minor morals
called at the house one the peasants the
door which was opened by a string which
passed through a hole and communicated with
a wooden latch inside george inquired why
the neat and ordinary iron latch was not used
oh sir v said the woman ours is rather a
bad way for the boys sometimes cut off the
string and when we are all out there is a great
fuss and trouble to open the door and to get
in but it was so in our grandfathers time
and we don't like to change it the chimney
was smoking and the room was full black
dust we have a shocking smoky chimney
sir and it covers the plates and the chairs
and the tables with dirt but why don't
you have it altered inquired george oh
sir my husband and i often talk about it
but he says it was so when his father lived
here and his father's father before him and
he don't think himself wiser than his fathers

ancient tim 
during the conversation the cottager came in
he had across his arm a very oddlooking
and oddlyshaped sickle which excited george
howard s curiosity thomas said he for
that was the cottager's name you have an
ancient tool there that i have sir i
have seen all sorts changes and fancies
but i stick by the old friend but surely
thomas you cannot do so much work you
cannot reap so much corn or get so much
money for yourself or your family with such
a sickle as this aj sir that's what our
younker say but i don't set up to be wiser
than those that have gone before me
 there said mr howard as they left
the cottage you have another example 
the wisdom ancestors and yet in this poor
man's case there may be some excuse for
habit has made all these inconveniences almost
 mrnor moral
enjoyments he is more pleased with his fancy
about resembling his forefathers than he would
be with the benefits which improvements would
bring to him to others he does but little
mischief all you can say is that he is a silly
and imprudent man but when any one prevents
improvements which may benefit others
the mischief is as great as the value the
improvement the desire something better
whether in art or morals or laws or happiness
is the source from which all that is
good comes forth
conversations like these marked the happy
days which the family the towards enjoyed
days made happy by the pursuit knowledge
and the practice virtue a thousand
other topics they talked and at some other
time my young readers shall hear how many
other questions right and wrong were settled
